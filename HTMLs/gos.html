<p>Zi Yao spat out mouthful blood, and her charming face paled suddenly. This attack also wounded her. So, she couldn&rsquo;t launch another attack for the time being.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan suddenly opened his eyes, with a freezing cold gleam sparkling in them.</p>
<p>Chapter 738: Sun Brilliance!</p>
<p>The Bloody Slaughterer, Ka Tuo, couldn&rsquo;t hide his excitement. He laughed crazily as pieces of rock and debris of outer space spinning rapidly around him. They moved like a tornado, sweeping away all the God Light.</p>
<p>As those space pirates saw their boss attacking, their bloodthirsty nature was aroused. They expanded their God Domains again. They wanted to seize the chance when Zi Yao hadn&rsquo;t recovered yet to destroy her protection magnetic field.</p>
<p>Nobody cared about Shi Yan.</p>
<p>No one even gave him a glance.</p>
<p>They all just ignored his existence.</p>
<p>King God Realm warriors just needed a glance to see his real realm. A feeble warrior at the Second Sky of True God Realm was nothing in their eyes. He wouldn&rsquo;t be important at all in this situation.</p>
<p>Zi Yao paled, as blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. Seeing the pirates striking wildly, she felt hopeless and desperate.</p>
<p>She had to urge her soul altar to make the previous strike. Although her attack was formidable, the backfire she received was almost of the same magnitude. At this moment, energy in her body was disturbingly turbulent. She needed to steady her power to launch the second strike.</p>
<p>Apparently, the opponent had seized this opportunity. They wouldn&rsquo;t give her any moment. They wanted to subdue her, taking her as a captive.</p>
<p>Thinking about this tragic fate, Zi Yao hated that she couldn&rsquo;t kill herself to save her from falling into their hands and experiencing the most horrible torture in the world.</p>
<p>Zi Yao clenched her teeth as she had made up her mind. Once things went wrong, she would make them die altogether. With the big price of her soul altar collapse, she would give them a bloody lesson that they would never forget.</p>
<p>But at this very moment, Zi Yao suddenly felt a sharp energy fluctuation, making her glance at Shi Yan in bewilderment.</p>
<p>The young man, who had been sitting neatly on the war chariot like a rock hadn&rsquo;t spoken anything from the beginning, just opened his eyes. His calm countenance made her feel weird.</p>
<p>Zi Yao felt sorry, thinning her lips as she sighed. She didn&rsquo;t know how this man could maintain his calmness until this moment. Wasn&rsquo;t he scared? Did he not see the whole picture here? Or, was he petrified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>Dazzling cracks appeared one by one outside her God Domain&rsquo;s coverage, each crack being dozens of meters long. They looked like extremely sharp blades moving and accelerating under some kind of urge.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s gloomy beautiful eyes sparkled with the light of hope. As she was moved, she temporarily put aside her negative intention.</p>
<p>She wanted to see if he could cause a miracle to happen.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had many secrets. She understood this better than anyone else.</p>
<p>A warrior from a low-level continent who knew how to use the Death Intent Domain and also had the space power, no one could tell how many other wicked tricks he must have hidden.</p>
<p>She realized that she had never seen through Shi Yan. Zi Yao wanted to see how mysterious and magical Shi Yan was before she died.</p>
<p>The space blades were dangerously shiny. They appeared in dozens and became faster and agiler shortly. They were like the sharpest weapons that could cut and slash everything, expanding outside her God Domain.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood up next to her, as a cruel, bloody scent diffused from his body. Instantly, his eyes became blood-red, which could send shivers down people&rsquo;s spines.</p>
<p>The space pirates hadn&rsquo;t approached Zi Yao&rsquo;s God Domain, yet they found something strange, screaming in panic.</p>
<p>The space blades curved and then thrust into their God Domains. Shortly, the different God Domains were split apart! The warriors hit by the space blades had their bodies cut off without bleeding, dying on the spot.</p>
<p>Even the King God Realm warriors got their limbs cut off if they couldn&rsquo;t dodge those brutal space blades on time. Their armor and secret treasures were all ineffective.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes brightened. She was excited as light bloomed gloriously on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun Brilliance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan touched his glabella, and the Star power Upanishad turned into a flood current, gushing out of his soul altar.</p>
<p>Wherever his power Upanishad passed through, sunbeams shot faster, and the flaming meteorolites seemed to be revived!</p>
<p>The massive meteorolites were manipulated by an unknown force!</p>
<p>It took only one second to move the giant objects that had been still for tens of thousands of years!</p>
<p>In that second, dozens of giant burning meteorolites rolled towards Ka Tuo under the control of a magical, unknown force!</p>
<p>Colossal burning meteorolites that were as big as an island or a basketball court, full of flaming energy of the sun, brought with them an unimaginable heat as they stormed into Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Domain.</p>
<p>Rumble Rumble Rumble!</p>
<p>Earth-shaking explosions echoed inside Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Domain. Ka Tuo was struggling; his vulgar laughter ceased, as he was clumsily urging his energy to avoid the impact from the burning flame meteorolite.</p>
<p>Bunches of sunlight suddenly became incomparably sharp, becoming wild and hysterical from the originally quiet state. They meandered and slithered like spiritual snakes, darting towards the space pirates.</p>
<p>Shortly, all pirates who came to attack them were troubled by the burning meteorolites and sunbeams. They moved and dodged here and there, shouting crazily and indignantly.</p>
<p>The fiery fluid from the burning meteorolites poured on the pirates, melting their blood and flesh.</p>
<p>The sunbeams were everywhere, and as soon as the pirates got hit, they would screech painfully while their bodies were pierced through. It was like a ghost nibbling their bodies while they were still alive.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s energy drained rapidly, which was clearly visible from his eyes. His Essence Qi ancient tree shriveled quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as he sensed this danger, he immediately sat down and used his Star power Upanishad to connect with the flaming meteorolites in this area.</p>
<p>As his Star Upanishad had been fused with the sunlight once, he could use this feeble connection to control the meteorolites, making them move in this Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>In that short moment, Shi Yan had a magical feeling, as though he had turned into the core of the sun, and the flaming meteorolites in this place had become part of his body.</p>
<p>He just needed to flicker his Soul Consciousness together with his energy to manipulate the flaming meteorolites.</p>
<p>This discovery cheered him up. While Zi Yao was having a bloody fight with the enemies, he had created the connection with dozens of meteorolites around them. At the moment Zi Yao couldn&rsquo;t endure any longer, he controlled the burning meteorolites, launching a strike that demanded a big price from the others.</p>
<p>However, it also required an enormous consumption.</p>
<p>In a matter of several seconds, the Essence Qi ancient tree in his body shriveled, as it had no beam of energy left. Also, the large amount of flaming energy from the sun his Star Martial Spirit had absorbed was all burned.</p>
<p>Now, Shi Yan had only his Soul Consciousness to endure. He begrudgingly controlled the meteorolites to attack here and dare, messing up the God Domains of the pirates.</p>
<p>The flaming meteorolites were like steel punches pounding the God Domains, while the sunbeams were as agile as spiritual snakes, worming and attacking the space pirates. They seemed to be afraid of nothing.</p>
<p>The space blades, which had been created first, took the chance and destroyed the pirates&rsquo; God Domain.</p>
<p>Space power and Star power were urged at the same time, creating a scene of catastrophe. On the other side, Shi Yan&rsquo;s energy was used up, and his spirit was exhausted completely.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaahhhh!</p>
<p>Painful screams and cries constantly echoed, as almost one hundred space pirates were besieged by the scorching meteorolites. They were struck hard, while the other lower-realm pirates were all killed.</p>
<p>Only the King God Realm warriors, who had achieved the God Body, could resist. Although they weren&rsquo;t melted by the sunbeams and the meteorolites, they still had to run madly for their lives.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was as savage as an enraged beast. His eyes gazed at Shi Yan, noticing this low warrior for the first time. While he was panting and dealing with the flaming meteorolites, he hissed and roared to threaten Shi Yan. &ldquo;Kid! I will detain your soul! I will make you taste all kinds of torture until you die! I swear, I will make you rather die than to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was quiet, his face dangerously ashen. Only his blood-red eyes sparkled with a gleam of cold and evil intention.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care about Ka Tuo, still using his Soul Consciousness to control the meteorolites which he had activated, creating a meteorolite sea to subdue all the pirates.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes flashed with a strange light, as thrill filled her charming face. Her succulent lips parted, but she didn&rsquo;t say anything. She immediately focused on stabilizing her energy to prepare for the next attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cough cough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan coughed out blood, and his eyes became gloomy shortly. His body shivered, and the flow of his energy was interrupted.</p>
<p>The Essence Qi ancient tree was drained, and so was the flaming energy his Star Martial Spirit had absorbed. There was nothing left. His Soul Consciousness was also consumed greatly. Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar was trembling from the damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hold on anymore.&rdquo; He smiled bitterly, begrudgingly looking at the bundle of glamor standing next to him. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have any solution, we will have to die here for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, Shi Yan had some other kinds of energies besides those draining ones. He could use the energy from his blood and flesh, and, of course, the negative energy.</p>
<p>However, those energies couldn&rsquo;t supplement his Space Upanishad and Star Upanishad. So, he couldn&rsquo;t continue using the sunbeams and flaming meteorolites to slaughter the others.</p>
<p>It was not because of his profound realm that he could create this situation. Shi Yan had just borrowed the external forces.</p>
<p>This magnificent Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field had so many pieces of the fragmented pieces of the sun scattered here and there. Since Shi Yan&rsquo;s power Upanishad had the Sun Essence, he could control the solar fragments in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field and create the current situation.</p>
<p>If they had been in another region, he would have had no means.</p>
<p>If he couldn&rsquo;t use the meteorolites to attack anymore, his other energies weren&rsquo;t of much help. Thus, it wasn&rsquo;t that he was trying to save some energy or being modest; he truly had no other options.</p>
<p>Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t say anything, squinting as the chaotic energy in her body gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>When there was no energy controlling them, the massive flaming meteorolites stopped moving, and the violent sunbeams started to calm down.</p>
<p>After Ka Tuo&rsquo;s team had adjusted their powers after this savage attack, they stormed over again, much wilder and harsher.</p>
<p>Zi Yao waved her hand, and the ring on her jade-like finger flashed. Crystals that looked like volcanoes shot out from her ring, moving outward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done enough,&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled tenderly after releasing the crystals. A fragrant breeze brushed his cheek as her moist, succulent red lips smacked his left cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can leave this place alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 739: Volcano crystal nucleus</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt as if he had received an electric shock. He looked at her with a dumbstruck visage, rubbing his cheek instinctively as he wore an odd expression.</p>
<p>He had never estimated that Princess Zi Yao would act like that in their tragic situation. She&hellip;kissed him?</p>
<p>Was it a reward?</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t explain her deed. With a dull and amazed face, he didn&rsquo;t know how to react.</p>
<p>Anyway, this feeling&hellip; was so good!</p>
<p>Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t have the time to talk to him. Her beautiful eyes were bright, looking at the farther area while her Soul Consciousness was controlling the volcano-shaped crystals to attack Ka Tuo&rsquo;s team furiously.</p>
<p>Waves of magical energy rippled from those volcano crystals.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo felt something suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter!&rdquo; He shouted all of a sudden. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Volcano Crystal Nucleus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were furiously swarming over their target, the space pirates paled on hearing their leader as if they had seen ghosts, hastening to retreat.</p>
<p>Boom Boom Boom!</p>
<p>The volcano crystal that was as big as a fist burst off fiercely. The energy it generated was not different from an erupting volcano, brutal to the acme!</p>
<p>Those people who couldn&rsquo;t dodge the explosion would be turned into ashes. Their soul altar was shattered, leaving nothing intact.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had collected the Volcano Crystal Nucleus at a magical volcano range in the Raging Flame Star Area. After so many years of condensing and accumulating, each erupting volcano would have a crystal nucleus.</p>
<p>The crystal, which had preserved the fiercest power of the volcano, was urged at the critical time. It was like triggering the volcano to burst off at a set time, creating an intimidating attack power.</p>
<p>A Volcano Crystal Nucleus was as mighty as a real volcano when it exploded. Even a King God Realm warrior couldn&rsquo;t endure such a blast.</p>
<p>Shortly, more than ten King God Realm pirates were crushed into pulp. Their flesh and bones were smashed, scattering everywhere in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>This attack scared the space pirates. Even Ka Tuo, the wildest man, was frightened, not daring to move forward again.</p>
<p>Shi Yan also discolored in fright. Looking at the exploding Volcano Crystal Nucleus, a cold current arose in his soul.</p>
<p>Too frightening!</p>
<p>The Volcano Crystal Nucleus&rsquo; explosion had created a tremendous shockwave, which was much more terrible than the impact of the solar fragments.</p>
<p>In the second when the explosion happened, many flaming meteorolites were shattered, while smaller pieces of meteorolites shot out lethally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, his face strange.</p>
<p>The Earth Flame had stormed out of his soul altar without any prior notification. Just like an excited flame, it flew towards the center of the fierce explosion created by the Volcano Crystal Nucleus.</p>
<p>He was bewildered, then turned more excited.</p>
<p>The Earth Flame was the most brilliant flame created in a ten thousand years old volcano. After a long period of taking in the power of the volcano, it gradually gained intellect. This kind of a creature was rare and peculiar.</p>
<p>Before it had formed intellect, it seemed like it used to be&hellip; a Volcano Crystal Nucleus. To the flame, the surging flaming energy in this area was the best nutrient, much better than any other medicines and pellets.</p>
<p>The Volcano Crystal Nucleus exploded one by one. Waves of flaming energy rolled furiously, creating a vast burning sea that blocked Ka Tuo&rsquo;s team. It troubled them from moving forward.</p>
<p>Zi Yao sneered, talking with full confidence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Her jade-like hand knocked on the amethyst war chariot, which then shot out like lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t help but cry.</p>
<p>As Zi Yao was busy with the enemies, she didn&rsquo;t notice the Earth Flame flying out of Shi Yan&rsquo;s body. She didn&rsquo;t know that the Earth Flame was taking in the exploding energy of her Volcano Crystal Nucleus. That was why she wanted to leave hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Although she was full of suspicion, she paused, frowning at Shi Yan. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t leave now, it will be more troublesome later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t explain. He begrudgingly condensed a flow of Soul Consciousness to contact the Earth Flame.</p>
<p>But that b*stard didn&rsquo;t answer!</p>
<p>It seemed the flame was wholeheartedly taking in the energy of the Volcano Crystal Nucleus, so it wasn&rsquo;t free to answer Shi Yan. The massive energy generated from the volcano crystals was what it had been yearning for the most. He would never let this chance slide away at any cost.</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly had a headache, cursing the flame for being so greedy that it didn&rsquo;t even care about its life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Zi Yao was worried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to seize the chance to escape, you know? If we don&rsquo;t take this opportunity, we can&rsquo;t break the siege and escape later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, we just need to wait for a while.&rdquo; Shi Yan gritted his teeth. His Soul Consciousness moved like a light arrow, entering the exploding area where the Volcano Crystal Nucleus was still bursting off. &ldquo;Spoiled kid, you come back now or take all these things with you. Or else, I won&rsquo;t care about you anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Shi Yan shot his flow of Soul Consciousness, Zi Yao could finally feel something. She shouted with astonishment. &ldquo;Who are you communicating with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan kept silent, while one hand of his was pressed on his forehead. With an ashen face, he tried to extend his Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>The seething flaming sea in front of them changed suddenly. It started to move, and then accelerated towards them.</p>
<p>The Earth Flame finally responded, and Shi Yan exhaled in relief.</p>
<p>Right at this moment, a magical jade token suddenly appeared from an interlacing place of sunbeams not far from them. This token had been carved with a miraculous formation, which was releasing surging energy waves. Shortly, it could almost reach Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s soft body shivered as a gleam of deep fear sparkled in her eyes. She hastened to urge all the energy she had left. God Light bloomed out from her entire body, condensing into a seven-colored light column and striking towards that jade token.</p>
<p>BOOM!</p>
<p>The jade token trembled. The shockwave emitted from it had smashed the massive flaming meteorolites into pieces.</p>
<p>The jade token was stopped, and it couldn&rsquo;t storm over the second time.</p>
<p>Blood gushed out from Zi Yao&rsquo;s mouth as she closed her eyes exhaustedly. Her breathing was feeble while her soft body lost control.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was scared. At this moment, he didn&rsquo;t care about anything else, shouting hoarsely. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A purple light appeared from Zi Yao&rsquo;s fingertip, then fell onto the war chariot. Then, the amethyst war chariot buzzed and glided swiftly over the sunbeams, moving forward quickly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan tried to use his last beam of energy to pulled around ten bodies floating nearest to them to the chariot on the way out.</p>
<p>Essence Qi emitted from those corpses rolled massively into his body, like a furious flood breaking the dike. The acupuncture points from his entire body swelled instantly, causing him a paralyzing pain.</p>
<p>Since the Earth Flame had absorbed the power of the volcano fire sea behind them, it started to shrink. Eventually, the entire sea shrank into some floating flames, which could pierce through the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field easily without being afraid of the sunbeams. That was why they could fly rapidly and catch up with Shi Yan, who was using the amethyst battleship.</p>
<p>Those flames then lined up and combined with each other, turning into a windmill-sized flame that disappeared into Shi Yan&rsquo;s glabella.</p>
<p>After the Earth Flame got into the heaven flame soul altar, it calmed down and sent Shi Yan an exciting thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good! I can ascend this time. Haha, wait until I wake up. I can evolve to another level!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised.</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot continued to accelerate crazily. Besides Zhi Yao, who was fainted next to Shi Yan, there were nine corpses of the space pirates. Those people were killed by Zi Yao&rsquo;s God Light not too long ago. Shi Yan could tell it from the holes on their bodies.</p>
<p>They included eight people at the Second and Third Sky of True God Realm, and one at the King God Realm!</p>
<p>The massive Essence Qi from that King God Realm warrior was equal to the amount Shi Yan could get from the other eight warriors. It was so abundant that it surprised Shi Yan a lot.</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot was running wildly, agilely, and swiftly, worming through the sunbeams like lightning.</p>
<p>Behind him, the space pirates were shouting and cursing. Their eyes were bloodshot as they still wanted to storm over and kill them all. However, their tiger shark chariots weren&rsquo;t as fast as the amethyst chariot. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn&rsquo;t catch up with it.</p>
<p>Shi Yan concentrated on the jade token that appeared the last.</p>
<p>That jade token had appeared at the most critical time. With only one strike, it had hurt Zi Yao badly, directly putting her into a coma. Shi Yan knew that jade token was the fatal attack. Perhaps, the one who controlled that jade token had a stronger cultivation base than Ka Tuo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The one who controlled that jade token must have been hiding in the place where the sunbeams were interlacing for a long time for that fatal strike.</p>
<p>That person was the most dangerous factor of this hunting operation&hellip; Perhaps, he knew Zi Yao personally. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have hidden from the beginning. He clearly didn&rsquo;t dare to show his face.</p>
<p>He had been waiting persistently, depending on the magical and dangerous feature of the sunbeam interlacing area to avoid people&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness from sensing. This person was much more dangerous than those space pirates!</p>
<p>When Shi Yan turned around to check it, the jade token had disappeared into thin air, leaving no trace. It was possible that the owner had retrieved it.</p>
<p>That person was still hiding on his spot. If he didn&rsquo;t show up, he seemed to be afraid of something.</p>
<p>The war chariot flew forward at max speed.</p>
<p>Shi Yan gradually pulled himself together. While absorbing the enormous Essence Qi, Shi Yan checked Zi Yao&rsquo;s wounds with a solemn countenance.</p>
<p>She was still breathing, and her soul altar still existed. However, Shi Yan found an unknown force, which was constantly destroying her vitality, fighting against the energies inside her body.</p>
<p>After Shi Yan had sensed it for a while, he paled, his eyes full of cold intent.</p>
<p>That unknown energy flow seemed to be taking the upper hand. During its battle with the energies inside Zi Yao&rsquo;s body, it could drain her energy continually. When Zi Yao&rsquo;s energy was emptied out, that flow of energy would cut off all of her vitality. At least, it would be able to destroy her God Body.</p>
<p>But that was not what scared him the most.</p>
<p>Shi Yan could sense a soul destroying power within that unknown energy as well. In other words, after it destroyed Zi Yao&rsquo;s God Body, it would storm into her Sea of Consciousness and smash down her soul sacrificial altar!</p>
<p>The one who had cast this technique truly wanted to take Zi Yao&rsquo;s life, leaving her no hope or way to revive!</p>
<p>Chapter 740: Can&rsquo;t choose the right way because of the flurry</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s space pirates strode angrily, but the amethyst war chariot had soon disappeared from their sight. Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo stopped and gritted his teeth, his face gloomy and cruel as he stood on the tiger shark war chariot.</p>
<p>Many tiger shark chariots came over. The young human guy said with a bitter face. &ldquo;Boss, what should we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Ka Tuo grinned, madness sparkling clearly in his eyes. &ldquo;Do you need me to teach you what to do next? Scatter and block them! We&rsquo;re familiar with this area. If we can block them once, we can do it the second time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was shaken, nodding his head continually. &ldquo;I got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the f*ck out there! Move! Now!&rdquo; Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo cursed, but he didn&rsquo;t move to chase the others. Quite the contrary, he flew back to the place where the battle was the fiercest.</p>
<p>Those space pirates didn&rsquo;t dare to discuss more. They continued their operation once they confirmed what to do next.</p>
<p>Soon, Ka Tuo went to the area where the jade token appeared. He pulled himself together, hesitated for a while, then bowed slightly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I will fulfill what I&rsquo;ve agreed with you. Although they can run away now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they can leave the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field alive! I assure you that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soul thought was sent to him from where the sunbeams were interweaving. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fail me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo bent his body, continually assuring the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know the reputation of the name Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo. I know that you won&rsquo;t skirt what you have agreed upon midway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That voice was icy cold and evil. &ldquo;You will receive your payment fully. Go chase them. When you can locate them, tell me before you try to attack them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Ka Tuo replied solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you understand. I don&rsquo;t require many things&hellip; I&rsquo;m waiting for your good news. Now go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Ka Tuo didn&rsquo;t linger. He turned around and left, disappearing from this area.</p>
<p>A light flashed in that area where the fatal sunbeams were interweaving. That light flickered once and then disappeared into the void.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Shi Yan sat neatly on the amethyst war chariot. His face was cold, but there was a gleam of hurry in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s breathing was becoming weaker. The unknown force in her body had dominated her own energies, and was about to dissolve all of her energies.</p>
<p>When the energy in her body disappeared completely, her God Body would be damaged totally. At that time, that unknown energy would storm into her Sea of Consciousness and destroy her soul altar, which would result in the death of her both God Body and God Soul.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the result he wanted to see.</p>
<p>He wanted to help Zi Yao destroy that flow of energy. However, his situation wasn&rsquo;t different from hers.</p>
<p>The Essence Qi of his entire body had been emptied out. And, since his negative energy had the evil effect of destroying vitality, he didn&rsquo;t dare to use it. So, Shi Yan had no solution for her.</p>
<p>As soon as he had taken in the massive Essence Qi, it surged madly in the acupuncture points of his entire body, making him hot and agitated. Under this state, he was in danger as well.</p>
<p>They needed to get to a safe area first!</p>
<p>Only when he could covert the Essence Qi and restore his power could he help Zi Yao and heal her wounds. During the conversion process, he would be exhausted, powerless, and pretty uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At this moment, if some warriors came to kill them, Shi Yan wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything.</p>
<p>He thought and thought. Different ideas flashed in his head, as he was trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>If Ka Tuo could block them once, he could always do it again. The first thing to do was to escape Ka Tuo&rsquo;s gang, even if for just a while. He needed time to recover his power.</p>
<p>The first place that popped up in his mind was the center area of the sunbeam field.</p>
<p>Pondering for a while, Shi Yan prepared to move.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had told him how to control the amethyst war chariot. As long as the chariot accepted him, he could drive the chariot with only a flow of Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness left in the chariot was drained fast. Gradually, the war chariot didn&rsquo;t move under the set direction. Shi Yan understood that Zi Yao was in a critical moment, and couldn&rsquo;t control the chariot any longer.</p>
<p>Hesitating for a while, he pressed a corner of the chariot, releasing his Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>A flow of pure Soul Consciousness was poured into the chariot. In the next moment, he became the owner of the chariot. From this moment, he could drive it easily.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness showed the way, and the chariot flew in the direction he wanted. It was magical and so convenient.</p>
<p>The war chariot immediately changed its direction, heading towards a bunch of sunbeams. Shortly, he appeared in a sea of light.</p>
<p>The dense flaming energy here had magical energy waves that pulsed continually. The scorching, piercing power covered the war chariot entirely, including Zi Yao and Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Inside the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, Shi Yan had a glimpse of the Sun&rsquo;s mysteries. Immersing in this sea of sunbeams, he had used the Solar Essence in his soul altar to make a resonating movement with the solar energy around him.</p>
<p>Under that magical energy ripple, he felt warm instead of feeling annoyed, as his Star Martial Spirit quickly absorbed the flaming energy of the sun, which refreshed him a lot.</p>
<p>The power Upanishad he had learned was marvelous. The Star and Sun energy would fuse into one kind of energy in his body. As long as he could understand all the mysteries of the sun and stars, he could freely use these two powers, storing them in his body and then turning them into his formidable attacks.</p>
<p>In a short while, he felt much better. His Star Martial Spirit became calm, slowly taking in the flaming energy of the sun.</p>
<p>However, Zi Yao wasn&rsquo;t so comfortable.</p>
<p>Many bubbles appeared on her appealing, perfect body. Her body had activated the seven-colored God Light automatically to resist the scorching energy from the sun.</p>
<p>Thus, the unknown force wreaking havoc in her body became more furious.</p>
<p>The corpses he had dragged into the chariot were melted into puddles of blood.</p>
<p>Even the amethyst war chariot was melted bit by bit. It seemed like it couldn&rsquo;t withstand the Sun Essence at the place where the sunbeams were gathering for a long time.</p>
<p>After being astounded for a while, he decided to leave. He urged the amethyst for the second time. From this place, he had used his Soul Consciousness to find the perilous areas.</p>
<p>As he couldn&rsquo;t stay for a long time in the area of the sunbeams, it was a headache for him. This meant that he had no moment of safety to restore his energy. Also, it meant that the space pirates would come for them at any minute.</p>
<p>He had to move nonstop, finding a new area, an area that was safe for him and Zi Yao, where they didn&rsquo;t need to worry about the space pirates.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness was patrolling in the area which had the most sunbeams gathering. He was interested in the dangerous areas. The more dangerous it was, the relatively safer it would be for them for the time being. So, Shi Yan was driving the amethyst chariot while seeking the particularly perilous areas.</p>
<p>The information of a mysteriously wicked energy field was sent to his Sea of Consciousness. Energy waves rippled and surged vehemently in that area, creating many energy storms. They ushered chaos everywhere, as if they could devour everything that was alive.</p>
<p>It was the place every warrior who came to this Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field wanted to dodge proactively. No one would dare to intrude.</p>
<p>But he was different. In such dangerous circumstances, Shi Yan wanted to go to the place people were afraid of the most!</p>
<p>Shortly, Shi Yan made up his mind. He drove the war chariot, discreetly heading towards the scorching center.</p>
<p>The war chariot slowed down in that area, as it had to move carefully to avoid the energy fluctuations that could even destroy his God Soul. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to relax his nerves, controlling the amethyst war chariot while inching forward.</p>
<p>Crack Crack!</p>
<p>A clear cracking echoed from his chariot. The chariot was more than ten meters long. Once it came into contact with those furious energy storms, it was cracked, as if it were hacked by sharp weapons.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was frightened, and became more cautious.</p>
<p>He had heard from Zi Yao that the amethyst used to build this war chariot was an especially rigid material that even a King God Realm warrior couldn&rsquo;t break with only his muscle strength.</p>
<p>When the energy storm in this area touched the amethyst chariot, the chariot cracked to a significant extent. It was enough to prove how intense those energy waves were.</p>
<p>He was struggling hard to move forward in this hazardous area. From time to time, Shi Yan threw a few corpses of the space pirates to the most dangerous area that his Soul Consciousness could sense to check the power there.</p>
<p>As soon as those bodies fell into that area, they turned into a puddle of blood and then dispersed completely.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wore a bitter smile while feeling a serious headache. Looking at Zi Yao, who couldn&rsquo;t endure any longer, and the extreme danger in front of his eyes, he had a feeling that they were at a dead end.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack!</p>
<p>When he still had a worried frown, an energy storm which was still all this while, suddenly moved and collided with the amethyst chariot. Loud shattering noises resounded, as countless pieces of amethyst shot out from the war chariot.</p>
<p>Shortly, the amethyst war chariot, which was inching like a turtle, was destroyed just like that.</p>
<p>A turbulent energy tornado was still moving towards Shi Yan and Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Shi Yan discolored in fright. He hadn&rsquo;t had the time to think, pulling Zi Yao into his embrace. The flaming energy he had just absorbed expanded like giant fire sphere, covering him as they were flying into the unpredictable outer space.</p>
<p>Although he had the soft body of a beautiful woman next to his chest, he had no gleam of joy on his face. Quite the contrary, he felt his heart get heavy.</p>
<p>The war chariot called the Purple Lightning had been destroyed completely. In the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, their journey would be even more strenuous now. If they met Ka Tuo&rsquo;s gang the second time, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape using the quick speed like they just did. They would become the others&rsquo; prey for sure.</p>
<p>While his mind was like a mess, a surging energy came from the safe area they were taking shelter in temporarily.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was frightened, as he didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. He could feel an invisible force cover them and drag them towards the center of a massive vortex.</p>
<p>He wanted to struggle, but he then helplessly found that his power was nothing under the Heavenly Might. Holding Zi Yao, Shi Yan sank, falling into the core of the vortex while feeling dizzy without realizing why.</p>
<p>Chapter 741: New comprehension!</p>
<p>Shi Yan woke up and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was the endless dark cloud covering the entire sky above his head. Looking at the further area, he found that he was in an icy cold, desolate land. The soil here was brownish-black, without a single energy fluctuation of living beings in the area. Ahead of him was a tall mountain range with so many corpses buried there.</p>
<p>Those corpses belonged to beasts and different races. They were all so decayed that they could disperse with the slightest wind.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood up and observed, finding corpses everywhere. This place looked like a sea of corpses, of which Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t see the other end. This place gave him a bleak sensation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is this place?&rsquo; As his mind flickered, Shi Yan frowned while rubbing his head as he had a headache. He could only remember that he was besieged in an extraordinarily furious energy area in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field before he got here.</p>
<p>In that area, their amethyst war chariot was destroyed. He could only bring Zi Yao and leave. Then, a force dragged him into a tremendous energy vortex, and he fainted afterward.</p>
<p>Shi Yan remembered Zi Yao, so he immediately searched for her.</p>
<p>Shortly, he found Zi Yao lying in the shade of a beast skull, which had a body that was almost one thousand meters long, not too far from him. Her breathing was as feeble as a filament that couldn&rsquo;t be traced easily. His visage changed slightly, flying out quickly. Instantly, Shi Yan found that the gravity in this place was extremely formidable. It was like he was bearing a massive mountain on his shoulder. His running speed became sluggish.</p>
<p>Essence Qi was still being converted madly in his acupuncture points, making them annoyingly swollen. Shi Yan understood that the time he had fainted for was short. It shouldn&rsquo;t be more than one hour. Otherwise, his acupuncture points should have finished converting the Essence Qi.</p>
<p>At a speed dozens of times slower than normal, he walked towards Zi Yao. Putting his hand on her, Shi Yan found that the unknown force was still breaking her body from the inside. Zi Yao had lost all of her resistance.</p>
<p>With an extremely grimaced face, he sat down, pulling Zi Yao into his embrace. His both hands were placed on her chest and abdomen.</p>
<p>Although the Essence Qi in his body was still being converted, he was hurriedly waiting for the first flow of mysterious energy, as if a fire was burning him.</p>
<p>Time suddenly became lethargic while Shi Yan was getting so agitated and restless that he had to try his best to calm down his soul to prevent himself from falling into bedevilment.</p>
<p>At this moment, once he lost his consciousness, it would be tough to restore himself shortly. And, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help Zi Yao heal her wounds. He temporarily put Zi Yao&rsquo;s wounds aside to quieten down his body, sitting motionlessly like a stone.</p>
<p>A long time afterward, while he felt the pain spreading all over his body, his acupuncture points started to generate energy.</p>
<p>The mysterious energy flooded out from his acupuncture points, circulating in his entire body and then pouring into his Essence Qi ancient tree. The shriveled Essence Qi ancient tree received abundant energy and became translucent little by little as its energy was refilled.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was shaken. He then focused wholeheartedly on his lower abdomen to refine the Essence Qi and pour it into Zi Yao&rsquo;s body. He wanted to destroy the unknown flow of energy in her body.</p>
<p>However, the flow of energy from that jade token seemed to strangely have its own consciousness. As soon as Shi Yan sent his energy into her body, that flow started to run and hide in unpredictable directions. It could dodge his pursuit and still wreck Zi Yao&rsquo;s vitality.</p>
<p>Wicked!</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s visage changed dramatically. It was the first time he had encountered such spooky thing. That flow of energy seemed to have intellect. It could dodge him easily. What the f*ck was going on?</p>
<p>He gathered his Essence Qi. His Soul Consciousness moved rapidly inside Zi Yao&rsquo;s body to capture that flow of cunning energy.</p>
<p>However, that energy was swift and agile. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&rsquo;t catch it. It was like Shi Yan and that energy were playing seek-and-hide in Zi Yao&rsquo;s body. That energy had never decreased while his Essence Qi was running out during this pursuit.</p>
<p>His face became grimaced. Seeing Zi Yao&rsquo;s life fading away, he had a powerless feeling.</p>
<p>Pausing temporarily, he felt the surging mysterious energy in his body. Shi Yan pondered for a while and then made a new decision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Use the negative energy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The negative energy would go with his Death Intent Domain, which might deprive Zi Yao&rsquo;s vitality faster, but still could aim at that flow of energy.</p>
<p>As he was about to take action, he suddenly understood something. His face was astounded.</p>
<p>Death and Life Intent Domain.</p>
<p>Not only did he understand the Death Upanishad, but he also he had some knowledge of the Life mysteries. Perhaps, he could release a life magnetic field that was similar to the Soul Burial Ground?</p>
<p>When this thought appeared, it started to snowball, and he couldn&rsquo;t dismiss it from his mind.</p>
<p>Pondering for a while, he decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>When this thought popped up in his head, it turned into an electric current, strongly flooding the deep place in his God Soul. It seemed to have a magical connection with his Seal of Upanishad. All of a sudden, a vague but marvelous idea arose in his head.</p>
<p>Flows of mysterious energy in his acupuncture points seemed to be stimulated, becoming more vigorous. Such a powerful life energy made him shudder. He couldn&rsquo;t help but release the energy as per what he had in his vague mind.</p>
<p>Magically, a wonderful feeling appeared in his eyes. One of them was gloomy and tranquil like Death that could destroy everything. There was no mercy, just an unpredictable wickedness. His other eye had a vigorous life energy, with great affection and yearning for lives.</p>
<p>His pair of eyes had two distinctively different energy fluctuations, and totally opposite emotions.</p>
<p>While his eyes had a bizarre change, seals appeared in his palms.</p>
<p>Death Seal and Life Seal!</p>
<p>Two different seals applied on Zi Yao&rsquo;s body at the same time, as a Death Intent Domain and a Life Intent Domain were both generated.</p>
<p>Flows of mysterious energy were scattering from his acupuncture points together with the evil negative energy, which was corresponding with the emotions in his eyes and the opposite energies in his left hand and right hand. The mysterious energy then flooded the Life Seal, giving him the supernatural power of living beings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the negative energy had contacted his gloomy eye, pouring massively into the Death Seal and fusing perfectly with the Death Intent Domain, turning it into a Sacred level evil energy that could kill everything. Then, it entered into Zi Yao&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan seemed to become a God who held life and death in his hands. He could kill a life instantly, depriving its vitality. Or, he could give the breath of life to a still rock, giving it intellect.</p>
<p>Negative energy and mysterious energy fused in the Life Intent Domain and the Death Intent Domain urged by his Soul, pouring into Zi Yao&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The vigorous life energy moved inside Zi Yao&rsquo;s body, stimulating her vitality and making her pale skin blush again. At the same time, the Death Upanishad was fused in the negative energy that was destroying Zi Yao&rsquo;s vitality.</p>
<p>Shi Yan observed the beauty in his embrace for a while, and he felt he had gotten it.</p>
<p>The Life Intent Domain expanded, covering Zi Yao&rsquo;s soul altar, brain, limbs, and the organs that were wounded. The Death Intent Domain was storming furiously in Zi Yao&rsquo;s chest, finding that cunning flow of energy to destroy it.</p>
<p>That flow of energy with its own consciousness was moving unceasingly. As though it could find the strange situation, it was trying to counterattack.</p>
<p>The coverage of the Death Intent Domain was getting larger. Under the urge of the negative energy, it created a mini Soul Burial Ground, which also covered half of Zi Yao&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The Soul Burial Ground was marvelous. It could absorb all life energy and destroy all vitality. Even that flow of wicked energy couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>
<p>Under the miraculous yet brutal Soul Burial Ground, that flow of energy was weakened little by little.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was cheered up, a strange light sparkling in his eyes. While he was destroying the unknown force in Zi Yao&rsquo;s body, he felt a new perception of the power of Death and Life Upanishad.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t think much, trying to condense his spirit, soul, and Essence Qi. With the bleak energy on one side and the vigorous energy on the other side, he used Zi Yao&rsquo;s body to test his comprehension.</p>
<p>Shortly, the flow of cunning energy in Zi Yao&rsquo;s body was smashed into nothingness.</p>
<p>Then, Shi Yan&rsquo;s thought flickered, retrieving the Death Intent Domain. His negative energy stopped supplementing the energy. The mysterious energy filled his body, turning into his vigorous vitality, flooding his Life Intent Domain while covering Zi Yao&rsquo;s dying body.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was sinking into the sea of life, as her pale body was refilled with new vitality. Her dysfunctional body was recovering fast.</p>
<p>Her face glowed again, and her stagnant soul altar started to move again.</p>
<p>Shi Yan studied her face. After a while, he could confirm she was alright, and only then did he calm down.</p>
<p>He continued releasing the Life Domain. Closing his eyes, he started to sink into the Life Upanishad, wholeheartedly learning the newest knowledge he had sensed.</p>
<p>In a mysterious, bleak place with so many corpses and no beam of living energy fluctuation, a young man was holding a glamorous figure, who was truly a beautiful disaster, in his embrace. He sat nonchalantly while the Death and Life, the magical, contrastive energy fluctuations, were constantly diffusing from his body.</p>
<p>He was trying to comprehend the power Upanishad, making an effort for the acme of the martial path.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, a flow of dark light shot rapidly, carefully dodging each fatal sunbeam. A vague, skinny figure stayed inside that dark light, as a cold and wicked aura came from that light.</p>
<p>While moving forward quickly, the bunch of dark light suddenly shook as if it had received a serious hit. It then slowed down.</p>
<p>The silhouette covered by the dark light distorted for a while, seeming to have gotten hurt. He sat inside the dark light, as if he were trying to recover something. Long after that, he started to breathe normally again.</p>
<p>A cold and wicked aura that nothing could compare with diffused from the silhouette inside the dark light. He seemed to be enraged, trying to carry out something.</p>
<p>Chapter 742: Compensate</p>
<p>Zi Yao felt as if she had just awakened from the deepest nightmare. She felt fatigued, acting dully as if she was still under the effect of some anesthesia.</p>
<p>In her heavy dizziness, she could feel an icy cold murderous intention moving in her brain, attempting to kill her.</p>
<p>This feeling scared her a lot. She was trying hopelessly to resist it. However, like in an endless nightmare, she eventually became powerless. She felt as if Death was near.</p>
<p>Right when she wanted to give up, a warm Soul Consciousness embraced her. In that robust sea, she suddenly felt safe and cozy. Gradually, she forgot the fear in her heart.</p>
<p>After that flow of warm Soul Consciousness appeared, her nightmare turned into a nice dream. She felt relaxed and comfortable. The worries and fear in her heart were swept away. Her dull God Soul also received a new flow of power, as she gradually regained her consciousness.</p>
<p>The power that wanted to cut off her vitality was covered by another wicked energy in her body, then dissolved slowly. After that energy disappeared, the flow of wicked but familiar energy also retreated from her body.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she had no worries or fear. It was so comfortable, as if she were enjoying a wonderful bath, feeling the vigorous energy rolling in her body. An unknown force was nurturing her little by little.</p>
<p>Her consciousness was restored, as the soul altar was moving slowly in her Sea of Consciousness. Her exhausted body became lighter and refreshed.</p>
<p>After an unknown period, she remembered all the things that happened before she was put into a coma. She remembered everything&hellip;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. Her dreamy eyes suddenly sparkled as she saw the one in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was pretty close to her. His face was cold and somber, with his eyes closed. He stayed still like a rock, as two opposing auras were diffusing from him.</p>
<p>One aura was cold and deadly silent, while the other was vigorous. These two auras were opposite to each other, but they could co-exist magically in his body, which gave Zi Yao a strange illusion.</p>
<p>In the next moment, she found herself laying in the other&rsquo;s embrace. Shi Yan was holding her with one arm while she lied feebly on his legs.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was flurried. As she was about to wiggle, she felt something astounding.</p>
<p>A flow of marvelous energy was poured into her body through Shi Yan&rsquo;s arm which was holding her. That energy flowed with vigorous vitality, covering her like a sea of life.</p>
<p>Under the effect of that strange energy, her damaged body was filled with power. Her exhausted body gradually restored.</p>
<p>The mysterious energy had turned into so many streams, spreading and refilling every corner in her body. The biggest stream among them was moving and pouring into her Essence Qi ancient tree in her low abdomen.</p>
<p>The shriveled Essence Qi ancient tree became shining with the supplemented amount of energy.</p>
<p>She was sensitive enough to see how great the benefit that mysterious energy was bringing to her. Thus, she stopped, maintaining her position while looking at Shi Yan quietly.</p>
<p>She studied the cold face within her reach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This man&hellip; isn&rsquo;t bad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s pale face glowed, as a magical light sparkled in her beautiful eyes. She pressed her succulent red lips as the quiet lake in her heart was having some ripples.</p>
<p>Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t realized that Zi Yao had woken up. He seemed to immerse in some dreams. His breath was steady, and his soul was calm with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>However, the Death and Life Intent Domains on his body were like two different sharp swords. One hand of his was pouring the vigorous energy of life into Zi Yao&rsquo;s body while the other hand, which could kill all kinds of creatures, was placed on the freezing cold ground.</p>
<p>The Death Intent Domain and Life Intent Domain were totally opposite. Both of them continually appeared layers upon layers on him.</p>
<p>Shortly, he seemed to become Death, who wanted to kill all creatures, while in the next moment, he gave people a warm feeling like the spring breeze, as if he wanted to give life to all living beings</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s comprehending the knowledge of his realm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao observed for a while and then got it. Her pretty eyes became brighter. She couldn&rsquo;t move her eyes from him even just to blink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has the Life Intent Domain as well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>An impossible thought popped up in her head. Now she knew that it was because of Shi Yan that she could keep her life.</p>
<p>When she woke up, she remembered how tremendous and cruel the flow of energy intruding her body was. In her previous condition, she had no means to resist it. While she was half-conscious, she knew her vitality was damaged severely.</p>
<p>If Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t helped her, she knew that at this moment, even her soul altar would have been destroyed.</p>
<p>The vague memories of her nightmare became clearer bit by bit. Although her eyes were still as beautiful as stars in the sky, the quiet lake in her heart was rippling. Her countenance was strangely unclear.</p>
<p>She was dazed, looking at the young man who was holding her tight and learning his power Upanishad at the same time. At this moment, she felt a little bit confused&hellip;</p>
<p>The mysterious energy pouring into her body weakened until it stopped. It woke her up from her tangible thoughts.</p>
<p>She sensed her body condition as a gleam of begrudging sorrow appeared on her charming face.</p>
<p>Although her life was saved, her energy had been consumed greatly. The amount of mysterious energy Shi Yan had given her was like a pinch of salt in the sea. She still needed a lot to recover.</p>
<p>As she was at the Third Sky of King God Realm, she needed the amount of energy as much as the water in a vast sea to restore her power. Depending only on the refined energy from Shi Yan&rsquo;s acupuncture points, who was just at the Second Sky of True God Realm, wasn&rsquo;t enough to help her recover.</p>
<p>While she was upset, she just recalled something, her face frightened.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s power Upanishad could heal her wounds? That vigorous vitality seemed to carry the mysteries of Life, which could heal her damaged vitality, helping it shine healthily. Such power Upanishad could appear on the man who has the Death Upanishad?</p>
<p>This discovery astounded her!</p>
<p>Impossible!</p>
<p>When she looked at Shi Yan, she felt that this man was like a riddle. No one knew how many secrets he was keeping.</p>
<p>Time flew hurriedly.</p>
<p>After an unknown period of time, Shi Yan woke up from his realm comprehension. When he opened his eyes, he was startled. An enchanting face was not more than half a meter from him. The sweet fragrance of hers permeated his nostrils and mouth, entering his body.</p>
<p>It should be a wonderful thing. However, as he had just woken up from his realm comprehension, so he couldn&rsquo;t react timely. Quite the contrary, he was a little bit bewildered.</p>
<p>He felt awkward as he hurried to loosen his arm around Zi Yao. He smiled shyly and stood up.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face was still normal, still the flower-like smiling visage. She was half lying and half sitting on the ground, revealing her charming curves. A strange light flared in her beautiful eyes. &ldquo;I feel great after a good nap. But, I haven&rsquo;t slept enough. Still feeling a little tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was dull, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. You can continue to sleep. We aren&rsquo;t hurried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew Zi Yao understood what had happened. Since the other didn&rsquo;t mention anything, he didn&rsquo;t want to explain further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was sleeping, why did you take me here? Where the heck is this place?&rdquo; Zi Yao rubbed her jade-like neck. She shook her head as if she were pulling herself together. Her beautiful eyes gazed here and there at the surroundings.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was stiff. &ldquo;Ghost knows. Our war chariot was destroyed in a furious energy storm. I brought you and tried to escape, but we were dragged into a massive vortex, sinking into its core. When I woke up, we were here already. I&rsquo;ve surveyed this area. There are no living beings here. I found only rotten corpses here, which belonged to beasts and other races.&rdquo; He pointed at the area above their heads.</p>
<p>Zi Yao lifted her head, looking at the hundred-meters-long beast skeleton. She wasn&rsquo;t so surprised, as if she had seen it before. She laughed cheerily. &ldquo;Why did you bring me to this strange place? You&rsquo;ve planned some dark things, right? Why did you hug me? You&hellip; Did you do anything to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He was bewildered for a while and then said calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done anything to you. But hey, before we got here, you bullied me when we were in the war chariot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed a finger at the place Zi Yao kissed him, talking seriously. &ldquo;No woman has ever disgraced me like this. How will you compensate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao couldn&rsquo;t hold her laughter anymore. She laughed until her body shook, her eyes watery. The pressure and the harsh situation they were bearing were suddenly swept away a little bit.</p>
<p>She squinted while laughing, licking her seducing red lips. Her naturally charming voice arose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. My bad! I shouldn&rsquo;t have disgraced you. Tell me, what do you want for compensation? I&rsquo;m a little bit slow. You have to teach me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt hot, as if a volcano was activated inside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just make it up,&rdquo; He was shaken, approaching Zi Yao all of a sudden. He licked his lips, trying to place a smack on her cheek.</p>
<p>Zi Yao laughed cheerily. When his lips were about to touch her cheek, she rose a finger, placing on his wide mouth, then continued laughing. She didn&rsquo;t say anything, her eyes bearing something deep.</p>
<p>Facing her for a few seconds, Shi Yan was embarrassed. He admitted his defeat first, giving a wry smile and then stepping backward. He faked a cough and then stood up with a solemn face, looking at the further distance. &ldquo;We should know where we are first. We should check this area to know the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao beamed a smile. She looked at him for a while and then stooped, whining. &ldquo;Thick-skinned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was emotionless, talking naturally. &ldquo;The gravity here&rsquo;s formidable. As your wounds haven&rsquo;t recovered fully, I&rsquo;ll help you. Yeah, I won&rsquo;t calculate our debt this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t wait for Zi Yao to object to his idea, hastening towards her like lightning. He held her hand while looking forward, urging his power to pull her with him while running at a fast pace.</p>
<p>At the moment he held her hand, Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes had a clear gleam of fear. However, she calmed down quickly and didn&rsquo;t struggle, just letting Shi Yan hold it. She didn&rsquo;t urge her power as she let Shi Yan take the lead and leap up.</p>
<p>Chapter 743: Vermilion Bird &ndash; the Sacred Beast</p>
<p>Shi Yan and Zi Yao were moving aimlessly in the mysterious and perilous land. Anyway, their speed was just one-third compared to their normal speed.</p>
<p>The gravity of this place was horrifying. Once warriors stepped on this land, they had to bear a massive pressure that hindered them whenever they moved or flew. Above their heads were the thick, ink-like clouds that blocked their view to outer space.</p>
<p>There was neither sunlight nor the energy from sun, moon, or stars. This gloomy land only had rotten corpses lying here and there. They couldn&rsquo;t find a single way of energy from living beings.</p>
<p>This place was spacious. Even after moving for a long time, they didn&rsquo;t see where it ended. However, Shi Yan and Zi Yao all felt tired. They had to slow down, using their Soul Consciousness to sense begrudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; Shi Yan held her hand tightly, his face serious. &ldquo;The energy that intruded your body was frightening. It had consciousness, and it could avoid my pursuit. If I hadn&rsquo;t reacted correctly using the Death Intent Domain to surround it, perhaps, you couldn&rsquo;t have resisted it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who attacked me is at the Peak of King God Realm. He&rsquo;s just one step away from the Original God Realm. A flow of Soul Consciousness with power could ascend into life&hellip; This is the mystery of the heaven and earth a warrior at the Original God Realm can perceive. That one&hellip; I think he&rsquo;s still a little bit weak, so he couldn&rsquo;t cross a further distance or pour more energy into the living being ascended from his Soul Consciousness. Otherwise, even if you helped me, I would have been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes were distressed. She contemplated for a while and then turned to him. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t helped me, I would have died already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wisp of Soul Consciousness could evolve into a living creature? Do the Original God Realm warriors have that kind of supernatural attainment?&rdquo; Shi Yan was frightened.</p>
<p>In his eyes, it was unimaginable. A flow of Soul Consciousness could have its own intellect, as if it could become a clone of the user? Such a tremendous and marvelous technique was too spooky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experts at the Original God Realm have supernatural power Upanishads, and it&rsquo;s not that simple.&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled begrudgingly, her face longing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always making efforts to reach this realm. Until now, I still think it&rsquo;s too far away for me to ever reach. Experts at this realm are the real characters in the Raging Flame Star Area. They are all the freak elders that have almost become monsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wounds&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t die yet, but it&rsquo;s not easy to recover fully. Don&rsquo;t worry! I have so many medicines and pellets, so I can gradually recover my powers. I just need time,&rdquo; Zi Yao said casually.</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good then. This place is strange, and somehow evil. My Soul Consciousness can&rsquo;t get out, and the others can&rsquo;t detect us either. Even if they can come here, they won&rsquo;t dare to intrude. So, we still have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes brightened. &ldquo;When I woke up, I saw you were comprehending power Upanishads. How was it? Did you get a big harvest? Is it still far from reaching the Third Sky of True God Realm? I think the Essence Qi in your body is enough&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last part of her words wasn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>Before the battle with Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo, she had checked Shi Yan&rsquo;s Essence Qi condition. She knew his situation at that time. However, when she woke up and sensed his body&rsquo;s conditions again, she found that his Essence Qi had tripled!</p>
<p>This was something she had never dared to imagine!</p>
<p>Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t know what had happened to Shi Yan that had tripled his Essence Qi while she was in a coma.</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Did you get something good?&rdquo; As she was moved, Zi Yao couldn&rsquo;t help but ask.</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded relaxedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. I gained a big harvest. If nothing unexpected happens, I can break through shortly. I think&hellip; just a little bit later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not small indeed, as he had made a tremendous harvest this time!</p>
<p>Not only was his Essence Qi ancient tree filled with pure energy, but he also gained a brand new perception of the mysteries of Life and Death.</p>
<p>Among the three powers of Star, Space, and Death and Life, his Death and Life Intent Domain had always been lagging behind the others. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know how to continue advancing this power. This time, when he was aiding Zi Yao in healing her wounds, he magically fell into the state of comprehension. Afterward, he had a new knowledge, which could be considered a whole new world to him.</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that he would be able to enter the Third Sky of True God Realm not long afterward, gaining a greater achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; Zi Yao told him seriously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to predict things, indeed. I can&rsquo;t recover my wounds in a short time, but you have gained big benefits, as your realm and powers are all improved. I should be distressed, but I don&rsquo;t know why I feel it&rsquo;s alright. At least&hellip; I can relax for a while, and I don&rsquo;t need to plan or calculate anything, just putting that terrible mess aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He knew she had to bear a lot of pressure. He sighed inwardly. &ldquo;You know the one who attacked you at the last moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s smiling face changed. Her eyes became freezing cold, sparkling with a bone-deep resentment. &ldquo;I have some idea, but I&rsquo;m not sure. I will investigate it. I hope it wouldn&rsquo;t be like I&rsquo;ve thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suspect?&rdquo; Shi Yan contemplated while frowning.</p>
<p>Zi Yao gave him a deep look. Pondering for a few seconds, she replied, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to know, because you can&rsquo;t help me even if you know, and it will only increase your pressure. Moreover&hellip; I&rsquo;m not certain about it yet. We should talk about it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; nodded Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gravity here is massive. Your realm can&rsquo;t help you with the terrible gravity here. We can&rsquo;t escape this place.&rdquo; Zi Yao lifted up her head, looking at the sky and muttered, &ldquo;If my power is recovered, we can wiggle and get rid of the gravity. Anyway, we can&rsquo;t do that right now. Seems we have to stay there for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are from the Raging Flame Star Area, so have you ever heard about this strange land inside the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Raging Flame Star Area is much bigger than what you&rsquo;ve imagined. The Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field doesn&rsquo;t simply have some hidden areas like this. I&rsquo;m not familiar with this place. Or else, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been lost,&rdquo; Zi Yao shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are. There are many mysterious places in the Raging Flame Star Area. Many unsolved riddles, too. There are some places even the Original God Realm warriors don&rsquo;t dare to trespass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan shuddered inwardly, secretly putting up his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, you can loosen my hand. We shall move.&rdquo; Zi Yao suddenly smiled, as bright as a blooming flower. She pulled herself together and shook the negative mood off.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t change his visage as he let off her hand. &ldquo;Okay. We should continue to search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing him deliberate like nothing had happened, Zi Yao was resentful. She clenched her teeth and let out a light snort.</p>
<p>Shi Yan acted as if he didn&rsquo;t notice her move. He dashed forward with a sigh. &ldquo;Too bad! So many skeletons here have been corroded with time, without any energy remaining. Otherwise, I could have made some toys with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can forge secret treasures, too?&rdquo; Zi Yao was surprised as she exclaimed behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a little bit.&rdquo; Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t turn his head to look at her as he continued to move ahead. &ldquo;I made the three Bone Thorns I used in the fight with Da Meng. Sigh! Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have many good materials. Otherwise, I can try to forge Divine weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was stunned.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t care about her. He released his Soul Consciousness and urged his energy to get rid of the massive gravity, flying forward quickly.</p>
<p>Beast skeletons passed under his body. Those skeletons showed no wounds, making Shi Yan curious as to how they died.</p>
<p>Far, far from him, Shi Yan could see the skeletons of many experts from different races. All of them were grayish-brown, without a single beam of energy left. He couldn&rsquo;t use them to forge any weapons.</p>
<p>Barren hills appeared in his view, only to be left behind shortly. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know how long he had been flying. But on this day, while he felt a little tired, a beam of weak, hidden energy suddenly appeared in his Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>That flow of energy was feeble, as if something was covering it. If Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t understand the Sun Upanishad, he would never have sensed it.</p>
<p>It was the flaming energy of the Sun!</p>
<p>Shi Yan was cheered up. He didn&rsquo;t care about his exhausted spirit and continued to fly forward at a slower speed.</p>
<p>Arid hills and mountains glided under his body. After a long time, his view was suddenly widened. Lying deep in a massive hole drilled into the earth was a giant beast skeleton.</p>
<p>That skeleton looked like a giant bird without flesh. All the bones were scarlet, around ten thousand meters long. It looked more like a collapsed mountain fallen into the center of that deep hole.</p>
<p>A beam of flaming energy of the sun came from this giant bird. However, it was concealed. If Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t have a special power Upanishad, he would never have felt it.</p>
<p>He approached the hole slowly, floating quietly above the giant bird and observing. Shi Yan condensed his Soul Consciousness into a beam and sent it toward the bird&rsquo;s forehead, where he had sensed the energy.</p>
<p>The feeble wisp of flaming sun energy came from there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; At this moment, Zi Yao&rsquo;s frightened call arose behind him.</p>
<p>A purple light flashed. In the next minute, Zi Yao was next to him, watching the giant bird skeleton with fear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan immediately retrieved his sensing Soul Consciousness. He frowned, looking at her unknowingly. &ldquo;Do you know what kind of a bird is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m right, I think I know what it is.&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes flared, but she didn&rsquo;t say anything in detail, as though she wasn&rsquo;t so sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was scared. &ldquo;What? What did you just say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird!&rdquo; Zi Yao repeated. &ldquo;Long time ago, this Sacred Beast came here from nowhere. It suddenly appeared in the Raging Flame Star Area. It caused the solar suns in the area to lose their light. This so-called Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird seemed to be able to absorb the power of the sun to ascend. Since the Solar Stars were ineffective, floras on many life stars shriveled and died. So many spiritual herbs and plants on Herbal Stars died, which enraged experts at that time. They united to hunt that bird down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the result?&rdquo; A vehement storm rolled in Shi Yan&rsquo;s heart, but his voice was still calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Result?&rdquo; Zi Yao beamed a forced smile &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the result, because the warriors hunting the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird and the bird itself all disappeared into thin air all of a sudden. But now, I know it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed at the giant bird skeleton under their feet and countless skeletons of beasts and experts of different races far from them. &ldquo;I think this is the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vermilion Bird True Flame&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the heaven flames from Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar sent him their thoughts. Shortly, Shi Yan could feel the energy fluctuations from the skeleton of the giant bird.</p>
<p>Chapter 744: Original Magnetic Field</p>
<p>Legends of the Vermilion Bird True Flame had been told in the Grace Mainland, and each of them was related to the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>The Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird was a mighty existence in the Immemorial Epoch. It was gifted with the ability to use fire. As the Sacred Beast of Fire class, its supernatural power was eternal. It was one of the most powerful existences of that era.</p>
<p>Another legend, which got approval from many people, was said to be the nearest to the truth.</p>
<p>Rumors had it that when one of the four Sacred Beasts, Vermilion Bird, left the Grace Mainland, as it didn&rsquo;t know whether or not it could survive in the outer space, it left a wisp of its soul.</p>
<p>That wisp of soul had its flaming energy, but it didn&rsquo;t have an entity. As time went by, it gradually cut off the connection with Vermilion Bird and gained its own intellect, becoming one of the heaven flames. The Vermilion Bird True Flame had the comprehension of Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s principles. Weapons forged by Vermilion Bird True Flame would be added with the divine power of the Bird. This heaven flame was ranked seventh on the list.</p>
<p>There were many tales about the Vermilion Bird True Flame, but this one was the most famous. In the Grace Mainland, Vermilion Bird True Flame was the most mysterious heaven flame, as it rarely showed up.</p>
<p>After the Immemorial Epoch, the Ancient Time, and the Antiquity Era, no warrior had ever met this heaven flame. It seemed to have disappeared into thin air, or it had left the Grace Mainland somehow.</p>
<p>Heaven flames could sense each other. That was why Shi Yan&rsquo;s heaven flames in his soul altar could detect the feeble fluctuation on the forehead of that giant bird. They all reacted and sent the thoughts to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Thus, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to act rashly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zi Yao felt something. &ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan mused. He didn&rsquo;t release his Soul Consciousness, just frowning and assessing the giant bird skeleton as he was contacting the heaven flames in his soul altar discreetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very powerful! He&rsquo;s certainly at level five. His ascension&rsquo;s more complete than ours, and his power&rsquo;s immense.&rdquo; The Ice Cold Flame sent him its message first. &ldquo;You should be careful. Heaven flames can detect and swallow each other to increase their power. Just like the World Extinguishing Thunder Flame, if he can detect us, perhaps he will want to occupy us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan slightly changed his face. &ldquo;Level five? What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are similar to the warriors, and we can evolve. Heaven flames have 9 levels to achieve. Each time we ascend, we can break through one level, during which, we will improve our intelligence and power, and the living form will become more perfect. The ranking of 9 levels appears at the time we gain intellect, and then stays deep inside our souls. It will never fade away. I don&rsquo;t know why we have such ranking. However, to have a more perfect living form, we have always headed to level 9,&rdquo; said the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame, the heaven flame that was ranked number 3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had ascended to level 4. However, due to a long time of captivity, my realm has degraded. Now, I&rsquo;m only at level 3. Among the heaven flames here, only the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame&rsquo;s at level 4. The Ice Cold Flame and I are the same, at level 3. The Earth Flame&rsquo;s at level 2, but he seems ready to break through soon. He should be at level 3 later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, his ascension is much more perfect than yours?&rdquo; frowned Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. His realm is similar to the World Extinguishing Thunder Flame, level 5. Although he is ranked number 7, his ascension&rsquo;s much better than us. We, perhaps, are not his opponents. And, this is his territory. Once we engage in a battle, he can gain more energy support. It would be much strenuous to deal with him.&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame seemed to be begrudged. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been confined for so many years, I think, not only would my realm have not been degraded, I would have also broken through to level 5. It&rsquo;s so unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you talking with someone?&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes sparkled as she could sense his Soul Consciousness change. &ldquo;Before I got fainted, I could feel you were talking to someone. Who is that one? Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soul sacrificial altar was the most precious and fundamental treasure of a warrior. It was the most forbidden and private place. Since the heaven flames were taking shelter in his soul altar, even Zi Yao couldn&rsquo;t detect them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard about heaven flames?&rdquo; Musing for a while, Shi Yan took a deep breath then focused on Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Since Zi Yao was the princess of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation in the Raging Flame Star Area, her knowledge was profound. Shi Yan thought that if they could find the heaven flames on the Grace Mainland, the Raging Flame Star Area might have some as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven flames?&rdquo; Zi Yao was shaken, apparently astounded. &ldquo;How do you know these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was moved. &ldquo;You know them? Tell me, what are those strange living beings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know them?&rdquo; Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t answer but asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know them. Our continent has heaven flames.&rdquo; Shi Yan frowned as he was filled with suspicions towards Zi Yao&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told me you come from a low-level continent! How long do you want to deceive me furthermore?&rdquo; Zi Yao was so angry that her face paled. &ldquo;I knew it. You have the Death Upanishad and space Upanishad. You&rsquo;re absolutely not from a low-level continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan beamed a forced smile. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fool you. In my continent, the strongest warriors have only the Peak of True God Realm cultivation base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never seen a stronger warrior in your continent?&rdquo; Zi Yao glared at him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was astounded. &ldquo;It seems&hellip; Yeah, a long time ago. But that&rsquo;s too long ago. Currently, the energy cycle of our continent is coming to an end. We don&rsquo;t have even the King God Realm warriors. That&rsquo;s why I told you I belong to a low-level continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s face was better after listening to him. &ldquo;The continent you lived should have been rich before. In the time you didn&rsquo;t know of, the invincible experts must have appeared. However, as their realms were extreme, the heaven and earth energy in your continent must have been drained fast. They had to leave to find a better place for their cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess,&rdquo; nodded Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I know, only the oldest continents could have these magical creatures called heaven flames.&rdquo; Zi Yao looked at him with a serious countenance and explained slowly. &ldquo;Those mysterious and old continents have original magnetic fields, which absorb the energy of the star sea for billions of years. The original magnetic field stays in the deepest place in those continents, just like the marvelous soul altar of warriors. The heaven flames are the kinds of strange creatures created by the original energy of the original magnetic field. Each kind of heaven flames have coincidentally or accidentally gained a flow of Original Energy, and gradually formed their beings. Those flames don&rsquo;t have a real entity. Their living form is mysterious and magical. They are constantly completing and ascending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only Shi Yan, but his heaven flames in the soul altar had also quieted down, using Shi Yan&rsquo;s perception to listen to her description.</p>
<p>Heaven flames themselves didn&rsquo;t have a clear information of their origin and existence. Nobody had ever told them how they were created or developed. As they were listening to her, they were all attentive, as if they were afraid that they would miss some of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Original Energy is the most supernatural power in the world. Only the oldest continents could have the Original Magnetic Field. Of course, this flow of energy will drain together with the prosperity of lives on that continent. You said that your continent is about to reach its end of the energy cycle. I think it has lost the Original Magnetic Field and the Original Energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Zi Yao arranged her ideas and then continued. &ldquo;Anyway, I can tell you that every continent that used to have the Original Magnetic Field is one of the oldest continents, and they aren&rsquo;t the low-level ones. At least, in our Raging Flame Star Area, we have never had that kind of a continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the Original Magnetic Field good for?&rdquo; Shi Yan exclaimed inwardly. His eyes showed his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient continents have the Original Magnetic Field, which could give birth to and nurture powerful lives. It could make the creatures on that continent learn faster and gain more of the heaven and earth&rsquo;s energies. Lives born on continents with Original Magnetic Field are all high-grade living beings. From the primitive times, they could level up pretty fast using the enormous energy on the continent. Their realms were really profound and unpredictable.&rdquo; Zi Yao took a deep breath and pointed at the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird under their feet. &ldquo;Take this giant creature for example. No continent in the Raging Flame Star Area can give birth to such life. I&rsquo;m sure it came from an ancient continent with Original Magnetic Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding instinctively, Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes were complicated. &ldquo;Yeah, I think this dude came from our Grace Mainland. Because, in our place, legends of it have been told for so many generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. She confirmed immediately. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s true! Heaven Flames are the strange creatures that evolved from a flow of Original Energy. I heard that when a warrior could combine all kinds of heaven flames in a mysterious ancient continent, he could fuse those Original Energies into one, bringing an unimaginable benefit to his soul altar. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know the details, because our Raging Flame Star Area has never had such a lucky b*stard who could have all kinds of heaven flames from the continent with Original Magnetic Field. I think no one knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was struck, as his eyes brightened.</p>
<p>He remembered that he had obtained a technique called &lsquo;Heaven Flame Refining Divine Technique&rsquo; from the ring.</p>
<p>This secret technique told people how to fuse all kinds of heaven flames to create the Fire Life, which could burn the soul and create the Original Soul. Heaven Flame Refining Divine Technique required three main materials, including the Thunder Witch Wood, Blood Soul Divine Water, Five Elements Crystal Marrow, and so many auxiliary materials. The process to combine the flames was quite complicated and exquisite.</p>
<p>Because it was too difficult to find all the heaven flames, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to this technique. But, as he was listening to Zi Yao, he jolted as he finally understood how magical and precious that technique was.</p>
<p>Shi Yan calculated, and he could confirm what kind of a great chance he could have when he gathered all heaven flames on the Grace Mainland.</p>
<p>Chapter 745: Sun Original Essence!</p>
<p>Among the known ten heaven flames on the Grace Mainland, he had the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame, the Ice Cold Flame, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, the Corpse Vanishing Flame, and the Earth Flame. The Purgatory True Flame was in Ye Chang Feng&rsquo;s body. If he could return to the Grace Mainland, perhaps he could exchange that heaven flame with a good price. It seemed not really difficult to take that heaven flame.</p>
<p>The World Extinguishing Thunder Flame was smashed and banished into another space. When his Space power could be improved further one day, he could make that space appear again to gather the World Extinguishing Thunder Flame and conquer it.</p>
<p>So, among the ten heaven flames, only the Primal Chaos Sacred Flame, Immemorial Demonic Flame, and the Vermilion Bird True Flame remained unknown.</p>
<p>Today, the Vermilion Bird True Flame was right under his feet.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Shi Yan felt that the time he could gather all the heaven flames of the Grace Mainland was near.</p>
<p>While frowning, he was stunned thinking about one thing.</p>
<p>If what Zi Yao said were true, that each of heaven flame would need a flow of Original Energy, should the Earth Flame have one when it had ascended too?</p>
<p>Original Energy was the root of an ancient continent. Without the Original Energy, a continent would lose its heaven and earth energy faster.</p>
<p>No wonder why the energy of the Grace Mainland had nearly come to the end of its cycle. Turned out it was related to the Earth Flame, more or less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you ask about the Heaven Flames?&rdquo; As Zi Yao was watching him, she recognized he sometimes furrowed his brows and then shifted to a more relaxed posture</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, the one who&rsquo;s been talking to me is a heaven flame,&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes rippled with a strange light. She was astounded, looking at him stunned. After a while, she beamed a forced smile. &ldquo;Your luck is too good, you know? You got a heaven flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heaven flame?</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt funny, shaking his head. However, he didn&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s underground. Watch out!&rdquo; All of a sudden, the Ice Cold Flame sent Shi Yan a message. &ldquo;That energy&rsquo;s too hot. I don&rsquo;t like it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next moment, Shi Yan felt it as well. His sword-like eyes gazed at the skull of the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>The feeble flow of energy became clearer. Soon, an orange-red flame appeared. The flame enlarged gradually, and in just a blink, it became an exquisite Vermilion Bird, floating above the skull of the giant bird.</p>
<p>A scorching, flaming energy bloomed from that Vermilion Bird. It was like a change of heaven and earth energy. Waves of flame rippled unceasingly, covering Shi Yan and Zi Yao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to start a fight!&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame was totally enraged. &ldquo;Although he&rsquo;s at level 5, we aren&rsquo;t alone. Such an arrogant b*stard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fight&rsquo;s between the heaven flames, just like the battle with the World Extinguishing Thunder Flame. You can&rsquo;t participate in it easily.&rdquo; The Ice Cold Flame told him.</p>
<p>In the next moment, strange flames flew out one by one from Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Altar.</p>
<p>Four great heaven flames, including the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, the Ice Cold Flame, and the Corpse Vanishing Flame got out and stormed towards the Vermilion Bird created by the Vermilion Bird True Flame.</p>
<p>Zi Yao gawked, muttering as if she were sleep-talking. &ldquo;One, two, three, four! Four! My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, touching his forehead. He found that the Earth Flame was still dormant. Seemed like it was still in the process of ascension. The Earth Flame wouldn&rsquo;t join this battle.</p>
<p>Shortly, the silver Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame, the blue Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, the green Corpse Vanishing Flame, and the jade white Ice Cold Flame flashed and then disappeared, swarming towards the Vermilion Bird True Flame.</p>
<p>Four energies of different attributes were activated, stirring up this whole world and shaking it turbulently.</p>
<p>The Corpse Vanishing Flame came the last, floating silently. In just a flash, a magical magnetic field expanded from its green flame.</p>
<p>Suddenly, countless spooky, green colored phosphorescent lights slowly flew up from the barren land. They looked like snowflakes moving upward to the sky, gathering into the flame.</p>
<p>A faint corpse Qi was found in those spooky green lights. It seemed the flame had dragged the last beam of energy in those experts and beasts&rsquo; skeletons.</p>
<p>So many spooky green flames gathered and congregated in the Corpse Vanishing Flame. At the same time, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame seemed to have sensed something, as a wave of energy rippled from it. Then, a gossamer-like energy that naked eyes couldn&rsquo;t see diffused from the dark cotton clouds in the sky, moving towards the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan could clearly feel how joyful the Corpse Vanishing Flame and the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame were. This area could supply them a powerful energy.</p>
<p>The Corpse Vanishing Flame could gain energy from the corpses. Although Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t see any beam of energy in the countless corpses and skeletons here, it didn&rsquo;t mean that there was nothing usable. The strange and evil Corpse Vanishing Flame was able to take the Corpse Qi from corpses to grow its power.</p>
<p>And, the thick cotton clouds in the sky seemed to contain the remnants of the spooky souls, which the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame could take in.</p>
<p>It looked like these flames had been prepared. As soon as they flew out, they acted immediately, taking the power that benefited them to increase their auras.</p>
<p>Countless green phosphorescent flames and a large amount of energy from soul remnants made the Corpse Vanishing Flame and the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame overjoyed, especially the latter. He was a level 4 heaven flame. After receiving this kind of energy, the energy fluctuation it released had frightened even Shi Yan.</p>
<p>So powerful!</p>
<p>Zi Yao suddenly groaned, even though she had no wounds. She supported her forehead in tiredness, gazing at him with a bizarre countenance. &ldquo;You&hellip; How many tricks do you have? Why do I feel that you always have many mysteries that people will never fully discover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubbing his nose, Shi Yan shrugged. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you have only one heaven flame? Why are there four over there?&rdquo; Zi Yao clenched her teeth, thinking that she was fooled the second time. Her young soul was enraged.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. &ldquo;When did I say I have only one kind of heaven flame? Didn&rsquo;t you think like that yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why didn&rsquo;t you explain?&rdquo; Zi Yao screamed indignantly, her charming face angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled. &ldquo;I think I don&rsquo;t need to explain these things. It&rsquo;s not worth the time. You&rsquo;ve seen them, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you everything. But you are hiding things from me. You&rsquo;re too ungrateful!&rdquo; Zi Yao was enraged, speaking through her gritted white teeth. &ldquo;Remember it! Women are always narrow-minded. I will make you see what you will receive for bullying women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullied you?&rdquo; Shi Yan forced a smile. He felt that he sometimes couldn&rsquo;t reason when talking to her. He shook his head and didn&rsquo;t try to explain further, shifting his focus to the furious fight of the heaven flames.</p>
<p>It was similar to the previous time. The heaven flames had created a separate world that would hinder the outsiders, keeping them from getting involved in their fight.</p>
<p>He looked at the sky. So many layers of flames covered the entire sky, just like a massive cluster of light. Seeing this kind of scorching heat and fierce atmosphere, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know how or when to support them.</p>
<p>Shortly, the light disappeared, leaving some auras that even the Soul Consciousness couldn&rsquo;t catch. Without the connection with heaven flames, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t feel those auras.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t want to hover in the sky anymore. Getting rid of the formidable gravity wasn&rsquo;t an easy task, after all.</p>
<p>He landed, standing near the thousand-meters-long skeleton of the Vermilion Bird. He faced the sky, gathering his Soul Consciousness. &ldquo;I know you guys can borrow my soul energy. This is the only thing I can help you with. If you need it, remember to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need! He and I have taken the Corpse Qi in this area. We&rsquo;ve gained big this time. It won&rsquo;t be too harsh dealing with him.&rdquo; The Yin Spirit Ghost Flame sent him a message. Among the heaven flames, this was the only level 4 flame.</p>
<p>In this area, he seemed to be more relaxed. While fighting with the Vermilion Bird True Flame, he still had time to talk to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Hearing him, Shi Yan felt at ease. He smiled and then relaxed, walking around the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton, admiring the ancient creature from the Grace Mainland.</p>
<p>The Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird was born in the Immemorial Epoch in the Grace Mainland. It had left the Grace Mainland a long time ago. A mighty sacred beast like it had fallen in the outer space, under the siege of so many experts. Ultimately, it had paid a big price of having its God Soul dispersed to kill all of the enemies.</p>
<p>The outer space was too dangerous, indeed.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton was ten thousand meters tall. Its bones were ash gray and rotten. It seemed to have no energy remaining in it.</p>
<p>However, when Shi Yan knocked a leg bone, he heard the echoing sound of metal. This astounded him for a while, his face solemn.</p>
<p>He gathered energy, urging his power to make a strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That skeleton resounded a loud echo, but his attack left nothing on the bone.</p>
<p>His face changed, looking at Zi Yao who had just landed. &ldquo;This thing has been dead for countless years. Look, its bones are all decayed. Why haven&rsquo;t they turned into dust? Aren&rsquo;t they too rigid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still remembered when he stepped on the skeleton of a beast on the way there, it would disperse like a mass of bone dust. It was unimaginably weak.</p>
<p>Even though it appeared to be decayed, this Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton was still so rigid. Shi Yan was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This beast isn&rsquo;t some kind of creature our Raging Flame Star Area could nurture. Its might has been carved in the minds of many people of the Raging Flame Star Area. According to the legends, we had to mobilize almost all of the peak experts of the Raging Flame Star Area at that time to kill him. That beast was able to kill all of them! I don&rsquo;t know how he could do that.&rdquo; Zi Yao seemed to respect the beast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate that your continent is going to see the end of its energy cycle. Otherwise, I can&rsquo;t imagine how frightening it would be. Creatures from that continent are too powerful. They are all beyond my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack Crack Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, fierce cracking sounds echoed under the skeleton of the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was scared, oddly looking at the finger he had just touched. &ldquo;Oh sh*t, did I just activate any restriction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was dumbstruck, looking at the ground under her feet.</p>
<p>The ground was torn apart, revealing a large hole. A massive crystal that was as big as a football court emerged slowly. Countless beams of sunlight were radiating from that crystal, as the flaming energy of the sun was surging vehemently. A burning liquid was moving on the surface of the crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun Original Essence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao couldn&rsquo;t help but cry hoarsely.</p>
<p>Chapter 746: Power Upanishad Sublimated!</p>
<p>The flaming crystal slowly emerged from the ground, releasing a lot of sunbeams. At that moment, the icy cold, barren land was filled with a scorching energy.</p>
<p>Numerous skeletons of warriors and beasts were melted under those sunbeams. The gray sky was illuminated by the flaming light, as the colored light extended everywhere.</p>
<p>The aura of the Vermilion Bird True Flame inside the sky suddenly rocketed!</p>
<p>Right after the flaming crystal appeared, he seemed to gain more power. In the battle with the other heaven flames, he seemed to be gaining the upper hand thanks to the supplementation from the crystal.</p>
<p>In the fierce fight between the heaven flames, outsiders couldn&rsquo;t participate. Even Shi Yan, the one with the heaven flame tier in his soul altar, could only use his soul energy to aid his flames.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t pour his energy directly to support the heaven flames to deal with the Vermilion Bird True Flame. The fight between heaven flames seemed to have some binding principles.</p>
<p>Every time the heaven flames fought, they would be covered by an invisible force, which hindered outsiders from sensing or interfering in their fight.</p>
<p>The flaming crystal slowly emerged, as if some force was guiding it to fly up from underground. The terrible gravity of this place seemed to not affect the crystal at all, as it could slowly float up to the sky.</p>
<p>Countless sunbeams shone like spotlights and illuminated the ground. Far from the lighting source, skeletons were melted and dissolved, while all energy remnants were squeezed out.</p>
<p>Fear appeared on Zi Yao&rsquo;s charming face as sweat dampened her neck. A seven-colored God Light twirled around her to resist the eroding sunbeams. Her cheeks blushed like ripe apples, looking extremely inviting, making people want to bite her to ease their hunger.</p>
<p>Shi Yan faced up the sky, his visage frightened. However, he didn&rsquo;t know why he was so happy inwardly.</p>
<p>The Sun Original Essence looked like a burning crystal, just like the Star Original Essence he had seen. It was the essence of the Sun Heart, the fountain of the flaming energy of the sun.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t sure if this massive Essence Crystal was the entire core of the Sun that had exploded. However, he could confirm that the core of this Sun Original Essence must store some principles of the beginning and ascension of the sun!</p>
<p>He suddenly woke up. With a bright look in his eyes, he touched the glabella on his forehead.</p>
<p>A flame bloomed in his palm, running into the soul altar in his head. The soul altar then spun in his Sea of Consciousness. The Star Martial Spirit&rsquo;s mysterious Intent Domain suddenly sparkled in the second tier of the soul altar.</p>
<p>A scorching flame appeared in his soul altar. In the next moment, his entire body was covered in a frightening red flame. Shi Yan closed his eyes, as his body shook.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s host soul swayed in the highest tier of his soul altar. It seemed to become a large mirror that reflected that massive Sun Original Essence. The flaming sunbeam of the Sun Original Essence appeared in his soul. Each beam seemed to be transforming magically, as his God Soul swiftly marked them all.</p>
<p>Instinctively, he sat down cross-legged, not noticing Zi Yao&rsquo;s changed appearance. He held his breath and concentrated, using his God Soul to be the tentacles to touch the Sun Original Essence to transfer the mysteries hidden in the crystal.</p>
<p>His God Soul seemed to enter a scorching space where so many flaming crystals were moving swiftly. Between the crystals were many narrow gaps. They looked like a giant formation carved by God, which stimulated the energy of the crystals. They layered up and created a natural spiritual formation, which hid certain principles of Nature.</p>
<p>He had tested the magical connection between his Star Upanishad in the God Soul and the Sun when he was in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. When he was in the Grace Mainland, he used to fuse the power of the sun with the Star Martial Spirit. From that time, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to improve the Sun power. However, today, he was going to have a big opportunity!</p>
<p>The Star Upanishad included all the stars in the sky. The Sun was a Solar Star, and the Moon was a Moon Star; they were all considered stars. If he wanted to advance his Star Martial Spirit, understanding the mysteries and principles of the Solar Star and Moon Star was a step he needed to take.</p>
<p>This Upanishad contained the vast starry sky, with all stars in the sky being his objects to study. Since the Solar Star and the Moon Star were the two most important parts of the sky, they were the critical subjects he needed to comprehend little by little.</p>
<p>As his God Soul was reflecting the Sun Original Essence, his Soul Consciousness had unknowingly flooded to the Essence Crystal and explored it.</p>
<p>The Sun Original Essence was the core power of the Sun. This fountain of energy had been there, carrying the mysteries when the Sun was born and whenever it changed. If he could get just a bit of it, he could make his understanding of the Solar energy more profound, which would level up his Star Martial Spirit the second time.</p>
<p>Of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t let this chance slip away.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness flew inside the Sun Original Essence as Shi Yan concentrated to comprehend something. He looked at so many different sized crystals moving according to the principles of heaven and earth, creating a natural formation.</p>
<p>The crystals were constantly releasing an enormous energy. It was just like the heart of a fire; even if the crystals were draining out, it was still scorching hot!</p>
<p>In the sea of crystals, he could feel the power of fire and the heat of the Sun in his consciousness. This Sun Original Essence seemed to have a magical life. It liked and hated all creatures at the same time, which was very complicated.</p>
<p>He forgot the fierce battle of the heaven flames and his condition. He even forgot his goals and his Star Martial Spirit.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed in the Sun Original Essence and felt its emotions, its stories. He could feel the Sun&rsquo;s sorrow and feelings, its contribution to the world, and all it had done for the world. This world of emotions was something ordinary people would never be able to touch.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s perfect body was covered in a luxurious seven-colored God Light. Her glamour was too mesmerizing for all men. She was like a Goddess descending into this mortal world, floating in her sea of God Light.</p>
<p>However, her eyes were sparkling with astonishment at this moment.</p>
<p>Looking at the Sun Original Essence slowly floating up, she stooped to see Shi Yan sitting peacefully. Her dark brows furrowed. It felt like someone had thrown a stone into the tranquil lake in her heart, causing so many ripples to be generated.</p>
<p>She could feel a flow of soul aura belonging to him inside the Sun Original Essence after Shi Yan sat down and closed his eyes. At that moment, Zi Yao understood that Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness had gotten into the Sun Original Essence, which made it have his aura. He was acquiring the mysteries of the sun in the Sun Original Essence.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes were lit up; she was blushing from astonishment.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had so many mysteries that she hadn&rsquo;t discovered yet. The more she wanted to know about him, the more mysterious she found he was.</p>
<p>It was like a puzzling mist was covering Shi Yan all the time. This mist was dark and thick, blanketing his soul. It seemed that no one would ever be able to touch his soul and understand everything about him.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had a beam of anguish in her heart. She shook her head instinctively, thinking that this man from an unknown continent would rise the high tide in the Raging Flame Star Area in the near future, or, maybe he would even stir up some earth-shaking events.</p>
<p>This thought had no basis at all. In her eyes, was even a little funny.</p>
<p>After all, as of today, Shi Yan was still a True God Realm warrior, a low-status, pathetic warrior. Generally, he couldn&rsquo;t make any great change in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>However, she still had this thought. With his arrival, Shi Yan would make this Raging Flame Star Area turn over tremendously. He could even change the entire Raging Flame Star Area&rsquo;s general picture. At the same time, he could make so many experts excited or&hellip;fearful!</p>
<p>A scarlet flame quietly flew out from Shi Yan&rsquo;s pupils unknowingly.</p>
<p>When that flame appeared, it released a magical energy wave, as if it had a miraculous connection with the Sun Original Essence which was floating in the sky. All of a sudden, the Sun Original Essence in the sky started to tremble.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the Sun Original Essence shot out the purest and scorching sunbeams, pouring them into the center of that flame.</p>
<p>The flame then twisted, turning into a wonderful red flame. Inside that red flame, she could see the energy fluctuations of the remnants of Volcano Crystal Nucleus.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was shaken. A brilliant light sparkled in her beautiful eyes as they locked at that flame. After a while, she beamed a forced smile and then cursed in a low voice. &ldquo;B*stard! Still wanna fool me? Turns out you have another heaven flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, she was shaken again, her eyes getting dizzy.</p>
<p>The Sun Original Essence sent out two other flows of energy which spun round and round.</p>
<p>Two beams of refined sunlight were shot to the sky and the ground. One flung to the deep place in the sky, creating the connection with the Vermilion Bird True Flame, while the other descended from the sky, not aiming at the scarlet flame but Shi Yan, entering his heart.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao exclaimed in shock. She knew that Shi Yan had entered the Sun Original Essence and gotten a little of the sun&rsquo;s mysteries. That was why he could draw the solar energy to nurture his body.</p>
<p>After being stunned for a while, Zi Yao mumbled, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let you guys get all the good things&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched her forehead, as her soul altar rose. The second tier of her soul altar had the rainbow-colored light. It was so beautiful that it made all the other attractive sights pale in comparison. It was her main power Upanishad: The God Light Upanishad.</p>
<p>A small flame was dancing in the core of the rainbow. It seemed to have a living energy fluctuation resonating with her Soul Consciousness. It was then guided towards the Sun Original Essence hovering in the sky.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s God Soul distorted, continually releasing the Soul Consciousness. Gradually, a flow of pure flaming energy shot out and combined with many sunbeams that descended slowly, pouring into her rainbow-colored soul altar.</p>
<p>The Outer Space Upanishad had a similar effect on the heaven flames. God Light that moved unceasingly year around in outer space could eventually gain intellect as well.</p>
<p>Zi Yao used to collect a flow of similar God Light. Thanks to that God Light, she could comprehend the God Light Upanishad and create the soul sacrificial altar, along with the Seals of Upanishad in her God Soul.</p>
<p>Right now, she was using that flow of God Light to draw the blazing sunbeam to shine on her soul altar. Together with Shi Yan, the Earth Flame, and the Vermilion Bird True Flame, she was taking in the enormous power of the Sun Original Essence. This would improve her power and strengthen her soul altar.</p>
<p>Throwing a glance to Shi Yan sitting next to her, her beautiful eyes sparkled with a complicated thought, her lips shivering.</p>
<p>An idea popped up in her head.</p>
<p>A new &lsquo;Solar Star&rsquo; was rising in the Raging Flame Star Area. Its dazzling light would outshine all other people. They would be happy with his happiness. They would be sorrowful because of his sorrows. They would be excited because of his might!</p>
<p>Chapter 747: The Third Sky of True God Realm</p>
<p>Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field&hellip;</p>
<p>Floating in the center of a group of massive meteorolites were around one hundred tiger shark war chariots, trying to dodge the sunbeams there.</p>
<p>Energy storms were moving and slaughtering everywhere. Strong, distorted energy wandered about, threatening the space pirates on the war chariots. They didn&rsquo;t dare to intrude, as they just stayed and waited cautiously near the edge.</p>
<p>Standing on the leading war chariot was Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo, glaring at the space in front of them with bloodshot eyes. Suddenly, he pointed. &ldquo;Tie Lei, you guys go there and check it out.</p>
<p>The space pirate who was called out changed his face, shivering, and crying hoarsely. &ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s the Solar Star Forbidden Area!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your f*cking rubbish talk!&rdquo; Ka Tuo activated his God Domain. A seething energy wave flooded everywhere shortly. People in his God Domain&rsquo;s coverage were all shivering. &ldquo;Will ya get you&rsquo;re a*s there?&rdquo; He glared at that space pirate.</p>
<p>Under his infuriated roar, the warrior named Tie Lei changed his visage dramatically. He constantly nodded with a wry smile. The man didn&rsquo;t say anything else, dashing towards the place.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo snorted, his brutal eyes sweeping through his henchmen. He suddenly got angry, but he didn&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Cracking and explosion arose from the Solar Star Forbidden Area. The tiger shark war chariot Tie Lei riding was broken into pieces. Tie Lei screamed painfully as he was sitting in the chariot. His body was cut off into countless cubes, as if so many blades were slashing him.</p>
<p>The onlookers all felt a shiver sent down their spines. Deep anxiety arose in their hearts. They bowed their heads, no one daring to look at Ka Tuo.</p>
<p>Tie Lei&rsquo;s death wasn&rsquo;t beyond their estimation. However, they were petrified because it happened too fast!</p>
<p>This event had proven the terrifying features of the Solar Star Forbidden Area. Indeed, it could slaughter anything. Any life would be shattered on entering this place.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s eyes raked through his men again and again. No one dared to look at him. They all stooped their heads, pretending they had seen nothing.</p>
<p>Wearing a dark face, Ka Tuo didn&rsquo;t continue to push more pressure. He understood that if he continued to urge them, he would make their hearts cold.</p>
<p>Then, this force, which he had been struggling hard to gather, would collapse.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something he wanted to see.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo waved his hand impatiently and gave a dry instruction. &ldquo;Scatter and watch this area. Do not relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those space pirates felt like they just got amnesty, answering their boss as they scattered quickly.</p>
<p>In just a blink, there was no tiger shark war chariot next to him.</p>
<p>A flow of living energy was sent to him from a place where the sunbeams were interlacing. However, this energy fluctuation was so cold it could chill people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t found anything yet?&rdquo; A cold, gentle, and reserved voice arose. &ldquo;Ka Tuo, you&rsquo;ve ensured me that they won&rsquo;t leave the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field alive. I hope you can fulfill your promise! Otherwise, I think you know what your consequences will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo slightly stooped his head, as a gleam of fear sparkled in his bloodshot eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! I will achieve what I&rsquo;ve promised you. The Solar Star Forbidden Area has buried so many creatures. Any war chariot that enters that area will be ground into powder. I think they aren&rsquo;t an exception. Perhaps they are all dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they are dead, I want to see their bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it. I will watch this place until I can be sure that they are all dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, I don&rsquo;t have much time to linger here. You should open your eyes wider. If you get anything, tell me immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That living energy fluctuation faded out in the area where the sunbeams were interweaving. Eventually, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo lifted his head, looking at that place savagely while spitting. &ldquo;Damn it! What kind of toy is that! If I weren&rsquo;t greedy for your stuff, your daddy here would flee away. F*ck it! It&rsquo;s too bad this time. I haven&rsquo;t gotten anything but humiliation this time! F*CK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he left this place, approaching the edge of the Solar Star Forbidden Area. He contemplated, then released his Soul Consciousness further little by little.</p>
<p>After an unknown period, once he felt his Soul Consciousness was weakened, he vaguely felt a scorching aura.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was shaken. He continued to gather his Soul Consciousness and push it further persistently despite his exhausted spirit and consumed Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A tremendous vibration shot out from a deep place inside, as powerful as the explosion of the Solar Star.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s flow of Soul Consciousness was cut off instantly, his face pale.</p>
<p>However, he wasn&rsquo;t dispirited. It was quite weird that he seemed to be moved. A fiendish grin hung on the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;Still in there, indeed! I&rsquo;ll play big with you this time. I don&rsquo;t believe you won&rsquo;t get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The entire place inside was filled with fire.</p>
<p>The massive chunk of Sun Original Essence was spinning in the air. The flaming power accumulated inside that crystal was divided into four parts, pouring into Shi Yan, the Earth Flame, the Vermilion Bird True Flame, and Zi Yao respectively, turning into their blazing energies.</p>
<p>The flaming halo moving on that Sun Original Essence was getting dimmer gradually. The burning fluid on the crystal had also lost its energy slowly, turning into ordinary drops of water, falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Shi Yan and Zi Yao were sitting neatly on the ground, calmly taking in the hot power.</p>
<p>After an unknown period of time, Zi Yao woke up first and instinctively looked at the sky.</p>
<p>The Sun Original Essence wasn&rsquo;t so blazing anymore. It turned to look more like an ordinary meteorolite that could be seen anywhere in outer space. Seemed like its energy had been drawn out completely.</p>
<p>The Earth Flame had enlarged to a big flame floating in front of Shi Yan. The energy of the Volcano Crystal Nucleus was rippling from him, covering him with so many layers of flaming solar energy.</p>
<p>He was still digesting energy!</p>
<p>Some weak auras came from the sky, one of them belonging to the Vermilion Bird True Flame. Due to the similar aura she had, Zi Yao could feel it now. She faced the sky, astounded for a while, then turned to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was still motionless like a log of wood. No energy waves rippled from him. Even his aura was concealed.</p>
<p>However, as Zi Yao was using her Soul Consciousness to explore his soul, she could feel his soul altar moving unceasingly in a deep place in his soul.</p>
<p>She understood that Shi Yan was still trying to understand the solar mysteries. This magical encounter wasn&rsquo;t something he could simply wish for to encounter. Zi Yao was sure he would advance one step further after this event.</p>
<p>A triangular jade arose from her ring. She frowned while glaring at it, then muttered. &ldquo;It has been half a year. Time flies so fast. I didn&rsquo;t recognize it has been a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, she quieted down, taking out a Divine Crystal. Then, she closed her eyes and started to absorb the pure energy from it, together with some medicinal pellets she had. This would refill the energy she had consumed in the previous battle.</p>
<p>It was followed by another period of perpetual quietness.</p>
<p>On this day, flames sparked insanely in the sky above her head. The sky was the location of a tremendous event. Heaven flames appeared one by one, entangling and fighting against each other.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was surprised. She pulled herself together, frowning while looking at the sky.</p>
<p>Shortly, her eyes brightened. She hastened to walk to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>The Earth Flame had disappeared, staying silently inside Shi Yan&rsquo;s head. A soul energy was felt rippling from Shi Yan at this moment.</p>
<p>It seemed there were some filaments of soul energy that flew out of his head to support the heaven flames. Still, Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t had any changes. He knitted his brows while a scorching flow of energy gushed out of his chest, which astounded Zi Yao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle&rsquo;s about to end,&rdquo; Shi Yan suddenly muttered after a long period of silence. He opened his eyes, smiling brightly at her. &ldquo;You look good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes brightened. She smiled dazzlingly. &ldquo;Not as good as you though. My wounds are all healed, but my power hasn&rsquo;t been filled fully. And you, you&rsquo;ve entered the Third Sky of True God Realm. You&rsquo;re not far from the King God Realm, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan slowly got up, looking at the sky. &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;ve got a big harvest this time. Also, this experience has helped me understand the mysteries of the stars better. Turns out that the Star Upanishad includes the entire sky. The Solar Star and the Moon Star are two kinds of Star Upanishads. The flaming energy also brought me huge benefits. The understanding I&rsquo;ve got from the Sun will be useful for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the feeling of breaking through?&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled. She stood up, walking her slender body for one round and revealing heart appealing posture.</p>
<p>With a calm and relaxed countenance, and no heated gaze on his face, Shi Yan smiled. &ldquo;You are so appealing, such a beautiful disaster of this world.&rdquo; His face was calm and relaxed. &ldquo;I know so many men of the Raging Flame Star Area would love to have you in their dreams. Being with you for days and nights like this is truly my honor. I don&rsquo;t know how many people would risk their lives just for a moment like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes lit up, her smile unchanged. &ldquo;Cut it off. Too many people have praised me, so I&rsquo;m immune to it. Yeah, don&rsquo;t change the topic. How does it feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his arms, causing clusters of flaming energy to appear. A flow of fiercely hot aura diffused from his body. Shi Yan faced the sky while laughing crazily. &ldquo;Of course, not bad at all! Each time I break through a new realm, it&rsquo;s the time my soul altar and body are both quenched. Breaking through a new realm means rocketing my power. I think I&rsquo;ve earned a lot this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes gazed at his body. &ldquo;This time, you&rsquo;ve earned more energy than normal people! Due to the excessive energy you&rsquo;ve taken from the Sun Original Essence, you&rsquo;ve understood how the Sun moves. This will be a big help for you in the future. I&rsquo;m sure that with your condition, once you start to condense your God Body, it will be unimaginably smooth. Your God Body will be much stronger than any warrior I&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; Shi Yan just smiled but neither affirmed nor denied anything. He continued to look at the sky. &ldquo;Almost done. My buddies will come back successfully. Oh, right, how long have we been bewildered here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the time I got fainted, it&rsquo;s been one and a half year. Too fast, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One and a half year? Ah, too long! Anyway, it&rsquo;s okay. We didn&rsquo;t waste this period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found that even though I was a little bit unlucky going with you, I&rsquo;ve got my share of miraculous encounters.&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled sincerely. &ldquo;Although you are a disaster, you&rsquo;re also a lucky star. It depends on the point of view. Shi Yan, you must be famous in your continent, right? Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t have so many heaven flames like that. Tell me, how many sweethearts you&rsquo;ve had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was astounded, looking at her with a weird face. Then, he held ten fingers in front of her face. &ldquo;Too many, so I don&rsquo;t remember clearly. So? Do you want to be my beloved one too? Oh yeah, if you are persistent, and taking the fact that we&rsquo;ve been through dangers together into account, I can accept you begrudgingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was stunned. She angrily glared at him, gritting her teeth. &ldquo;A*shole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; Shi Yan laughed crazily, his laughter shooting up to the sky.</p>
<p>Chapter 748: Soul Nirvana</p>
<p>Amidst his laughter, flames appeared one by one in the sky, descending slowly.</p>
<p>The four heaven flames staying in his soul altar, the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, the Ice Cold Flame, and Corpse Vanishing Flame, appeared while flying towards him.</p>
<p>What appeared the last was an orange-red flame, as shy as a maiden. It looked like a bashful flaming bird, and couldn&rsquo;t act naturally. After the four heaven flames showed up in front of Shi Yan, it started to move towards him with great reluctance.</p>
<p>A toxic smile appeared on Shi Yan&rsquo;s face. He gazed at the flame and asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Still shy? Weren&rsquo;t you so loud and savage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harrumph! I&rsquo;m the most magical creature in this world. I&rsquo;m much more aristocratic than you lowly humans. If they didn&rsquo;t subdue me, I would never depend on you!&rdquo; The Vermilion Bird True Flame talked begrudgingly. &ldquo;Too bad, I didn&rsquo;t succeed but get tied with you. Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This flame&rsquo;s intelligence was higher than the other flames. It had emotions! This surprised Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Anyway, he got surprised for a short while and then smiled. &ldquo;Aristocratic? The aristocratic class flames like you are hiding in my soul altar. They won&rsquo;t leave even if I ask them to leave. If you are truly noble, you won&rsquo;t get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame seemed to be enraged. &ldquo;I know you are a fair host. That&rsquo;s why I agreed to put my feet in your soul altar. If you insult me, I won&rsquo;t get in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your character is quite impressive,&rdquo; Shi Yan grinned, not caring about the flame&rsquo;s anger. &ldquo;Alright, you stay right here. The Sun Original Essence is gone. After I get out, I will spread the news that there&rsquo;s a heaven flame in this area. People will come and play with you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B*stard!&rdquo; The Vermilion Bird True Flame thundered.</p>
<p>Waving his hand lazily, Shi Yan spoke impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. I don&rsquo;t care if you want to stay here. Anyway, my soul altar doesn&rsquo;t just only one heaven flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid! What do you get angry for? Afraid that you will be mistreated?&rdquo; The Ice Cold Flame said. &ldquo;We reserved a slot for you because of the inheritance. If you met a guy like the World Extinguishing Thunder Flame, he would swallow you for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t babble and be proactive. When you get into the soul altar, you will know how you&rsquo;ll benefit.&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame was a little discontented. &ldquo;Battling with you has drained our energy. We have to restore our power as fast as possible. If you aren&rsquo;t satisfied with your lot, harrumph, I&rsquo;m not afraid of devouring you. Muahaha&hellip; You can help me ascend fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing that, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame also revealed its strong desire.</p>
<p>The lonely Vermilion Bird True Flame was besieged by the four flames. As its energy was consumed tremendously, it became anxious. &ldquo;Four on one! Don&rsquo;t you feel any shame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not bad. Have you seen five on one yet?&rdquo; The Corpse Vanishing Flame sparkled. &ldquo;We still have another one. He&rsquo;s in his evolution process. Otherwise, you would be over earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame suddenly behaved as if it had finally accepted its destiny, keeping silent. After swaying in the air for a while, it flew towards Shi Yan&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Shi Yan held up his hand. His flickered his thought, retrieving his soul altar. &ldquo;I want to make it clear first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao frowned, eyeing the five heaven flames. She could feel the soul fluctuations of Shi Yan and the heaven flames, but she couldn&rsquo;t know what they were walking about. As she was so curious, she released more of her Soul Consciousness. But still, she got nothing.</p>
<p>The communication between Shi Yan and his heaven flames were conducted using their souls. Unless Shi Yan and the heaven flames agreed to open their souls to her, she would never know the contents of their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Vermilion Bird True Flame put up it guard, trying to urge a beam of energy. Swaying in front of Shi Yan, it released the burning energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; asked Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sensed the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s aura, so I had crossed a lot of obstacles to get here from my hometown.&rdquo; The Vermilion Bird True Flame hesitated for a long time before answering reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What attracted you here? And, the Vermilion Bird buried here, did it die completely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here for the Sacred Body of the Vermilion Bird, which could help me advance further. However, when I arrived here, I found that his Sacred Body had no energy left. I couldn&rsquo;t fuse with him. I hid the Sun Original Essence under the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton in the hope that his Sacred Body could gain the energy from the crystal. But, it was of no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ascended after you got here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One level. The condition here is suitable for me. Also, I could use the Sun Original Essence to increase my power. If I could have the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s Sacred Body, I could become the Vermilion Bird and replace him. At that time, my living form would be more complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be., but not anymore. At the moment I gained my consciousness, my way became different from his. I don&rsquo;t want to become a part of his soul. I want to make efforts for myself. I want to live for me, not for him. Moreover, he has died already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Died already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To existences like him, it&rsquo;s hard to die completely. He destroyed all the attackers, created the forbidden area in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, and built a tremendous energy restriction to protect his skeleton from people&rsquo;s discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because when his soul scattered, it divided into several flows. No one knows which space they&rsquo;ve gone to. However, any creature who could have the remnants of his soul could understand the power of the Vermilion Bird. One day, if it could reach a certain level, it could be reborn. As long as he could get his skeleton, he would be reborn using a different method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan knitted his brows tightly in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the level of the Sacred Beast Vermilion Bird, the soul would never be completely destroyed. At the moment it exploded, it would divide into so many flows of remnant souls, wandering in different spaces. If a creature captured one of those flows, it could always evolve and get stronger. After that, the sacred bird would gain a new life one more time. If he could get his skeleton, when he was reborn, he would be himself once again. Perhaps, he could recover his full energy. Moreover, he could advance one more step to understand the mysteries of earth and heaven deeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame sent its thought. It seemed this flame had some knowledge of creatures in the Immemorial Epoch. Shi Yan was dumbstruck. He felt fear as he was shaken by the might of the creatures in the Immemorial Epoch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh right, the little girl you&rsquo;ve met in the Perpetual Night Forest, the one called Zuo Shi, if nothing unexpected happens, she certainly has a soul remnant of the Sacred Beast Black Tortoise. If she can continue to progress and get stronger, she can become the Sacred Beast Black Tortoise one day. Perhaps, she will be stronger than the Black Tortoise himself!&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame suddenly recalled something. It pondered for a while and then continued.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was shaken, shouting. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me earlier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it from the talk with the Vermilion Bird True Flame. This method of rebirth is called the Soul Nirvana of the sacred beast,&rdquo; said the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with light in astonishment. He got dumbstruck for a while, then finally understood why Old Xuan Ming wanted to take care of Zuo Shi. For Zuo Shi&rsquo;s welfare, he had done his best.</p>
<p>Xuan Ming was the descendant of that bloodline. The Sacred Beast Black Tortoise was his ancestor. As Zuo Shi had a flow of his ancestor&rsquo;s soul remnant, she could be considered his ancestor. As he had put fort everything to help her, did he know the Soul Nirvana technique which he would use Zuo Shi to make the Sacred Beast Black Tortoise be reborn?</p>
<p>Before Sacred Beast Black Tortoise left the Grace Mainland, it was one of the strongest existences. Like the Vermilion Bird, why did he have to experience the Soul Nirvana?</p>
<p>Did they encounter a more intimidating existence?</p>
<p>Shi Yan sighed with inexplicable emotion. Suddenly, he had a respect and fear for the unpredictable mysteries of outer space.</p>
<p>There were so many experts in outer space. Although he&rsquo;d reached the Third Sky of True God Realm, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to counter anything. As his thought flickered, his eyes sparkled with amazement.</p>
<p>He suddenly walked to the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton. He knocked the bones, turning to Zi Yao while smiling. &ldquo;Do you have any way to bring the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo; Zi Yao was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make weapons!&rdquo; Shi Yan was excited, gesturing. &ldquo;This bird should have a profound realm. If we can make weapons using its bones, they will be Divine weapons! I&rsquo;ve lost my three Bone Thorns. Perhaps, I can use this skeleton to create a better weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Vermilion Bird True Flame suddenly screamed, its soul sounding sorrowful. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my body! My body! You can&rsquo;t break it! Absolutely, you must not break it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you and he are totally different?&rdquo; Shi Yan glared at the flame. &ldquo;The Vermilion Bird is dead. Leaving the skeleton here is just a waste of good materials. I&rsquo;d better take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! If you do that, I will risk my life against you! Even if I have to die completely, I will stop you!&rdquo; the Vermilion Bird True Flame cried loudly. &ldquo;Leve the skeleton. One day, he can have a new life and mightier power. Even if I&rsquo;m not him, I don&rsquo;t want him to vanish completely. Agree with me. If you give up this skeleton, I will follow you honestly. I will never resist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, the Vermilion Bird True Flame desperately begged him. &ldquo;Please, show mercy. I&rsquo;ve been in outer space for so many years. I know some places with similarly mighty skeletons. I promise you, I will definitely find them for you! I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubbing his chin, Shi Yan contemplated for a while. Eventually, he gave up his intentions, then nodded and talked to the flame. &ldquo;Forget it! As we will stay together for a long time and you&rsquo;ve begged me that much, I&rsquo;ll give you face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame sighed in relief. This time, it wasn&rsquo;t arrogant or stubborn. The flame flew into his Sea of Consciousness without waiting for Shi Yan to urge it.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t continue to trouble the flame either. He smiled, then opened his soul altar, letting the five heaven flames enter.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sensed for a while and felt like his soul getting sublimated. A flow of warm and cozy energy flooded his entire body as he smiled happily. &ldquo;I think we should leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded, scanning the area with a little yearning in her eyes. &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s time to go. Although this place is barren and isolated, I will never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Shi Yan shouted, soaring into the sky and heading to the thick, gray clouds.</p>
<p>Zi Yao followed him as she smiled charmingly and swayed her appealing body. Just like a deity returning home, she looked indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>Chapter 749: Chaos Upanishad</p>
<p>Layers of thick, dark clouds had created a magical, heavenly barrier. The gravity increased dozens of times. The closer they got to the sky, the stronger the gravity became.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s power had been recovered well, so it was easy for her to get through the clouds using her God Domain. However, it was tough for Shi Yan. Every step he made to move in the sky had consumed a lot of energy.</p>
<p>At this moment, Vermilion Bird True Flame in his soul altar suddenly emitted a magical energy wave. That energy wave contacted the thick clouds in the sky. In the next moment, the tremendous gravity that covered the entire place was reduced by several times.</p>
<p>Shi Yan soared up to the sky even faster than Zi Yao. When he got to outer space, a magical vortex appeared atop his head. It was the vortex that had dragged him into that bleak land.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame flew out. Right when it fell into the eye of the vortex, the latter stopped moving. It didn&rsquo;t generate a strong suction force anymore.</p>
<p>As the flame and the Vermilion Bird used to be one, it was familiar with the barriers and restrictions the bird had set up. Under the flame&rsquo;s power, all the energy barriers and vortexes ceased.</p>
<p>Shi Yan could fly smoothly out of the eye of the vortex. Shortly, he appeared in the forbidden area of the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. He didn&rsquo;t hasten to leave as he hovered and waited in the sky. Slowly, Zi Yao appeared and flew towards him, floating shoulder to shoulder with him.</p>
<p>Energy vortexes and storms screamed around them. However, the Vermilion Bird True Flame had made them all cease, unable to move around and wreak havoc anymore.</p>
<p>That was why they didn&rsquo;t meet any obstacles on the way out of the land. With the Vermilion Bird True Flame&rsquo;s aid, they got out of the Solar Star Forbidden Area, flying between the burning meteorolites.</p>
<p>Those burning meteorolites were the pieces of the sun after it exploded. They still had a little bit of the Sun Original Essence. However, due to absorbing so many pieces of chipped rock and debris in outer space, the energy had been polluted. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t absorb this dirty energy. He could only use the Star Upanishad to create a feeble contact with them.</p>
<p>However, even though this connect was feeble, it was enough for him as long as it could bring him support when he was in need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; Zi Yao tenderly called him. Her face became cold immediately. &ldquo;Ka Tuo&rsquo;s still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, instinctively releasing his Soul Consciousness. Flows of Soul Consciousness scattered, pouring into the burning meteorolites around them.</p>
<p>Meteorolites connected to him moved slowly, congregating towards him.</p>
<p>Tiger shark war chariots appeared from different corners. Ka Tuo with his shiny bald head was standing on the leading chariot. He couldn&rsquo;t hold his laughter. &ldquo;You two have finally come out. I knew it. It&rsquo;s impossible to hide in there for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So wise, my Boss!&rdquo; Many space pirates faced the sky and laughed out loud. They were all excited thinking that their wait wasn&rsquo;t wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Tuo, you&rsquo;re a haunting ghost that never vanishes.&rdquo; Zi Yao spoke with a dark face and a pair of cold eyes. &ldquo;What is it that the other has promised you which makes you wait here for so long? Ka Tuo, why do you suddenly have plenty of time like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness, you&rsquo;ve become smarter. I like you even more.&rdquo; Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo&rsquo;s grin seemed to last forever. &ldquo;Oh yeah, the benefit the other has promised me is something I can hardly deny. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t need to keep my eye on you guys. I hope you would be smarter. Your amethyst war chariot is broken, so you can&rsquo;t escape today. You should be honest and follow me. As long as you can satisfy me, muahaha, perhaps I will keep you alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare to keep me alive, the other will kill you. Ka Tuo, making up such a thing in front of me, don&rsquo;t you feel it&rsquo;s too boring?&rdquo; Zi Yao snorted, looking here and there. &ldquo;I think you guys better leave earlier. Or else, you will regret taking this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; Ka Tuo laughed crazily. &ldquo;Your Highness, you&rsquo;re too innocent. If I dare to walk on this way, I have never thought that I can die naturally. If I can live one day, I want to earn more for that day. To me, even if my fate is set, I will strongly resist and find a way to survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Ka Tuo shouted, &ldquo;Kill them! Whoever dares to show them mercy, Daddy will bury him altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he finished, the crowd of space pirates became crazy, wildly storming forward.</p>
<p>Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t talk more, releasing her God Domain, her eyes turning serious. Seven-colored rainbow bloomed from her soft body, covering the whole area.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood firmly. Suddenly, he grinned while talking to her. &ldquo;Just pay attention to Ka Tuo. Leave the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Zi Yao was stunned as her beautiful eyes gazed at him. &ldquo;Are you sure? Although you&rsquo;ve reached the Third Sky of True God Realm, do you think that you can gain the upper hand against King God Realm warriors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t try, we won&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled, &ldquo;Your Highness, have you ever heard about a method called &lsquo;Four ounces yield one thousand catties&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Zi Yao shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan stopped smiling. He gathered himself together, touching his forehead. Scorching flames diffused from him like countless rapid meteors dashing towards the burning meteorolites around him.</p>
<p>Instantly, the flaming meteorolites were revived, turning into fireballs, flying and colliding everywhere. They rumblingly rushed towards the space pirates.</p>
<p>Each burning meteorolite was extremely massive. Some of them still had bits of the Sun Original Essence. After absorbing numerous pieces of rock and debris, they became quite intimidating, moving in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>Burning meteorolites moved by some principles of Nature. With the vivid red hue, they looked like dancing red lanterns, furiously attacking the space pirates.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s subordinates pitched their voices and cursed. Once the flaming meteorolites collided with them, the flaming fluid on the menacing meteorolite would splash on them. They cried painfully while smoke fumed and sizzled on their God Bodies.</p>
<p>Floating quietly in the cold outer space, Shi Yan wore a cold, dark face. Flows of pure flaming solar energy shot out rapidly between his fingers, creating the connection with the meteorolites around him.</p>
<p>It seemed like invisible gossamers were connecting his fingers and the meteorolites, which could manipulate the massive, burning rock to stir and wreak havoc in the middle of the crowd of pirates.</p>
<p>Many pirates at the True God Realm, who hadn&rsquo;t gained a God Body yet, and had a realm that wasn&rsquo;t profound enough, had to spit out blood when the meteorolites hit them. Their blood was then burned into ashes by the flaming fluid, as their living aura vanished shortly.</p>
<p>Only warriors at the King God Realm could dodge in distress. When the flaming fluid touched them, they could resist for a while, using their tough God Bodies.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had used the power of only one warrior and the unique situation of the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field to manipulate the flaming meteorolites by his Star Martial Spirit, creating a magical sea of meteorolites, which torrentially crushed the space pirates.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked at him deeply. After a long moment, she smiled. &ldquo;Turns out it&rsquo;s what you call &lsquo;four ounces yield one thousand catties.&rsquo; I can understand it now. As you&rsquo;ve comprehended the Sun Upanishad, you used the energy taken from the Sun Original Essence to connect with the meteorolites. You&rsquo;re excellent! I didn&rsquo;t misjudge you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul control, the meteorolite sea was unbreakable. A part of the pirate group was killed by the flaming meteorolites, while the other King God Realm warriors were flying around like flies. They couldn&rsquo;t pose a threat to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>His defense seemed to be indestructible.</p>
<p>Zi Yao could ease her mind. As she took a deep breath, the God Light twirled and expanded gradually from her body. A burning flame also extended from her God Domain. Added with her Soul Consciousness, this wisp of flame vaguely locked Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo wore a savage countenance. He had released his God Domain for a long time. Remnants of energies, debris, and pieces of corpses were dragged into his God Domain while chaotic energy fluctuations appeared.</p>
<p>A chaotic aura emitted from Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Body in the middle of his God Domain. His eyes became bloodshot. He roared as he was ready to storm forward.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes shrank. He became tense and cautious.</p>
<p>However, right at this moment, a rainbow light sparked on his Blood Vein Ring. It flashed then disappeared, as if it had intruded Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Domain.</p>
<p>The rainbow was like a small rope, taking a walk inside Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Domain as if it were surveying something. A moment later, a feeble thought was sent to Shi Yan from the ring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Upanishad inherited from Ge Lu. Subdue him and make him your first Cortege. His Upanishad isn&rsquo;t pure enough. Detour&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to impart you the earlier period of Ge Lu&rsquo;s Upanishad. You should entice him and make him follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aura of the Ring Spirit in the Blood Vein Ring was too feeble. If Shi Yan weren&rsquo;t cautious, he couldn&rsquo;t have felt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Ge Lu?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised. He hastened to send his thought to the ring. &ldquo;How are you? How have you restored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to recover. I can only send you a bit of consciousness. Every time I talk to you, I have to consume energy. Don&rsquo;t talk about the irrelevant topics. I will impart you Ge Lu&rsquo;s Upanishad inheritance. Use it to entice him, and make him follow you. This inherited Upanishad can help him get back on the right path. However, if he wants to break through to the Original God Realm, I need to adjust the power one more time. Imparting the Upanishad to you will harm me. I will be quiet for a long time. Be careful. Don&rsquo;t let the others kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought of the Ring Spirit flashed. In the next moment, a magical soul fluctuation flew directly to Shi Yan&rsquo;s Sea of Consciousness. &ldquo;Ge Lu is one of the Bloodthirsty&rsquo;s Cortege of Eight. Chaos Upanishad is his main Upanishad. Use your negative energy to cover it and hand it to the other&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imparting Unpanishad seemed to consume a lot of energy. The Ring Spirit&rsquo;s aura became weaker and weaker. Even though it hadn&rsquo;t explained clearly, it disappeared. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t sense it again, no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was startled. He didn&rsquo;t have the time to think more, urging the negative energy in his acupuncture points and guiding it to his Sea of Consciousness. He had to use the negative energy to cover that flow of soul fluctuation to preserve it.</p>
<p>That flow of soul fluctuation seemed to have the aura of a magical Upanishad. It was like a strange soul sacrificial altar. After the negative energy had covered it, looked like it had a veil that made Shi Yan unable to see things clearly.</p>
<p>One of the Bloodthirsty&rsquo;s Cortege of Eight&hellip; Chaos Upanishad&hellip;</p>
<p>Thoughts appeared one by one in his head. Shi Yan was dumbstruck. Shortly, he seemed to get something as his eyes lit up.</p>

<p>Chapter 750: Call me senior!</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly turned around and shouted to Zi Yao. &ldquo;You should leave first. I will catch up with you later. I will make all the burning meteorolites explode. It will create a formidable shockwave. Except for me who understands the Sun Upanishad, all people here will be affected. You will not be an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was frightened. &ldquo;You want to fight face to face with Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo? Impossible! You will never be able to hurt him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. He&rsquo;s at the Third Sky of King God Realm. I&rsquo;m a whole realm behind him. I know I&rsquo;m not his rival.&rdquo; Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t have the mood to joke. &ldquo;I will stop him for a while and show him how dangerous I am. Once the shockwave&rsquo;s over, you can return and help me. But, you have to leave now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes were complicated. She looked at him deeply in astonishment for seconds. Then, she nodded. &ldquo;Shi Yan, promise me that you&rsquo;ll be safe. I don&rsquo;t want anything unexpected to happen to you. Really, I want you to be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled and said, &ldquo;Move. I&rsquo;ll be alright. Give me more time. Perhaps&hellip; I can bring you a big surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao exhaled. &ldquo;Alright, I will leave. Be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t an indecisive woman. As she was able to hold a high position of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, the generation with the most outstanding fame that her nimbus could subdue many princes, it was enough to prove her competency and characteristics.</p>
<p>Zi Yao retreated, turning into a flow of seven-colored light. Shortly, she had moved pretty far away.</p>
<p>At this moment, the other space pirates didn&rsquo;t dare to approach. Only Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo was still storming towards Shi Yan like crazy with his God Domain. He wanted to kill Shi Yan and then chase after Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Seeing Ka Tuo stride angrily and get closer to him, Shi Yan had so many thoughts moving in his head. He was discreetly nervous, as he didn&rsquo;t know if what the Ring Spirit had told him was true or not. Would he be able to wake Ka Tuo up using the Upanishad inheritance?</p>
<p>Gradually, Ka Tuo was only one thousand meters away from him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s thought flickered, and countless flaming meteorolites abruptly congregated around him. Shortly, the area around him was filled with flaming meteorolites, blocking Shi Yan and Ka Tuo in the middle. The others couldn&rsquo;t see them right now.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s God Domain was special. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be weakened by the tremendous impacts of the burning meteorolites. Moreover, the fragments of meteorolites were dragged into his God Domain, becoming a beam of scattered energy Ka Tuo could use, which boosted his aura formidably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, my God Domain&rsquo;s the most special one in the Raging Flame Star Area. Do you think you can stop me?&rdquo; Ka Tuo roared indignantly with a pair of blood-red eyes. His aura was both brutal and savage, that sent shivers down to people&rsquo;s spines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Tuo, the power Upanishad you&rsquo;ve been cultivating has diverged from the right path. The inheritance you got isn&rsquo;t complete. Your inheritance is called &lsquo;Chaos Upanishad,&rsquo; do you know that?&rdquo; Shi Yan calmly looked at him and then smiled. &ldquo;I asked Zi Yao to leave and kept your people away so that we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo discolored as if he had seen a ghost, looking at Shi Yan with fright. &ldquo;What did you just say? Repeat it. What&rsquo;s my Upanishad called? Repeat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaos Upanishad,&rdquo; Shi Yan repeated faintly.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s eyes sparkled disbelievingly. His savage aura silently reduced as he still maintained a certain distance with Shi Yan. He shivered in thrill. &ldquo;You&hellip; How did you know the name of my Upanishad? Who are you? How are you related to that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was dumbstruck. However, he felt cheered up. &ldquo;Ka Tuo, the power Upanishad you&rsquo;ve been cultivating is related to me. If you are cultivating the Upanishad you received from him, we are going on the same way. Relax, then we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was still shaking. His eyes were filled with extreme surprise and fear. &ldquo;My Upanishad has never appeared in the Raging Flame Star Area. How did you know about it? I took this Upanishad from the Lonesome Dead Territory outside the Raging Flame Star Area. Have you ever been there? How did you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mood wasn&rsquo;t calm, as if he had encountered a frightening surprise. His voice became louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet down,&rdquo; Shi Yan frowned and snorted.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was startled. He had to adjust his breath to calm down. A long time later, a strange light sparkled in his eyes, looking at Shi Yan with a great surprise. &ldquo;Who are you? Where are you from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you urge your Upanishad, your eyes will turn blood-red, right?&rdquo; An idea popped up in his head. Shi Yan asked the other all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was shaken and became more frightened. &ldquo;You also know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan curled his lips and urged his Rampage. His eyes immediately changed to the fearful blood-red hue.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was dumbstruck, and his boiling mood settled down. He looked at Shi Yan deeply and then nodded. &ldquo;Perhaps, you and I share the same root. However, I&rsquo;m not that man&rsquo;s disciple. I just got his inheritance. He was dead a long time ago, so my inheritance isn&rsquo;t complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was still young, he was just a Sky Realm space pirate. He had followed his boss to run to the Lonesome Dead Territory outside the Raging Flame Star Area, where he had a fortunate encounter.</p>
<p>A strange force had guided him to a mysterious and bizarre area. He found a decayed skeleton there. This skeleton was so old that its soul altar had just a beam of faint light, with a thought of a broken Upanishad.</p>
<p>He then merged that broken thought of Upanishad into his soul and put forth everything to study. It took him a lot of time to understand the mysteries of the Upanishad. However, this Upanishad had never appeared in the Raging Flame Star Area before.</p>
<p>Although this Upanishad was incomplete, he took this chance and made it his main power to cultivate to the True God Realm. Also, he had created the Seal of Upanishad to continue advancing his realm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d been so many years. He had used this incomplete Upanishad to shine in the Raging Flame Star Area and replace his Boss, becoming the new leader of the space pirates.</p>
<p>Although it was a broken Upanishad, he had treasured it a lot. Through many years of learning and comprehending, he had found that this Upanishad was so profound that it was almost one of the most dangerous powers Upanishad in the universe. It was even more advanced and exquisite than the powers Upanishad of the other leaders in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>This was Ka Tuo&rsquo;s biggest secret, which he had never revealed to anyone. This power Upanishad had made him a leader from a low pirate, giving him his today&rsquo;s attainments.</p>
<p>However, as his realm had become more profound, the incomplete features of the power Upanishad became clearer. Gradually, it had affected his mentality and soul. Everything was getting chaotic.</p>
<p>He became worried. Up till recently, he had been looking for a solution. However, since it was a power Upanishad that had never existed in the Raging Flame Star Area, no matter how hard he had searched, he couldn&rsquo;t find the way out.</p>
<p>As he had entered the Third Sky of King God Realm, the incomplete power Upanishad would trouble him a lot when he entered the Original God Realm. His soul altar could be shattered while he was breaking through his new realm!</p>
<p>As he knew it would be dangerous, he didn&rsquo;t dare to break through or dig deeper about his Upanishad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You power Upanishad isn&rsquo;t complete. Also, you&rsquo;ve diverged. If you can&rsquo;t have a complete Upanishad, you will never be able to break through the Original God Realm. You shouldn&rsquo;t go against the Nature&rsquo;s Order, which will destroy your soul.&rdquo; Shi Yan looked at him, suddenly beamed a smile. &ldquo;However, if you can have a complete Upanishad after you enter the new realm, you will be one of the small number of strongest warriors of the Raging Flame Star Area. If you and the others have the same realm, you can trounce them easily. You don&rsquo;t know how lucky you are. Encountering me is the luckiest event in your whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan talked as if he were a hoax medium, guiding the other step by step. He threatened and then showed the big benefits to entice the other.</p>
<p>Looking at Ka Tuo&rsquo;s visage, Shi Yan believed that he wouldn&rsquo;t pose any threat to him anymore, since he had something Ka Tuo couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he? Who are you?&rdquo; Ka Tuo&rsquo;s breath became short and heavy. He panted, trying to calm down.</p>
<p>Since he had cultivated this broken Upanishad for so many years, he knew the formidable features of this Upanishad more than anyone else. He believed that the complete version of this Upanishad would be the most fearful thing in the Raging Flame Star Area. He craved for it! This heated thought filled his brain, burning his rationality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my precursor. I&rsquo;m the apprentice of one line. The Upanishad you&rsquo;ve been cultivating, I have the complete one,&rdquo; Shi Yan said smilingly.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo suddenly grinned fiendishly. &ldquo;Then, it&rsquo;s good. If I kill you, I&rsquo;ll get the complete Upanishad. When I use it and break through to the Original God Realm, I will fear no one in this Raging Flame Star Area. Hahaha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s that simple?&rdquo; Shi Yan soon knew how this sort of people worked. &ldquo;If you could kill me to get what you want, would I stay here and babble with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Shi Yan continued deliberately. &ldquo;Sorry, mate. Even if you kill me, you can&rsquo;t have the complete inheritance. Because&hellip; it stays in my Sea of Consciousness. If I die, it will vanish. Only my energy could preserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo mused. He also knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be simple. He said that just to see Shi Yan&rsquo;s reaction. If Shi Yan showed he was scared, he could do that. If Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t react, it meant the other wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him or losing his life.</p>
<p>He observed for a while and made a new assumption immediately. Ka Tuo took a deep breath to steady his mind. &ldquo;Kid, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please call me senior. My status is higher than yours,&rdquo; Shi Yan naturally fabricated.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo&rsquo;s face reddened, looking enraged. However, to get the complete inheritance, he had to press it down. With a husky voice, he called, &ldquo;Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright. Since you&rsquo;ve cultivated his Upanishad, we are from the same school. Killing and fighting have violated our rules.&rdquo; Shi Yan grinned. &ldquo;Alright, I don&rsquo;t want to do anything to you. We&rsquo;re from the same house. You called me senior, which has proven our root. It&rsquo;s normal if I give you a gift for our first encounter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, his thought flickered, using negative energy to cover the magical Upanishad, sending it towards Ka Tuo. &ldquo;It will help you get back on the right track and prevent you from falling into bedevilment. However, before you break through the Original God Realm, you have to find me. Or else, you will meet a lot of troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was shivering in thrill as his eyes brightened. His gaze was even hotter when he saw Princess Zi Yao. Looking at the inherited Upanishad, he hated that he couldn&rsquo;t swallow it right away.</p>
<p>Chapter 751: Repel the enemy!</p>
<p>The Upanishad inheritance shot out of Shi Yan&rsquo;s Sea of Consciousness, slowly floating towards Ka Tuo. Ka Tuo&rsquo;s eyes were so hot, yet he was a little bit hesitant as well. Eventually, he released his soul altar.</p>
<p>His soul altar covered the Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s negative energy covering the inheritance vanished immediately right when the Upanishad merged into the power Upanishad tier of Ka Tuo&rsquo;s soul altar, becoming part of his soul altar.</p>
<p>Chaotic energy fluctuations twirled around Ka Tuo. His body shook vehemently while he was sensing the Upanishad, adding it into his soul altar and making it his unique Seal of Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shi Yan let out light laughter. The way he looked at Ka Tuo didn&rsquo;t have any evil intention.</p>
<p>When adding the power Upanishad, the warrior would need to release his soul altar and condense his soul, spirit, and thought into one. He shouldn&rsquo;t let any external force disturb him during the whole process.</p>
<p>At this moment, if Shi Yan struck a fatal strike, even if Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo had reached the Third Sky of King God Realm, he would receive severe wounds.</p>
<p>As long as he wanted to attack Ka Tuo, even if Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo could survive, he would be hurt badly. Perhaps he would never have the chance to enter the Original God Realm for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>But Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t want to attack Ka Tuo.</p>
<p>To him, the Blood Vein Ring still concealed a big secret that he had just entered the threshold of. It would take a long time to open it fully.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo received the inheritance of the Chaos Upanishad by Ge Lu, one of Bloodthirsty&rsquo;s Cortege of Eight.</p>
<p>As Ge Lu was one member of the Bloodthirsty&rsquo;s Cortege of Eight, he must be a powerful expert. Shi Yan was scared thinking how this almost-invincible existence died.</p>
<p>Since Ge Lu was related to that man, perhaps he would become a sharp weapon in Shi Yan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Of course, he would never destroy his weapon.</p>
<p>Shortly, Ka Tuo seemed to finish adding the Upanishad into his soul altar. His soul altar swayed slightly, then returned to his Sea of Consciousness, the energy fountain of his soul.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ka Tuo opened his eyes, taking a deep breath. An extreme joy bloomed in his heart as he looked at Shi Yan with great astonishment. &ldquo;You just gave me the inheritance like that? No conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan grinned, &ldquo;My brother, we&rsquo;re from the same school, so I won&rsquo;t harm you. This inheritance belongs to you. If you get it, you should continue to cultivate. I can relax now. If you please, just tell me who asked you to attack me&hellip; And, don&rsquo;t chase us furthermore. Is it okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. He pondered for a while and then suddenly asked. &ldquo;Senior, why do you only have the True God Realm cultivation base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too young. Although I was enrolled earlier, my cultivation time hasn&rsquo;t been long enough.&rdquo; Shi Yan continued to fabricate his story. &ldquo;As you call me your senior, we&rsquo;re considered classmates. When you&rsquo;ve entered the Original God Realm, I will tell you things related to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you and I join hand to capture Zi Yao. I have always dreamt of having her. Anyway, if brother wants her, as your junior, I can give up what I want.&rdquo; A cunning gleam sparkled in Ka Tuo&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;If we capture Zi Yao, I can receive big benefits. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s better to go with me than with that little girl? Although we don&rsquo;t have a good reputation for being space pirates, we don&rsquo;t have any restrictions. We can do whatever we want. How free is that! What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirates?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised. Then, he shook his head smilingly. &ldquo;Always hiding to West or East, it&rsquo;s not what I want. I don&rsquo;t care if you want to be a space pirate, but I won&rsquo;t do that. I have my goals. I have stuff I have to get done. Your crew has enough members, so I won&rsquo;t be one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo frowned while contemplating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should hurry to adjust your Upanishad, getting it back on the right track. So, I suggest you be content with your lot, quiet down, and find a place where people can&rsquo;t find you to solve your problem first,&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to talk more, I won&rsquo;t force you. We will talk later. Once you strengthen your realm and feel you want to break through to the Original God Realm, remember to find me. We will talk at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Shi Yan seemed not to want to talk more. He turned around and left.</p>
<p>Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo looked at him with astonishment. Seeing him about to leave, with Shi Yan having flown out already, he shouted in a low tone. &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan turned his back, looking at him smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ones who hired me included Miss Bi Rou of the Underworld League and Sura of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.&rdquo; Ka Tuo snorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to repay your favor, Senior. My business is done here. I will leave right away. Brother, be careful. Sura&rsquo;s attack won&rsquo;t end here. Even if we leave, he will continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sura?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, Princess Zi Yao surely knows him. Tell her and she will know who wants to kill her.&rdquo; Ka Tuo pondered for a while and then continued, &ldquo;That Princess isn&rsquo;t a good person. Brother, be careful. Don&rsquo;t give her a chance to kill you. Many strong experts in the Raging Flame Star Area follow her because of her beauty. However, most of them don&rsquo;t have a nice ending. You should take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded and smiled. &ldquo;Thank you for your reminder. Ah, by the way, what should I do if I want to contact you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ka Tuo hesitated for a while and then took out a blue-sky crystal from his ring. That crystal was carved with a magical formation and a beam of moving Chaos energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made it myself. When you want to find me, give it to a guy named Ka Fu in the Land of God Punishment. He&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo; Ka Tuo threw him the stone. &ldquo;But, you&rsquo;d better not let the others see it. Don&rsquo;t bring trouble to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Land of God Punishment? Where is it?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Princess Zi Yao. She must know about it.&rdquo; Ka Tuo didn&rsquo;t talk more. He turned around and left, as if he was hastening to reconcile his new Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shortly, Ka Tuo disappeared. Shi Yan scattered the burning meteorolites. Not long afterward, he saw the tiger shark war chariots disappear one by one.</p>
<p>Ka Tuo was a man who repaid favor. He left a tiger shark war chariot there for Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan pondered for a while, flying out of the circle made of flaming meteorolites towards the tiger shark chariot. He found that the spiritual station inside the chariot and all barriers and restrictions had been deactivated. Shi Yan poured a flow of Soul Consciousness into the chariot, which moved immediately, gliding through the meteorolites towards Zi Yao.</p>
<p>A massive meteorolite shielded a place in the gathering spot of sunbeams. It was where Zi Yao was waiting for him silently. She looked like a fire fairy with rainbow light twirling around her.</p>
<p>She was worriedly folding and then unfolding her fingers. Flows of seven-colored Divine Light shot out of her fingertips. Just like small snakes, they wound around her hand.</p>
<p>Staying with Shi Yan through this period had calmed down her seething mind. She had temporarily forgotten the wicked competition of the royal family. She felt relaxed, as if she had thrown all the burdens away.</p>
<p>This experience would be something she would never forget for the rest of her life. She treasured it. And, Shi Yan was a flame in this memory of hers, which she had imprinted in her mind, and nothing could erase it.</p>
<p>Waiting with worries for a long moment, Zi Yao became impatient. Seeing the meteorolites not exploding, she couldn&rsquo;t help herself but fly out of the sunbeams&rsquo; congregating area, turning around to look for Shi Yan.</p>
<p>A moment later, she found a tiger shark war chariot. Zi Yao discolored, gathering energy to prepare for her attacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back there for me?&rdquo; A generous laughter arose from the war chariot from a sunbeam gathering area far from her. &ldquo;Seems like Your Highness misses me a lot. Yeah, I&rsquo;m honored. I suddenly feel excited. Perhaps, that&rsquo;s why I could burst out my divine power and defeat Ka Tuo&rsquo;s gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan shouted. The tiger shark war chariot glided faster through the thick-woven sunbeams and approached Zi Yao shortly.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s enchanting face looked like a blooming flower. She smiled tenderly, waiting inside the bunch of sunbeams. Seven-colored God Light twirled around her soft body as her beautiful eyes glistened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. I was really worried about you. But, it seems I overthought. Tell me, why didn&rsquo;t Ka Tuo&rsquo;s gang chase after you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sea in her heart seethed. It wasn&rsquo;t as calm as she was showing on her face. Releasing the Soul Consciousness, she didn&rsquo;t find anyone, which made her seriously curious.</p>
<p>Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo&rsquo;s name was famous in the Raging Flame Star Area. He was the most ruthless slaughterer, and his hands always had blood stains. It was not easy to make this man give up his targets. As long as he hadn&rsquo;t died, he would never give way to his targets.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was astounded knowing that the slaughterer didn&rsquo;t come after them. She didn&rsquo;t know what had happened back there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Tuo won&rsquo;t show up anymore. He has retreated from the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. He gave us this tiger shark war chariot.&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled, waving at Zi Yao to ask her to get in the war chariot.</p>
<p>Zi Yao hesitated for a while, as if she were afraid of something. Then, she slowly got into the chariot. &ldquo;Have you cooperated with Ka Tuo to deal with me? Would you sell me then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ka Tuo had proposed the same, indeed,&rdquo; Shi Yan looked at her deeply. Suddenly, he smiled.</p>
<p>Zi Yao discolored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I denied him. Haha&hellip; Pardon me, but I can&rsquo;t tell you the details, and I hope you won&rsquo;t ask about it.&rdquo; While frowning, Shi Yan said seriously, &ldquo;Ka Tuo and I share the same origin. I hope that you won&rsquo;t pursue him after we get out of here. At this moment, I can&rsquo;t disclose much. I hope you believe me. I don&rsquo;t mean harm to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as she scrutinized him without blinking. Long afterward, she nodded gently. &ldquo;Alright, I won&rsquo;t press you. Quite the contrary, I feel better that you don&rsquo;t tell me the details. If you had told me a broken lie, I would have thought that you did cooperate with Ka Tuo to harm me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bi Rou of the Underworld League has promised big profits to Ka Tuo,&rdquo; smiled Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That b*tch!&rdquo; Zi Yao gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, there&rsquo;s another one,&rdquo; Shi Yan paused for a while, his face odd. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s from your Dark Firmament Divine Nation. Ka Tuo said that he&rsquo;s called Sura. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face changed dramatically as her soft body shivered. Cold light shot out from her eyes. &ldquo;This man, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Du Jie, my brother from another mother. Sura&rsquo;s the Captain of his Bodyguards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 752: Dirck</p>
<p>Dark competition in the royal family was the dirtiest and most ruthless in the world. For the throne, brothers could kill brothers or even the father. It was not a rare thing to expect.</p>
<p>Du Jia and Zi Yao had the same father but different mothers. To get the crown of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, Du Jie wanted to kill Zi Yao and her blood brother, which wasn&rsquo;t hard to understand.</p>
<p>After Princess Zi Yao named Prince Du Jie, her mood was down. Along the way back, she was silent, and her smile wasn&rsquo;t as bright as before.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood her mood. He knew it was hard to give any advice in this field. So, he didn&rsquo;t try to say anything in vain.</p>
<p>Zi Yao told him what the Land of God Punishment was. It was the area at the edge of the Raging Flame Star Area, which was obnubilated by thick mist year round. This land had so many forbidden areas that even an Original God Realm expert couldn&rsquo;t use his Soul Consciousness to survey.</p>
<p>Many space pirates would seclude in those lands to avoid the enemies.</p>
<p>The Land of God Punishment was situated in the center of the forbidden areas. A crowd of pirates, marauders, and evildoers that the other forces didn&rsquo;t want to accept dwelled there, along with brutal slaughterers and the madmen of the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>No one would show mercy while talking about that area. Also, it was a strange but rich trading area. Many goods the pirates and marauders got would be put up for transactions there. Rare cultivating materials that couldn&rsquo;t be found in the Raging Flame Star Area would perhaps appear in that land.</p>
<p>The Land of God Punishment was full of fights. They fought daily. Weak warriors couldn&rsquo;t survive there. People were killed every day, and all of their belongings would be snatched away.</p>
<p>When Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo, the leader of the pirates, operated in another area of the Raging Flame Star Area, if the enemies laid their eyes on him, he would be chased until they could kill him.</p>
<p>But, it would be different in the Land of God Punishment. This place had so many forbidden areas. If he evaluated that he couldn&rsquo;t resist the enemies, he just needed to hide in a forbidden area and seize some time to recover.</p>
<p>Madmen, slaughterers, pirates, and murderers with many death sentences, often visited the Land of God Punishment. They would trade many goods and materials, creating a strange but rich land.</p>
<p>This area hadn&rsquo;t been governed. Forces in the Raging Flame Star Area used to attack this place in an attempt to clean it. However, they hadn&rsquo;t succeeded.</p>
<p>After what Princess Zi Yao told him, Shi Yan quieted down as he finally knew the location of the Land of God Punishment. If it were not necessary, he wouldn&rsquo;t need to visit that land.</p>
<p>Even if he wanted to go, it shouldn&rsquo;t be with his current realm. When he felt he could protect himself well enough, he would go there and find Ka Tuo, asking him to do something in his favor.</p>
<p>Zi Yao seemed to have another goal. The tiger shark war chariot slowed down as she knew Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo wouldn&rsquo;t come for them anymore. She identified the direction, then drove the war chariot in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, not caring about the speed.</p>
<p>On their journey, they encountered some other marauders and some warriors secluding in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. However, those people weren&rsquo;t as brutal and fearless as Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo. When they found that Zi Yao was at the Third Sky of King God Realm, they would proactively stay away, not daring to mess with her.</p>
<p>Shi Yan relaxed happily. He stayed and cultivated in the tiger shark war chariot to steady his realm. He didn&rsquo;t hurry, just letting Zi Yao be in charge of everything.</p>
<p>Time flew by quickly.</p>
<p>Today, when he was closing his eyes to relax his nerves, Zi Yao suddenly smiled and muttered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; Shi Yan lifted his head to look at her in confusion. &ldquo;You should have a purpose visiting the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. What do you want after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to visit a man. He&rsquo;s very important to me. If I can get his recognition, I can gain the upper hand in the royal competition to the throne.&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s bold brows knitted together. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hurried. We will see him soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao drove the tiger shark war chariot to glide through the maze of meteorolites, sometimes using her Soul Consciousness to survey.</p>
<p>Gradually, they arrived at a place packed with burning meteorolites. Flaming rocks floated everywhere while sunbeams shot chaotically.</p>
<p>Zi Yao got excited as she wormed through the gaps between the dangerous burning meteorolites like a shuttle. She detoured to avoid many dangerous areas, and after a long moment called out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes brightened, his face also cheering up as his vision got clear.</p>
<p>It was unimaginable that a piece of land with rich heaven and earth energy could be situated in the middle of the burning meteorolite sea. It was a square land, thousands of miles squared in area. It floated quietly in outer space. Countless sunbeams seemed to be absorbed by that piece of land.</p>
<p>Steam fumed, winding outside the land, creating a marvelous barrier and covering the entire area. This barrier filtered the sunbeams, controlling the extreme heat so it wouldn&rsquo;t destroy the flora inside.</p>
<p>Square shaped herbal fields were flat and neat like cubes of tofu. Each field was the home of rare and precious spiritual herbs. They were all shining vigorously, proving their magical medicinal effects.</p>
<p>At first glance, those herbal fields seemed to be shimmering. So many plants in different colors looked more like blooming flowers, forming a scene that was beautifully marvelous.</p>
<p>A clear lake stayed in the center of hundreds of herbal fields, where an islet with a small cottage was situated.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s line of sight glided through the thick steam, falling on that small cottage. She left the tiger shark war chariot, going into the barrier made of thick vapor, then called tenderly, &ldquo;Uncle Dirck, your niece comes to visit you. Please open the barrier so I can get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soul fluctuation was sent from the small cottage on the islet. A moment later, a white-headed man emerged from the cottage. He waved his hand to dismiss the barrier, letting out a tender laughter. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded to Shi Yan, signaling him to come with her.</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled and didn&rsquo;t hesitate, accompanying Zi Yao through the barrier to that land of rich heaven and earth spiritual Qi. They slowly descended at the center of the islet.</p>
<p>The white-headed man called Dirck had some wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, but he was surely a handsome man when he was young. He crossed his arms in front of his chest, standing in the yard of his cottage while facing the sky. Until Zi Yao and Shi Yan landed, his deep eyes had never left Zi Yao, as if he were sinking into his thoughts.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t say anything as he was observing the surroundings discreetly, especially Dirck.</p>
<p>This herbal area was surrounded by so many flaming meteorolites. It was just around a thousand square miles, but the heaven and earth spiritual Qi and the Five Elements energy in this land were dozens of times denser than the Sixth Herbal Star.</p>
<p>Herbs and spiritual grass planted in those fields seemed to be all high-quality, which Nita&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t compare with at all. It seemed people in this islet had utilized the solar energy of the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field to convert the cycle of heaven and earth energy to create the magic of this area.</p>
<p>Dirck had the same immense energy fluctuation that Shi Yan had observed from Da Lei. Their auras were vast and immeasurable. However, when he tried to sense further, he couldn&rsquo;t feel a beam of energy on him. It was like he was just an ordinary person.</p>
<p>He was obviously an alchemist whose rank was higher than Nita. Looking at Zi Yao, Dirck fell into his memories. Different complicated moods sparkled in his eyes. After a long moment, he sighed with emotion. &ldquo;So identical! You and your mother, you guys look the same as if you are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s soft body shivered. &ldquo;Uncle Dirck, you&rsquo;ve met my mother? How was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s mother passed away before she could be able to memorize things. She had no memories of her mother. Every time she tried to ask her father, she didn&rsquo;t get the information she wanted to know. With time, the feeling she had for her mother seemed to fade gradually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That b*stard Du Tian Ji had promised me to take care of your mother. He didn&rsquo;t fulfill his promise. He let your mother die!&rdquo; Dirck snorted, his face cold and dark. &ldquo;If I had known it, I would have never let her go. If she had gone with me, she would have never fallen into this tragic consequence. She would absolutely not have had to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she die? My father has never told me anything. Uncle, could you please tell me?&rdquo; Zi Yao begged the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should ask him yourself, dear.&rdquo; Dirck let out a long sigh, looking at Zi Yao with fondness. &ldquo;That b*stard knows you look exactly like her. That&rsquo;s why he sent you to see me. It&rsquo;s been so many years, and he hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit. Cunning! He calculates everything precisely. He knows I won&rsquo;t refuse you, so he sent you to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; Zi Yao called him tenderly, &ldquo;Is my mother&rsquo;s death related to&hellip; him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes!&rdquo; Dirck rolled his eyes, &ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t want that throne and expand the territory, how could my sister die exhausting herself? My sister was the most outstanding alchemist of that year. Even I didn&rsquo;t have her innate endowment. She had refined so many God pellets for that b*stard Du Tian Ji. She had damaged her soul badly to help Du Tian Jie strengthen his force. Her soul was eroded bit by bit. Eventually, her soul altar vanished, leading to her death. If Du Tian Ji hadn&rsquo;t been so selfish that he wanted to rule the entire Raging Flame Star Area, my beloved sister wouldn&rsquo;t have had to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s heart trembled, her beautiful eyes watery. A sorrowful feeling soaked her wholly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like my sister, but your brother takes after that b*stard. It&rsquo;s impossible if you want me to leave my place and aid your brother. I will never help someone who looks like Du Tian Ji. But, if you want to do something, I promise you, even if I have to risk my old life, I will help you at all costs.&rdquo; Dirck took a deep breath. &ldquo;The entire Raging Flame Star Area knows what your brother is like. He inherits Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s characteristic from when he was young. I will never risk my life for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du Jie, your brother from another mother, came here before you. He came and promised me that as long as I stayed in this area, he would transport a large number of medicinal materials to me every ten years.&rdquo; Dirck darkened his face. &ldquo;The royal evil competition is so dirty that nothing could compare with it. Brothers kill sisters without any hesitation. Anyway, thinking about it, Du Tian Ji had also killed a lot of his siblings to claim the throne. In present days, his children are going on the same path as his young self. I wonder if he has ever thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; Zi Yao clenched her teeth. &ldquo;I almost died before I could see you, Uncle. The one who ambushed me was my dear older brother Du Jia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you need to yearn for power and position? Give it up and leave with me, then we will live in peace and freedom.&rdquo; Dirck gave her a deep look. &ldquo;As long as you want it, Uncle can protect you forever. You will never need to worry about anything. Uncle can help you collect cultivating materials. Why do you need to get out there and battle with the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I don&rsquo;t fight for my right, the others won&rsquo;t let me go.&rdquo; Zi Yao pondered for a while and then beamed a forced smile. &ldquo;Father has put forth everything to reach the Ethereal God Realm. You know how dangerous it is. If he succeeds, nothing will change. But if he fails, his soul altar will perish. At that time, the Divine Nation will fall into chaos. Then, no matter where I hide, I can&rsquo;t stay away from their pursuit. Even if Uncle wants to protect me, it&rsquo;ll be a hard task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirck panicked. &ldquo;That damn b*stard! How could that heartless moron gain such realm! The Heaven is so unfair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 753: Resolutely reject</p>
<p>In the center of the meteorolite sea, Princess Zi Yao had begged Dirck to leave his place and help her compete for the throne for Du Feng, her blood brother, to ensure that he would become the future King of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>Dirck remembered how things happened in the past, scolding Du Tian Ji for being heartless. However, he didn&rsquo;t want to help Zi Yao support Du Feng to get the throne.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed aside, not having said anything from the beginning to the end. He listened to their conversation and gained some information about King Du Tian Ji of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. He understood that this man was the tyrant overlord of an area in the Raging Flame Star Area. For the great undertaking, he could give up everything. For a stronger realm, he could sacrifice anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s mind, the one who could inherit his throne should be a bloody iron overlord like him.</p>
<p>As his children were competing harshly, it might be that he was watching them. He wanted to see his children killing each other. The strong would live, and the weak would die, then he would pick the winner to be his heir.</p>
<p>The one who could show his talents in the royal competition would get into his eyes. He would make that one the Crown Prince and let him be in charge of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. Later on, that Crown Prince would make the nation he had developed stronger, and dominate the Raging Flame Star Area forever without worrying about the other forces.</p>
<p>Only the winner of a brutal fight could prove his power and mindset. For his great undertaking, he could kill his brothers that year. And today, he had made his children kill each other. They were the kind of crazily stubborn characters.</p>
<p>There was an obvious dispute between him and Dirck. When they were young, they were friends, and even good friends. Because of Zi Yao&rsquo;s mother, they diverged. Eventually, their brotherhood cracked and was cut off.</p>
<p>He wanted to make Dirck serve him, but he knew for sure the other would never agree. That was why he had sent Princess Zi Yao to him, the princess who looked identically to her mother. Standing in front of her, it was hard for Dirck to be heartless. The affection he had for her mother in the past would make him leave his place then.</p>
<p>However, it seemed he had a wrong assumption.</p>
<p>It was not that Dirck didn&rsquo;t want to help them. However, his premise was that the throne of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation should be in Zi Yao&rsquo;s hands, and not her brother Du Feng.</p>
<p>No matter how hard Zi Yao tried to convince him, Dirck wasn&rsquo;t moved. He gritted his teeth and didn&rsquo;t agree with her anything.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had no ways to persuade him. After staying here for several days, she bid Dirck farewell.</p>
<p>Before they left, Dirck pondered for a while and then slipped a ring off his finger, putting it on Zi Yao&rsquo;s palm carefully. &ldquo;This ring stores a lot of medicinal pellets I&rsquo;ve refined. Many of them are good for you. I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;ve come to see me. Although I can&rsquo;t promise you anything, I won&rsquo;t neglect you. Take it&hellip; No matter to build your force or to break into a new realm, you will need them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t reject. Her slender jade-like fingers squeezed the ring, her eyes begrudging. &ldquo;Uncle, I know you want the best for me. Don&rsquo;t worry, I will take care of myself well. In the future, if I fail this battle for the throne, I will get back here to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My place is always open for you. As long as you can come here, nothing will matter.&rdquo; Dirck smiled fondly. &ldquo;Your dad&rsquo;s a selfish scoundrel. He&rsquo;s done things only for himself. He will never appreciate or take into account the others&rsquo; feeling. He won&rsquo;t take care of his family either. When someone dies for him, he will regret for a while, then continue to dip his head into what he calls a &lsquo;great endeavor&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Dirck looked at Shi Yan for the first time. He frowned, talking with some hidden meanings. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be as blind as your mother. Don&rsquo;t find a man like your father. If you do that and I find it, don&rsquo;t blame me. Whoever dares mistreat you, I will kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes suddenly became terrifyingly sharp and cold like a sword tip.</p>
<p>Under his gaze, Shi Yan felt like he got so many swords placed at his neck. A chill was sent down his spine, as if he would be crushed in the next minute.</p>
<p>Dangerous!</p>
<p>Shuddering inwardly, Shi Yan confirmed immediately that this Dirck wasn&rsquo;t only a profound alchemist, but also a formidable warrior&hellip; Perhaps, he was stronger than Da Lei!</p>
<p>Under Dirck&rsquo;s threatening eyes, Shi Yan frowned. His eyes weren&rsquo;t fluttered, but like a rigid block of ice as a cold aura moved around his body.</p>
<p>Calm and fearless!</p>
<p>Dirck gazed at him without even blinking. After a while, he shifted his sharp eyes, talking calmly. &ldquo;Kid, I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but if you could come here, it&rsquo;s fate. This pellet is for you. Use it as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pellet was verdant, with a fragrance that cheered people up. It sparkled with immense light as it flew towards Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Enormous energy fluctuations rippled from that pellet, which clearly seemed amazing and with tremendous medicinal effects. Shi Yan could even hear water murmuring inside the pellet. Shi Yan gathered his spirit and surveyed the pellet. He saw a small leak, which looked like a miniature a stream. It flowed naturally, circulating just like veins in a warrior&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes lit up as her succulent red lips parted. &ldquo;Shi Yan, say thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan looked at the pellet and sensed its efficacy. His eyes shrank but he didn&rsquo;t take the pellet. &ldquo;I appreciate your favor, precursor. But, I can&rsquo;t take this pellet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was surprised.</p>
<p>Dirck slightly knitted his eyebrows as his sharp eyes gazed at Shi Yan. He pondered for a few seconds, then the corners of his mouth twitched into a faint smile. &ldquo;Kid, do you know what pellet it is? What are its effects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan shook his head, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hundred Circulation Soul Pill, a level 4 Divine Grade pellet. It could nurture your God Soul and supplement your Blood Qi. It&rsquo;s still a big treasure to a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior.&rdquo; Dirck arched his brow. &ldquo;And you, when you take this pellet, breaking through the King God Realm is just a piece of cake. Condensing the God Body&rsquo;s as easy as flipping a hand. As long as your realm could catch up with your energy and your Upanishad, you will soon enter the King God Realm. This pellet will make countless warriors kill each other to gain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Dirck snorted and then squinted his eyes. &ldquo;One more time, do you want it or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; Shi Yan shook his head, resolutely rejecting the offer. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate, and his eyes didn&rsquo;t shift. He continued faintly, &ldquo;Without this Hundred Circulation Soul Pill, I&rsquo;ll still break through easily to the King God Realm. I think condensing the God Body shouldn&rsquo;t be dependent on external forces. It&rsquo;s the best way for it to happen naturally. Using pellets mean one doesn&rsquo;t believe in oneself. Along my cultivating path, I haven&rsquo;t depended on pellets to break through realms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You arrogant kid!&rdquo; Dirck sneered. &ldquo;You got a shortcut but you&rsquo;re stubborn. I can tell your achievement in the future will be limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Zi Yao. &ldquo;This cortege of yours is like a rock. Arrogant and firm enough&hellip; His realm&rsquo;s high but his pride isn&rsquo;t low. Harrumph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao smiled, her beautiful eyes glaring at Shi Yan as she said tenderly. &ldquo;This man&rsquo;s always arrogant. Anyway, I think a man who dares to give up a pellet offered to him and wants to use his own power to break through shouldn&rsquo;t be a moron. He just has the absolute confidence. Of course, my follower is the latter kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, not flexible at all, doesn&rsquo;t know how to seize a chance. I think he won&rsquo;t have a great achievement.&rdquo; Dirck waved his hand, taking back his pellet. He seemed not happy at all. &ldquo;Alright, don&rsquo;t pretend in front of me. Don&rsquo;t you want to show off in front of Zi Yao? I&rsquo;ve seen many people like you. Du Tian Ji acted the same that year. Damn it, my sister liked this manner of his! So disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed he didn&rsquo;t have a good impression of Shi Yan. After talking with a serious face, he urged impatiently. &ldquo;Go. The sort of man like you, if you don&rsquo;t taste bitter things, you won&rsquo;t know how high the sky is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To attract beauties, making oneself the odd one out was the trick many men used. In Dirck&rsquo;s eyes, Shi Yan was this sort of a man, which he absolutely hated. That was why he didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him more.</p>
<p>Shi Yan shrugged indifferently and didn&rsquo;t explain anything.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao bid farewell to Dirck for a while. Eventually, she went with Shi Yan back on the old route to the Solar Star Exploding Field. Later on, she stooped and chuckled. &ldquo;Are you like what my Uncle said? You wanted to show that you are different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t change his visage, although the corners of his mouth twitched a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you aren&rsquo;t. To be honest, throughout many years, many people have tried to act in front of me. Your deeds and theirs are pretty similar.&rdquo; Zi Yao laughed cheerily. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re like them, I will be happy. At least, I can assure that my charm has never been reduced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have failed you,&rdquo; Shi Yan slight bowed to her, talking gently. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to own that man a favor, so he can&rsquo;t control me in the future. Perhaps, he&rsquo;s self-righteous, as he thinks that no one is your match in this life. Anyone approaching you will have a purpose, to capture your glamour, for example. Haha&hellip; Interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A*shole!&rdquo; Zi Yao gritted her teeth. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I really make you enchanted? Why could the others be and you couldn&rsquo;t? Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll borrow your words. Do you have&hellip; health issues?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She acted as if she suddenly understood a mystery, nodding and then saying affirmatively. &ldquo;Sure it is. I understand. Ah ah! I forgive you. I&rsquo;m sorry for misunderstanding you. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
<p>Zi Yao looked at him seriously for a while and then burst out laughing, holding her flat belly. She laughed until her body was shaking, pointing her finger at Shi Yan. &ldquo;Hahaha&hellip; Interesting! You&hellip; Turns out there&rsquo;s something that makes you ridiculous. Haha&hellip; Look at you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan paused for a while and then accelerated all of a sudden. Just like a shooting light, he glided, passing her while storming forward furiously.</p>
<p>The silver bell jingles like laughter arose behind him.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face was bright and shining, as if she were overjoyed. She waved her hands cheerily like she had done a great thing. She looked like a blooming flower that tickled people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Floating behind him, her laughter didn&rsquo;t cease, while her soft body shook tenderly. Her beautiful eyes gazed at Shi Yan&rsquo;s buff back. She mused on him for a while before urging her power to follow him quickly.</p>
<p>Chapter 754: Glorious Amethyst Star</p>
<p>*This star is named after Yi Zao &ndash; Yi Zao Star. Yi Zao means &lsquo;Glorious amethyst,&rsquo; so I translated it literally &ndash; TL.</p>
<p>The Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field&hellip;</p>
<p>A tiger shark war chariot roared, flashed, and disappeared into the dark, cold universe. Shi Yan and Princess Zi Yao were standing on the chariot, watching the immense star sea. They seemed to be happy to see the sunlight again.</p>
<p>After leaving Dirck&rsquo;s place, they didn&rsquo;t meet any danger, crossing the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field at ease.</p>
<p>The tiger shark war chariot stopped. Zi Yao frowned, taking out a delicate blue crystal. She sent her Soul Consciousness into the stone, trying to contact someone.</p>
<p>After a while, a heavy expression appeared on her charming face, her eyes worried.</p>
<p>Shi Yan observed quietly. He suddenly felt cold inwardly, sighing as he knew Du Feng had encountered something unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No news from them?&rdquo; Pondering for a while, Shi Yan asked in a soft tone.</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded. &ldquo;Before we diverged, I told Bergh to meet me outside. I have no news from them. Perhaps, they have encountered something unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stayed idle in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field for a long time. If Berge and Prince Du Feng got out and didn&rsquo;t see us here, perhaps&hellip; they&rsquo;ve gone home already. Your Highness, don&rsquo;t worry much.&rdquo; Shi Yan tried to console her.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s visage became better. &ldquo;I hope so. If my brother meets anything unexpected, I will never spare them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan knew she was talking about Prince Du Jie.</p>
<p>Sura was the team leader of his bodyguards. He was in charge of contacting Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo. Ka Tuo&rsquo;s target was Zi Yao, and Sura had joined this operation directly.</p>
<p>Perhaps, they still had another team who was chasing after Du Feng. As Bergh and Du Feng weren&rsquo;t here, something bad might have happened to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We should go back first, then we&rsquo;ll return here afterward to search for their whereabouts.&rdquo; Zi Yao contemplated for a while. She understood that waiting here wasn&rsquo;t a good solution, but would give Sura a chance to track them down.</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded and didn&rsquo;t say anything else as he sat down on the tiger shark war chariot.</p>
<p>There was no way to measure time precisely in outer space. They could only use a special type of stone to check the time. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t have such toys, so he didn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed. He only knew that they had spent a long time on this tiger shark war chariot.</p>
<p>A long, long time afterward&hellip;</p>
<p>On this particular day, they saw a dazzling star appear in their sight. This star was massive, with abundant spiritual Qi and countless energy fluctuations of living beings.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes glinted while her anxious mind quieted down, and a smile appeared on her face once again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan got up, standing in the war chariot and watching the area further ahead of them. He could see some sparkling stars near that massive star. However, due to the far distance, he couldn&rsquo;t sense much or estimate their size and energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Dark Firmament Divine Nation,&rdquo; Zi Yao pointed at an area from a far distance. &ldquo;The Nation consists of eleven life stars. Ten satellite stars surround one big life star, which is the metropolis star of our Dark Firmament Divine Nation. It&rsquo;s called the Dark Firmament Star. My Father stays there. That star has three suns and three moons, the three Great Solar Stars, and the three Great Moon Stars. They scatter in different areas and light up the Divine Nation. We will never experience true darkness. Even if it&rsquo;s night time, under the light of the three Great Moons, the place&rsquo;s still lighted up gloriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face glinted with vainglory. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where my ancestors guard from generations to generations. It&rsquo;s my hometown. The Dark Firmament Star always belongs to the owner of the Divine Nation. The ten life stars surrounding it belong to the Princes, Princesses, and the King&rsquo;s siblings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan looked at that place and was shaken inwardly. He suddenly felt that the Dark Firmament Divine Nation was truly mighty and prosperous.</p>
<p>Fluctuations of dense energy were sent to him from the nearest star. It should be at least a life star at level 3 or 4, with abundant earth and heaven energy. It was the best place for warriors to cultivate.</p>
<p>A life star was a place similar to the Grace Mainland. The area created by eleven life stars was the place where the royal family of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation stayed.</p>
<p>Of course, the Dark Firmament Divine Nation&rsquo;s territory included not just these stars.</p>
<p>Other five feudal vassals guarded the further areas. They had more than ten life stars and many mineral stars. Together, they created the powerful status of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. Each feudal vassal, just like Da Lei, was an expert at the Original God Realm.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the Dark Firmament Divine Nation had an extremely large territory, and a power that could make people shiver on just hearing their names. It was worthy of being one of three strongest forces of the Raging Flame Star Area. As it could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Underworld League and the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce for ten thousand years, it proved how strong this divine nation was.</p>
<p>The tiger shark chariot was still moving at fast speed. Gradually, the life star in front of them became larger. Shi Yan could see so many creatures, beasts, mountains, rivers, lakes, and things. The scenery there was beautiful and heartening. Spiritual herbs and grass were grown in separate areas, where the specialists took care of them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness flickered and his eyes brightened. The soul auras he could sense on that life star were packed like an ant colony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha&hellip; This is the Glorious Amethyst Star, the planet belonging to me. It has several thousand people on it, and the same number of beautiful mountains and lakes. You can see attractions everywhere.&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s mood was good. &ldquo;This Glorious Amethyst Star&rsquo;s named after me. When I was born, my Father gifted it to me. Under my management, the Glorious Amethyst Star can be considered prosperous. Since it&rsquo;s a level 4 life star, it won&rsquo;t be drained even after dozens of thousands of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, Zi Yao smiled like a blooming flower as her beautiful eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Each Prince and Princess has their own life stars. My brother also has one. However, his life star is dark and chaotic. His clumsy management has made it messy. Although his star&rsquo;s full of spiritual Qi, its order has never been made. Fights happen all the time. He just babbled when he said that he would give you a life star. He can&rsquo;t give you his life star. Of course, if he can take the throne, it will be another story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled faintly. &ldquo;I knew it already. You don&rsquo;t need to explain me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about my Glorious Amethyst Star?&rdquo; Zi Yao asked as the tiger shark war chariot slowly descended, flying towards the central grand palace of the Glorious Amethyst Star.</p>
<p>Purple clouds wound around that group of palaces built from a kind of fulgent purple crystal. Violet nimbus was moving beautifully on those structures.</p>
<p>Inside those palaces, Shi Yan could see many artificial mountains and small bridges over the running streams, with flowers blooming everywhere. Spiritual Qi stormed into his nostrils. At first glance, this place was both luxurious and dreamy like a fairyland, which could calm people&rsquo;s soul, making them forget all their sorrows.</p>
<p>Shi Yan surveyed and watched the magnificent scenery. Many different-raced warriors were busying themselves inside and outside the palaces. They were harvesting herbs, feeding spiritual animals, cultivating, or refining medicines and weapons. Everybody was working orderly.</p>
<p>It seemed Zi Yao had sent them her message. Many warriors were waiting for her solemnly on a massive platform in the central palace. They faced up the sky, waiting in silence.</p>
<p>Around twenty-some King God Realm warriors, a hundred True God Realm warriors, and almost one thousand Sky Realm warriors were scattered on that massive tall platform. Some of them stooped, while some kneeled down or bowed on the ground, waiting for their master to come home.</p>
<p>Seeing their grand welcoming ceremony, Shi Yan suddenly had a complicated feeling&hellip;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was only a Princess of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, but she could control such a holy land like this, with a tremendous force under her command. Thinking about the general force of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, the Underworld League, and the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce, he understood that his vision had been so narrow.</p>
<p>The Raging Flame Star Area was mysterious, and much more immense than what he had imagined. The Grace Mainland was&hellip; much smaller than this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Your Highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Your Highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Your Highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud sounds echoed from the square under their feet. Shortly, the whole area of thousands of miles around was filled with greetings.</p>
<p>Any person working outside or inside the palaces, no matter what they were doing, harvesting herbs or feeding beasts, refining medicines and forging treasures, all paused their work, bent, and greeted, contributing to that stream and strengthening its power.</p>
<p>The smile on Zi Yao&rsquo;s face faded. She looked solemn, even though she wasn&rsquo;t enraged. The imperious manners of a leader appeared on her enchanting face as she said tenderly, &ldquo;Get up. No need to be too courteous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Your Highness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several thousand warriors stood up, their faces solemn. They still stooped their heads, without acting too flurried.</p>
<p>The tiger shark war chariot stopped, landing on the center of the high platform. Although it was around ten meters long, the tiger shark war chariot looked nothing special landing on this vast platform.</p>
<p>Shi Yan observed for a while and found that this square had many battleships and war chariots, most of which were purple. Shi Yan could see some amethyst war chariots, but he couldn&rsquo;t see the amethyst battleship Zi Yao used to use.</p>
<p>He got it immediately. The amethyst battleship he had dragged into the unknown space was Zi Yao&rsquo;s private property. It must be much more precious, as it also was her moving imperial abode. Although she was noble and rich, she wasn&rsquo;t able to fabricate more battleships like that. It proved how precious and extraordinary her amethyst battleship was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness, where&rsquo;s your battleship? And, where&rsquo;s Bergh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Demon Clan&rsquo;s sturdy man with a short beard and high spirits, having a half-naked upper body, stepped forward and asked her while bending his body. The muscles of his entire body bulged like stones, which stored his bursting energy.</p>
<p>Zi Yao discolored as her eyes glinted with a gleam of fear. &ldquo;Bergh hasn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bergh and Antrim, didn&rsquo;t they go with you?&rdquo; That sturdy man seemed to be astounded.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sighed inwardly. He shook his head, as he understood that something had happened to Bergh and Du Feng.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s voice trembled. &ldquo;No message from them? How about my brother? Did you hear anything about Prince Du Feng?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Du Feng&rsquo;s subordinates have come here and asked for him several times. They are searching for him too.&rdquo; The sturdy man changed his visage. &ldquo;The Prince hasn&rsquo;t come back yet. Since the last time he went out, we haven&rsquo;t heard from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s heart sank to the bottom of the abyss. Chill covered her entire body as she stood in a daze.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t dare to even breathe loudly. They all understood that something had happened. They were all grim. The entire Glorious Amethyst Star seemed to be overcast by invisible dark clouds.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, as his line of sight raked through those people. He suddenly recognized that, perhaps, Du Feng and the others would never appear again.</p>
<p>Chapter 755: Source of Upanishad inheritance</p>
<p>Getting no news about Prince Du Feng and Bergh, Zi Yao became dispirited. She first asked about the general condition of the Glorious Amethyst Star and solved some minor problems. After that, she took Shi Yan to the purple palace.</p>
<p>Along their way, many warriors bent on one knee to show their respect for her. Several thousand warriors followed her just like the cortege of a Goddess, sending her to her amethyst palace.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t say anything, just following her. However, he didn&rsquo;t bend his body or stoop his head. He was obviously different from the other warriors.</p>
<p>Many warriors of Zi Yao&rsquo;s retinue were assessing him discreetly with complicated eyes, as they didn&rsquo;t know his identity. When they knew that Shi Yan was also one of the Princess&rsquo;s retinue, they were surprised and frightened inwardly.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao was a noblewoman in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. She had countless members of her retinue, and even the King God Realm warriors had to bow to her.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was just at the Third Sky of True God Realm. According to common sense, he wasn&rsquo;t worth her special treatment.</p>
<p>Anyway, after they had observed for a while, they found that the way Zi Yao treated Shi Yan was different. This made many people jealous of him, generating some thoughts in their heads.</p>
<p>Who was this kid? What talents did he have? What did he have at the True God Realm that Your Highness had appreciated?</p>
<p>They were thinking about him secretly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t care about them. He just kept silent and followed Zi Yao to her amethyst palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys can leave. When you have Du Feng or Bergh&rsquo;s news, report to me immediately.&rdquo; Zi Yao waved her hand tiredly. &ldquo;Pay attention, and watch out carefully for me. Brief the situation of the divine nation for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many warriors nodded, bent their bodies and stepped backward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, you choose a room to rest in the Amethyst Palace. We have the training room, the Upanishad Hall, and the warehouse that stores all kinds of materials. If you need, just take them. I can also give you my personal collection of materials.&rdquo; Zi Yao pondered for a while. &ldquo;You and I have experienced struggles together. At the most critical time, you&rsquo;ve shouldered my burden in the battles. You&rsquo;re different from the others&hellip; To be honest, when we entered the forbidden land, I didn&rsquo;t consider you my cortege. I&rsquo;ve considered you my friend. I hope you would treat me the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan let out a tender laugh as he nodded his head. &ldquo;Thank you for appreciating me, Your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t put on this face. I know you have all sorts of airs and graces, and many secrets. However, you&rsquo;re not familiar with the Raging Flame Star Area yet. This area is too complicated. I believe you will have an immeasurable future. However, your realm&rsquo;s still pretty low at this moment. There are any things you can help me out with.&rdquo; Zi Yao rolled her eyes at him. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t respect me wholeheartedly. No problem. The sort of a man like you will never want to be under the other&rsquo;s commands. I understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan gave a wry smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I always think for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie. It&rsquo;s not what you mean with your heart,&rdquo; Zi Yao harrumphed. &ldquo;I want to take a good rest this time and gather myself. You should take care of yourself. Take this jade token. You can freely walk around in the Amethyst Palace. In my Glorious Amethyst Star, this token represents me. No one will dare to do anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Your Highness,&rdquo; Shi Yan took the jade token and wore it on his belt.</p>
<p>Waving her hand, Zi Yao urged him. &ldquo;Go away. The Amethyst Palace&rsquo;s three hundred meters tall. Each level has private training areas. You can choose wherever you want to stay. The jade token also shows the locations of the training rooms, the Upanishad Hall, and the materials storage. Do whatever you want. Ah, yeah, since you told me that you&rsquo;re a blacksmith, I won&rsquo;t give you weapons. You can forge your own ones. You also have heaven flames, which would make your weapons more suitable for you. My storage has a lot of materials, which are all rare things in the Raging Flame Star Area. I have a lot of skeletons of level 10 beasts, similar to the material you had made your Bone Thorns with. Do what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as he slightly bent his body for the first time to talk to the princess. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; This time, he was more sincere.</p>
<p>Level 11 beasts could be compared to Original God Realm warriors. Their bones were extraordinary rigid, which were the top quality materials to make weapons.</p>
<p>Monster Clan&rsquo;s members at this level had long left the Grace Mainland to the foreign lands. Shi Yan had never seen beasts at such level before.</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns made of the bones of a level 10 beast were already intimidating. With space power added to the Bone Thorns, Shi Yan could control them as he pleased. He had planned to quench them one more time. That was why he wanted to take the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s skeleton that much.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird was also a beast. Shi Yan had assumed that this beast was at least at level 11, or even level 12.</p>
<p>However, since the Vermilion Bird True Flame was so persistent, he couldn&rsquo;t do anything but give it up. Of course, if the Vermilion Bird had reached level 12, he could hardly refine that bird&rsquo;s skeleton.</p>
<p>It would be already tough for him to forge the skeleton of a level 11 beast.</p>
<p>Zi Yao advised a bit more and then left. Her figured flashed, then disappeared into the Amethyst Palace. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know where she had gone.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood still and didn&rsquo;t hasten to leave yet. His fingers rubbed the jade token, releasing a flow of Soul Consciousness while moving inside the jade token.</p>
<p>This jade token was a small model of the Amethyst Palace. As its restriction was lifted, Shi Yan could use the jade token to see the structure and the arrangement of different secret chambers in this palace.</p>
<p>Which floors were suitable to rest, which were the training rooms, and where the Upanishad Hall was, the jade token showed them all.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was curious about the Upanishad Hall the most. It should be similar to the Martial Technique Hall of the Martial Spirit Palace in the Grace Mainland, where they stored the fundamental techniques of different power Upanishads.</p>
<p>After Zi Yao had left, Shi Yan considered for a while and then followed the map inside the jade token to find the Upanishad Hall in the Amethyst Palace.</p>
<p>It was a spacious room, around one thousand square meters in area, built from amethyst. A giant ancient tree, which was refined from five-colored crystals, stood in the middle of this large room. This big tree didn&rsquo;t have leaves but crystal clear branches, which was pretty similar to the Essence Qi ancient tree in his body.</p>
<p>That ancient tree was the Source of Upanishad Inheritance where countless magical power Upanishads were stored. Warriors could get in there to receive a new power Upanishad. Of course, in many other Upanishad Halls, it wasn&rsquo;t always in the shape of a tree.</p>
<p>For example, the Corpse Clan would make their Source of Upanishad Inheritance with the shape of a tombstone. The other clans would make it look like a mountain range, the ocean, or even the soul altar.</p>
<p>The Source of Upanishad Inheritance had so many shapes, but they shared the same name and the same functions, which was to help warriors receive the power Upanishad.</p>
<p>People had used a magical way to imprint different Upanishad into the Source of Upanishad Inheritance. When they had new Upanishad, they could always add them altogether. The Source of Upanishad Inheritance was really precious, and only the strongest forces could have them.</p>
<p>Eyeing the tree-shaped Source of Upanishad Inheritance, Shi Yan kept silent. Afterward, he beamed a faint smile.</p>
<p>He suddenly got it that the seven statues of Demogorgon in the First Demon Area in the Grace Mainland were also a Source of Upanishad Inheritance. However, it was a low-level one, since it had only the martial techniques, but not the fundamental elements of the martial techniques: the Power Upanishads.</p>
<p>The Source of Upanishad Inheritance in this place was much better. It had the imprints of the basis of martial techniques. As long as the warrior could learn a kind of power Upanishad and develop it, he could freely create different martial techniques by the principles of Nature. Then, he could use that energy in a beautiful way, which would form intricate martial techniques.</p>
<p>The giant five-colored tree in front of him was filled with strange energy fluctuations. Each branch of its seemed to have the distinctive auras of powers Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shi Yan released his Soul Consciousness, making his soul change miraculously and constantly. He then tried to touch the Source of Upanishad Inheritance.</p>
<p>The jade token on his waist suddenly sparkled, and a feeble beam of purple light shot towards the Source of Upanishad Inheritance in front of his eyes. In the next moment, the barrier on the Source of Upanishad Inheritance was lifted up.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness seized the chance and flooded in.</p>
<p>This Source of Upanishad Inheritance had a tree shape with many branches, which stored different power Upanishads. Shi Yan could see the power Upanishad of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Thunder, Storm, Hypnotizing, Light, and Gravity, etc.</p>
<p>Countless different power Upanishads were imprinted in the Source of Upanishad Inheritance. Each branch had the basic techniques for beginners. Of course, the Source of Upanishad Inheritance wasn&rsquo;t really omnipotent.</p>
<p>The Upanishad it showed was just the fundamental rules and principles of a power. Even if a warrior could know them, it didn&rsquo;t mean that he could really cultivate the power and create a power Upanishad tier in his soul altar.</p>
<p>Only after truly understanding the essence of the primary power Upanishad and continuing to cultivate and study it would a warrior actually cross the threshold and create the Seal of Upanishad in his soul.</p>
<p>Normally, a warrior wouldn&rsquo;t cultivate many different types of power Upanishads. Studying one power Upanishad ascetically was enough to consume the whole life effort of a warrior.</p>
<p>When a warrior began to cultivate a power Upanishad, he would encounter so many obstacles. The meanings of a power Upanishad were tedious, as if they would never be completely comprehended.</p>
<p>And, even if a warrior spent his whole life to cultivate a power Upanishad, it wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed that he could make it to the peak.</p>
<p>Even if one were a smart and patient expert, he would only cultivate two or three powers Upanishad. Moreover, he would choose the powers Upanishad with something in common to save time and create more effects.</p>
<p>Only morons would try to study many power Upanishad at once. If he did that, he would never cross the threshold, let alone create a Sea of Upanishad in his God Soul. Basically, he couldn&rsquo;t create the soul altar to break through to a more profound realm.</p>
<p>Without crossing the threshold and cultivating it to a certain depth, a warrior could never bring out the best of his power Upanishad.</p>
<p>A warrior&rsquo;s efforts were limited, and the power Upanishad was always too profound. A warrior should normally cultivate only one kind of power Upanishad in his life, which was the correct way and the practicing principle of most of the experts in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>Shi Yan urged his Soul Consciousness to move around the Source of Upanishad Inheritance, trying to find some power Upanishad similar to his Star, Space, and Death and Life power Upanishad. However, he felt sorry that he could find nothing.</p>
<p>Power Upanishads in this place were all popular. Shi Yan had seen the similar martial techniques in the Grace Mainland. Apparently, the Star, Space, and Death and Life were all high-level power Upanishads. They were special and strange, which made them rare in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>Even Zi Yao with her aristocratic status couldn&rsquo;t gain such high-quality power Upanishads. That was why Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t find any similar imprints in the Source of Upanishad Inheritance.</p>
<p>However, Shi Yan was still enticed. Although this Source of Upanishad Inheritance couldn&rsquo;t offer him big benefits, it was of much use to his friends and relatives in the Perpetual Night Forest if they could come here and use the Soul Consciousness to perceive the power Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sank into his thoughts while gazing at the Source of Upanishad Inheritance for a while. Afterward, he left to the material storage to find the suitable bones for his Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>Chapter 756: The best quality bone material</p>
<p>In Zi Yao&rsquo;s private storage, Shi Yan found many chambers under different lists, storing many kinds of materials.</p>
<p>Some rooms stored many mineral ores and crystals. The others kept delicate wooden materials, which had natural patterns. Shi Yan also found a room filled with beautiful jades having many shapes and different functions.</p>
<p>All chambers here had a detailed written description, for example, the Bone Material room Shi Yan was checking out just now.</p>
<p>The Bone Material room wasn&rsquo;t so spacious, around one thousand square meters. Pieces of strange bones were put on greenish-brown shelves. Some of them were translucent like gems, some looked rusted, while the others still had a lot of blood stains and a thick bloody scent.</p>
<p>More than dozen kinds of bone materials were classified in different zones. A label, which was placed in front of each bone, described each material in detail, reading which beast it came from, name and level of the beast, class, attributes, and how to refine the bone.</p>
<p>Shi Yan took a walk around the Bone Material room. He wasn&rsquo;t hurried. His eyes twinkled as he was praising this area.</p>
<p>Bone materials that Zi Yao had collected weren&rsquo;t normal. The lowest rank here belonged to a level 9 beast, and the rest belonged to beasts with special features.</p>
<p>Bones of level 10 beasts weren&rsquo;t a rare item in this place. They were put neatly on the shelves with a detailed introduction.</p>
<p>Shi Yan strolled around, stroking the bones he had passed by passionately. Sometimes he frowned, and sometimes his eyes glinted as he beamed a faint smile.</p>
<p>Monsters at level 10 could be compared to King God Realm experts. Usually, they were all tough and tenacious. Beasts of different classes were different, and their bones were distinctive. Some bones were as light as a feather, while the others were even heavier than iron or rock. This feature depended on the beast&rsquo;s class.</p>
<p>Shi Yan still walked around while his ten fingers touched each piece of bone here. He found so many kinds of bones with different attributes, many of which were priceless bone materials.</p>
<p>Of course, he wanted to see the skeleton of the level 11 beast Zi Yao had mentioned the most.</p>
<p>Holding the purple jade token in his hand, he sauntered to a corner of the Bone Materials room. This place had a clear energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>Around ten bones of three to eight meters were placed on a massive amethyst platform. These bones also had a label, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear enough.</p>
<p>However, those simple words had struck Shi Yan inwardly, making him put all of his attention on them.</p>
<p>Material: Level 11</p>
<p>Name of beast: Unknown</p>
<p>Functions: Unknown</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with a strange light. He eyed those ten bones and hesitated for a while, before picking up a piece of black bone. He didn&rsquo;t know what kind of beast this bone belonged to, but it was totally black, with a shiny dark halo. It felt so cold and heavy in Shi Yan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s palm felt cool while holding this piece of bone. He suddenly felt a mountain-like heavy aura diffusing to his face from the bone. This bone was so heavy that Shi Yan had to urge his energy to hold it.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face changed as he closed his eyes and felt. From this piece of bone, he could sense the thick and heavy aura of earth.</p>
<p>Shi Yan shook his head discreetly, putting this bone down. His eyes shifted to the other bones in front of him.</p>
<p>The bone he wanted shouldn&rsquo;t be too heavy. Or else, it would be hard to promote space power of his Soul Consciousness. The feature of coming and going without leaving any trace was what he needed the most. The bones that could promote space power must be sharp, swift, and extremely tough!</p>
<p>Heavy wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted. He needed to avoid this feature.</p>
<p>His fingers surfed above the bones as if he were stroking his lover&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, too brittle. It can&rsquo;t stand the space power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nah, not this one. Too blunt. Even if it&rsquo;s quenched, it can&rsquo;t be sharp enough to break the God Domain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This one isn&rsquo;t good either&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>While his fingers glided above the bones, his Soul Consciousness penetrated them. Shi Yan could feel the attributes and the special features of each bone.</p>
<p>The bone materials on this platform belonged to the skeleton of an unknown level 11 beast. However, most of them had no energy remaining in them. Some still had a little of energy remnants, but the attributes weren&rsquo;t suitable. They were too brittle or too blunt, or had the attributes Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t need, such as Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, his Soul Consciousness continued to move around the bones on the platform via his fingers.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>He suddenly opened his eyes, gazing at a six-meters long bone that was as wide as his fist. This bone looked like a piece of translucent white jade, with many holes on the surface, which seemed to be created naturally, and were part of the bone. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t find any flaw in this bone.</p>
<p>Shi Yan placed his finger on a small hole on the bone. Immediately, he felt a gust, as if a furious wind was howling and storming out of that small hole, tearing his eardrum.</p>
<p>Hiss Hiss Hiss!</p>
<p>From the finger placed on the tiny hole, the hissing wind stormed into his soul. It felt like it was a real wind cutting his skin.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was shaken inwardly. He stooped, studying the bone while his eyes brightened. After a while, he laughed happily. &ldquo;Tough, sharp, and belongs to a Wind-class beast. Also has some remaining energy that I can use. Top-quality bone material!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>The six-meters long bone flew up, slowly landing on his finger, floating in front of him.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame flew out from his soul altar. Under his thought, it turned into a flaming fluid ring, enveloping the bone.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was filled with smiles. &ldquo;You refine it and extract all the impurities. I&rsquo;m going to choose the auxiliary materials to increase its sharpness, flexibility, and speed!&rdquo; He left the bone and the Vermilion Bird True Flame in the room, then flew towards Zi Yao&rsquo;s private material chambers. He busied himself in raking up Zi Yao&rsquo;s materials to choose the suitable materials to increase the bone&rsquo;s attributes and power.</p>
<p>Disaster suddenly fell on the cultivating materials Zi Yao had been collecting for years. The chambers that stored materials became a mess after Shi Yan&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>To gather the auxiliary materials quickly, Shi Yan moved like a tornado sweeping through the storage. Whenever he found a good item, he picked it up, gave it an examination, and put it directly into his Storage Ring.</p>
<p>His operation was like a hungry wolf snatching its prey, searching and taking. Finally, he had even affected Zi Yao, who was taking rest in her private Amethyst Palace.</p>
<p>A delicate, five-colored formation in the Jade chamber glistened. In the next moment, a charming figure appeared inside the divine light.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao was wearing a purple dress, her eyes gloomy. She weakly walked out of the formation inaudibly. The man who was rummaging pieces of jade and gem hadn&rsquo;t recognized her as he was still searching. He even mumbled to himself. &ldquo;Wind attribute, better to be Wind attribute. No, not this one. Oh, sh*t, not this one either&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao frowned her bold brows. She was a little bit angry, staring at his back for a while. Afterward, seeing the man was not stopping his deed, she couldn&rsquo;t help but shout. &ldquo;Do you want to destroy my material chambers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s back suddenly got upright. He suddenly turned around, throwing her a glance and smiling brightly. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding her for a second, he turned around and continued his business of collecting materials. He ignored Zi Yao one more time.</p>
<p>After a while, he craned his head from the mess of jades and gems. His eyes looked happy as if he had found something good eventually. &ldquo;Your territory is so good. Thanks a ton for your favor, Your Highness. I think I can refine my Bone Thorns now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he nodded, and a wind passed by Zi Yao as he rushed to the Bone Materials room.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s face grimaced. She was angry as the other had ignored her completely. She gritted her teeth and then walked to the Bone Material room.</p>
<p>A red-orange flame covered a six-meters long crystal bone. From time to time, the crystal bone would drop some drops of brownish-gray viscous fluid. Those were the melted impurities inside the bone.</p>
<p>As the bone was being refined by the Vermilion Bird True Flame, wind would sometimes hiss through the tiny holes on the bone. Gradually, the bone became scarlet and angular like a sharp spear.</p>
<p>Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t realized that she had come too. His face was serious while beautiful gems and strange stones flew out of his sparkling Storage Ring. An energy then guided them towards the bone.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame burst out its energy, and a red-orange flame covered those precious jades and gems, starting to refine them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was serious as he sat down cross-legged right in front of Princess Zi Yao. His soul altar started to rotate while his hands were constantly making magical hand seals and formations. Energy under formations and seal forms struck the bone.</p>
<p>Shi Yan touched his glabella. A flow of flaming energy carrying the Sun Original Essence aura poured into the bone like a bunch of light. It then entered the bone through the tiny holes on its surface.</p>
<p>Shi Yan closed his eyes, while his hands started to move and carve the formations swiftly and unconsciously. Fine space lights appeared and sizzled. Under the support of some mysterious energy, they poured into the bone, and then strongly changed its structure.</p>
<p>Hundreds of hand seals and formations entered the bone like fading shadows. The bone suddenly emitted an earth-shaking whistle. The strong wind howled through the small holes in the bones.</p>
<p>The beautiful jades and strange gems were all melted into a magical fluid. Shi Yan&rsquo;s miraculous hand seals and formations sank into this fluid, and then they all merged with the strange energy inside the bone, increasing its power and ability.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao was dizzy and astounded on watching Shi Yan refining the bone.</p>
<p>After a long time, her beautiful eyes glistered as she muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really a blacksmith. From his bearings, I think his grade isn&rsquo;t low either&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flame was burning on the bone, turning it into a scarlet hue as if it were heating up well. Magical hand seals and formation suddenly disappeared, and the tiny holes on the bone cracked, turning into narrow slits.</p>
<p>It seemed the bone was crushed and rebuilt. Those slits appeared as if it had suffered from sharp slashes or chops.</p>
<p>However, on a closer look, it was visible that each eyelet and slit had stored an extremely sharp space energy, which was like a wind blade that could cut and crush everything.</p>
<p>Chapter 757: Refine divine weapon!</p>
<p>The wind howled ear-piercingly, tearing the air inside the Bone Material room. It was like a sharp weapon was prickling people&rsquo;s eardrums, making the soul twinge as if it was pierced by a needle!</p>
<p>The Bone Thorn wasn&rsquo;t visible in the Bone Material Room, but it was howling fiercely. Also, there was no strange energy surging. The wind howl seemed to hide in space slits, making it hard to detect.</p>
<p>Shi Yan squinted. His aura was cold, sharp, and wicked, just like a spear, giving people a weird feeling.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame got back to Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar. The ground in front of him was full of black and gray viscous substance, the contaminants extracted from the Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>The wind wailed unceasingly, crying in the Bone Material room. This eardrum-tearing sound discolored Zi Yao. Although she had urged her soul fluctuation as a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior rippling around the room, she couldn&rsquo;t find the Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>The howling didn&rsquo;t stop. She was sure that the Bone Thorns were still in this Bone Material room, yet she couldn&rsquo;t sense or lock them, or find their whereabouts.</p>
<p>This was evilly strange!</p>
<p>With her King God Realm cultivation base, she couldn&rsquo;t detect the Bone Thorns Shi Yan had refined and controlled. It was not normal at all. Also, it made her have a higher valuation of Shi Yan&rsquo;s blacksmithing techniques.</p>
<p>The howls stopped all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Three crystal clear Bone Thorns appeared, each being two meters long with two pointy ends like two spears connected to each other. The Bone Thorns had so many fine slits on their bodies, as if they were made by slashes of a sharp weapon. At first glance, these three Bone Thorns looked like trash.</p>
<p>However, with a closer look and the soul to sense, sharp energy of space could be detected from those fine cracks.</p>
<p>Carving space power Upanishad on the Bone Thorns was a strange but excellent technique, which made Zi Yao interested in these three Bone Thorns. She wanted to know which grade they were at.</p>
<p>So, she waved her exquisite small hand in the air, drawing something to open a restriction. A light purple light sparkled, and a lozenge tool appeared in the center of a formation inside the Bone Material chamber. Zi Yao smiled, walking towards the tool and talking to Shi Yan. &ldquo;This Tool Ranking Stone can grade the quality of your three Bone Thorns. Wanna try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan agreed frankly. The three Bone Thorns reappeared, hovering next to the thing called the Tool Ranking Stone.</p>
<p>Countless glorious energy filaments extended from inside the lozenge tool. They shone on the three Bone Thorns like tentacles, as if they were measuring and verifying their quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a criteria does this tool use?&rdquo; From a distance, Shi Yan glared at the thing with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it will check the tool&rsquo;s flexibility, sharpness, endurance, bearing capacity, etc. If your weapon has a spirit, it&rsquo;ll measure the weapon spirit&rsquo;s grade. Also, it will check the combination of materials and level of impurities or contaminants. There are so many criteria to evaluate.&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled, craning her white neck towards Shi Yan. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it clearly in detail. This Tool Ranking Stone&rsquo;s made by the blacksmiths who could forge Divine Grade secret treasures. I don&rsquo;t know their criteria clearly. Anyway, it couldn&rsquo;t be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded as his interest was aroused. He also wanted to know which grade the Bone Thorns he had dedicatedly fabricated were at.</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns were made of a bone of a level 11 beast of Wind class, together with twelve kinds of beautiful jades, gems, and ironstone to increase the flexibility, sharpness, and speed. They were refined by heaven flame to extract contaminants. With hand seals and formations from the Blacksmith&rsquo;s Secrets of Success, Shi Yan had poured and created the energy by adding space power and the flaming solar energy.</p>
<p>This set of treasure had been invested with Shi Yan&rsquo;s enthusiasm and effort. He had made use of all of available resources to create them.</p>
<p>He also had a great expectation for the quality of those Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>Light spots sparkled on the Tool Ranking Stone. Seven light sports glinted and then combined into one. A dazzling light flooded the area, turning into a sparkling light dot like a small star, then slowly vanishing.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s bright eyes showed that she was disbelieving, as she dazedly looked at the strange state of the Tool Raking Stone. Her succulent red lips convulsed as she muttered something in her throat.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t hear it clearly. He frowned and then asked impatiently. &ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s chest jolted upright. She took several breaths to steady her mind. Then, she glared at him with an odd countenance. &ldquo;Level 1 Divine Grade. You are a Divine Grade blacksmith! The three Bone Thorns of yours all have the characteristics of level 1 Divine Grade treasures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Shi Yan grinned as he felt contented.</p>
<p>Divine Grade!</p>
<p>He had never imagined he could refine a Divine Grade secret treasure in the Grace Mainland! He had never thought that he could use the level 11 beast&rsquo;s skeleton to refine three Bone Thorns successfully in this area. Also, the three Bone Thorns had been added with his special powers Upanishad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have so many Divine Grade alchemists in the Raging Flame Star Area each of whom holds a superior position in their forces. However, the Divine Grade blacksmiths are still rare. Our Dark Firmament Divine Nation has only two Divine Grade blacksmiths.&rdquo; Zi Yao paused and then eyed him seriously. &ldquo;Among tens of thousands of blacksmiths in the entire Raging Flame Star Area, not more than ten blacksmiths could create Divine Grade secret treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Raging Flame Star Area, the blacksmiths were rarer than alchemists. So, their status is higher than the alchemist.</p>
<p>Thus, when Zi Yao eyed him again, her beautiful eyes seemed to be about to illuminate.</p>
<p>Shi Yan beamed a faint smile, talking deliberately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just an amateur blacksmith. Don&rsquo;t plan anything on me. I won&rsquo;t give up my cultivation just to refine treasures for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He understood that he could forge a Divine Grade secret treasure because of the level 11 beast&rsquo;s skeleton and the level 5 Vermilion Bird True Flame that had extracted all the impurities in the bone thorns, making it precious.</p>
<p>Without these two conditions and with his not-so-experienced techniques, he could never refine the Divine Grade Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>As his mind flickered, the three Bone Thorns disappeared into his Storage Ring. Shi Yan smiled, stretching his body. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, and I need to rest now. Your Highness, do as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes were shining like the torch while looking at him. &ldquo;Divine Grade blacksmith! Shi Yan ah, don&rsquo;t you think you should do something for me? You should know that my bone materials here are all precious. And, you&rsquo;ve used a lot of my auxiliary materials, too. Do you want to take everything for free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me to do that?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised. &ldquo;When you gave me the jade token, you told me that I can use everything here as I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. But I didn&rsquo;t say that they are free, did I?&rdquo; Princess Zi Yao laughed, her eyes cunning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve used a lot of my materials. Shouldn&rsquo;t you make something to compensate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan kept silent, frowning as he thought about how to reject her.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao wasn&rsquo;t hurried. She just smiled, looking at him. She didn&rsquo;t leave, as though she was adamant on getting his affirmation before leaving.</p>
<p>Right when they were still struggling and watching each other, cheers resounded outside the Amethyst Palace.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s eyes lit up, letting out a light sigh. &ldquo;Did my spoiled little brother come back?&rdquo; She turned into a bunch of purple light, flashing and then disappearing.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was amazed. He curiously flew out of the Bone Material room to the outside of the Amethyst Palace as well.</p>
<p>A hundred meters long silver bird battleship slowly landed on the spacious square.</p>
<p>A dazzling blonde man flew out of the battleship, smiling tenderly. Some King God Realm warriors followed him. Silver bird war chariots emerged from the silver battleship, all of them filled with precious materials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gera&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s Ao Gera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many warriors staying in the Glorious Amethyst Star got out of their places, cheerily screaming from a far distance.</p>
<p>That handsome blonde man was brawny, with a shining smile. He continually nodded his head to greet the other warriors. Seemed like he was pretty familiar with them.</p>
<p>When Princess Zi Yao got out of her palace, she also went to welcome the handsome man called Ao Gera. As he saw her, his eyes didn&rsquo;t lay on anyone else. He strode towards her, kneeled down on one knee while talking to her like the most humble knight. &ldquo;Your Highness, you&rsquo;ve been struggling hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling sincerely, he placed a tender kiss on Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s hand then stood up gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled mildly. Like the noblest Queen, she let him kiss her hand and then asked him, &ldquo;Ao Gera, how is it going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to your grace, everything&rsquo;s smooth.&rdquo; The blonde man smiled as if any difficult matter would turn easy in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, come to say hello to Ao Gera, my most competent messenger. He&rsquo;s not my guard.&rdquo; Glorious Amethyst Star laughed happily, waving her jade-like hand at Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He sauntered and nodded at the blonde man from a far distance.</p>
<p>Ao Gera was amazed, his eyes skeptical. He looked at the other man, nodded to him, and then turned to Zi Yao. &ldquo;Your Highness, is he your new retinue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Zi Yao smiled mildly, her beautiful eyes carrying some deep meanings. &ldquo;He saved me in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. Ao Gera, even though he hasn&rsquo;t reached the King God Realm yet, his potential&rsquo;s excellent. I favor him a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the blonde man replied faintly as he didn&rsquo;t put it in his mind. He hesitated a while before lowering his voice. &ldquo;Your Highness, I got something I want to report you privately&hellip; about&hellip; Prince Du Feng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao trembled in fright. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; Her figured flashed like an electric wisp, flying directly into the Amethyst Palace. Ao Gera followed her.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood at his spot, his face unchanged. He looked at the materials on the war chariots and the other warriors following Ao Gera. He was surprised inwardly.</p>
<p>Among those King God Realm warriors, there was one at the Third Sky of King God Realm. He was a dangerous member of this team. All members of his crew, including that man, looked at Ao Gera with respect and support. It seemed like&hellip; Ao Gera was their true master, and not Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Ao Gera was at the Second Sky of King God Realm, one rank lower than Zi Yao. He was considered one of the retinues of Zi Yao. In other words, his status was like Shi Yan&rsquo;s. But, why could he have his own organization?</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t guess anything, so he discreetly became more cautious.</p>
<p>He vaguely felt that the man called Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t look at him with a friendly attitude. It seemed he was trying to conceal his murderous aura.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Shi Yan understood that Ao Gera had soon known about him and every operation of his from the time he had arrived in the Glorious Amethyst Star. However, this man was trying to hide things and ignore him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly understood and couldn&rsquo;t help but beam a forced smile, shaking his head begrudgingly.</p>
<p>Chapter 758: Heaven flame&rsquo;s ascension</p>
<p>Although he was Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s escort, Ao Gera seemed to have a high status and position. He had his own cortege, and he seemed to be the other master of the Glorious Amethyst Star.</p>
<p>His subordinates were managing people to transport the materials from the flying bird war chariots. They even shouted at the onlookers to ask them to give a hand.</p>
<p>Those who were called didn&rsquo;t resist. Quite the contrary, they looked happy working for the warriors under Ao Gera&rsquo;s commands. They unloaded the materials and transported them to many places.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao and Ao Gera had left to the Amethyst Palace to talk about issues related to Du Feng and Bergh. Shi Yan observed for a while, then beamed a forced smile as he got it eventually. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t return to the Amethyst Palace, leaving this place alone.</p>
<p>He had been to the Glorious Amethyst Star for a while, but he had always stayed inside the Amethyst Palace, and never got out or talked with Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s underlings. That was why he didn&rsquo;t have a clue about Ao Gera&rsquo;s position and status.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood that he had been staying in a bit too much, so he wanted to walk around to check the situation of the Glorious Amethyst Star. He should better have more knowledge of this area, as it would help him a lot later.</p>
<p>Glorious Amethyst Star was a continent. Although it wasn&rsquo;t as vast as the Grace Mainland, his Soul Consciousness couldn&rsquo;t cover it all. This place was filled with heaven and earth energy, many spiritual animals, and rare flora. All of those belonged to Princess Zi Yao of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, the owner of this beautiful planet.</p>
<p>Shi Yan left that group of palaces. Seeing the amethyst token on his waist, the guards moving back and forth slightly bent their bodies to greet him on the way.</p>
<p>People holding the Amethyst token could visit anywhere in the Amethyst Palace, as they were the distinguished guests of the Glorious Amethyst Star. They could go anywhere without having any restrictions.</p>
<p>With the token, his trip was smooth. He soared up into the sky, flying above the Glorious Amethyst Star. Looking at the sky with three dazzling suns and immersing himself in the sunlight, Shi Yan felt more comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>His mind flickered, and the three Bone Thorns roared, flying towards the mountain range, disappearing shortly.</p>
<p>Ear-piercing screams echoed from the center of the mountain ranges. Many spiritual animals had to hide in fright. The Bone Thorns were like invisible sharp weapons, swaying in the mountains. People could only hear the wind hissing, but not find out their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Shortly, Shi Yan was floating in the air, while his eyes sparkled with a fiercely cold light.</p>
<p>Pfff!</p>
<p>A verdant mountain flank in front of him suddenly had a fist-sized hole. It looked so deep that he couldn&rsquo;t even see the bottom.</p>
<p>His eyes glued to the hole. Shi Yan squinted to sense with a grin.</p>
<p>Three blazing bunches of light abruptly illuminated. Three crystal clear Bone Thorns were floating in front of him steadily. Silver light radiated from them, full of magical energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>Shi Yan waved his hand, and the three Bone Thorns disappeared. Shi Yan was satisfied, smiling as he flew forward once again.</p>
<p>After the Bone Thorns were quenched, their endurance and sharpness became extraordinary. With the energy of Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness, he could use the Bone Thorns to use his space power. The Bone Thorns could hide in space slits to avoid being detected by the opponents&rsquo; Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>These three Bone Thorns would be sharp weapons in his hand, which could perform tremendously in a life and death battle.</p>
<p>With high spirit, he flew through the mountains, lakes, and forests. After several hundred miles, he glided through a vast area of so many cities.</p>
<p>Most of the residents of those cities were ordinary people with different races. Shi Yan could sense some warriors, but their realms weren&rsquo;t so high. Strongest warriors would wear purple clothes. Apparently, they were under Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s management. On behalf of her, they would control those cities.</p>
<p>Most of the cities there looked like the Sky Meteor City in the Quiet Cloud Land, or the Wonderful Stone City in the Divine Great Land. Each city would have a City Master to manage the entire operations of the city.</p>
<p>All the City Masters were Zi Yao&rsquo;s subordinates. They would help her find the potential warriors in the city to nurture them, which could help her in the future. Taxes would be submitted on time, turning into Zi Yao&rsquo;s properties.</p>
<p>Shi Yan got there, walking through the cities. He had put the token away so that nobody would notice him.</p>
<p>Gliding above the cities, Shi Yan found that the City Masters of many cities in the Glorious Amethyst Star were only at the True God Realm. In some small cities, the City Masters were only at the Spirit Realm or Sky Realm. Those cities constituted the Glorious Amethyst Star, surrounding the purple palaces where Zi Yao stayed, which was the only ruling structure of the planet.</p>
<p>In the eyes of those several thousand people, Zi Yao was their Queen, their master forever. Some of them even had never heard of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation or the Underworld League. Most of her people had never left the Glorious Amethyst Star.</p>
<p>Only warriors with potential would be selected. Afterward, they could move to the palaces where Zi Yao stayed to receive the power Upanishad inheritance. Then, they would have to cultivate and go through tests to earn their status and positions. They could be Zi Yao&rsquo;s guards or workers at the herbal fields, or even take care of her spiritual animals.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had many cities, but the heaven and earth energy in those cities weren&rsquo;t the same. Some were rich in energy, while many of them had thin layers of spiritual energy. Only where Zi Yao was staying had the thickest heaven and earth energy.</p>
<p>After several days of staying in the Glorious Amethyst Star, he had some understanding about this life star. Shi Yan evaluated to plan where he should establish a city for his family and friends from the Grace Mainland, so that they could stay and live happily.</p>
<p>Different from the Grace Mainland, members of different clans could live together in harmony here. They wouldn&rsquo;t be hostile toward the others due to racism, which could lead to a bloody battle where either of them had to die.</p>
<p>Zi Yao had chosen the best subordinates. She didn&rsquo;t care about races, just their realms and competences, and how much they could support her.</p>
<p>After several days of taking a tour around the Glorious Amethyst Star, Shi Yan had a deeper understanding of this life star. Through a True God Realm City Master, he got to know Ao Gera&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Ao Gera at the Second Sky of King God Realm was the son of Ao La Dai, the blood sister of Ao Gu Duo &ndash; one of the five feudal vassals. Ao La Dai got married to a leader of a small force near the border of Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s territory. To take over that force, Ao Gu Duo made his sister marry that leader, which was solely to merge that force into his territory.</p>
<p>Ao Gera had shown his extraordinary innate talents when he was pretty young. He was excellent in cultivation, so Ao La Dai and her husband had always indulged him.</p>
<p>One of the five Great Feudal Vassals of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, Ao Gu Duo didn&rsquo;t get married. He didn&rsquo;t have any children, so he had treated this talented nephew as if he were his blood son. He had favored him so much that he had taught Ao Gera the meanings of martial path himself for a period of time.</p>
<p>Ao Gera was a prominent young man in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. After he had seen Zi Yao the first time, it seemed he had fallen under her spell. He decided to follow Zi Yao and pledge to protect her welfare and honor.</p>
<p>When Ao Gu Duo and Ao La Dai found out about his decision, they had tried everything to oppose it. However, the young man was persistent. He had given up everything and moved to the Glorious Amethyst Star alone, becoming Zi Yao&rsquo;s escort.</p>
<p>Due to his special status, Zi Yao was proud and happy to have him as her retinue. She had always treated him well, considering him her friend. She even let him take care of many big cities on her planet.</p>
<p>After Ao Gera followed Zi Yao, his realm had never been stagnant, but always advanced, which had cheered his uncle Ao Gu Duo a lot. Later on, he forgave the young man for his deed and sent the experts under his command to be Ao Gera&rsquo;s cortege.</p>
<p>That was why Ao Gera was a special character of Zi Yao&rsquo;s cortege. His origin wasn&rsquo;t bad, and he also had a firm backup and his own organization. Due to his admiration for Zi Yao, he was willing to humble himself and become her escort.</p>
<p>After Shi Yan knew of Ao Gera&rsquo;s identity, he was amazed, sighing with emotion for this man&rsquo;s deeds.</p>
<p>He had an outstanding background, but he had given it up for Zi Yao. He had harassed himself being her guard. If this man didn&rsquo;t have a deep affection for her, he should have been a cunning, wicked man. No matter what kind of character this young man was, Shi Yan staying close to Zi Yao in the Amethyst Palace would rouse his envy.</p>
<p>That was why Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t give him a comfortable feeling when he looked at him. Shi Yan understood that if he were him, he would have been enraged too.</p>
<p>Shaking his head begrudgingly, Shi Yan forced a smile while looking at the purple palaces and sighing. He pondered for a while, then returned to the place.</p>
<p>A feeble flame arose in his Sea of Consciousness as a wonderful thought crossed his mind. Although he didn&rsquo;t change his speed, his focus was now on his Sea of Consciousness.</p>
<p>On the heaven flame soul altar, the Earth Flame, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, and the Corpse Vanishing Flame were sending out energy fluctuations. Their flames were flickering on the soul altar, as though they were about to wake up.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>When they were in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, the Earth Flame was the first one who went dormant. While fighting against the Vermilion Bird True Flame, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, and the Corpse Vanishing Flame had absorbed a lot of the strange energy in that forbidden land. Afterward, these two flame quieted down as well.</p>
<p>Today, it had been half a year since then, and these three heaven flames were about to wake up. He was a little bit excited. Shi Yan pulled himself together and observed the situation.</p>
<p>Not long after that, the Earth Flame &lsquo;boomed,&rsquo; releasing so many flames. It circled the soul altar and then stopped, sending him its thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reached level 4!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was astounded. &ldquo;That fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Volcano Crystal Nucleus and the Sun Original Essence are the best precious items for me to ascend. Having them, of course, I can leap up swiftly,&rdquo; The Earth Flame answered him cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me&hellip;&rdquo; The deep thought of the Corpse Vanishing Flame slowly arose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reached level 3. The corpse Qi there was abundant. I&rsquo;m lucky to have broken through another level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha. I&rsquo;ve reached level 5! I should have reached level 5 earlier though!&rdquo; The Yin Spirit Ghost Flame was thrilled.</p>
<p>This flame was the same as the Vermilion Bird True Flame. They were both at level 5, the highest ranked heaven flames among this group.</p>
<p>The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame used to be at level 4. However, since it had been confined for so many years, it was degraded back to level 3. Contrary to it, the Earth Flame, the flame that gained intellect the last, had leaped from level 2 to level 4 thanks to its miraculous encounter. After that event, this flame had benefited the most.</p>
<p>Feeling the joy of the heaven flames in his soul altar, Shi Yan also smiled while slowly flying toward the purple palaces, heading to the Amethyst Palace.</p>
<p>Chapter 759: The Purgatory Token</p>
<p>The Amethyst Palace was the symbol of the supreme power in the Glorious Amethyst Star. It was also Zi Yao&rsquo;s palace, where she resolved her business and cultivated.</p>
<p>However, it was different today. Two lines of guards were standing on both sides of the stairs in front of the Amethyst Palace. Behind them sat a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior near the entrance.</p>
<p>That warrior was Ao Gera&rsquo;s subordinate, who had just come back with him. Shi Yan had seen him before.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned and then put on his usual countenance, walking towards the Amethyst Palace. Suddenly, two lines of guards standing solemnly on the steps stopped him with unfriendly faces while one of them shouted. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two lines of guards had fourteen warriors in total. Each line had seven guards holding long silver spears, sparkling sharply.</p>
<p>Fourteen pairs of eyes shot towards Shi Yan with caution. Their spears shivered slightly, sending an extraordinary energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>All of them were at the True God Realm, with half at the Peak of True God Realm. Their auras were much more intimidating than his.</p>
<p>Shi Yan changed his visage, then snorted and took out the jade token he was wearing on his belt. &ldquo;The Princess gave me this jade token. She said that I could enter the Amethyst Palace freely. I&rsquo;ve been away for several days, and this Amethyst Palace has had a new master now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the guard saw the token, his face became strange. He didn&rsquo;t answer but turned around, looking at the warrior standing behind them.</p>
<p>The old man still closed his eyes as he slowly rose his indifferent voice. &ldquo;The Princess has set off to Dark Firmament Star to find the King and ask for justice. Before she left, she had advised that when she&rsquo;s absent, Ao Gera will be in charge of the Amethyst Palace. Currently, Ao Gera&rsquo;s cultivating inside the Amethyst Palace. He doesn&rsquo;t want anybody to disturb him. He has advised that we can&rsquo;t let anybody enter the Amethyst Palace before he wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the jade token granted by the Princess, I still can&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; Shi Yan snorted with a cold face. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true that the Princess&rsquo; words are the rules in the Glorious Amethyst Star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bull!&rdquo; The old man shouted. A sharp aura shot out from his body instantly, seeming like a sharp sword. His closed eyes slowly opened, gazing at Shi Yan furiously. &ldquo;Of course, Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s the master of the Glorious Amethyst Star. It will never change. However, the Princess isn&rsquo;t here. She has told us that in her absence, Ao Gera shall be in charge. Today, Ao Gera&rsquo;s cultivating inside the Amethyst Palace, and no one is allowed to disturb him. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you have the token or not. You are not allowed to get in. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this man was talking, his voice was amplified. Many warriors on the square could hear his voice, so they came close to observe.</p>
<p>Many warriors from the other palaces walked out with frowning face. They came to check what was happening there. Not long afterward, the beefy Demon Clan&rsquo;s warrior whom Shi Yan had seen before walked out from a palace, still baring his chest.</p>
<p>He appeared and harrumphed while walking towards Shi Yan shortly. He shouted mockingly at that man. &ldquo;Yuwen, although our master isn&rsquo;t here, I think it&rsquo;s not your job to control everything, eh? Then, what is a major-domo like me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man put on a serious countenance. &ldquo;I protect the Amethyst Palace for Ao Gera. It&rsquo;s to prevent some low-realm people from being crushed into powder by his God Domain while he&rsquo;s cultivating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, the old man closed his eyes again, as if he didn&rsquo;t want to talk much to the Demon Clan&rsquo;s brawny man.</p>
<p>The major-domo stood outside the Amethyst Palace, looking at the place with a dark face, as if he was releasing his energy to sense something. After a while, he knitted his brows and asked Shi Yan. &ldquo;Did you put anything in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Shi Yan shook his head as his ruthless eyes lingered on Yuwen for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. Princess had arranged something for you before she left.&rdquo; The beefy Demon man turned away, walking on the square. Shi Yan followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Shi Yan tried to probe for information from that sturdy man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gera said that he found the corpses of Bergh and Antrim. But he didn&rsquo;t see Prince Du Feng&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The Demon man hesitated for a while and then turned around. &ldquo;Princess was worried that Prince Du Feng would be in big trouble. She went to the Dark Firmament Star to ask for the King&rsquo;s opinions. Before she left, she did say that Ao Gera would be in charge of the Glorious Amethyst Star. It has always been like that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded as he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been familiar with the Glorious Amethyst Star yet. Even if the Princess trusts and favors you, it&rsquo;s impossible that she would let you manage the Glorious Amethyst Star. You would ruin it.&rdquo; The Demon man explained. &ldquo;The Princess does favor you a lot. Otherwise, she wouldn&rsquo;t give you her jade token.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded again</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what Princess wanted to give you, the Purgatory Token. This is how you can go to the Extreme Purgatory Field.&rdquo; The beefy man held a token with both his hands, which wasn&rsquo;t made of jade or gold, then handed it to Shi Yan with a solemn face.</p>
<p>Actually, his respect wasn&rsquo;t for Shi Yan but the Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Shi Yan received the token, gathering his spirit to check it. This token had a triangular shape, with a white bone crown carved on it. The white bone crown was supported by several pale bones above a pond of blood. Shi Yan caressed the token. All of a sudden, he had a brutal thought of killing people. It seemed like the token had many resentful ghosts screaming inside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King had forged the Purgatory Tokens himself. The bloody white bone crown is the symbol of the royal family of the divine nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded, closed his eyes, and caressed the white bone crown on the token. He felt his Blood Qi increase abruptly, as the killing desire arose in him.</p>
<p>Frightened, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to sense further. He hastened to put the Purgatory Token into his Storage Ring, then asked, &ldquo;Did the Princess advise me anything before she left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants you to go to the Purgatory Star. The Extreme Purgatory Field is there. And, take the amethyst war chariot she gave you.&rdquo; The man pointed at a brand new fulgent amethyst war chariot. This beautiful chariot was apparently of a better quality than the others parked around this area. &ldquo;The Extreme Purgatory field is about to open. People holding this Purgatory Token can go there. When you get to the Purgatory Star, show them the token. They will take care of you and explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled, then slightly bent his body. &ldquo;Thank you, Major-domo. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ai Fu La,&rdquo; The Demon man hesitated for a while and then beamed a bright smile, telling his name. His eyes rolled as he was considering something. Then, he continued in a low voice. &ldquo;The Princess and Ao Gera had a dispute because of this Token. My men overheard it accidentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was bewildered. He paused for a while and then looked at the other man with a solemn visage. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! Be careful. Our Princess appreciates you, so don&rsquo;t fail her. The quotas of the Extreme Purgatory Field are very precious. As she wants to send you there, she does favor you a lot. At this moment, she needs more support. I hope that you would give her strong support in the near future,&rdquo; Ai Fu La said with a serious countenance.</p>
<p>Apparently, he was quite loyal and dedicated to Princess Zi Yao. He had always thought for Zi Yao. As long as something benefited her, he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do it. He would fulfill everything Zi Yao asked him to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, I got it. Thanks again.&rdquo; Shi Yan said heavily, then got in the amethyst war chariot. He found that all the restrictions and barriers were lifted. He could use his Soul Consciousness to drive the chariot directly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sent his Soul Consciousness into the station of the amethyst war chariot. A constellation map arose, showing the location of the Glorious Amethyst Star and the Purgatory Star. At first glance, Shi Yan learned his route immediately.</p>
<p>Shi Yan knew that Zi Yao had prepared everything for him before she left. She even set the map for him, so he didn&rsquo;t need to do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should check it carefully. This war chariot has been used by so many people. I&rsquo;ve seen Ao Gera&rsquo;s men adjust it too.&rdquo; Ai Fu La suddenly said, his words implying something.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He released his Soul Consciousness to sense the energy fluctuation in this war chariot. Afterward, he smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many members of the Princess had pledged to die for her. They could risk their lives in many dangers. However, some of them have disappeared inexplicably&hellip;&rdquo; Ai Fu La muttered, throwing a glance towards the Amethyst Palace.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes changed as he was scared.</p>
<p>When he bid farewell to Ka Tuo, the man had also advised him to be cautious with Zi Yao. He told him that many of her escorts had disappeared for unknown reasons. He said that Zi Yao was an extremely toxic character.</p>
<p>Connected to what Ai Fu La had just told him, Shi Yan suddenly understood something as a flash of thought crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be careful.&rdquo; Ai Fu La didn&rsquo;t talk more. He nodded and waved his hand, then left.</p>
<p>After his figured disappeared, Shi Yan used his Soul Consciousness to drive the amethyst war chariot, turning into purple lightning and soaring into space.</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot was made of amethyst, which was a special crystal that could be added with Divine Crystal energy. Each war chariot had been installed with Divine Crystals to supplement the energy. The war chariot flew up and accelerated towards the sky. As he was looking outside from the chariot, Shi Yan suddenly felt something.</p>
<p>Standing in the war chariot, Shi Yan looked at the Amethyst Palace, especially at a central floor of the Amethyst Palace, where a tall, open platform was installed.</p>
<p>The blonde Ao Gera&rsquo;s small figure was sitting neatly. A wisp of energy fluctuated from his soul altar. He suddenly lifted his head, glaring at Shi Yan&rsquo;s war chariot.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes and his locked each other from a distance of around ten thousand meters.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>It felt like a flame blooming in the void, bringing up a sharp, hostile aura. Shi Yan beamed a faint smile, his face brutal and cold.</p>
<p>Ao Gera sat firmly and slowly closed his eyes, his aura quiet and archaic.</p>
<p>Chapter 760: Convergence of the Moon&rsquo;s brilliance!</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot flew in the sky like purple lightning, tearing the cloud sea to enter the cold and dark outer space. He had stayed in the Glorious Amethyst Star for nearly a month. Since Zi Yao had left, he had to go into outer space the second time.</p>
<p>Sitting indifferently in the war chariot, Shi Yan watched the vast starry sea. His Soul Consciousness was blurry, as the thoughts in his mind started to scatter. He sat like that while his consciousness floated to somewhere.</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot didn&rsquo;t require his soul energy to move. It was flying at lightning speed according to the set route.</p>
<p>The Glorious Amethyst Star and the Purgatory Star weren&rsquo;t too far away from each other. At this speed, it would take around half a month to reach the Purgatory Star and join the training in the so-called Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Flying in the middle of the endless starry universe, he suddenly felt lonely. His tough mentality couldn&rsquo;t help but get softer.</p>
<p>The Raging Flame Star Area was endlessly vast. In this universe, he was just an outsider who had no friends or family, nothing familiar, or a lover to yearn for.</p>
<p>Everything about this place seemed to distance him. He was drifting alone in this star area. Instinctively, he recalled Bao Ao and Jie Ji.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you guys doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those two experts of the Demon Clan had come here with him to save their clan and make it stronger. They had given up everything to enter outer space in the hope of finding a solution.</p>
<p>At this moment, he&rsquo;d found the solution for the energy shortage issue of the Grace Mainland.</p>
<p>However, he didn&rsquo;t know whether Bao Ao and Jie Ji were still alive or not. He had run away discreetly with Fergie. Since Bao Ao and Jie Jie had to stay and be involved in the battle, they would possibly become sacrifices.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was begrudging. Looking at the stars in the sky, he forced a smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me. Even if I stayed, I would be of no help. Whether you are alive or not, when I get back to the Grace Mainland, I will give the Demon Clan a place to live and grow. I will bring them out of the Grace Mainland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never forgotten the reason he left his homeland. For his family, his friends, and his people in the Grace Mainland, he had to hurry up to find a safe life star in the Raging Flame Star Area and bring his people there.</p>
<p>The Glorious Amethyst Star was a good place, but the premise was that he had to solve the hidden trouble named Ao Gera.</p>
<p>A cold smile hung on the corner of his mouth. Shi Yan pondered for a while and then touched his glabella.</p>
<p>A soul thought run directly to the heaven flame tier in his soul altar, targeting the Vermilion Bird True Flame. &ldquo;How long does it take from our homeland to the Raging Flame Star Area? Oh, I mean, when we use the amethyst war chariot. Give me an exact number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the Vermilion Bird True Flame was startled. It was anxious for a while before replying. &ldquo;It will take a long time. At least more than ten years. When I left my homeland and followed the aura of the Vermilion Bird, running to this place, it took me more than one hundred years. If this war chariot runs at its max speed, it will take around twenty years to return to our homeland. But it&rsquo;s in the case everything goes smoothly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes shrank. &ldquo;Such a long time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least twenty years,&rdquo; the Vermilion Bird True Flame affirmed. &ldquo;If you have bad luck, it would take one hundred years. It&rsquo;s normal though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From our homeland to the Raging Flame Star Area, we need to cross so many cold and isolated star areas. Those star areas have no living beings or life stars. They&rsquo;ve been drained long ago. However, formidable dangers are hiding there. Take one step wrong, and your soul will be shattered. Even though I&rsquo;m in the soul form, I had encountered so many perilous events along the way. If you use this amethyst war chariot, when you enter a perilous area, your chariot will explode. And you, you will be destroyed by the tremendous power of outer space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s brows slammed together tightly.</p>
<p>He knew the Vermilion Bird True Flame didn&rsquo;t fabricate things. Since he had been in the Raging Flame Star Area, he had a precise perception of the common dangers that could be seen in outer space. He knew there would be many hazardous places like the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>And, to make it worse, those places were situated on the main routes. People had to cross them to reach their destination.</p>
<p>If they were careless for even a moment, the dangers in those areas would crush their soul altar instantly.</p>
<p>He suddenly quieted down, not knowing whether he should laugh or cry, as the distance to his homeland seemed to be out of reach. The plan he had seemed impossible for now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to go back, you can use a very simple way. You don&rsquo;t need to travel all the way.&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame sent him its thought from his Sea of Consciousness.</p>
<p>Among the heaven flames, the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame didn&rsquo;t have the highest level, but it was ranked the third, which spoke for the fact of how mighty it used to be. In most cases, his perception of the situation was much better than the other flames.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes brightened a little bit. &ldquo;Which simple method do you mention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your understanding of space power can reach a profound realm, you can make a space bridge that connects your homeland and where you are. It&rsquo;s like a space tunnel.&rdquo; The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame regarded him. &ldquo;As long as you can sense that area and you know the general location, with a better understanding of space power, you can cross layers of spaces. It&rsquo;s just like when you built the Teleport Formation, you can connect the Grace Mainland and the Raging Flame Star Area directly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was struck, as light shot out from his eyes in amazement.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>The Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame had given him a simple solution, and it was the most likely to be successful. Space power was one of the most magical powers Upanishad in this era. People who cultivated this power Upanishad would face no difficult with space connection.</p>
<p>However, the preconditions were that his perception of space power Upanishad should reach a profound realm, and his competence should be formidable.</p>
<p>Shi Yan considered this possibility for a while and then cracked a smile. The most difficult problem that had troubled him seemed to be solved easily.</p>
<p>He calmed down, while the amethyst war chariot continued moving like a wild thunderbolt.</p>
<p>On this day, as he was trying to perceive the mysteries of space power with his eyes closed, he suddenly woke up, his face astounded.</p>
<p>A massive Moon Star appeared in front of him. The moonlight was radiating shiningly like running water diverging in so many streams, entering outer space and illuminating the life stars around it.</p>
<p>It was one of the moons he had seen when he was in the Glorious Amethyst Star. Together with two other moons in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, it brought light to eleven life stars. Its moonlight was bright and pure, keeping those life stars from the perpetual darkness. They would immerse in the clear but cold moonlight forever.</p>
<p>The moon in his eyes was round and big, as if it had filled both of his eyes. He was approaching the closest moon to him.</p>
<p>As he was getting close to the halo of that moon, he felt so refreshed and comfortable, as if a stream of cool river water was pouring on his head, chilling his entire body. He almost shouted with delight, as he felt so good.</p>
<p>Stretching both his arms, Shi Yan closed his eyes, starting to concentrate his thought to create a strong bond with his soul altar, which would help him gather more moonlight.</p>
<p>Both the Solar Star and the Moon Star were part of the immense sea of stars. To the Star power Upanishad, understanding the moon and the sun was required for advancing further.</p>
<p>In the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, he had used the Sun Original Essence to gain his own knowledge of how the Solar Star was formed and evolved. That was why he could collect the flaming solar energy and control the meteorolites in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, which helped him trouble the space pirates, whose realms were much higher than his.</p>
<p>Since the Sun was a part of stars in the sky, this encounter was a motivation for him to ascend his Star power Upanishad.</p>
<p>Likewise, the shining moon was a part of the stars as well. The perception of the formation and development of the moon, along with the varieties of the moon power were a part of the knowledge of the Star power Upanishad.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed still on the amethyst war chariot. His soul altar slightly trembled, as the Seal of Star power Upanishad was stimulated.</p>
<p>Shi Yan closed his eyes, relaxing his whole body to immerse in the water-like moonlight. He calmed his mind to learn and feel the clear but cold moonlight. He could realize how the energy was changing on that moon.</p>
<p>In his heart, his Sea of Consciousness, and his soul altar, an image of the moon appeared like its reflection in water. It floated while releasing the faint moon energy.</p>
<p>His aura became deep and seemingly ever-lasting. There was also a feeble beam of moonlight in his aura.</p>
<p>Gradually, the moonlight creeping on his body seemed to turn into real water, magically seeping into his body through his pores. An immense white halo appeared on his body, looking inexplicable and magnificent.</p>
<p>In this isolated outer space, under the shining moon, an amethyst war chariot hovered still like a massive purple crystal.</p>
<p>A man with stretched arms stood in the war chariot, as if he wanted to hug the shining moon. His face was passionate, as if he were possessed. Only the faint moon aura was seeping out of his body little by little.</p>
<p>Time seemed to stop at this moment. Under the bright moon, it looked a little bit strange.</p>
<p>More than ten one-thousand-meters long battleships made of bizarre white bones lined up in a spear formation, flying slowly by the moon.</p>
<p>Warriors with tremendous power guarded on each battleship. Many warriors were moving back and forth on the battleships. They were talking and laughing with each other; some were gambling or throwing their leftovers into outer space, making this place their garbage dump.</p>
<p>Many warriors on the battleships noticed Shi Yan&rsquo;s weird posture under the moonlight. They mocked and laughed at him with disdainful eyes. No one paid him any attention.</p>
<p>The battleships slowly came close to the amethyst war chariot, reaching ten thousand meters away.</p>
<p>Shortly, it was unknown why, but Shi Yan&rsquo;s amethyst battleship suddenly rippled with waves of purple light. Those waves carried sharp blue spots which expanded slowly. The feeble energy aura amplified billions of times in just a blink!</p>
<p>A cold, brutal female voice arose from the leading battleships. &ldquo;Move away from that amethyst war chariot. Quickly! It&rsquo;s the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion! Damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shout echoed to every battleship. The experts on all the battleships paled as if they had met a spooky ghost. They immediately urged their battleship to stay away from Shi Yan&rsquo;s amethyst war chariot.</p>
<p>What she called &lsquo;Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion&rsquo; seemed to come from Shi Yan&rsquo;s amethyst war chariot.</p>
<p>Chapter 761: Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly woke up as a terrible tremor was emitted from his amethyst war chariot. Instantly, the amethyst chariot cracked with so many fine slits, while a tremendously destructive power was about to burst off!</p>
<p>This terrifying energy was much fiercer than the Volcano Crystal Nucleus Zi Yao had used. It seemed to be able to blow off an entire life star! Inexplicably evil!</p>
<p>As though he had encountered spooky ghosts, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t have any time to think. Space power flew out of his soul altar, while the energy in his entire body was boosted to the acme instantly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s Space power Upanishad and the energy of outer space had created a marvelous resonance. At this moment, multiple fine space slits appeared near him, with five-colored lights sticking out.</p>
<p>Waves of space energy rippled in front of his eyes. He had urged all energies in his body, which made his body shrivel in just a blink. The third Sky of Rampage Realm was activated. His negative energy was urged, as Shi Yan recklessly stormed into layers of space splits. He wildly dashed towards the Moon Star in front of him.</p>
<p>The earth-shaking energy tremor under his feet had been stimulated to the max. The explosion that could tear the whole sky burst off abruptly!</p>
<p>In that instance, dazzling light beams shot out everywhere like the sharpest sabers.</p>
<p>The shockwave created by the explosion moved at a shockingly fast speed. Even Shi Yan, who had crossed the space slits, saw them getting shattered. A space energy flood that naked eye could see furiously spurted out of the slits.</p>
<p>Light bloomed, as if the sun or the moon was exploding. Billions of fierce light beams smashed the space slits behind him into so many fragments. That exploding energy was rumblingly bombarding behind his back.</p>
<p>Shortly, his back was torn into a mess, his dark gold bones getting exposed.</p>
<p>Shi Yan tried his best to urge the energy in his entire body. His soul altar was still spinning fast as he shot towards the Moon Star like a fading shadow.</p>
<p>The furious energy had burst off his back, waist, and nape. His tenacious body couldn&rsquo;t resist the mighty power of the shockwave. His soul was trembling, as he was intensely exhausted. He was put in a coma shortly, with a darkness swallowing his mind.</p>
<p>Under the Moon Star, the intimidating energy expanded like a vast sea, while light beams swept through the entire area. The battleships couldn&rsquo;t endure this brutal, formidable energy.</p>
<p>The battleship closest to the core of the explosion was fragmented in just a blink of an eye. Warriors from different races who were gambling and drinking on the battleship were turned into powder immediately, leaving nothing.</p>
<p>Even experts at King God Realm with God Bodies and God Domain couldn&rsquo;t escape the shockwaves. Although their God Bodies were tougher than rock or iron, they were still bleeding badly. Blocks of flesh were peeled off their bones, turning them into bloody skeletons. Only their soul altar could escape in that instant.</p>
<p>A brutal, wild shout arose from the leading battleship as a woman in black clothes appeared in the center of the explosion. She had an appealing body, accompanied by a frighteningly scarred face.</p>
<p>Waves of crystal-like energy rippled from her God Domain, strongly changing the principles of heaven and earth, creating a flood current which guided the energy generated from the explosion to one side. With a somber face, she continually urged her supernatural powers, pulling the tremendous energy created by the explosion towards the immense darkness.</p>
<p>The woman in black with a scarred face shivered in anger. She looked as ferocious as a wailing ghost, with indignation sparkling in her eyes.</p>
<p>Under her power, the furious energy flood generated from the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion was pushed aside, saving the other battleships from this fatal attack.</p>
<p>Only the first exploded battleship was now a total ruin. Besides the bloody skeletons in that area, soul altars were floating here and there, as a resentful aura shot out from them.</p>
<p>The impact of the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion had paled the warriors who were lucky enough to not get involved in this. They gritted their teeth with blood-red eyes, looking at the Moon Star like a pack of wolves.</p>
<p>This formidable explosion had smashed a one-thousand-meters-long battleship. Several hundred warriors at different levels were killed. Around twenty King God Realm experts had lost their God Bodies, leaving only their soul altars. Many materials carried on that ship were now mere powder, becoming a part of the space debris wandering in the dark universe.</p>
<p>The smell of blood permeated the area, which was so nauseating. Although they had lost their God Bodies, their soul altars were alright. Their God Souls hissed and cried mournfully like wailing ghosts. All of a sudden, they flew rapidly towards the Moon Star.</p>
<p>The woman in black was still floating in the center of the explosion. Her dark green eyes were as cold as sabers. A wild, furious murderous aura shot out from her, sending shivers down the other warriors&rsquo; spines.</p>
<p>The woman wore a cold visage. Each scar on her face looked like a small snake crawling under her skin. A flame of anger seemed to be ignited in her heart, as she looked ready to erupt at any minute like a volcano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; A handsome Third Sky of King God Realm expert in heavy dark iron armor kneeled down in the void. &ldquo;That man was sitting in an amethyst war chariot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black shouted ruthlessly like demons hissing and crying in Hell. Her voice pierced people eardrums. &ldquo;I want him alive!&rdquo; She roared through her gritted teeth.</p>
<p>The good-looking man in black iron armor had a heavy smell of blood about him, as if he had been soaked in the sea of blood for years. His armor had many blood stains as well. He nodded, then shot out like a bloody light, heading towards the shining Moon without saying anything.</p>
<p>On the barren Moon, the ground was silver, like some kind of metal, shining with a magical halo.</p>
<p>Shi Yan with his torn flesh body had almost turned into a bloody skeleton. His vessels and tendons were all broken, and some of his dark gold bones were also cracked. If it were a normal person, he would have died immediately.</p>
<p>However, his vitality was still there as he was lying quietly on the icy cold metal ground. His eyes were blurry while he was bearing the utmost pain to adjust his body&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>The amethyst war chariot suddenly exploded, creating the shockwave that could even crush a small-sized life star. Such a powerful explosion was something he had never seen before. Also, he had never thought that an explosion could reach such a level.</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t known the Space power Upanishad, and he hadn&rsquo;t urged all of his energy, which even hurt his soul to create the space slit, he would have turned into dust by now.</p>
<p>However, even if he had escaped rapidly, his body was almost crushed under the shockwave of that explosion. His soul altar was also damaged badly. At this moment, his consciousness was blurred, and he couldn&rsquo;t even rebuild his thoughts.</p>
<p>While he was still muddling and couldn&rsquo;t respond, he had fallen into that furious energy impact.</p>
<p>Shadows of ghosts roaring in the soul altar crossed the sea of cold moonlight, appearing in his view.</p>
<p>Those ghost shadows were the God Souls of the warriors who had lost their God Bodies. They were riding their soul altars as if they were riding horses, appearing one by one in his view.</p>
<p>The God Souls of the warriors acted as if someone had killed their parents. They were extremely resentful as they showed themselves one by one. The soul altar spun, as they were about to urge the God Domain to bombard him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was frightened.</p>
<p>A hunky man wearing heavy black iron armor suddenly intervened, shouting. &ldquo;Our boss wants him alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stream of dark energy was fired from his arms. Just like a gloomy long river descending from the sky, it covered Shi Yan&rsquo;s bloody body entirely.</p>
<p>Under that gloomy energy&rsquo;s effect, Shi Yan was lifted, without any room to wiggle. Even his Immortal Martial Spirit stopped healing his flesh and bones. Soon, he was brought to that man.</p>
<p>The God Souls sat neatly on their soul altars, looking at him just like a pack of hungry wolves. They hated that they could gnaw at his bones, crush him and swallow him wholly.</p>
<p>Under the binding of that dark river, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t move at all. He was forcefully dragged out of the Moon Star and brought to the affected area of the previous explosion.</p>
<p>Although his body&rsquo;s functions were all damaged, Shi Yan could see fragments of the battleship, along with pieces of bones and blood floating around. He could even smell the thick scent of blood.</p>
<p>Flows of energy that naked eyes couldn&rsquo;t see quietly surged and seeped into his body quietly.</p>
<p>Those were the beams of Essence Qi of the warriors who got crushed to death in that explosion. His Mysterious Martial Spirit was taking them in using a method that no one could detect. The energy was absorbed into his body, filling his acupuncture points with negative energy. The brutal, desperate, and resentful auras in this area had become so sharp and clear that they were able to affect people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>As he floated in the dark river, his acupuncture points automatically attracted the remnants of the energy, which made him understand their feelings before they died.</p>
<p>They were scared and desperate. They missed this world when they were about to die. And, they were extremely indignant!</p>
<p>Shi Yan squeezed a forced smile inwardly. He looked at his body, which was bleeding badly. At this moment, he couldn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not died yet, good! Very good!&rdquo; A savage female voice echoed not too far from him. In the next moment, the woman in black appeared in his view. This woman grabbed something in the void, and a flow of mysterious energy intruded Shi Yan&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>His soul altar didn&rsquo;t listen to him anymore. It trembled and flew out of his head, floating alone above his mutilated body.</p>
<p>He had so many wounds that went deep to the bones. Broken bones were stuck into his internal organs, while his tendons and vessels were cut. After his God Soul skimmed over his body, the damages he had were reflected clearly in his soul.</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t help but beam a wry smile. His God Soul sent him a distressed feeling. He gradually calmed down when his soul altar was still moving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the first glance itself, his God Soul was shaken on seeing the woman&rsquo;s appearance. He thought he had seen a wailing ghost from Hell, making him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black forcefully dragged his soul altar out of his head, her eyes focused on it. Suddenly, she exhaled in surprise for a second. Then, she shouted abruptly. &ldquo;All of you get out of here! Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many resentful warriors wanted to storm over. As they hadn&rsquo;t had time to check Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar, her shout made their soul tremble. They all hastened to flee away.</p>
<p>There was no one near her and Shi Yan. No experts dared to come close. This woman was clearly the commander of those battleships.</p>
<p>The dark green eyes of the woman in black sparkled with a strange light while they were gazing at Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar, astounded.</p>
<p>Chapter 762: Scarlet Mark!</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar was apparently different from the others. His soul altar also had three tiers. However, the second tier was divided into three sections.</p>
<p>Star, Space, and Death and Life power Upanishads were circulating in one section, while the other section held several heaven flames, which had formed a real shape. The last section was a dark place that looked like a black hole. No aura or energy fluctuation was detected there, giving people an inexplicably mysterious feeling.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul was floating above the soul altar. At this moment, his God Soul had turned into a hollow figure of himself. A miniature version of him, around ten times smaller, was sitting neatly like a gloomy shadow on the soul altar of powers Upanishad, heaven flames, and something mysterious.</p>
<p>The shadow of his God Soul was as faint as a ghost. A magical mark appeared in its glabella.</p>
<p>It was a scarlet mark created by five clusters of blood clouds.</p>
<p>This mark used to appear right at his glabella. When he had condensed the mysterious section of the soul altar, that blood-cloud mark, the Inner World Five Devils, and the Soul Gathering Pearl had fused into one, as the mark disappeared from his glabella. Together, they created the mysterious section in his soul altar.</p>
<p>Turned out that the mark had never disappeared, but imprinted in his God Soul as the prominent mark on his God Soul&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>Five clusters of blood clouds arrayed in a pentagon, which looked like an evil, peculiar sea of blood, portrayed deep in his God Soul.</p>
<p>What the woman in black was gazing at was the scarlet mark on Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul. Her dark green eyes showed a complicated emotion, as she was immersing in some perplexing memories.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to act rashly. He could feel an energy aura from this woman which made his soul feel empty. He believed that if she wanted to kill him, it would be like a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know of the mark&rsquo;s existence on the forehead of his God Soul or the fact that the woman in black was gazing at that scarlet mark.</p>
<p>After a while, the mysterious woman in black seemed to wake up. She looked at him strangely. &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He was baffled for a while before sending his soul thought. &ldquo;Can I return to my body first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can use your body again?&rdquo; The woman in black curled her lips, her face mocking. &ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s the God Body of a King God Realm warrior, with such damages, it will never be recovered fully. Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Shi Yan sent his soul thought.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness flickered. Shi Yan found that the force subduing his soul altar had retreated like the low tide. He gained control of his soul altar again.</p>
<p>The soul altar floated and turned into a bunch of lights, disappearing into his body.</p>
<p>Shi Yan opened his eyes, feeling the utmost pain in his body. He lied on his one side in the void, floating and trying to lift his head to look at the woman in black. He squeezed a forced smile. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding her head, the woman in black regarded him indifferently. &ldquo;I can see that. You know nothing. The other wanted to make you a sacrificial pawn. That person didn&rsquo;t want to spare your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes were cold, as rage was rolling in his heart.</p>
<p>He could confirm that the one who had touched this amethyst war chariot could estimate precisely that he would stop by the Moon Star. Also, that one knew the woman in black would pass by this area. That stealthy person had installed something terrible in his war chariot and triggered it.</p>
<p>That person&rsquo;s purpose was to kill him and damage that woman&rsquo;s battleships at the same time.</p>
<p>This was absolutely a big wild scheme. Someone was having so many plans to set him up and that woman in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, if it happened as what the other had planned,&rdquo; the woman in black was still calm, &ldquo;if the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion had completely burst off, you would have died. Nothing could have been left remaining. Some of my battleships would be crushed, and I would have some big trouble. Since you&rsquo;ve come using the amethyst war chariot, the chariot of Princess Zi Yao, I would pour this debt on Zi Yao, making her pay a big price for it&hellip;&rdquo; Shi Yan nodded, but his neck was torn painfully. &ldquo;Yeah, someone wants to trigger the grudge between you and Princess Zi Yao, making you and her stand on the opposite sides, which would make you take revenge on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; The woman in black mumbled, then asked all of a sudden. &ldquo;Who are you? Where are you from? How do you relate to Zi Yao? Why did you come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black seemed to be concerned about Shi Yan&rsquo;s identity more. A gleam of surprise crossed her green eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; Shi Yan was bewildered. He arranged his thoughts and then answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from a low-level continent. I&rsquo;ve been a member of Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s cortege not for a long time. I&rsquo;m holding the Purgatory Token Princess granted me. I&rsquo;m going to the Extreme Purgatory Field to train myself. My name is Shi Yan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A low-level continent?&rdquo; A strange light sparkled from her eyes. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Shi Yan nodded. &ldquo;In my continent, the strongest warriors are only at the True God Realm. Before, I came to the Raging Flame Star Area, I had never left my continent. As I&rsquo;ve gotten here, I got to know so many mysteries of the vast universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman in black looked at him for a while but didn&rsquo;t say anything. After a long time of staying quiet, she groaned something in her throat. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I didn&rsquo;t want to see this, either.&rdquo; Shi Yan tried to move his limbs in pain. He suddenly felt his body recovery starting again. His broken tendons and vessels slightly moved, as they were about to be connected.</p>
<p>The woman in black got lost in her thoughts, not paying attention to his body condition. After a while, she spoke up again. &ldquo;Who do you suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man called Ao Gera. I heard&hellip; he&rsquo;s Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s nephew. Ao Gu Dou favors him a lot. The Purgatory Token in my hand was supposed to be his. Perhaps he has a grudge because of it. He wants to kill me,&rdquo; Shi Yan answered without any hesitation.</p>
<p>This is his assumption, and he believed it was the truth.</p>
<p>He asked himself who he had provoked in the Glorious Amethyst Star. He didn&rsquo;t feel wicked intentions from anybody else but Ao Gera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gera, Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s nephew&hellip;&rdquo; The woman in black mumbled. Her dark green eyes sparkled as she harrumphed coldly. &ldquo;This kid doesn&rsquo;t treasure his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was scared. He could feel the brutal murderous intentions of this woman. Her murderous thought seemed to be as real as a fire that could burn everything.</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that Ao Gera had caused a big trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had a marvelous encounter, right?&rdquo; The woman in black pondered for a while and then asked suddenly. &ldquo;Your God Soul has a scarlet mark on the glabella. Where did you get that magical mark?&rdquo; Her eyes became evilly sharp, as if Shi Yan had to give her a proper answer, or she would kill him brutally. She would never give him the second chance.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was baffled.</p>
<p>After a while, he condensed a beam of Soul Consciousness and found the mark, which had disappeared before, on his glabella. However, this strange mark faded, and was about to disappear after the soul altar returned to the Sea of Consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it in our continent. Because of my special cultivating method, I didn&rsquo;t know I had it. Until now, I don&rsquo;t even know what it is. I don&rsquo;t know what it can do and what it represents.&rdquo; Pausing for a while, he looked at the woman in black without blinking. He vaguely realized that the reason why this woman hadn&rsquo;t killed him yet could be because of the mark. He should try to ask for more information.</p>
<p>The woman in black didn&rsquo;t answer. She still gazed at him, as if she wanted to detect whether he was lying to her or not.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to look around. He contemplated while looking at her, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>After a while, the woman snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, she didn&rsquo;t pay attention to Shi Yan anymore, flying away suddenly. When she approached her subordinates, she shouted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to the Extreme Purgatory Field. You take him with us. Put him in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buff man at the Third Sky of King God Realm in heavy dark armor slightly changed his visage. &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, he almost destroyed us all&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; The woman in black frowned.</p>
<p>The husky man in black armor shut his mouth. He flew over and dragged Shi Yan with him into the leading bone battleship. He threw him into a dark cell, speaking ruthlessly. &ldquo;Kid, although I don&rsquo;t know why my boss didn&rsquo;t torture you to death, you won&rsquo;t live for long. As soon as my boss changes her mind, I will make you taste all kinds of extreme tortures in this world. I will take revenge for my brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cell had no light, so it was completely dark, such that Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t even see his own fingers. The cell was protected by a fierce energy magnetic field. It looked like if Shi Yan touched it, it would blow him off instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, can I ask something? Who are you guys?&rdquo; Shi Yan asked while frowning in the dark cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloody Legion of Ma&rsquo;am Leona,&rdquo; The man in black armor harrumphed. He disappeared shortly, leaving no other words.</p>
<p>Shi Yan lay defenselessly in the dark cell. His face changed dramatically as a respectful feeling arose in his heart.</p>
<p>Bloody Legion, Ma&rsquo;am Leona&hellip;</p>
<p>He knew the other&rsquo;s identity now.</p>
<p>The Dark Firmament Divine Nation had five great feudal vassals ruling different areas. They were quite powerful, as they were the extreme Five under Du Tian Ji.</p>
<p>The five great feudal vassals were all mighty, expanding the territory of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. They were the legends, the formidable existences at the Original God Realm.</p>
<p>Only one woman stayed in that group of five, and the Blood Legion was under her command. In the Raging Flame Star Area, they had caused so many bloody cases. Compared to Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo, they were much more savage. They had destroyed so many life stars.</p>
<p>The evil reputation of this woman echoed around the Raging Flame Star Area. Even the Underworld League and the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce didn&rsquo;t dare to fight face to face with her.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji trusted her a lot. She had more of his favors than the other princes and princesses. She was a bloody saber of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, which could slaughter everywhere.</p>
<p>This woman was called Leona, the &lsquo;Bloody Night Brutal Devil&rsquo; female butcher, the leader of the five great feudal vassals.</p>
<p>Chapter 763: Demon Blood molds the body!</p>
<p>In the dark cell where Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t even see his own fingers, he was lying still, relaxing his soul to sense the changes of his body. A drop of scarlet Immortal Demon Blood broke inside his vessel. A blood-red halo expanded, turning into a magical recovery energy that flooded his bones, tendons, and flesh.</p>
<p>The speedy recovery of the Immortal Rebirth Secret depended both on the Immortal Martial Spirit and the Immortal Demon Blood. The more Demon Blood he had, the faster his recovery could be.</p>
<p>More than ten drops of Immortal Demon Blood turned into a pure fountain of recovery energy, murmuring in his entire body like his blood. Wherever the Immortal Demon Blood flowed by, his broken tendons and vessels received an enormous vitality, growing back vigorously.</p>
<p>Each of his tendons was many times tougher than cattle tendons, moving slowly and rhythmically. A bloody light shimmered at the cut section and turned viscous, connecting the vessels and tendons.</p>
<p>His fragmented bones grew back under the effect of the Immortal Demon Blood, creating a thick layer of hard bones. After that, his bones could gather the energy from his blood and flesh, and the pure energy from the Essence Qi ancient tree to work on the bone layers, making it tough like iron miraculously.</p>
<p>Each block of muscles in his body was covered in a blood-red liquid, which was full of vitality. His muscles were growing vigorously.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground, he didn&rsquo;t think about anything as he relaxed his mind and soul, just letting the Immortal Demon Blood work to restore his body.</p>
<p>If anyone saw him at this moment, they would find that he was covered in a shimmering blood halo. Veins and tendons in his entire body were shivering, while cracking sounds were echoing from his bones. It looked like his blood and flesh were filled with air. Every cell of his was revived.</p>
<p>The pain and fatigue he felt during the recovery process by the Immortal Demon Blood and the Immortal Rebirth Secret faded away.</p>
<p>After an unknown period, Shi Yan gradually woke up, feeling so weak. All of a sudden, he paled. However, not long after that, his eyes lit up as he cracked a bizarre smile in the dark.</p>
<p>The ruthless power of the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion had crushed one of Leona&rsquo;s battleships entirely. Several hundred warriors died on the spot, including at least ten King God Realm experts. Since they hadn&rsquo;t escaped, their bodies were destroyed, leaving only their soul altars.</p>
<p>After Leona&rsquo;s guard had dragged him to the center of the explosion, the Essence Qi of the dead warriors had flooded his acupuncture points while he was talking to her.</p>
<p>The way those flows of energy had been gathered and poured into his body was mysteriously discreet. Even Leona, an expert at the Original God Realm &ndash; the leading expert among the five great feudal vassals of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, couldn&rsquo;t detect any anomaly. She didn&rsquo;t know what he had gotten in his bloody pathetic situation.</p>
<p>Abundant energy rolled torrentially in his acupuncture points. Using his Soul Consciousness to check, Shi Yan could see the mysterious vortexes wildly spinning in his acupuncture points.</p>
<p>Amazing changes were happening in each of his acupuncture points, as the vortexes were rotating rapidly to extract the negative energy. From the center of the vortexes, bits of mysterious energy would appear continually. Once formed, beams of mysterious energy from the vortexes would fly out and become the source of greatly useful energy for his whole body.</p>
<p>Each of his seven hundred and twenty acupuncture points in his body seemed to turn into a mysterious world. They were filtering the Essence Qi of the dead and turning it into his mysterious but marvelous energy.</p>
<p>He lied on the ground still. However, he could feel the earth-shaking changes in his acupuncture points. It was like each of those tiny worlds had become the extension of his consciousness, a new world his soul could control.</p>
<p>Seven hundred and twenty new worlds hidden in his acupuncture points had the mysterious power to refill all of his energy.</p>
<p>The negative energy generated during the filtration process had flooded the acupuncture points and expanded them continually.</p>
<p>As his Soul Consciousness was moving in his acupuncture points, he seemed to be having some hallucination. He had become the only lord of seven hundred and twenty bizarre worlds in his acupuncture points. He could hold everything in his hand. He even felt that the mysterious mini-worlds in his acupuncture points seemed to be real.</p>
<p>They all were waiting for him to explore, feel, and harvest the mysteries they carried.</p>
<p>The dense negative mood rippled in the lake in his heart, generating brutal, desperate, fearful, bloodthirsty, and resentful feelings. The negative moods were like a dark abyss that could drag his soul into it, pushing him into insanity.</p>
<p>Since he had experience when this happened, he immediately held his breath and kept his mind from overthinking, maintaining a quiet and pure soul altar.</p>
<p>The icy cold air of the Ice Cold Flame changed in his thought. It quietly expanded, turning into a bright silver cold air that enveloped his God Soul.</p>
<p>The extremely cold aura stormed into his God Soul. His consciousness that was trembling due to the negative mood calmed down gradually. All of the vicious thoughts seemed to be frozen, preventing him from entering bedevilment.</p>
<p>His Sea of Consciousness seethed as it was supplemented. Flows of Soul Consciousness got longer and purer thanks to the heaven flame.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul trembled, as his soul altar spun like a windmill and accelerated steadily.</p>
<p>It seemed like Death and Life, Space, and Star power Upanishads in his power Upanishad tier had been trimmed and separated clearly. At the same time, a magical energy fluctuation expanded from this tier, making a marvelous connection with the ripples in his Sea of Consciousness. His soul was baffled, as he suddenly seemed to have a deep perception.</p>
<p>It seemed the cold moonlight of that moon star had connected the Sun Original Essence, the same way when he was in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>At this moment, he didn&rsquo;t even recognize himself. His God Soul seemed to have turned into a wandering ghost in the starry sky, taking a trip around to sense the heaven and earth energy, and the basis of different power Upanishads in the world.</p>
<p>Under this unconscious condition, his shattered body recovered at speed naked eyes could see.</p>
<p>Tendons and veins in his body were moving like worms. They wiggled and connected with each other, creating a complex drawing of vessels in his body.</p>
<p>Blocks of flesh and each of his muscles were filled with the mysterious energy. With the resonance of the muscles, his body bulged into a stocky look. He gradually became as tough as the most rigid stone and iron. Shi Yan could feel a bursting power in his body.</p>
<p>Bones in his entire body echoed cracking sounds as pungent, viscous substances oozed out of his pores. Those were the contaminants his Immortal Demon Blood had extracted from his body.</p>
<p>When a warrior ascended, he would take in a large amount of heaven and earth energy. Energy from the Divine Crystals, the broken Essence Qi ancient tree of the dead, and pellets all had the magical energy that was useful to the flesh body.</p>
<p>However, no matter what energy it was, it wasn&rsquo;t really clean, as it always contained dregs.</p>
<p>When a warrior refined his body, he must discharge these dregs out to purify his body. That was how he could facilitate the energies to move faster in his vessels.</p>
<p>Discharging the contaminants in the body was something the warriors had to do regularly. At any stage of cultivation, as long as a warrior still practiced his martial path, taking in energy from heaven and earth or from pellets would always generate dregs and contaminants.</p>
<p>Those dregs of energy would affect the flow of energy circulating in the body, which would create leaks. When the body wasn&rsquo;t clear enough, it wouldn&rsquo;t be tenacious, and external energies could seep into the body through these leaks.</p>
<p>The main activity in quenching the body was to discharge the dregs and contaminants.</p>
<p>When the Immortal Rebirth Secret rebuilt his body, one of the fundamental effects was eliminating the dregs in his body.</p>
<p>However, after each time of cleaning the body, new dregs would be generated when the warrior broke through the new realm or took in more energy. Hence, it would affect the circulation of energy in the body.</p>
<p>Thus, after so many times of quenching the body, a warrior could make his body tougher and more tenacious. At the same time, discharging the dregs was also necessary.</p>
<p>Those stinky viscous substances were the dregs of the body, a challenge to make his body more flexible and firmer.</p>
<p>While he hadn&rsquo;t recognized it, the Immortal Demon Blood and the Immortal Rebirth Secret had worked together to wash his entire body. They reduced the leaks, which prevented the external energies from seeping through his body.</p>
<p>Inside the dark cell.</p>
<p>Shi Yan lied quietly. His soul felt empty, as he was falling in a magical condition of learning power Upanishads.</p>
<p>His body had recovered, and was in a marvelous quenching process.</p>
<p>What had benefited both his soul and body was the mysterious energy overflowing from his acupuncture points. The mysterious energy filling his entire body had not only helped him recover his body, but also refined his blood and flesh like refining secret treasures.</p>
<p>As his soul was resisting the negative moods, it became tranquil, using the Upanishad perception to avoid falling into bedevilment.</p>
<p>However, his soul hadn&rsquo;t been benefitted much compared to the previous time.</p>
<p>After fighting with Yin Spirit of the Dark Clan, a new section that looked like the black hole in his soul altar had flown out and swallowed that man&rsquo;s soul altar, which made his soul altar sublimate. That flow of energy had similar effects as his Mysterious Martial Spirit.</p>
<p>The only difference between them was that the Mysterious Martial Spirit absorbed the energy of the dead, which was the body&rsquo;s energy, while the black hole-like soul altar section aimed at the soul, devouring them to create the energy which sublimated his soul altar.</p>
<p>Although they were two different methods, they both brought him great benefits, especially to sublimate his soul altar, providing a major help to the power Upanishads and heaven flames. At the same time, his God Soul also received the pure energy.</p>
<p>Staying in this completely dark cell, Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t disturbed, and nobody knew what he was doing. At this moment, he was temporarily forgotten.</p>
<p>Even Shi Yan&rsquo;s mind was empty. He hadn&rsquo;t recognized the changes happening in his body.</p>
<p>At this moment, a shadow that blended with the darkness appeared next to him in the cell.</p>
<p>A pair of dark green eyes gazed at him silently. She didn&rsquo;t say anything, just stood as if she were a part of the dark &ndash; the soul of darkness.</p>
<p>Chapter 764: The dawn of blood changing</p>
<p>A series of fierce explosion reverberated. The battleship trembled as if it had halted somewhere. Then, another rumbling explosion resounded.</p>
<p>Shi Yan woke up all of a sudden in his dark cell, his eyes shining like bright stars.</p>
<p>His body had recovered fully. No wound could be found on his bones, tendons, and flesh. Furthermore, his body had reached another level of tenaciousness.</p>
<p>In the dark cell, he couldn&rsquo;t see his body, so he could only use the Soul Consciousness to sense. Closing his eyes, Shi Yan observed quietly, a grin forming on his face gradually. His grinned then cracked into a loud, insane laughter, echoing in the cell.</p>
<p>He felt that this body quenching process had brought him unimaginable advantages.</p>
<p>Thoughts flickered in his mind. His body was as tough as iron or great stone, that nothing could crush.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what the God Body was like, but he thought that even if it were the God Body of a King God Realm expert, their unbreakable body would be only similar to his.</p>
<p>However, what made him laugh insanely weren&rsquo;t only the changes in his body. There was also his Essence Qi ancient tree and the new Immortal Demon Blood he had just condensed.</p>
<p>Experiencing the unexpected Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion, he had been hurt severely. However, with the aid from his Mysterious Martial Spirit, not only had Shi Yan recovered fully, but he had also gained big.</p>
<p>His Essence Qi ancient tree was full. Each crystal branch was filled with pure energy, shining like jades. Each detail of the branches was made of pure Essence Qi, carrying the surging, torrential energy.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure about his realm, but in this condition, he was sure that his Essence Qi had reached the Peak of True God Realm.</p>
<p>In other words, his Essence Qi had reached a new height, which was enough to help him break through the new realm.</p>
<p>And, he had the Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>Rebuilding the body had cost him ten drops of Immortal Demon Blood. He used to think that it was his loss this time. However, using his Soul Consciousness to check, he found that the Immortal Demon Blood drops he now had were fifty!</p>
<p>Fifty drops of Immortal Demon Blood! He had never seen this situation before. It seemed the Essence Qi from the dead had helped him tremendously. After it had filled his Essence Qi ancient tree, it helped him condense more Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>In the Grace Mainland, killing hundreds of Sky Realm or Spirit Realm warriors could only help him generate several drops of Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>The Essence Qi emitted after the True God Realm and King God Realm warriors died was much more than the previous two realms. As a result, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t press down his excitement.</p>
<p>When Bao Ao and Jie Ji told him that he could use the Immortal Demon Blood to replace his own blood, Shi Yan thought it would be impossible.</p>
<p>Today, he suddenly had an idea that since the Raging Flame Star Area had so many True God Realm and King God Realm warriors, his blood changing activity wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem.</p>
<p>Using the Immortal Demon Blood to replace his blood, he would reach a new height. As it was what Bao Ao and Jie Ji had shared with him, he believed the other two didn&rsquo;t just babble.</p>
<p>As he was the man who bore the Demon Blood, he was clearer about its mysterious and mighty feature than the other two. If he could fill his body with Immortal Demon Blood one day, Shi Yan believed that he would have a tremendous transformation.</p>
<p>Slowly sitting up, his eyes brightened. Shi Yan hesitated for a while, then shot out a drop of scarlet Immortal Demon Blood from his fingertip.</p>
<p>A thought popped up in his mind. He sent his soul energy into that drop of Immortal Demon Blood and urged it with his secret technique. A face of a man appeared in his God Soul. It was Shi Jian.</p>
<p>The Immortal Demon Blood ignited. A magical energy fluctuation shot out from it, tore through space, and flew rapidly in outer space at an unimaginable speed.</p>
<p>It seemed he had formed a connection with Shi Jian. However, this connection was vague, as if it had encountered many layers of hindrance.</p>
<p>Not long after that, a drop of his Immortal Demon Blood was burned completely, leaving no energy remaining.</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t create the complete connection with Shi Jian or sense his Great Grandfather in the Grace Mainland.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t distressed. However, his eyes lit up as he laughed dryly.</p>
<p>Of course, a drop of Immortal Demon Blood couldn&rsquo;t cross the endless space through several star areas to reach the Grace Mainland.</p>
<p>What if it weren&rsquo;t just a drop of Immortal Demon Blood? If he used more than ten drops of Immortal Demon Blood, would he be able to locate Shi Jian&rsquo;s location, his situation, or even&hellip; create a soul connection with him.</p>
<p>He grinned, confirming this assumption himself.</p>
<p>Shi Yan thought that the Nine Serenities Soul Devouring Flame&rsquo;s suggestion was absolutely possible.</p>
<p>Once his Space power Upanishad reached a new realm, when he used the Immortal Demon Blood to connect one of his relatives in the Grace Mainland and verify their location, he could use his great power to create the space passage, which could bring his family and friends in the Grace Mainland to the Raging Flame Star Area. This would overturn the problem that had troubled the Grace Mainland for so many years.</p>
<p>Shortage of energy?</p>
<p>The Raging Flame Star Area had so many life stars, and any of them could help the warriors continue their cultivation. They could use the enormous natural energy to create their God Bodies and break through to the King God Realm.</p>
<p>Also, they had different kinds of pellets and the Source of Power Upanishad Inheritance. All of these could be the best chances for his relatives on the Grace Mainland to enter a new height, becoming his solid support in the Raging Flame Star Area. Perhaps, one day, they could be strong enough to be the rival of the three mighty forces in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>Right when he was still laughing weirdly, a shout came from outside. &ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slit of light appeared in the dark where people couldn&rsquo;t see their own fingers as the door was opened.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was bewildered for a while. He halted his stupid laughter and walked out, appearing in the vision of one of Leona&rsquo;s subordinates.</p>
<p>When the hunky man wearing heavy dark armor turned around, he was stunned. His eyes reflected his disbelief. He gazed at Shi Yan without blinking. &ldquo;You&hellip; Your body&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled, moving his wrists, which caused some cracking noise as he glared at the man. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sh*t, you&rsquo;re a monster!&rdquo; The man mumbled, his face frightened. &ldquo;You can recover such severe damages. Even a King God Realm warrior, if he got damaged like that, he would choose to leave the body, finding a host somewhere or just be reborn. How could you recover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Shi Yan understood his uniqueness. He just smiled. &ldquo;I just had some good fortune. I also had divine medicines to treat the wounds. It&rsquo;s normal that I could recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divine medicines?&rdquo; The man was astounded. His eyes flared up for a while, then he nodded begrudgingly. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a medicine like that indeed. It can recover the God Body to the normal state. However, you are only at the True God Realm. It&rsquo;s not normal, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan just smiled and didn&rsquo;t talk more.</p>
<p>The beefy man scrutinized him for a while, but couldn&rsquo;t find any possible reason. He then didn&rsquo;t talk more, and just snorted. &ldquo;Madame wants to see you. I&rsquo;m waiting for her order to kill you. I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was indifferent without a gleam of fear. &ldquo;If Madame Leona wanted to kill me, I couldn&rsquo;t have lived until this moment. You will be disappointed. I won&rsquo;t die, but instead, will live vigorously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know why he always felt that he and that female butcher shared something originally. It should be related to the scarlet mark in his God Soul. Anyway, that butcher didn&rsquo;t explain anything, and Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t ask her for more information, although he was kind of skeptical.</p>
<p>The hunky man led him out of the prison. While walking, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t help but look at the dark doors on the two sides of the passage. Each of those big doors was carved with complex patterns and drawings, including flames, clouds, or water. Those patterns seemed to have some functions, just like barriers or restrictions to seal the world behind the door.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t sense what was behind those dark doors. Relating to his situation, Shi Yan vaguely thought that each door of them was used to imprison someone.</p>
<p>He pondered for a while and asked. &ldquo;What is in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo; The brawny man grinned fiendishly. &ldquo;Prisoners of the empire, space pirates, bandits, thieves, and insane serial killers, etc. They will be the grinding burrs of the Extreme Purgatory Field. If you can join the Extreme Purgatory Field, they will become your opponents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised, asking for more. &ldquo;Are they related to the Extreme Purgatory Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hold the f*cking Purgatory Token but you don&rsquo;t know what the Extreme Purgatory Field is?&rdquo; The beefy man&rsquo;s eyes were odd. &ldquo;Are you even from the Raging Flame Star Area? Too ignorant, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan beamed a dry smile, but he didn&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>The man had walked to the end of the passage. He waved, not wanting to discuss more. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve arrived at the Purgatory Star. If Madame lets you live, you will join the Extreme Purgatory Field. Then, you&rsquo;ll know what benefits you can receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While talking, the man walked out. Shi Yan followed him closely.</p>
<p>A dark light flashed as he appeared on the main deck of the bone battleship. This spooky green bone ship was quite strange, releasing a freezing blood aura.</p>
<p>Hundreds of warriors were standing on the deck of the ship. Their auras were strong, but not hurried. A thick smell of blood emitted from those warriors, gathering into a blood flood current that couldn&rsquo;t be seen with naked eyes, twirling around their body.</p>
<p>Shi Yan discolored. He had a feeling that he was swimming in the blood sea of Hell. He felt so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Members of the Bloody Legion under Leona&rsquo;s commands were all insane butchers with bloodlust as their natural feature. They wandered around the Raging Flame Star Area, causing bloody instances that startled people on countless life stars. No one could count how many people they had killed till now.</p>
<p>Those warriors had a bloodthirsty aura. Since they had killed so many people, their bloody murderous aura was so thick that it could affect the warriors&rsquo; souls directly.</p>
<p>Standing on the deck of the battleship, Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul was uneasy. He believed that someone with a weak mind would have his knees softened in this place. His realm would decrease dramatically, which would prevent him from generating the fighting will.</p>
<p>Standing in front of those warriors was a figure in black. She stood still, looking into the far distance, as though she was waiting for something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame&rsquo;s waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man pointed forward. His back was upright as he stood like tough rock. His eyes looked at that woman in black with the hottest admiration and respect.</p>
<p>In his eyes, that woman in black was his Goddess.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, passing by each warrior that looked like block of bloody rock, his eyes raking here and there.</p>
<p>Chapter 765: Purgatory Star</p>
<p>The sky here was pitch-black, without any sun, moon, or stars. Black ink water seemed to hover thickly in the sky, hindering all kind of lights. The cold and isolated aura permeated everywhere.</p>
<p>Further in their vision were mountains jutting up to the sky. However, they were carved and portrayed spookily. They looked as ferocious as the strong demon beasts in the Dawn of the planet, which could shake people&rsquo;s souls.</p>
<p>The ground was full of red blood. A bloodthirsty aura and the thick scent of blood invaded the whole land.</p>
<p>Leona stood on the main deck, looking like a wailing ghost of this Purgatory Star. She seemed to be waiting for something.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was discreetly careful. He sauntered to behind her, looking at her back and speaking respectfully. &ldquo;Greetings, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona didn&rsquo;t turn around, still looking at the far area ahead of her. &ldquo;How is your condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m recovered fully. No damage. It&rsquo;s because of your grace.&rdquo; Shi Yan slightly bent his body, his eyes focusing on her.</p>
<p>Standing near Leona were three other young warriors. One of them was at the Second Sky of King God Realm, and the other two were at the First Sky of King God Realm. They all wore pitch-black clothes, which had a dark sun crest &ndash; the unique mark of Leona.</p>
<p>The Second Sky of King God Realm warrior was a Dark Clan female. Although her appearance wasn&rsquo;t that outstanding, her body was mesmerizingly appealing. At the same time, her aura was quite intimidating.</p>
<p>The other two were young human males. From their similar appearances, they must be brothers. These two had a barrel-chested, muscular body, with haughty faces indicating they didn&rsquo;t want to be controlled.</p>
<p>The reason why Shi Yan observed those three was neither because of their realms nor their special appearances. It was because all three of them wore a token on their waist, which had the drawing of a bloody crown &ndash; the Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Apparently, these three were like him. They were going to join the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>When he observed these three, they were also looking at him with a disdainful face. They obviously looked down on him.</p>
<p>Especially the Dark Clan&rsquo;s woman, who pursed her lips while talking faintly. &ldquo;Only at the True God Realm. Trash! Once he gets into the Extreme Purgatory Field, he&rsquo;ll soon be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona snorted.</p>
<p>Those three young people quieted down. Their eyes were somber, slightly bending their bodies as if they were waiting for her advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will do after you get in there. In short, the one who can kill the most must be one of you three.&rdquo; Leona suddenly turned around. Her dark green eyes raked through the three young people. &ldquo;If you lose my people, even if you can come out alive, I will kill you myself. I will destroy your clan too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three people shut their mouths. They immediately kneeled down on one knee, stooping. No one dared to talk anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man will join the Extreme Purgatory Field as well. You guys pay attention to him.&rdquo; Leona pointed at Shi Yan and shouted her order. &ldquo;In the Extreme Purgatory Field, if you encounter him, you can kill him. However, remember this, if he has to die, he must die in your hands. Whoever else dares touch him, skin them and draw their bones out for me! Confine their souls and torture them to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three nodded instantly. Their eyes looked at Shi Yan with a bloodthirsty visage.</p>
<p>Shi Yan shuddered inwardly. His face was cold as he stooped and grinned fiendishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s men, don&rsquo;t show mercy. Kill them all. Especially Ao Gera, if you see him, bring his soul to me&hellip; I&rsquo;ll treat him myself,&rdquo; Leona shouted.</p>
<p>The two were shaken as they got stirred up immediately. Their eyes became blood-red, full of fighting will.</p>
<p>While Leona was talking, hissing sounds came from ahead of them. Not long afterward, ten-meters long war chariots appeared one by one in front of them. A handsome warrior in the leading war chariot pitched his voice. &ldquo;Greetings, Madame Leona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona nodded, gazing at Shi Yan. She pulled something in the air, and a white bone war chariot flew over. She got in the chariot and talked to her warriors. &ldquo;Get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three members of the Bloody Legion, who were going to join the Extreme Purgatory Field, got in the war chariot without saying a word.</p>
<p>Leona frowned, sweeping her eyes over Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded, his face indifferent. He walked to the war chariot as well.</p>
<p>His view became wider after he got into the war chariot. He suddenly found that only this white bone battleship appeared in the Purgatory Star. The other ships had disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Leona touched the void, and a beam of pitch-black light fell on the white bone battleship under their feet. Prison cells suddenly flew out of the battleship, each cell covered with a dark shadow. Around fifty cells floated in the air, looking like small suns.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness flickered. A gleam of fright flashed in his eyes as he looked at Leona.</p>
<p>He suddenly recognized that at the moment Leona used her power and her God Domain, her body was covered entirely in the darkness, as if she had disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Dark Domain!</p>
<p>A beam of magical light crossed his brain like lightning. In the next moment, he vaguely got something. Dark Upanishad! It was the Dark power Upanishad!</p>
<p>Shi Yan was shaken. He suddenly released why he felt that he and Leona had something in common. Because, the Dark Upanishad the woman had was totally the same as the War Devil in his ring!</p>
<p>However, War Devil couldn&rsquo;t make the Dark Upanishad reach that status. Anyway, War Devil was just a puppet, a clone of Lao Luo. Since it didn&rsquo;t have a soul, it would never be able to touch the essence of the Dark power Upanishad</p>
<p>Leona was different. She had reached the Original God Realm, so her perception and understanding of the Dark Upanishad wasn&rsquo;t something the War Devil could compare with.</p>
<p>However, the attribute of their power Upanishad and aura was the same. But, one was endlessly intimidating, while the other was much weaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Madame Leona,&rdquo; Warriors on the dark iron war chariot bent their bodies to greet her loudly.</p>
<p>Leona nodded as they white bone war chariot dashed forward rapidly. Around fifty clusters of dark light followed her like dark clouds. They were the cells controlled by her Dark power.</p>
<p>Apparently, those warriors were the receptionists. They led the way while Shi Yan and Leona were behind them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan then saw ranges of thousands of meters tall mountains, which were cut into the shapes of ghosts and monsters. This group of rock ghosts and monsters looked ferocious, with an evil, bloody aura. They appeared under the bone chariot, zoomed out, and disappeared.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Shi Yan saw another battleship by a three thousand meters tall mountain range. This one was made of platinum, shining dazzlingly in this dark Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems Rochester&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; Leona glared at the platinum battleship, then shifted her look away, talking indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. Sir Rochester arrived here the first. He&rsquo;s been idle here for half a month.&rdquo; The receptionist smiled, trying to earn her favor. &ldquo;Besides Sir Rochester, Sir Carthew and Sir Da Lei have come. Until now, only Sir Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s still on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes flared up strangely.</p>
<p>Besides Leona, Ao Gu Duo, and Da Lei, Rochester and Carthew were the other members of the five great feudal vassals of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>The five great feudal vassals guarded five different areas. To expand the territory of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, they engaged in bloody fights every day, building and expanding the endless divine nation. They were considered the five great pillars of the divine nation.</p>
<p>Among the five great feudal vassals, Leona had the strongest force. Ranked the second was Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s, followed by Rochester, and Carthew. Da Lei, the one Shi Yan had met, was placed the last among the five. His force was the weakest.</p>
<p>The ranking of the five great feudal vassals didn&rsquo;t always stay the same. Depending on the land they could occupy, and the merits of their subordinates, their rankings would be classified transparently.</p>
<p>Rumors said that at the beginning, Leona had been ranked the last. When she became a feudal vassal, she had received severe criticism, saying that she wasn&rsquo;t eligible.</p>
<p>It was Du Jian Ji of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation who had supported her, giving her a chance to show her competence. Finally, she stood firmly on the last position among the feudal vassals.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t let Du Tian Ji down, making all who had criticized her shut their mouths. Shortly, after one hundred years, she had used bloody brutal deeds to contribute to the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. She had expanded the Dark Firmament Divine Nation&rsquo;s territory. From the last position among the feudal vassals, she now topped them all. She became the never-ending legend of the divine nation.</p>
<p>Today, she had used her attainment to gain fame. In the divine nation, no one dared to criticize or look down on her. Whenever they mentioned her, they would do it with admiration, respect, and fear.</p>
<p>Shortly, a ten-thousand-meters tall mountain range situated on an area over hundreds of miles wide appeared. It looked like a savage beast crouched on the ground. The rough cliffs were as sharp as thick fangs. The aura bursting out of this area was intimidating and tyrannical. At first glance, it could shake people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Simple palaces built of blood-like rocks were present on the highest summit of this mountain range. The mountain was hollowed out with many pitch-black caves. Resentful, evil grunts, roars, and cries came out of those caves.</p>
<p>After Leona came here, the Dark Domain on her body moved slightly. Floating cells behind her rolled into those caves like black rubber balls.</p>
<p>Many warriors were waiting at the entrance of the caves to receive the prisoners from those cells.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t pay attention to those caves, just standing on the white bone war chariot while looking at the spacious square on the highest mountain. Some warriors were waiting there.</p>
<p>Shi Yan followed her line of sight. As soon as he looked at the square, he spotted Da Lei and Da Meng. Besides them, there stood some other young people. Each of them had humongous auras, wearing the Purgatory Token on their waists. Apparently, they were going to join the extreme training course in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahaha! Madame Leona, finally you&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for so long.&rdquo; An extraordinarily handsome middle-aged man in luxurious clothes stepped out of the group, laughing happily. He looked somewhat similar to Du Feng.</p>
<p>Leona didn&rsquo;t move. She just nodded, driving the white bone war chariot towards the square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; That middle-aged man sighed. His eyes raked through four people standing behind Leona, asking skeptically. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s not correct. Your Bloody Legion has only three quotas. Why do you have one extra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This middle-aged man seemed to be one of the managers of the Extreme Purgatory Field. He understood the rules well, so he was astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t from my Bloody Legion.&rdquo; Leona snorted, pointing at Shi Yan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s subordinate. I met him on the way here, so I just gave him a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zi Yao&rsquo;s subordinate?&rdquo; The old man became more astounded. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they choose Ao Gera from their internal meeting? How come they changed the participant all of a sudden? Weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 766: Undercurrent</p>
<p>Not only was this middle-aged man surprised, besides Da Lei and Da Meng, most of the warriors here showed a bewildered face. All of a sudden, they all paid attention to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gera has a good Uncle. He doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about having a quota for the Extreme Purgatory Field. Zi Yao spent her quota for another one to train the new elite force for the divine nation. What makes you surprised?&rdquo; Leona was calm, raking through those people on the mountain while speaking coldly.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man beamed a faint smile and nodded. &ldquo;As long as he has the Purgatory Token, he can join the Extreme Purgatory Field. It&rsquo;s the rule. Whoever will join, I don&rsquo;t actually care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, little buddy, long time no see. I didn&rsquo;t expect that we would meet again shortly.&rdquo; Da Lei suddenly stepped forward with his smiling face.</p>
<p>Da Meng stood next to him. He contemplated for a while and then grinned, nodding at Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, his visage relaxed. He smiled at the two, as if they had had a good relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da Lei, you know this boy? What&rsquo;s his background?&rdquo; A man wearing plain cotton garments with rough appearance asked loudly. &ldquo;I remember no one named Shi Yan in Zi Yao&rsquo;s cortege. Hasn&rsquo;t he just followed Zi Yao recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he said that, many people put on a strange visage.</p>
<p>Especially Da Lei, he was uncomfortable. Of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell the others that his son got subdued by a stranger. He just smiled begrudgingly. &ldquo;When Zi Yao passed by my place, she brought Shi Yan to be my guest for a few days. That&rsquo;s how I know him. Shi Yan, this little buddy isn&rsquo;t weak. Haha! Moreover, he&rsquo;s progressing rapidly. Two years ago, when I met him, he was just at the Second Sky of True God Realm. I didn&rsquo;t expect that when I meet him again, he would have reached the Third Sky of True God Realm. It&rsquo;s Zi Yao and our empire&rsquo;s grace, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Da Lei said was somehow serious.</p>
<p>Not many warriors standing on this square had actually known Shi Yan and his secrets. Even Leona didn&rsquo;t know that Shi Yan could use the Soul Burial Ground.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when that mysterious expert appeared in the Raging Flame Star Area, he had shown an invincible power, making many life stars fall in misery. If they had ever heard about the legends of that expert, once they felt that Shi Yan had something to do with that one, of course, they would highly appreciate him.</p>
<p>Da Lei thought that Shi Yan was quite lucky and excellent that he could go with Zi Yao and survive the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>Da Lei admired Zi Yao, as she could have such a mysterious escort. Since he knew the hidden things, although he didn&rsquo;t like Shi Yan &ndash; he even hated him a lot&ndash; he didn&rsquo;t dare to underestimate this young man anymore.</p>
<p>When people were watching Shi Yan, he was also eyeing them, discreetly putting up his guard.</p>
<p>Standing next to Leona and Da Lei, the middle-aged manager of the Extreme Purgatory Field in front of him was at the Peak of King God Realm. Since he looked much similar to Du Feng, Shi Yan guessed that this man perhaps was also a member of the royal family, Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>And, he noticed two other people almost right when he stepped on the ground.</p>
<p>One of them was the rude middle-aged man in plain cotton garments. Since Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t sense his cultivation base and aura, he should be the same as Leona and Da Lei, an expert at the Original God Realm.</p>
<p>With his understanding of the five great feudal vassals, this man should be Rochester, who was ranked right behind Ao Gu Duo. He was also a brutal and combative character.</p>
<p>The other one was young, good-looking, and coltish. His face was white, accompanied by a slender body. He should be one of the five feudal vassals, Carthew.</p>
<p>He was also an Original God Realm expert. Among the five feudal vassals, he was titled &lsquo;White-faced Bloody-handed.&rsquo; Besides Leona, he was the youngest among the feudal vassals, and also a great legend of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>Although he had earned fame and powers when he was still young, Carthew was born a humble kid on an ordinary life star. At the first time he had received the power Upanishad in the Source of power Upanishad Inheritance, he had started to show his talents. Then, he enrolled in the military of the empire and started his life on the battlefields. His performance was so dazzling, which helped him earn the glory of being a feudal vassal.</p>
<p>Carthew had the worst background among the five. However, he had used his own power to reach the peak little by little. Eventually, he became a strong feudal vassal.</p>
<p>Carthew just smiled tenderly from the beginning, his visage mild and gently just like a teacher, who didn&rsquo;t give the others any dangerous feelings. They would instinctively relax in front of him and get charmed by his gentle aura.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of the other forces outside the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, he was truly a demon. He had swaggered for so many years in outer space, hunting down countless space pirates and marauders.</p>
<p>Countless corpses of space pirates had built his foundation, making him stand firmly in the divine nation. Whenever they mentioned his name, space pirates would always be hostile.</p>
<p>There was an unwritten saying space pirates shared with each other that whoever could kill Carthew would immediately become the only leader of the space pirates.</p>
<p>However, until now, Carthew had still run amuck around outer space, chasing and killing space pirates. He had robbed the pirates to collect a great deal of properties for the empire.</p>
<p>Wherever he passed by, space pirates would be petrified.</p>
<p>Until now, he still lived his life casually, while the space pirates always shivered on seeing him.</p>
<p>Marauding the marauders, his cruel deeds and ruthlessness weren&rsquo;t something ordinary people could think about and apply.</p>
<p>Carthew just smiled and said nothing. However, his phoenix eyes, which looked like a beautiful woman&rsquo;s eyes, often glared at Leona with a strange gleam.</p>
<p>Shi Yan observed for a while and felt weird. From the way Carthew looking at the other, he seemed to have some unclear feelings for Leona. It looked like he liked her a lot.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was baffled. He couldn&rsquo;t help but turn around, his eyes gliding over the woman standing next to him. A beam of strange thought flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>This woman was a legend in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, with bloody, brutal deeds. She was a noble person though. However, her appearance&hellip;wasn&rsquo;t any more beautiful than a wailing ghost.</p>
<p>Did Carthew have a special fetish? Was she his type?</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet. We need to wait for him for several days more. He sent me a message saying that he would be here in seven days max. Yeah, he said he got some stuff along the way here, which delayed him,&rdquo; The middle-aged man explained softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo is making himself important, huh? He dares make me wait for him!&rdquo; Although the others didn&rsquo;t say anything, Leona started to cause trouble with a cold face. Vicious hatred filled her dark green eyes.</p>
<p>Among this group, only she dared to scold Ao Gu Dou. It was because she was much stronger, and her bloody force was the mightiest force in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. Even though she wasn&rsquo;t patient, no one dared to comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Leona, please calm down. Sir Ao Gu Duo has something that delays him. He said that when he comes here, he will make it up for you,&rdquo; The middle-aged man smiled dryly, continuing to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see how Ao Gu Dou could make up for this.&rdquo; Leona swung her arm, and couldn&rsquo;t help but speak up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rest. When Ao Gu Duo comes here, tell him to come and talk to me face to face. Harrumph! I have something to discuss with him anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on Shi Yan, as if she had implied something.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was astounded. He immediately got that she would trouble Ao Gu Duo because of Ao Gera&rsquo;s dark trick, which destroyed one of her battleships.</p>
<p>While frowning, Shi Yan suddenly realized that he would be a witness, and that he would have to stand up and criticize Ao Gu Duo and Ao Gera.</p>
<p>However, it was obvious that they didn&rsquo;t have enough pieces of evidence. They actually had nothing to prove that Ao Gera had done that. And, they couldn&rsquo;t make it related to Ao Gu Duo either. Would that woman prepare to scold and force the others to accept their crime?</p>
<p>Leona excused that she was tired after a long trip, bringing the three young warriors under her command and leaving arrogantly. They stayed in a palace on this mountain.</p>
<p>This palace had a dark sun symbol. It seemed like the palace belonged to her. She didn&rsquo;t pay attention to Shi Yan. After they got into the palace, she intended to keep a distance from him, saying nothing.</p>
<p>Right after Leona had left, many warriors on the square started to scatter. Rochester, Carthew, and Da Lei brought their people and left to their own palaces. Each of them had a private place on the mountains of this mountain range. They had shown up here to show their respects to Leona.</p>
<p>Not long after Carthew had left, on the way to his palace, he suddenly stopped, turning around and waving at Shi Yan. &ldquo;Buddy, if you don&rsquo;t mind, why don&rsquo;t you come and drink with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this spacious, grand mountain range, warriors had all scattered, and no one had thrown Shi Yan an eye. Even the middle-aged manager didn&rsquo;t have any intention to arrange a room for him.</p>
<p>As Zi Yao wasn&rsquo;t here, Shi Yan had no one to ask for information. Leona seemed not wanting to talk to him much. For the time being, he became an outsider.</p>
<p>While standing alone there with no clue about where to go, Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes brightened up on seeing Carthew waving at him.</p>
<p>Looking here and there, as Shi Yan found that no one noticed them. He frowned, then relaxed, beaming a smile. He didn&rsquo;t care how bad Carthew&rsquo;s reputation was, walking directly to him and clasping his fists from a far distance to greet the other. &ldquo;Then, I won&rsquo;t be too polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Carthew laughed. He asked his retinue to leave, then walked Shi Yan to his private palace.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, blue crystal palace. As soon as the man appeared, his maids came to receive him. Each of them was around twenty years old. They all looked inviting, with exposing clothes. They had just a thin silky fabric sheet on their bodies. People could see their private areas from time to time.</p>
<p>The maids served them good wine and food. Inside the blue crystal palace, Carthew was sitting on his chairman&rsquo;s seat, smiling warmly while raising his glass. &ldquo;Come here, come here, drink with me, buddy. Don&rsquo;t be too polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was skeptical, as he didn&rsquo;t know why Carthew wanted to drink with him. He had never met this man before, so they didn&rsquo;t have any relationship.</p>
<p>And, he was just an unknown character in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation without any reputation. Most importantly, he was marked as a member of Zi Yao&rsquo;s retinue. It was impossible that Carthew wanted to recruit him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned inwardly.</p>
<p>Chapter 767: Kill a chicken with a butcher&rsquo;s knife</p>
<p>Inside the blue crystal palace, beautiful maids moved around, serving them good food and wine. Carthew and Shi Yan were drinking unceasingly.</p>
<p>Carthew was a man who loved wine as much as his own life. He knew so many good wines like the back of his hand, explaining them to Shi Yan nonstop.</p>
<p>Which wine was purely good, which wine was burning like a passionate flame, etc&hellip; Different good wines needed to be stored in different containers and conditions. Also, he was telling how the method of drinking them was another interesting thing to learn.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t a sort of man who paid attention to details. He just nodded while putting up guard, as he didn&rsquo;t know what this man wanted to ask him.</p>
<p>Carthew and Shi Yan had never been close. Today was the first day they had met each other. Generally, the other shouldn&rsquo;t care about him that much.</p>
<p>However, in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, Shi Yan was just a stranger with no reputation.</p>
<p>Although he was a famous character, compared to the members of the five great feudal vassals like Carthew, he was nothing, and he wasn&rsquo;t worth his special treatment.</p>
<p>Serving the other without a reason, if he weren&rsquo;t deceitful, he would be surely a robber. In Shi Yan&rsquo;s thoughts, Carthew should have some other intentions.</p>
<p>Indeed, when they were in the middle of their drinks, Carthew lowered his glass, his extraordinarily handsome face blushed like a beautiful woman. He laughed deliberately. &ldquo;I have two things I can&rsquo;t explain. I hope you can help me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan straightened his back, his face serious. &ldquo;If I can explain, of course, I won&rsquo;t conceal. For the good wine you&rsquo;ve treated me, I will tell you everything I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Carthew was happy. &ldquo;I heard that Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo had talked to you in person when you were in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. Then, he disappeared from there. He has given up chasing after you and Zi Yao. I want to know what you and Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo had discussed back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan changed his visage while he shuddered inwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to be tense. I&rsquo;m just curious. I don&rsquo;t want to arrest you or interrogate you.&rdquo; Carthew waved his hands, telling him to not to be surprised. &ldquo;With my position in the divine nation today, I have many relationships with the outer space pirates. Perhaps, you&rsquo;ve heard about it. I&rsquo;ve stepped on their corpses to reach this high position. That&rsquo;s why I always have a special concern about those space pirates. Of course, I have many insiders in their organizations. Also, many pirates will sell me intelligence. They want me to stay away from their business. It&rsquo;s normal that I know about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan could relax a little bit. He took a deep breath while frowning, his face severe. &ldquo;Sir, if you ask me something else, I will not conceal. However, I&rsquo;m sorry that I can&rsquo;t tell you about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew slightly squinted, as a flash of electric current appeared in his eyes. &ldquo;Alright, I won&rsquo;t chase you about this stuff anymore. We should talk about another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please ask, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand Leona well. She isn&rsquo;t the sort of people who will poke her nose into the other&rsquo;s business. I don&rsquo;t know why she let you get on her battleship.&rdquo; Pausing for a while, Carthew&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;As far I&rsquo;ve known, before Leona got here, one of her battleships was destroyed, and several hundred warriors had died. Would you tell me what had happened? Is it related to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s brows slammed together. Hesitating for a while, he said calmly. &ldquo;Madame Leona&rsquo;s wrecked ship does relate to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Please elaborate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I departed from the Glorious Amethyst Star on an amethyst war chariot. When I passed by the Moon Star, an extreme explosion occurred. It seemed someone had installed a Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion in my chariot. The energy explosion had smashed Leona&rsquo;s battleship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew discolored in fright. He slightly trembled and then continued. &ldquo;Only the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce can fabricate that toy. It&rsquo;s so incredible. Even a small life star couldn&rsquo;t withstand it. It would crush the life star to powder. If warriors under Original God Realm are dragged into the Dark Magnetic Deadly Explosion, both their God Bodies and soul altars would be ripped apart. If I were in that situation, I would be hurt badly. How did your amethyst war chariot have such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Shi Yan beamed a forced smile.</p>
<p>Carthew suddenly quieted down, gazing at Shi Yan. He was bewildered for a while and then frowned. &ldquo;If that explosion was set for you, it&rsquo;s a miracle that you could survive. I&rsquo;m not amazed at the explosion. What surprises me a lot is that how could you survive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leona isn&rsquo;t a merciful person. Or else, she couldn&rsquo;t have her current attainments. I feel weird that even if you aren&rsquo;t the main cause, her battleship exploded because of you. With her bad temper, she would skin you alive. How could you&hellip; stay alive until now? &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I think you should ask Madame Leona. Even I don&rsquo;t know why. I&rsquo;m curious too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew sank in his thought for a while and then smiled oddly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t explained either of my two questions fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha! Sir, do you think that you&rsquo;re wasting a good party on me?&rdquo; Shi Yan answered deliberately, his face calm and natural. He didn&rsquo;t reveal a beam of fear.</p>
<p>Carthew shook his head. &ldquo;Drinking alone, even if you are drinking good wine, doesn&rsquo;t taste good. Sharing is a good drinking virtue, you know?&rdquo; Pausing for a while, he waved his hand, talking casually. &ldquo;You can stay in my place. When Ao Gu Duo arrives, the training of the Extreme Purgatory Field will begin. You have to join it right away. Although you didn&rsquo;t help me out with my suspicions, I won&rsquo;t be so mean to you. You can use my good wines here at will. No need to be too polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you in advance, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minor stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Shi Yan then stayed in Carthew&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>This palace had some different training rooms, and it even had a one-hundred-times-heavier gravitational room. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t care about the situation out there, as he entered the room and cultivated alone.</p>
<p>At the Third Sky of True God Realm, the effect of normal gravity on him was too little. However, this one-hundred-times-heavier gravitational room was quite useful for him, although walking in this room was extremely hard.</p>
<p>His body had been trained to the acme, making it tougher than iron and heavier that rock at the same volume. In the gravitational room, the weight he had to bear would be increased accordingly.</p>
<p>This gravitational room had many rocks of different shapes. Those rocks had some small holes and concave areas, that warriors could use to lift them up. All of them were heavy. Some weren&rsquo;t big, but their mass was formidable like a mountain.</p>
<p>Staying in the gravitational room, Shi Yan used those rocks to practice.</p>
<p>Sitting neatly on the stone ground, Shi Yan squinted. His body was soaked in sweat. Not long after that, he stood up robustly, thrusting his hands deep into the concave spots on the rock. He didn&rsquo;t use the Essence Qi, just his physical strength to lift the rock and then dashing madly inside the gravitational room.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, he was exhausted. His body looked like it was congested. Veins bulged under his skin like worms, giving him a savage look.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wanted to check his limit. Those heavy rocks in the room were dozens of times heavier. Even though he had reached the Third Sky of True God Realm, moving them was a little difficult.</p>
<p>And that was how his potential power was stimulated. The energy hidden in his body would be pressed by the extreme gravity, making him shiver.</p>
<p>It was another time of insane training. Shi Yan had no sliver of power in his body by now, lying like soft pulp on the ground. He closed his eyes to feel the robust vitality in his blood and muscles, while thoughts traveled fast in his head. He suddenly got an idea.</p>
<p>He got up immediately, focusing and urging dozens of drops of Immortal blood in his body towards the left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack Crack Crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bones on his left arm resounded with a cracking sound. His body enlarged fiercely. Just like a dormant beast, an intimidating flow of energy expanded from him.</p>
<p>The Immortal Demon Blood replaced his blood in his left arm. An extreme pain struck him from the veins. His arm turned into a red hue, such that it looked like his blood was seeping through his pores. His arm felt like it was boiled. That bloody hue seemed quite frightening.</p>
<p>He dashed forward rumblingly. A flow of brutal energy expanded from his arm, just like a savage beast struggling to get out of an abyss.</p>
<p>He lifted a dark golden rock on the ground using the fierce energy on his arm. A flow of scarlet light emitted from his body, generating a savage and furious power.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was cheered up. Joy filled his heart as he laughed crazily.</p>
<p>This dark gold rock was a relatively big one in this chamber. It was the Extinct Gold Stone, a particular stone in the Raging Flame Star Area which was hundreds of times heavier than normal rock.</p>
<p>The weight of the rock in his hand could be compared to a thousand-meters-tall mountain!</p>
<p>And, inside this gravitational room, the weight of this big chunk was increased dozens of times!</p>
<p>It was almost impossible for a King God Realm warrior to lift this rock. When one reached the Third Sky of King God Realm, perhaps they might be able to try.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had tried to lift this rock using only his physical power. However, after several attempts, he couldn&rsquo;t move it even an inch.</p>
<p>However, today, when he used the Immortal Demon Blood to fill his left hand, the bursting energy of it had helped him lift up the hefty rock. Such exploding power had frightened him as well.</p>
<p>After that moment, Shi Yan had a deeper understanding of the blood exchange Bao Ao and Jie Ji had mentioned.</p>
<p>If he could replace blood in his body with the Immortal Demon Blood, how tremendous could his body&rsquo;s bursting power be?</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t even dare to imagine that.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The big rock fell on the extremely rigid ground. On the spot where the rock fell, the ground was suddenly cracked and shattered. Cracks that naked eyes could see extended from under the rock.</p>
<p>Those cracks extended continually. Explosion resounded from the big rock as chips shot out everywhere like the sharpest blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh f*ck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A forthright voice came from the door of the gravitational room. A taut man who had the Purgatory Token on his waist came in. Flows of light emitted from his hands, crushing those chips, his face strange.</p>
<p>A delicate woman walked next to him. She coldly looked at Shi Yan, who was exhausted, sitting by the big rock.</p>
<p>She also had a Purgatory Token on her small waist.</p>
<p>These two were Carthew&rsquo;s subordinates, the famous warriors that would join the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Chapter 768: Hiding weaknesses by keeping quiet</p>
<p>The two of them stood by the door, watching the rock chips fill the ground. They couldn&rsquo;t hide the surprise on their faces, their eyes odd.</p>
<p>So many rock chips appeared around the Extinct Gold Stone. Cracks on the ground were as thick as spider webs. From the location of that big stone, cracks covered almost the entire room, which startled people.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was created by the impact when the Extinct Gold Stone rumblingly fell on the ground. Unlike Shi Yan, these two people were familiar with this gravitational room and the formidable mass of the Extinct Gold Stone.</p>
<p>He was just a warrior at the True God Realm, but he was able to lift a chunk of Extinct Gold Stone and create such situation. Those two people used to look down on Shi Yan, but now, they became serious. A streak of fear flashed in their eyes when they looked at him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was totally exhausted, lying on the ground. He didn&rsquo;t move, just frowned and assessed those two. He didn&rsquo;t try to talk to them first.</p>
<p>He understood that the other two came here to train as well. Perhaps, they didn&rsquo;t know that Shi Yan was in there.</p>
<p>The Purgatory Token on their waist showed their identity. They were Carthew&rsquo;s subordinates who were going to join the Extreme Purgatory Field. They should be outstanding characters as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps, these two were famous in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You created this situation?&rdquo; The forthright man couldn&rsquo;t help but ask surprisingly. &ldquo;Tough, man! You are only at the True God Realm, but you can create such a commotion. Not bad, really! No wonder why you can join the Extreme Purgatory Field. I used to think that Princess Zi Yao sent you here just to fill her assigned number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you use other forces?&rdquo; The delicate woman smiled coldly, her eyes skeptical. &ldquo;If you use the Essence Qi, you still can lift that Extinct Gold Stone. Not a big deal. I have never seen a True God Realm warrior without a God Body lift an Extinct Gold Stone like that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was suspicious, her face disdainful, and her mouth mocking faintly.</p>
<p>Each character that could join the Extreme Purgatory Field was an outstanding warrior in his or her force. They were all the talents that had performed well during this period.</p>
<p>Each of them had their own pride. Instinctively, they assumed that they were the strongest. When they saw someone stronger than them all of a sudden, their first reaction wasn&rsquo;t to recognize, but to be suspicious.</p>
<p>Hearing her, the forthright, taut man was also astounded for a while, as he began to be skeptical as well.</p>
<p>He wondered that even for himself, without using the Essence Qi and only using the physical strength of his God Body, it would be really hard to lift up that Extinct Gold Stone. Thus, he didn&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>Shi Yan lied on the ground, without showing any change. He just smiled faintly and explained nothing. He understood that he didn&rsquo;t need to explain.</p>
<p>The others were Carthew&rsquo;s people. They didn&rsquo;t walk the same way with him. When they got into the Extreme Purgatory Field, perhaps they would become rivals. If they would become each other&rsquo;s rival, it was better to hide his real competence. That was how he would have a better chance to survive.</p>
<p>When one could conceal one&rsquo;s competence, the others would underestimate him in a battle. This could pave the way for a marvelous change in the results.</p>
<p>To Shi Yan, who had experienced so many battles, of course, he knew what to do. He pondered for a while, using the others&rsquo; words as he smiled and replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I used the Essence Qi in my body. Using only my physical strength, I can&rsquo;t lift up that Extinct Gold Metal. I just wanted to check how heavy this stone is. I did. It&rsquo;s really heavy, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve overestimated yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delicate woman showed that she understood, then snorted and relaxed her tense countenance. Perhaps, what Shi Yan had said had helped her keep her confidence up.</p>
<p>If Shi Yan had admitted that he had used only this body power to lift that Extinct Gold Stone, which she couldn&rsquo;t even move, it would have smashed her confidence, making her feel like a loser.</p>
<p>Shi Yan hiding his talents relaxed her, keeping her confidence high. When she looked at Shi Yan again, her visage was still cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, mate,&rdquo; The beefy man cracked out laughing. &ldquo;People who come to the gravitational room to train won&rsquo;t use the Essence Qi, idiot. If you want to use Essence Qi here, you better not go. Because, you will gain nothing from it, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan tried to smile begrudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, how did you push Ao Gera out?&rdquo; The muscular man was suddenly interested in him. &ldquo;That man called Ao Gera&rsquo;s very famous in our Dark Firmament Divine Nation. After so many years, his speed in cultivating still makes many people bow to him. Even us two have to agree that we can&rsquo;t beat him in this field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I&rsquo;m not as excellent as him?&rdquo; The dainty woman was cold and infuriated. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lucky that he has a good uncle. The time is right, and geographical and social conditions are favorable for him as well. If he were like us, having no strong background, I don&rsquo;t think he would be stronger than me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yalan, admit it. That Ao Gera&rsquo;s a genius.&rdquo; The beefy man laughed. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve followed Sir Carthew, we&rsquo;ve had many favorable things too. We can use his pellets and other resources at will. He has never been stingy. Talking about external resources, what we have isn&rsquo;t worse than what Ao Gera has. However, he&rsquo;s much younger than us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; The fine woman called Yalan snorted.</p>
<p>Shi Yan grinned, looking at these two as he thought they were interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivate!&rdquo; Yalan rolled her eyes at the man standing next to her, as if she didn&rsquo;t want to discuss more. Her clothes suddenly ballooned as a flow of fierce energy bloomed out from her body. Then, she aimed at a big rock next to her, swinging her arm and throwing that rock away.</p>
<p>The muscular man beamed a hollow laugh. He didn&rsquo;t talk more and started to work out in this gravitational room. Energy surged through his body as he was showing his powerful energy.</p>
<p>These two didn&rsquo;t use their God Domains, the soul altar, or the Essence Qi. They were using the energy accumulated in their bodies.</p>
<p>These two were at the Second Sky of King God Realm. They all had attained God Bodies, with robust vitality and blood Qi. They looked like ancient monsters transformed into humans. Their physical strengths were tremendous.</p>
<p>Shi Yan lied on the ground, watching everything silently. His eyes gradually became severe.</p>
<p>Watching discreetly for a while, Shi Yan was frightened on seeing how formidable the flesh body of the King God Realm warriors with the God Bodies was.</p>
<p>He could confirm that even his body, which had been quenched through many challenges, couldn&rsquo;t gain the upper hand in fighting against these two, unless he used the power of the Immortal Demon Blood, just like the time he put it in his left arm.</p>
<p>Such powerful and bursting energy could be enough to smash the confidence of those two, who had used only their physical power now. However, the Immortal Demon Blood in his body was just enough to strengthen one arm. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to make his entire body more vigorous.</p>
<p>Of course, with the status and his way of cultivating, once he could break through to the King God Realm and get a God Body like those two, he believed that he would gain the absolute domination in a combat of physical strength, even without the Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>He had a strong belief in his body&rsquo;s bursting energy. Facing warriors at the same realm, no matter they were the Monster Clan or the Demon Clan who were famous for having a tenacious body, Shi Yan was confident that he could defeat them all.</p>
<p>Carthew&rsquo;s two subordinates were training themselves in the gravitation room. Shi Yan took a break for a while, then stood up, using the special features of this room to practice.</p>
<p>This time, he didn&rsquo;t use the power of the Immortal Demon Blood, but his own body strength to move the big rocks.</p>
<p>Even so, the bursting power of his body was tremendous. At least, the bodies of the experts at the same realm couldn&rsquo;t compare to his.</p>
<p>As they were in the same room, Yalan and Tie Mu, of course, paid attention to him. Although they had disdained him, after a while, they were surprised as they got a deeper understanding about Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan, in his Third Sky of True God Realm, had earned their respect, even though he didn&rsquo;t use the Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>From them, Shi Yan got the information of the Extreme Purgatory Field. Now, he could understand its situation better.</p>
<p>The so-called Extreme Purgatory Field was the other half of the Purgatory Star. It was unknown why warriors staying deep in that area would have a better sense of heaven and earth power Upanishad. From time to time, after a period, that Extreme Purgatory Field would generate a magical energy fluctuation from deep down underground.</p>
<p>That energy&rsquo;s fluctuation would cover the entire area of the Extreme Purgatory Field. At that time, when the warriors got in there, their sensibility of the heaven and earth power Upanishad would be enhanced formidably.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was quite helpful for warriors to cultivate and break through there.</p>
<p>Whenever this time came, they would put the prisoners from around the Purgatory Star, ominous people, killers, and space pirates captured by the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, in the Extreme Purgatory Field, where they would become the prey of the contestants.</p>
<p>Making those prisoners their prey, the contestants would use their power Upanishad and comprehend their powers better. This area would facilitate their progress greatly.</p>
<p>Through hunting those villains, contestants had to battle continually to train their fighting skills. At the same time, they could have chances to understand power Upanishads. Usually, they could break through to the next realm under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Of course, there wasn&rsquo;t an explicit division.</p>
<p>The divine nation had a rule that when the time was over, if the prisoners in the Extreme Purgatory Field could survive and get a Purgatory Token, no matter what crime they had committed, they would be exempted and gain a new life.</p>
<p>That was why participants would not stop hunting them. At the same time, those villains would try to kill the contestants to survive and earn a new life.</p>
<p>That made the Extreme Purgatory Field a bloody place. Every time, from the beginning until the end, countless people had to die. The survivors could be the contestants or their prey. The villains could have a chance to create a new life. The contestants could have the most precious battles for their advancement, and even rewards from the divine nation.</p>
<p>Chapter 769: Mutually losing face</p>
<p>Shi Yan was cultivating ascetically in the gravitational room together with Yalan and Tie Mu. Whenever they took a break, they would chat about the situation of the Extreme Purgatory Field. Through these two, his knowledge of the Extreme Purgatory Field became better.</p>
<p>After Yalan and Tie Mu found that Shi Yan could use his True God Realm cultivation base to train in the gravitational room, they didn&rsquo;t mock or provoke him anymore. They had stopped considering him as a small character.</p>
<p>However, his good days didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>On this day, while he was exhausted after a period of cultivation, he suddenly heard someone shouting. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Shi Yan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next moment, a flow of intimidating energy wave came from the square out there. Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t reacted, yet Yalan and Tie Mu jolted up immediately, their faces frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Shi Yan was astounded, asking hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Ao Gu Duo,&rdquo; Jie Mu was anxious. &ldquo;Why does he want to find you? From his voice, I think he wants to condemn you. Did you offend him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; Then, he stood up, frowning as he walked out of the gravitational room.</p>
<p>A two-meters-tall beefy man stood on the square. He was wearing a dark brown armor, which made him look as formidable as a savage deity. There were two other warriors wearing the Purgatory Token, standing next to this muscular man. Besides them, Ao Gera, who Shi Yan had met in the Glorious Amethyst Star, also stood there.</p>
<p>Carthew, Rochester, Da Lei, and Prince Du Tian Le also stormed out of their places. Du Tian Le was the younger brother of Du Tian Ji &ndash; King of Dark Firmament Divine Nation. He was the handsome middle-aged man who was in charge of receiving the feudal vassals from everywhere that Shi Yan had met when he had just arrived here.</p>
<p>That man clasped his fist with a smiling face, talking to the muscular man. &ldquo;Sir Ao Gu Duo, why do you shout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Shi Yan?&rdquo; The brawny man that was as formidable as a Demogorgon shouted. His brutal eyes scanned the crowd. Warriors in his line of sight frowned, as they were all afraid of him.</p>
<p>Ao Gera suddenly smiled, brightly pointing at Shi Yan from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turns out you&rsquo;re that traitor!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo laughed ruthlessly. He grabbed something in the void, and a flow of energy like an immense sea rose up torrentially, covering Shi Yan in just a blink.</p>
<p>As Shi Yan was still exhausted from his training, he had no time to recover or respond. That flow of energy covered him and held him up, bobbing high above people&rsquo;s heads. He was tied entirely, not able to urge any bit of his powers.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo was one of the five great feudal vassals, with endless supernatural power at the Original God Realm.</p>
<p>Compared to him, Shi Yan was only at the True God Realm. They were two whole realms apart. Under the man&rsquo;s attack, Shi Yan had nothing to resist.</p>
<p>As that energy was binding him, Shi Yan&rsquo;s Essence Qi ancient tree seemed to be sealed. It couldn&rsquo;t circulate even a beam of energy. At the same time, his soul altar was hindered by a thin membrane, preventing it from rotating.</p>
<p>This was the true God Soul confinement! Ao Gu Duo was savagely infuriated as he laughed brutally. &ldquo;Boy, you dared to join Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo to attack Princess Zi Yao? The reason why I&rsquo;m late is that I had to stay and investigate this. I know everything now. I want to show you what&rsquo;s the big price for planning a wild scheme on Princess Zi Yao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo? What the heck you are playing?&rdquo; Carthew frowned, his face cold. He scolded the other. &ldquo;Shi Yan has the Purgatory Token. I&rsquo;ve checked it. Princess Zi Yao granted him the token. Since the Princess gave him the token, she must have verified him before she did that. You should stop talking nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Da Lei just frowned and said nothing. His face was dark. No one knew what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Rochester, one of the five feudal vassals, was composed, as if he was watching everything with interest. Obviously, he didn&rsquo;t want to join this argument.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Du Tian Le screamed, &ldquo;Sir Ao Gu Duo, did you mistake him? Since Shi Yan has the Purgatory Token, it proves that he has gained Zi Yao&rsquo;s trust. Zi Yao will never give the token to someone who has planned to harm her. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha. I&rsquo;ll make you guys be sincerely convinced!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo grinned fiendishly, waving his hand all of a sudden.</p>
<p>From a place pretty far from them, a shadow was dragged to them by some invisible force. Shortly, he appeared in people&rsquo;s sights. He floated face to face to Shi Yan in the void.</p>
<p>That was a young human man. He was good-looking, but his eyes were anxious. Seeing Shi Yan, he was astounded for a while and then screamed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him! He had contacted Ka Tuo and disclosed Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s whereabouts. That&rsquo;s why we could chase and blockade Princess Zi Yao in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was cold, looking deeply at that man with a stern countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This man is a henchman of Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo. I met this man in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, where he had served Ka Tuo. I had never thought that he would stand up and criticize me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly felt chilled. He knew someone was trying to harm him. As that one couldn&rsquo;t kill him in the Moon Star, he now had another wicked plan.</p>
<p>His eyes couldn&rsquo;t help but fall on Ao Gera, showing an uncontrollable resentment and indignation.</p>
<p>It must be related to Ao Gera!</p>
<p>He was so sure about this. For the time being, he realized that perhaps it was also related to Ao Gera that Zi Yao was ambushed. With this thought, his heart sank into the abyss. Shi Yan understood that this mess was really serious.</p>
<p>The others were well-prepared. They even brought a witness. Apparently, they wanted to put him to death!</p>
<p>No one could know the relationship between Shi Yan and Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo. Also, he was sure that no one could overhear the conversation between him and Ka Tuo in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field.</p>
<p>Maybe someone was worried that his scheme would be disclosed soon. He wanted to get rid of all the related persons, and Shi Yan was the most dangerous factor that he should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shi Yan became the victim in Zi Yao&rsquo;s event. He got involved, but he knew it all now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more do you have to say?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo laughed brutally. &ldquo;We got the witness here to tell everything related to Zi Yao&rsquo;s ambush. Let me see how you can deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is related to me, why did Princess Zi Yao give me the Purgatory Token? If I wanted to kill her, would she get out of the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field alive? Why did Ka Tuo suddenly give us up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan contemplated, then defended himself, looking at Ao Gu Duo without any fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, you do know how to talk well. Haha! You earned Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s trust to facilitate your bigger scheme!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo beamed a faint smile. &ldquo;Getting to the Purgatory Star and joining the Extreme Purgatory Field is one of your conspiracies. You are a traitor. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve planned. Anyway, killing you first is a good thing to do to prevent everything else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flow of massive energy squeezed Shi Yan. Shi Yan suddenly felt so painful, as if a whole mountain was pressing down on him.</p>
<p>The bones in his entire body shivered, as if he could explode at any minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Carthew suddenly opened his mouth. A flow of sharp energy shot out of him, falling on Shi Yan. A wild energy covered Shi Yan, creating a lot of invisible gaps. That was why Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t exploded instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carthew, what did you shout? I&rsquo;m going to kill the empire&rsquo;s traitor. What does it matter to you?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo shouted, his face ruthless.</p>
<p>Carthew wasn&rsquo;t scared at all. He just smiled coldly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s subordinate. If he must be executed, Princess Zi Yao will handle it. Ao Gu Duo, aren&rsquo;t you trying to poke your nose in someone else&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew, Ao Gera, is the Princess&rsquo; escort. I&rsquo;m going to eliminate the traitor on behalf of Zi Yao. Who says I&rsquo;m interfering with the other&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo didn&rsquo;t talk more. He grinned fiendishly and was about to kill Shi Yan. &ldquo;A traitor at the True God Realm, I can kill him at any minute. When Zi Yao asks about this, I will give her a proper answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Ao Gu Dao roared. His energy surged like a collapsing mountain. He was about to kill Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Carthew paled, as if he was hesitant whether he would battle with Ao Gu Duo in this square to save Shi Yan. At that moment, his force relaxed a little bit.</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt tense the second time, as if so many invisible hands were strangling him. His breathing became strenuous.</p>
<p>In front of Ao Gu Duo at the Original God Realm, Shi Yan knew his realm was too low. Even if he could use all of his powers, he wasn&rsquo;t Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s match. He would never have the chance to get rid of this.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes, gazing at Ao Gu Duo and Ao Gera. He bit his lips and squeezed out a scarlet drop of blood. His eyes were filled with wicked resentment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An earth-destroying dark energy came from nowhere, covering his entire body. Instantly, he felt like he was put back to his dark cell. He couldn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>However, his painful body was relaxed in the dark. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t feel pain anymore.</p>
<p>The tremendous flow of energy that came from Ao Gu Duo was washed away like the low tide. It disappeared shortly, as the aura Ao Gu Duo put on him was swept away.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s angry voice came from outside. &ldquo;Leona, why does it matter to you? You shouldn&rsquo;t poke your nose in the other&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I interfere in your business. So what?&rdquo; Leona&rsquo;s cold and wicked voice arose.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Shi Yan suddenly heard Ao Gera screaming painfully, as if someone had just slapped him in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leona, you hit my nephew? Do you want to fight with me?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo was enraged, shouting and screaming wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I think I need a lesson.&rdquo; Leona was still composed. &ldquo;Ao Gera tried to harm me. I want to capture him. You&rsquo;re his uncle. Perhaps you&rsquo;re involved in this too. I want to investigate both of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, the darkness was suddenly lifted.</p>
<p>The power controlling Shi Yan disappeared, leaving no trace at that instant. Shi Yan now floated in the air. He stooped and found Leona and Ao Gu Duo facing each other. There was no surging energy in them. However, their eyes had ignited with an unknown flame of endless fighting will.</p>
<p>The blonde Ao Gera had blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. One of his cheeks had a bloody handprint. He was so mad, his eyes full of grudges as he was looking at Leona.</p>
<p>That woman didn&rsquo;t even glare at Ao Gera. Her stiff mount showed her bloodthirsty and cold intentions. It looked like she could devour the light around her. Her surroundings slowly darkened, until not even a single beam of light remained.</p>
<p>Chapter 770: Within one hundred years, I will take the head on your neck!</p>
<p>Leona and Ao Gu Duo were opposing each other with equal harshness, as if they could battle at any minute.</p>
<p>Since they were both feudal vassals of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation, they had to compete every day. Not long after Leona became a feudal vassal, she had suppressed Ao Gu Duo to become the strongest commander, with the strongest force among the feudal vassals. This irritated Ao Gu Duo a lot.</p>
<p>Today, Leona had interfered in his dealings with an anonymous kid. In his eyes, this was naked provocation!</p>
<p>Experts with a status and position like him would never let anyone provoke him like that. Thus, he was enraged. He would take Leona to make everyone understand that he was the top feudal vassal of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>In front of their confrontation, many people kept their mouths shut.</p>
<p>Carthew, Rochester, and Da Lei were calm and silent. They just watched, not bothering to give them advice or dig things further, as if they also wanted to see who was stronger.</p>
<p>In this place, the only person who could talk was Prince Du Tian Le. However, his realm was a little low, only at the Third Sky of King God Realm. While the two were facing each other fiercely, he had to stay away, as he was afraid that he would be involved in their battle.</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt pain in his whole body. He looked down with deep hatred and resentment in his eyes.</p>
<p>In front of so many people, Ao Gu Duo had restrained him and given him a possible crime. He almost couldn&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>Too humiliating!</p>
<p>Since he had revealed his talents in the Grace Mainland, he had never been humiliated like this. The anger in his heart right now was inexplicable. However, Shi Yan understood that with his current realm, he couldn&rsquo;t resist Ao Gu Duo to take his face back.</p>
<p>The time he had spent in there was too short. He hadn&rsquo;t mingled well in this star area. Without an organization and his realm being low, he didn&rsquo;t even have the right to voice here.</p>
<p>Quietly watching what was happening under his feet, Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes gradually become resolute. His enthusiasm had been triggered.</p>
<p>He needed time!</p>
<p>He strongly believed that if he had enough time to grow, one day, he would make all of those who had disdained him shiver in fright. He would make Ao Gu Duo regret and pay a big price for what he had done to him today!</p>
<p>When the other two&rsquo;s confrontation was tense, Prince Du Tian Le suddenly screamed. &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone couldn&rsquo;t help but look at him, including Leona and Ao Gu Duo, who were about to attack each other. They all stopped, frowning at him and waiting for him to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King says, no confrontation.&rdquo; Du Tian Le was holding a special metal token with a crown carved on it in his hand. It didn&rsquo;t look like silver or gold. He caressed the crown and touched it again.</p>
<p>A flow of magical soul fluctuation shot out of the crown, which diverged and then fell on Leona and Ao Gu Duo respectively. The two then quieted down and bent their bodies, as if they were listening to the King&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Not long after that, the soul fluctuation from the crown in Du Tian Le&rsquo;s hand gradually vanished. At this moment, Leona and Ao Gu Duo stood upright, glaring at each other, then snorted at the same time.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le laughed evilly. &ldquo;As the five great feudal vassals are all here, we can start the Extreme Purgatory Field&rsquo;s training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly pitched his voice, then threw the crown in his hand into the air. A magical energy scattered, falling on the Purgatory Tokens on the waists of all the contestants. At the same time, clusters of light shot out from the surrounding monster-shaped mountains one by one.</p>
<p>Each of the clusters confined an extreme inmate, flying towards an area far from this square.</p>
<p>Shi Yan skimmed over and found at least two hundred prisoners with different realms being delivered to somewhere. The lowest realm among them was the First Sky of King God Realm. Some were even at the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base. They were being dragged towards the Extreme Purgatory Field under an unknown force.</p>
<p>A magical energy fluctuation emitted from the Purgatory Token on his waist. It seemed like some seal had been lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone with the Purgatory Token can join this competition. The Purgatory Token on your waist is the key to entering the field. Once you get in the Extreme Purgatory Field, you can&rsquo;t get out before the time is up.&rdquo; Du Tian Le lifted his head and explained slowly. &ldquo;There are no rules in the Extreme Purgatory Field. You can kill anyone! Prisoners, contestants, even your partners! At the end, who kills the most will have a chance to meet the King and receive the rewards. The tokens on your waists have the life sensing power. You can detect your prey&rsquo;s location with its help. Assess your power, then choose your preys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona and Ao Gu Duo didn&rsquo;t talk, just quietly listening to Du Tian Le.</p>
<p>No one knew what Du Tian Ji had told them using his soul energy. But, the two hostile feudal vassals had calmed down and said nothing. It seemed like Leona had never hit Ao Gera, and Ao Gu Duo had never set up any conspiracy against Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Carthew, Rochester, and Da Lei were busy giving advice and making arrangements for their people. Shi Yan noticed that Da Meng also had a Purgatory Token on his waist. Apparently, he was one of the contestants.</p>
<p>Da Lei was his father. He used to have two quotas, which he had assigned to two warriors under his command. He had another arrangement for Da Meng, which was Zi Yao&rsquo;s quota.</p>
<p>But, it failed. Thus, Da Lei had no other way around but to make one of his subordinates hand back the token, so that Da Meng could join the Extreme Purgatory Field to train himself.</p>
<p>Besides Da Lei, Ao Gera also had one token.</p>
<p>His token was granted by his Uncle Ao Gu Duo. Ao Gu Duo had three quotas, of which, he gave his nephew one. It was because Zi Yao had given Shi Yan Ao Gera&rsquo;s quota.</p>
<p>Among the five feudal vassals, since Leona and Ao Gu Duo had achieved the biggest attainments, they had three quotas each. The other three vassals had two. Since Zi Yao had one quota, the total contestants entering the Extreme Purgatory Field this time were thirteen.</p>
<p>At this moment, a contestant holding the Purgatory Token started to move.</p>
<p>Leona was talking to her three warriors with a cold visage. Her bloodthirsty green eyes often glared at Ao Gu Duo and his contestants. Most of the time, she gazed at Ao Gera.</p>
<p>She seemed to instruct her warriors to kill Ao Gera and the other two warriors of Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s team in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo was grinning fiendishly, as he didn&rsquo;t show that his team was weaker than her team. Apparently, he had the same thought as Leona, that they would compete again in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu laughed, then left Carthew together with Yalan, waving at him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan curled his lips into a smile, walking towards Tie Mu and Yalan. However, he didn&rsquo;t hasten to leave just yet.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, he paused, looking at Ao Gu Duo and Ao Gera over there. He pondered, then said calmly. &ldquo;Master Ao Gu Duo, all the humiliation I had to bear today, I will give it back to you ten times in the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo sneered disdainfully. &ldquo;With just you? What are you? Haha, kid, basically, you won&rsquo;t get out of the Extreme Purgatory Field alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was calm, pointing at the sky and talking faintly. &ldquo;I, Shi Yan, swear that within one hundred years, I will take the head on your neck, Ao Gu Duo! Otherwise, within one hundred years, I will kill myself on the spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was shaken, looking at him disbelievingly. Their eyes showed that what they just heard was unbelievable.</p>
<p>One hundred years was just a short period for a True God Realm warrior to break through the King God Realm. Many people couldn&rsquo;t enter the Original God Realm, no matter how hard they had tried during their whole life. And, Ao Gu Duo was at the Second Sky of Orginal God Realm. Did Shi Yan lose his mind when he made his pledge?</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo laughed as he was crazy. &ldquo;Good, good! I want to see if you can even live for one hundred years or not! Hahaha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t affected. He pointed at Ao Gera, talking as if no one else was surrounding him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you in the Extreme Purgatory Field. If you dare, get in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked at him dazedly, as if he were an insane person.</p>
<p>He was only at the True God Realm. Among the contestants, his realm was the lowest. And, Ao Gera was at the Second Sky of King God Realm, a famous young expert.</p>
<p>Today, in front of the five great feudal vassals and Prince Du Tian Le, Shi Yan said that he wanted to kill Ao Gera in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Was it a funny joke?</p>
<p>Killing Ao Gu Duo within one hundred years, killing Ao Gera in the Extreme Purgatory Field&hellip; His rampancy and arrogance had stunned people. They all looked at him with odd faces, as they thought that this young man was quite crazy and funny.</p>
<p>However, they couldn&rsquo;t smile on seeing his resolute countenance. Apparently, he wasn&rsquo;t just joking. Although he had no tremendous aura on his body, the impression he gave the others wasn&rsquo;t ordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you there,&rdquo; Ao Gera&rsquo;s eyes became dark and sinister, &ldquo;&hellip;if you dare to find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Ao Gu Duo, please try to restrain your sorrow and go with the flow to prepare a good coffin for your nephew.&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled and chinned up, then walked away. He passed by Yalan and Tie Mu, who were petrified, heading towards the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo put on a cold face while his eyes were flared up with fire. He continually sneered. &ldquo;Ao Gera, if you can&rsquo;t torture that kid to death in the Extreme Purgatory Field, I don&rsquo;t have a nephew like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Uncle. I&rsquo;ll make him taste all the pains and sorrows of this world. I will use the Fantasy Stone to record the scene of his demise. You can save it and watch later,&rdquo; Ao Gera said deliberately and arrogantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go. I&rsquo;m waiting for your good news,&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo waved his hand.</p>
<p>Ao Gera and the other two warriors bent to say goodbye, then flew up in Shi Yan&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo, wanna bet with me?&rdquo; Leona said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to use the next life star to bet with you. I bet that your nephew will die and Shi Yan will survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew, Da Lei, Rochester, and Du Tian Le were baffled. They disbelievingly looked at the infamous woman, whose brutal reputation had been spread wide. They had no idea why she favored Shi Yan that much.</p>
<p>Did she just simply want to compete with Ao Gu Duo? Anyway, using a life star for that, was she insane?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play with you!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo shouted, his face ferocious.</p>
<p>Chapter 771: Leaving alone</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know that Leona had used him to make a big bet with Ao Gu Duo. Using an entire life star to bet was something rare even here.</p>
<p>After leaving the mountain range, Shi Yan turned into a bunch of light, flying rapidly towards the Extreme Purgatory Field as guided by his Purgatory Token. Yalan and Tie Mu followed behind him, gazing at his back with fear.</p>
<p>Soon, Yalan and Tie Mu had caught up with him with their Second Sky of King God Realm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, are you crazy? Ao Gera is at the Second Sky of King God Realm. Even we aren&rsquo;t sure whether we can kill him or not. You&rsquo;ve just reached the True God Realm.&rdquo; Tie Mu tilted his head, eyeing him strangely. &ldquo;Even if you want to compete with him, you shouldn&rsquo;t make it so explicit, should you? It isn&rsquo;t different from asking Ao Gera to kill you in the Extreme Purgatory Field, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, talking in a low tone. &ldquo;I believe that I can make Ao Gera not be able to leave the Extreme Purgatory Field alive.&rdquo; He had his confidence after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s head within one hundred years&hellip; You do have the guts!&rdquo; Yalan appraised him, shaking her head disbelievingly. &ldquo;No need to mention you, in the entire Dark Firmament Divine Nation, besides our King, I don&rsquo;t know who can say those words like you. Even Madame Leona doesn&rsquo;t have such confidence.</p>
<p>This was something Yalan just couldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo was one of the five great feudal vassals. In the divine nation, he was just under one person, but above tens of thousands of people. His competence and the force under his command were extremely mighty. He had so many brutal subordinates as well.</p>
<p>Even if he could reach the same realm as Ao Gu Duo, without a crazily strong background, he shouldn&rsquo;t even dream of defeating Ao Gu Duo, let alone killing him.</p>
<p>Original God Realm experts had their own ways to protect themselves. In case they couldn&rsquo;t resist anymore, they could always escape easily.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo was a Second Sky of Original God Realm warrior. If someone wanted to kill him, he should be at least at the Third Sky of Original God Realm. Only having one rank higher could guarantee the desired result.</p>
<p>This whole vast divine nation had only one warrior at the Third Sky of Original God Realm, who was also the King of the country, King Du Tian Ji.</p>
<p>The number of experts who were at the Third Sky of Original God Realm cultivation base in the entire Raging Flame Star Area could be counted with one&rsquo;s fingers. Each of them was the tyrant of an area or the freaky hermits, about whom no one knew whether they were still alive or not.</p>
<p>Compared to such existences, Shi Yan at the True God Realm was just a tiny ant. The high sky in front of him still hid so many unknown dangers.</p>
<p>Saying that he could kill Ao Gu Duo within one hundred years wasn&rsquo;t arrogant. It was idiotic!</p>
<p>Thus, no matter how high Yalan had evaluated Shi Yan, she didn&rsquo;t think that he had any basis for his haughty words. She thought he was mad at Ao Gu Duo, so he spoke up idiotically.</p>
<p>Hearing Yalan, Tie Mu beamed a forced smile while shaking his head. Although he didn&rsquo;t mock the other, his attitude and countenance were saying that he totally agreed with Yalan. He didn&rsquo;t believe that Shi Yan could fulfill his pledge.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t explain further, just accelerating towards the Extreme Purgatory Field with cold eyes and a composed visage.</p>
<p>Groups of prisoners were driven by some unknown force and moved into the Extreme Purgatory Field. From time to time, a bunch of light darted by Shi Yan, Yalan, and Tie Mu. They all headed to a different side of the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field was a vast place, situated on half of the Purgatory Star. Dangers hid in the mountains, lakes, and immense forests in this area.</p>
<p>Through Yalan and Tie Mu, Shi Yan got to know that highly authorized staff had created the barriers, formations, and restrictions in this area. They said that the Extreme Purgatory Field was a magical formation in itself, which had snatched the control of Nature. With the additional barriers and restrictions, it became the one of the most dangerous areas in the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>Even without competition and the villains of the Raging Flame Star Area, warriors entering this area would encounter a lot of dangers. They had to be cautious about countering the manmade traps.</p>
<p>This area had so many terrifying places, which were much harsher than even the cold, dark outer space.</p>
<p>Anyway, the most dangerous place often hid the best fortunate encounters. The Extreme Purgatory Field was a place like that.</p>
<p>The Purgatory Token in his hand flashed suddenly as Shi Yan turned into a bunch of light, which was then dragged into an ash-gray halo instantly.</p>
<p>When his body appeared in that place, his soul altar was shaken hard. A light of surprise flashed in his eyes as he beamed a happy smile.</p>
<p>The rumor was true!</p>
<p>Staying in this place, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t use any bit of his energy to comprehend the Star, Space, or Death and Life power Upanishads, but he still felt so sensitive to them.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field seemed to have an invisible energy that couldn&rsquo;t be seen or sensed by naked eyes and soul. In this place circled by that miraculous energy, any warrior could gain a deeper understanding of his own power Upanishad.</p>
<p>Holding his breath and concentrating, Shi Yan instinctively let his soul sink into the power Upanishad tier in his soul altar. The three powers Upanishad rippled with miraculous energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>This kind of a fluctuation could resonate with some energy in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Shortly, his sensibility of Space, Star, Death and Life powers Upanishad was connected. He instantly felt like he was sinking in the center of the magnetic exploding space, where space power twisted wildly.</p>
<p>The Death and Life Intent Domain proactively overflowed without the soul to guide them. In this moment, he felt like he had gotten back to the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, where he had used the Death and Life power Upanishad to heal Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Although he couldn&rsquo;t see the sun, moon, or stars in the gray sky of this area, his Star Martial Spirit was working miraculously.</p>
<p>Shi Yan concentrated on sensing more, sending his soul to the Star Martial Spirit. He felt like he was taking a trip to the immense starry sky, and, was sensitive enough to feel the trajectory of each star.</p>
<p>In this marvelous place, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t think about anything else. He just closed his eyes and felt. He found that he could approach his power Upanishad endlessly. He could visualize the most mysterious changes of the heaven and earth. If he could quiet down and comprehend, the benefit it could bring to his realm would be immeasurable!</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>Two silhouettes landed next to him. Shi Yan turned around and found Yalan and Tie Mu.</p>
<p>Those two warriors under Carthew&rsquo;s command stood next to him and squinted, their faces passionate. Just like him, they closed their eyes and silently comprehended their powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a magical place! The rumor&rsquo;s true. If we can cultivate here forever, our understanding of the realm would be formidably profound. Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to leave this place ever.&rdquo; Tie Mu laughed with a happy countenance. &ldquo;Thank you, Master Carthew. He gave us his quotas. If I can survive this Extreme Purgatory Field, I think I will absolutely break through to the Third Sky of King God Realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thought, anyway,&rdquo; Yalan snorted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the Extreme Purgatory Field will open once every fifty years? Every time it opens, it lasts only for three years. Do you know how tremendous a quantity of materials we have to use to keep it open for three years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Tie Mu looked like he didn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He stopped concentrating his mind, looking at Yalan seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that the Extreme Purgatory Field&rsquo;s an incomparably magical formation. It could convert the power of Nature. However, it requires an enormous amount of energy and materials to maintain it. I heard that it needs at least ten thousand pieces of Divine Crystals for each year! And, they must be the medium quality pieces! Besides, it requires so many kinds of materials. Some of them are so rare that only the Land of God Punishment could have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan paused for a while and then continued. &ldquo;When our master came here, didn&rsquo;t you see that he brought a large number of materials? Where do you think they would ship them? I&rsquo;m telling you, they will be consumed all in the Extreme Purgatory Field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was stunned on listening to her.</p>
<p>He immediately got why Leona&rsquo;s battleships carried a massive amount of materials. They must be used to maintain the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>It consumed ten thousand Divine Crystals each year, along with so many other rare materials. To retain this magnificent formation for three years, how big should the amount of the required materials be?</p>
<p>No wonder why the quotas to enter the Extreme Purgatory Field were too little. Da Lei only had two, and a noble princess like Zi Yao only had one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt grateful to Zi Yao for giving him a chance.</p>
<p>The quota he had was snatched from Ao Gera&rsquo;s hand. The value of a Purgatory Token perhaps was much more precious than an amethyst battleship!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, do you want to go with us or leave alone?&rdquo; After explaining to the two men, Yalan hesitated for a while and then asked. &ldquo;Your realm is too low. Walking alone in this perilous place will be too risky. If you go with us, we can back up each other. At least, Ao Gera can&rsquo;t kill you shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She actually meant good for him.</p>
<p>Tie Mu grinned. &ldquo;Yeah, we should go together. Besides the experts from the other feudal vassals, those villains won&rsquo;t dare to trespass on us here. We can kill them slowly. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the time in the gravitational field, Shi Yan and these two had talked and become familiar with each other. It seemed like Carthew had advised them to protect him for a while.</p>
<p>However, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t appreciate their treatment. He just smiled and slightly bent his body. &ldquo;I will keep your goodwill in my heart. But, I&rsquo;m getting here to train myself. If I go with you, you will shield me from dangers, so I won&rsquo;t actually be able to train myself then. Yeah, we should part here. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. If I have the guts to get in the Extreme Purgatory Field, of course, I have means to protect myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Tie Mu was a little bit worried. &ldquo;Ao Gera wants to kill you, and he isn&rsquo;t alone. The other two from Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s team aren&rsquo;t good people either. When they go together, not many people dare to provoke them in the Extreme Purgatory Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in yourself that much?&rdquo; Yalan snorted while frowning.</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled and clasped his fist to greet them, then changed the direction, leaving alone. His figure flashed, then disappeared into the gap between two grand mountains. After a while, he disappeared completely from their sights.</p>
<p>Chapter 772: Seek battle!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Inside the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu knitted their brows tightly, looking in the general direction where Shi Yan had left. They contemplated for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master asked us to notice and see if he has any mysteries. Turns out our Master has wronged him.&rdquo; Yalan talked with a strange countenance. &ldquo;He assumed that Shi Yan would go with us. But he&rsquo;s underestimated his arrogance. Perhaps, it&rsquo;s fearless ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say, did he know our intentions?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t want to go with us,&rdquo; asked Tie Mu.</p>
<p>Yalan shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m sure this man isn&rsquo;t simple. He has some big secrets. Or else, with his True God Realm cultivation base, it&rsquo;s impossible to be so haughty. You know&hellip; the time we were in the gravitational room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu&rsquo;s eyes flared with a strange light. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s not that simple. I have never met any True God Realm warriors who have such powerful physique. If he can break through to the King God Realm and condense the God Body with his current body, perhaps&hellip; he can give Ao Gera a painful headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Ao Gera&rsquo;s so disgusting. If we meet him, we should tear his face, too!&rdquo; Yalan snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why Zi Yao accepted him. Would she aim at Ao Gu Duo, his Uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Being princes and princesses, they have their special concerns. No one could read the King&rsquo;s mind. It seems he would let his children fight against each other until someone dies. Then he will choose his heir, the one who can suppress all of his or her siblings with great talents. In his eyes, perhaps only a character like that could bring the divine nation to a more prosperous future.&rdquo; Tie Mu shook his head, sighing. &ldquo;Under his tacit agreement, princes and princesses are trying to gather forces to subdue the others. I don&rsquo;t know if this kind of competition is good or bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Shi Yan won&rsquo;t have a good ending. I heard Prince Du Feng went missing. Princess Zi Yao is a woman. In the divine nation, we&rsquo;ve never had a ruling Queen. Princess Zi Yao&rsquo;s future will be troublesome.&rdquo; Yalan was a little discontented with the divine nation&rsquo;s gender discrimination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just normal citizens, we can&rsquo;t control that much. I just hope that our Master would make a right decision. Or else, we&rsquo;re also involved,&rdquo; Tie Mu beamed a forced smile.</p>
<p>Yalan didn&rsquo;t talk more. They prepared for a while, sending the Soul Consciousness to the token to sense. Then, they left in the opposite direction to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field was extremely vast with endless rivers, mountain ranges, big lakes, and forest with luxuriant floras.</p>
<p>Shi Yan strolled aimlessly in the dark forest with hundred-meter-diameter trees. He had sent his Soul Consciousness into the Purgatory Token to sense.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field was said to be a great formation of the ancient time. In this place, Soul Consciousness was limited. Even his Soul Consciousness added with space power seemed to be restrained by some invisible power. Shi Yan could only feel the living beings within one mile around.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness wasn&rsquo;t as good as the Purgatory Token in this area.</p>
<p>Each participant had a Purgatory Token, which they could use to sense the living energy of creatures around within the scale of five miles.</p>
<p>Within five miles, as long as there were magnetic fields of living beings, the contestants could detect them via the Purgatory Token. Since this token was stronger than his Soul Consciousness, in this forest, Shi Yan considered it his main secret treasure to sense around.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn&rsquo;t include the other participants.</p>
<p>Warriors with the Purgatory Token could prevent the others from detecting him using the Soul Consciousness. In other words, Shi Yan could only sense the hazardous inmates not Yalan, Tie Mu, or Ao Gera, who also held the Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Anyway, they were also the participants, who came here to train their realm and hunt the inmates down.</p>
<p>The divine nation didn&rsquo;t encourage the contestants to kill each other. And, they neither had any document to prohibit this activity. In case they met their enemies in the Extreme Purgatory Field and wanted to kill the others, the divine nation wouldn&rsquo;t care about that.</p>
<p>The winner will get the throne. It&rsquo;s always been the principle of the divine nation. Because of bloody competitions, the divine nation had earned their today&rsquo;s attainment. Each of them had kept the smell of blood and fighting desire in their hearts so as they could resist and battle against the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce or the Underworld League.</p>
<p>A flow of Soul Consciousness was sent into the Purgatory Token, creating an invisible connection with his soul.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sauntered in the vast forest. He hadn&rsquo;t detected any commotions of the prisoners.</p>
<p>Prisoners put into the Extreme Purgatory Field were all at the King God Realm, from the First Sky to the Third Sky. There were several hundred of them in this place.</p>
<p>However, the Extreme Purgatory Field was endlessly vast. It wasn&rsquo;t easy to meet several hundred people scattering in this area.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t hasten. The Soul Consciousness he had sent into the Purgatory Token was still sensing for living beings within five miles around. At the same time, he had released his Soul Consciousness to sense the commotions around him.</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness was special with the support of space power. As long as a tiny energy movement was made, he would get it immediately.</p>
<p>Along his way, Shi Yan found at least six areas with signs of faint energy. From Tie Mu and Yalan, he knew that the Extreme Purgatory Field had so many perilous areas. If the inmates and the participants were careless entering there, they would have big trouble or even have their souls vanish.</p>
<p>Thus, whenever he detected strange energy fluctuations, he would proactively stay away. Shi Yan wouldn&rsquo;t take risks.</p>
<p>When he reached a bared hill, he stopped, sat down neatly on the peak, looking forward.</p>
<p>Strange drawings and patterns were carved under his feet. They were the restrictions and barriers he had learned from the Blacksmith&rsquo;s Secrets of Success in the Dark Magnetic Noxious Mist. He knew how to make the magical formations, restrictions, and barriers that naked eyes couldn&rsquo;t see. Only some special Soul Consciousness could sense them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had set up this formation at the edge of the mountain range. Staying in there and with the hindrance provided naturally with the mist, people from the outside couldn&rsquo;t see anything but a dim place where naked eyes couldn&rsquo;t see through.</p>
<p>Sitting on the peak of the hill, Shi Yan looked nonchalantly at the further distance. He could only see peaks of mountains jutted in the clouds. Gray clouds and brown clouds hovered in those areas. From the far distance, they looked like a gloomy quilt.</p>
<p>Touching his forehead, Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul flew into the soul altar of the heaven flames. Shi Yan sent his thought. &ldquo;Is your Soul Consciousness also affected in this area?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heaven flames sent him the same thought. It meant this area was somehow special with a magical power that could hinder the Soul Consciousness. Even the peculiar living beings like the heaven flames couldn&rsquo;t sense the commotions around clearly.</p>
<p>Frowning, Shi Yan suddenly shouted. &ldquo;You guys scatter, staying five miles close to me. Watch everywhere for me. I need to stay quiet for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flames of heaven flames flew out from Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar. Shortly, they disappeared.</p>
<p>Heaven flames were his hidden trick. At the critical moment, they could help him overturn the situation, turning from defeat to victory. Besides, he could use them as his guards.</p>
<p>Since the heaven flames and Shi Yan were interlinked, once they sensed danger, they could send the information to his soul directly. Shi Yan would have more time to prepare.</p>
<p>After the heaven flames had left, Shi Yan gradually quieted down. He kept a flow of Soul Consciousness in the Purgatory Token. Sitting on this barren hill, he cleared his mind, making his soul empty, while paying attention to the power Upanishad tier, trying to take advantages of the resonance in this place.</p>
<p>Relaxed his mind, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t think about the other burdens. His face was calm as he closed his eyes. His aura retreated little by little until he was like a motionless rock that seemed to be there for ten thousand years. Gradually, his living energy fluctuation also disappeared.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood his weakness: low realm.</p>
<p>With the True God Realm cultivation base, killing Ao Gera was a tough task especially when Ao Gera wasn&rsquo;t alone. If Shi Yan had to meet them shortly, he would have no chance to win.</p>
<p>He believed that he could break through to the King God Realm shortly. That&rsquo;s why he dared to boast his arrogant words.</p>
<p>With his innate background, when he broke into the King God Realm, his power Upanishad could advance to the God Domain. At the same time, he could get the God Body. Shi Yan believed that even Ao Gera who had the Second Sky of King God Realm cultivation base even he couldn&rsquo;t be his rival!</p>
<p>He has this confidence!</p>
<p>Many prisoners and participants in the Extreme Purgatory Field would become the resources for him to get stronger. In this place, he could step into the sky, advancing to the new level.</p>
<p>Shi Yan closed his eyes, staying atop the barren hill. He was using the miracle features of the Extreme Purgatory Field to relax and focus on his power Upanishad comprehension. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t notice how time flies out there.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Ten miles away from Shi Yan&rsquo;s location, three one-eyed prisoners stood shoulder by shoulder, alertly watching here and there.</p>
<p>These three people were at the First Sky of King God Realm. They seemed to be condemned for a serious crime. Not only was one of their eyes taken but they had also been carved with the terrifying inmate mark on their faces, which indicated their soon-to-be-executed status. The three of them were from the Sea Clan, which were rare in outer space. They had fish scales on their necks.</p>
<p>They were almost three meters tall, wearing ragged garments. Their deep green eyes were cautiously watching everywhere. Their bizarre eyes also showed their ferocious features.</p>
<p>They were all alert as they knew that they were the preys of the participants. Once they meet a strong contestant, they would be killed soon, becoming the war achievement of the other.</p>
<p>Thus, on the way there, they had always tried to avoid the areas where experts might gather. They only aimed at the quiet and isolated areas to go.</p>
<p>While they didn&rsquo;t recognize it, they had entered the area where Shi Yan was staying.</p>
<p>Although Shi Yan&rsquo;s Purgatory Token hadn&rsquo;t reported him the living energy fluctuation, the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame, one of the heaven flames, had found them.</p>
<p>The immense blue flame squeezed itself on a leaf of a giant tree that kept it from the others&rsquo; views. Those three King God Realm warriors didn&rsquo;t see anything abnormal. They still headed toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>The Yin Spirit Ghost Flame had sent its thought directly to Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul altar.</p>
<p>As Shi Yan had just immersed in the miracle state not for long, he hadn&rsquo;t comprehended enough the mysteries of this place. He woke up all of a sudden with shaken appearance. &ldquo;Which realm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stronger than you by a little bit. According to human warrior classification, they should be at the First Sky of King God Realm. However, they have three. I&rsquo;m not sure you can handle them,&rdquo; said the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three?&rdquo; Shi Yan was startled. He hesitated for a while then said, &ldquo;Only bloody battles could help learn the powers faster. These three come here in good time. Then, there they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up, took a deep breath then touched the void. Barriers and restrictions around him disappeared, showing a way. He sauntered, his face calm and cold while fierce fighting will surging in his eyes.</p>
<p>Chapter 773: A much valuable battle</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>A big lake that looked like a clear shining mirror was situated in the corner of the Purgatory Star. This lake was so crystal clear that people could see its bottom.</p>
<p>Conical mountains surrounded this lake. Those mountains weren&rsquo;t too high as they were around one thousand meters more or less. Observation pavilions were built on each mountain. Beautiful maids and guards were serving the powerful officials of the divine nation.</p>
<p>At this moment, Du Tian Le, and the five feudal vassals Leona, Ao Gu Duo, Carthew, Rochester, and Da Lei were sitting neatly in different luxury pavilions to enjoy good food and wine.</p>
<p>The five feudal vassals had their retinue standing by their sides. They didn&rsquo;t say anything, but they were allowed to enjoy the food and wine with their masters.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le smiled tenderly. He stooped, looking at the lake underneath. A strange crown sparkled in his hand, it radiated beams of light shooting directly into the lake.</p>
<p>After the strange light shot into the crystal lake, it changed magically. Images started to appear on the lake.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field on the other side of the Purgatory Star became the images projected on the lake surface. Layers of mountain ranges, large lakes, murmuring rivers and streams, and vast luxuriant forests were projected gradually. Even the lowest positions were shown clearly.</p>
<p>This lake was a giant mirror that was transferring what was happening in the Extreme Purgatory Field to this place. Everybody standing on the surrounding mountains could see the details of the battles taking place in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>At this moment, the lake mirror was showing some fierce battles. Ao Gera was the outstanding contestant, who had already started to hunt inmates in the forest.</p>
<p>Ao Gera and the other two warriors under Ao Gu Duo were coldly surrounding two prisoners at a mountain foot.</p>
<p>Those two prisoners were at the Second Sky of King God Realm. At this moment, they were hurt badly, and they were trying with their last breaths to run away.</p>
<p>Ao Gera was deliberate even though he was busy. A gleam of arrogance sparkled in his eyes. He laughed like a howling hungry wolf gazing at one of the two prisoners.</p>
<p>The other two subordinates of Ao Gu Duo were joining hands to kill the other. They were all calm just like a hawk eyeing a sheep on the ground.</p>
<p>Shortly, they stormed over with brutal deeds. They used clusters of scorching light to block the man and torture him to death.</p>
<p>Ao Gera&rsquo;s battle also ended shortly. When his God Domain expanded, people could see a glorious gold halo rippling like water, extending everywhere.</p>
<p>Wherever his gold light crossed through everything was smashed. Ancient trees, big rocks, and even the rivers were exploded. The sharp gold energy had swept everything away as easy as breaking the dried branches of a tree.</p>
<p>The warrior, who had the same realm as Ao Gera, was blockaded in his God Domain. Shortly, the gold halo bound him. Frightening bleeding cuts appeared thickly on his God Body. That man resisted hard. He released his God Domain, which created a pressing energy wave.</p>
<p>Ao Gera faced the sky and shouted. The gold energy on his body slashed down from the sky like a sharp golden sword showering the land.</p>
<p>When Ao Gera used his true power, his entire body was covered in a gold nimbus, giving people a brutal and vicious feeling that he could fiercely crush everything into pieces. Bunches of gold energy light shot out from him breaking that prisoner&rsquo;s God Domain. The bleeding cuts on his body also exploded at once.</p>
<p>Instantly, that man became a bloody corpse, as if he had been executed with the &lsquo;ten-thousand-cut&rsquo; sentence. His death was terribly pathetic.</p>
<p>Ao Gera had been nonchalant from the beginning. He didn&rsquo;t even bother to look at the dead man, spat, mumbled something then leaped up. His figure flashed and he gathered with his two other teammates. They continued hunting.</p>
<p>The lake was projecting the same battle, which was happening with the three young people of Leona&rsquo;s team. All three had a bloody aura, their eyes were wild and brutal. They looked like the devils in Hell just like their master. Bloody murderous aura shot up to the sky.</p>
<p>The pupils of the only woman in that team of three showed a frightening faint color. The onlookers didn&rsquo;t know what secret technique she was cultivating, but on her way, murderous aura had condensed into real entities, turning into a dozens of meters blood python. It was animated and lively like a real object. It stuck its tongue out, facing the sky, emitting a tremendous energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>The woman who used to mock Shi Yan hid her hands in her sleeves, strolling as if she was taking a walk in her garden. And she just sauntered behind her blood python like that.</p>
<p>The python was like a real beast. Whenever it sensed signs of living beings, it would savagely dash away. This bloodthirsty commotion froze the prisoners, making them unable to run. Shortly, the python had swallowed three prisoners.</p>
<p>After one hour, the python would open its big mouth and spit out a bloody skeleton. The flesh on the skeleton seemed to be butchered. Extremely horrible!</p>
<p>No one could resist this woman on her way. She hadn&rsquo;t performed any attack, but using only a blood python she had condensed from the bloodthirsty murderous aura. She had made the inmates snacks for her python.</p>
<p>Experts of Carthew&rsquo;s and Rochester&rsquo;s teams hadn&rsquo;t encountered enemies yet. High-realm prisoners had avoided them proactively as if they knew those four people weren&rsquo;t easy to mess with. They had tried their best to stay away from them.</p>
<p>Da Meng, son of Da Lei, had the Peak of True God Realm. However, the beasts flew out of his soul altar were all formidable. On his way, he didn&rsquo;t need to move his hands. People ran away as soon as they saw his beasts.</p>
<p>Da Meng was at the Peak of True God Realm like Shi Yan. His path was smooth, and he hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to show his talents.</p>
<p>The experts sitting in the mountains to watch the fun shown in the lake all concentrated on the battles in the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Le suddenly screamed. A strange light flashed in his eyes as he focused on an isolated area.</p>
<p>The blood crown on his hand sparkled. The area he was watching was zoomed in so many times. Everything there became clearer.</p>
<p>Leona, Ao Gu Duo, Carthew, Rochester, and Da Lei, the five great feudal vassals became interested in that scene. Their eyes like electric strikes shot at that area.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s figured appeared clearly in that area. At this moment, he was dashing crazily from the hill toward the three Sea Clan prisoners that the Yin Spirit Ghost Flame had sensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, a whole life star. Interesting. Interesting. I should watch carefully.&rdquo; Rochester laughed noisily. His eyes skimmed through Leona and Ao Gu Duo.</p>
<p>Da Lei was shaken. He had a concealed gleam of hope in his eyes as if he hated that he couldn&rsquo;t make Shi Yan bury his body in the Extreme Purgatory Field and that the young man would never be able to get out of the Extreme Purgatory Field alive.</p>
<p>Carthew slightly frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, that boy doesn&rsquo;t have a good fortune. Seems Ao Gera won&rsquo;t need to take action. Hmm, but I think he got good luck now. If he meets Ao Gera, he will die in the worst way!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo received the strong liquor the maid served him. He gulped several mouthfuls, laughing loudly.</p>
<p>Leona wore a cold and sinister face. Her eyes were as sharp as icicles. She beamed a faint smile. &ldquo;Are you blind? Don&rsquo;t you see that Shi Yan&rsquo;s the one who proactively takes action?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that kid has taken action first. One-on-three, people. And his opponents are the King God Realm experts. Is he insane? Does he have any tremendous background?&rdquo; Du Tian Le continued then took a sip of his wine, his eyes strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a madman. Muahaha. Dares to boast arrogantly saying that he would kill me within one hundred years. Isn&rsquo;t that crazy?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo finished a bottle of strong wine and threw it away. That bottle exploded in the air. He bared his teeth. His craziness appeared on his face. &ldquo;Who dares say to kill me within one hundred years in the divine nation? I&rsquo;ve been moving unhindered around the universe for years. I&rsquo;ve seen so many different characters. He&rsquo;s just an ant! That motherf*cker is telling jokes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still holding on to what Shi Yan had bragged. He couldn&rsquo;t just let it go no matter what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I want to kill you, no need to wait for one hundred years, my dear. As long as our King nods his head, I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; Leona smiled coldly like a devil, snapping back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo was enraged, his face ferocious. &ldquo;Haha, don&rsquo;t think that because you&rsquo;re ranked over me means you can actually defeat me. When I, Ao Gu Duo, had topped the feudal vassals, you were still struggling to be a feudal vassal. If the King didn&rsquo;t notice you, you motherf*cker, you would have died in my hands already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope that the King would agree, so then I can cut your head off and make a nice chamber pot.&rdquo; Leona laughed like crazy. Her dark green eyes were filled with bloodthirsty intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys, could you please quiet down so we can watch the battle?&rdquo; Carthew rubbing his forehead, couldn&rsquo;t help but scream.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le also advised them with his soft voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a bet already. Just calm down and watch it. It&rsquo;s a whole life star you know. You should pay attention. Don&rsquo;t be hurried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing him, Leona and Ao Gu Duo snorted in unison then stopped quarreling. Their look fell on the lake underneath again to watch the clear scene projected.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan had faced the three Sea Clan prisoners. Their eyes locked. Sparks shot everywhere.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>Deep inside the vast, grand palace sat on the throne a tall and sturdy man wearing brocade clothes. He looked at something in front of him.</p>
<p>Zi Yao sat cross-legged next to him, her beautiful eyes gazed at something.</p>
<p>A magical mirror appeared in the middle of the hall, which showed Shi Yan and the three Sea Clan prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that him?&rdquo; the man frowned, asking all of a sudden. &ldquo;Are you sure he and the other have some relations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Their powers Upanishad are alike, the Soul Burial Ground,&rdquo; Zi Yao confirmed.</p>
<p>The man nodded, grinning faintly. &ldquo;Interesting. I need to watch carefully. If we can use him, he will be a sharp sword of the divine nation. I hope he would be like what you say: outstanding will and persistence. About his shallow cultivation base, it&rsquo;s alright. We can increase him gradually. The most important feature of a warrior is his fighting will! I need to watch carefully then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.&rdquo; Zi Yao said anxiously as she was praying that Shi Yan could debut better and surprise the others. That would make them appreciate him.</p>
<p>It seemed his performance this time would determine his death or life, and his future.</p>
<p>Chapter 774: Rip the sky!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>It was out of Shi Yan&rsquo;s expectation that the three prisoners were more excited than he was when Shi Yan appeared.</p>
<p>The inmate marks on the faces of those one-eyed Sea Clan prisoners twisted as they were laughing crazily and excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God loves the three of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s love for us. Our first encounter is a lone warrior. And, he has only the True God Realm cultivation base!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, it&rsquo;s so good. At least one of us can survive this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Sea Clan prisoners were cheered up as they found the other had only the True God Realm cultivation base. They were stimulated, screaming strangely. They didn&rsquo;t wait until Shi Yan stopped moving, storming toward him.</p>
<p>King God Realm experts had the God Domain, and those three weren&rsquo;t an exception.</p>
<p>As they were the warriors of the Sea clan, most of them would cultivate water power Upanishad, which made their God Domain have the attributes of water. Once they urged it, water would murmur around their bodies.</p>
<p>Moisture aura flooded the place. Water waves that naked eyes could see wound around their bodies as if they were standing in the middle of a furious current, showing all the advantages of the Sea Clan.</p>
<p>Inside the Water God Domain, those Sea Clan prisoners felt like fish in the sea. Their powers and the God Domain had fused perfectly, which had doubled their speed and bursting energy. A fierce flow of energy swarmed over Shi Yan like the rolling flood current.</p>
<p>In that moment, Shi Yan was submerged in the seawater. His powers were hindered by many layers. His body&rsquo;s movements also struggled. It was hard to activate his powers.</p>
<p>The God Domain of a warrior would bring him tremendous support. Different God Domains would affect each other. If these three had cultivated different powers Upanishad, once they joined hands, if they let their God Domains overlap, their powers would be reduced.</p>
<p>However, these three were from the same Sea Clan, and their power Upanishad was water, which made their God Domain&rsquo;s attributes unified.</p>
<p>Thus, when they activated their God Domains, they wouldn&rsquo;t affect but promote each other, expanding the coverage of the combined God Domain.</p>
<p>Shi Yan felt like he had fallen in a muddy puddle while his powers were weakened. Seeing the three prisoners furiously storming forward to attack him, his face became serious.</p>
<p>He had underestimated the might of the others and the mysteries of the overlapped God Domain. Right when the battle had started, he fell into a disadvantaged situation.</p>
<p>Seeing waves rolling torrentially inside the God Domain, Shi Yan cleared his mind. His eyes changed as all the impure thoughts in his head were washed away. Now his mind was as tranquil as an old well that had no ripples.</p>
<p>Touching his forehead, the soul altar suddenly spun. Marvelous flames appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>A scorching aura burst out from his body. Instantly, he was covered in a sea of fire. Flame shot out dazzlingly, twirling around him.</p>
<p>This is the flaming power of the Sun Original Essence!</p>
<p>He had absorbed a large amount of flaming energy in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. As soon as his Star power Upanishad flickered, the flaming solar energy stored in his chest would be stimulated at once.</p>
<p>He also borrowed the power of the Vermilion Bird True Flame and the Earth Flame.</p>
<p>Shortly, he turned into a fire freak with the blazing fire burning on his entire body and spread out to the environment from him.</p>
<p>The torrential power of water from the three prisoners&rsquo; God Domain turned into white steam before it could touch Shi Yan&rsquo;s body. The soft power of water was dissolved rapidly, turned into mist and vanished. It couldn&rsquo;t gather again.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird True Flame and the Earth Flame were ones of the heaven flames. After so many years of refining, their flames had become extremely hot energy. The power they had contributed to Shi Yan had doubled his flaming solar energy.</p>
<p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle!</p>
<p>Thick white mist diffused everywhere. Shortly, Shi Yan and the three prisoners were hidden in the mist. Their figures disappeared temporarily.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo, Leona, and the other feudal vassals couldn&rsquo;t see what was happening in there. All were surprised.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo was astounded for a while then barked with his foul-mouth. &ldquo;That motherf*cker&rsquo;s cultivating the fire power Upanishad. No wonder why he dares to face those three prisoners directly. He&rsquo;s lucky, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fire is always the nemesis of water. They have a natural dispute. If Shi Yan&rsquo;s fire energy was abundant, he could oppress the God Domain of water attribute.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo didn&rsquo;t know Shi Yan. Thus, when he saw the fire burning on his body, he immediately assumed that Shi Yan had cultivated fire power Upanishad. Leona knitted her brows as she was also surprised.</p>
<p>She had communicated with Shi Yan so she had a clear understanding of his secrets.</p>
<p>Leona mused discreetly.</p>
<p>If the mark on his forehead is real, his power Upanishad shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. Did I see it wrong?</p>
<p>Carthew and Rochester instinctively thought that Shi Yan&rsquo;s main power was Fire Upanishad. They got his intentions and appraised him for making a good decision in choosing the opponents. As he had found the Sea Clan men to fight, he had made a good use of the natural nemesis features between the powers Upanishad to subdue the Sea Clan prisoners.</p>
<p>Only Da Lei didn&rsquo;t have such thought. Among this group, he was the only one who had witnessed Shi Yan using the Soul Burial Ground.</p>
<p>He believed that if the man understood that wicked power Upanishad, he wouldn&rsquo;t consider another power Upanishad his main power to cultivate. He contemplated and reasoned. Afterward, he couldn&rsquo;t help but acclaim Shi Yan inwardly.</p>
<p>The king of the divine nation in the Dark Firmament Star far away also had a gleam of surprise. He stared at the magical mirror in front of him then turned to Princess Zi Yao. &ldquo;Zao-er, you said that he cultivates the Death Upanishad&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded to confirm then smiled deliberately. &ldquo;Father, that man has many secrets. When we were in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field, he used the Star power Upanishad to connect with the Sun Original Essence and collected its flaming solar energy. The power he&rsquo;s using now is from his previous accumulation. He doesn&rsquo;t cultivate fire Upanishad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji grinned bizarrely. &ldquo;The martial path doesn&rsquo;t have an end. Sometimes, mixing powers isn&rsquo;t always a good method. I hope this boy knew it already. If he&rsquo;s stubborn and cultivating additional powers, he would get nothing in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, don&rsquo;t worry. I think he knows his goals,&rdquo; said Zi Yao smilingly.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji nodded. He didn&rsquo;t talk more, and they got back to the battle in the mirror.</p>
<p>Sizzle Sizzle Sizzle!</p>
<p>Thick white mist diffused. The three Sea Clan prisoners&rsquo; furious attack ended in a failure.</p>
<p>The three prisoners couldn&rsquo;t help but curse. They knew that they weren&rsquo;t lucky this time since Shi Yan had cultivated the Fire power Upanishad. With the nemesis feature, their attack was dissolved. They were totally enraged.</p>
<p>God Domain was still covering everywhere as they didn&rsquo;t intend to use all of their powers. They exchanged looks then diverged instantly, moving toward Shi Yan in a triangle formation.</p>
<p>In the white mist, three several-hundred-meter rivers were driven by their powers from ten miles away.</p>
<p>The three rivers flowed like the milky way with billions of tons of seawater showering from the sky. They were like three massive whips flogging toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>These three were careful. Whenever they arrived at an area, they would check if it had lake or rivers or not. In critical times, they could borrow the force of the river and lake to resist the enemies.</p>
<p>Thus, within ten miles from where they appeared, there would be lakes or rivers.</p>
<p>Three hundred-meter heaven rivers grumblingly were condensed into three crystal white ribbons falling from the sky. Big ancient trees exploded all of a sudden as they couldn&rsquo;t bear the fierce attack of water. The dried trees and leaves also contributed to the mass of the rivers.</p>
<p>One of the three prisoners was cunning enough to make his river roll the big rocks along. The rocks moving fast in the river was so intimidating.</p>
<p>The milky ways dashed over from three different directions with terrifying energy accumulated in the furious water. The area where Shi Yan was standing had to bear a massive force, a formidable pressure, which had almost broken his body.</p>
<p>He was still calm. There was no panic sparkling in his eyes. It looked like he was numb as his eyes showed a boundless emptiness.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, his hands like two sharp claws thrust into the sky and ripped hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rip the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The void seemed to be grabbed by invisible formidable claws and torn forcefully. A dazzling slit appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the space crack!</p>
<p>The sky is torn apart!</p>
<p>Space shooting light emerged from the slit gloriously and dazzlingly. Furious and chaotic lights from outer space gushed out from the space slit. It was so powerful it made souls shiver.</p>
<p>A distorted and wildly powerful suction force appeared from the slit. Just like a whale sucking water, that space slit had sucked all the water from the three fierce milky ways together with all the big trees, rocks, and dirt they carrying.</p>
<p>Not a single drop remained.</p>
<p>The Water power Upanishad that the three Sea Clan warriors had combined energy to perform, the torrential milky way, had been dissolved like that.</p>
<p>The three Sea Clan experts paled as the energy they had poured into the milky ways had been swallowed completely. The connection was cut off, so they couldn&rsquo;t retrieve any bit of the amount they had mobilized.</p>
<p>King God Realm warriors could release or retreat their energy regularly. To condense three milky ways, they had used a lot of energy. Although their Rolling Milky Way couldn&rsquo;t achieve the desired result, they would still be able to retrieve the energy to prepare for the next attacks.</p>
<p>However, they could never imagine that the space crack would appear precisely at this moment and wolf all of their power. Even though they had seen everything, they couldn&rsquo;t retrieve a bit of their energy.</p>
<p>In such a short time, half of the energy in their bodies was consumed.</p>
<p>Their faces turned ash-gray.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The corner of the Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>On the mountains surrounding the lake, five feudal vassals and Du Tian Le were quiet with gawking eyes. They looked at the scene projected in the mirror disbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mwahahahaha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Leona burst out laughing with her savage appearance. Her laughter almost shook the sky.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo gritted his teeth, his face ferocious. He couldn&rsquo;t control his foul-mouth cursing loudly.</p>
<p>Chapter 775: Dead Sky!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Inside the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The three First Sky of King God Realm experts of the Sea Clan lost their excited mood. They felt chilled, their faces paled.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s power Upanishad was strangely evil beyond their estimation. They didn&rsquo;t react timely. Due to their wrong assumption, they had spent half of the energy accumulated in their bodies to build three Milky Ways, which the space slit had swallowed all in just a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The energy they had used was dragged into the space slit, they had not been able to take it back. Their energy had been reduced massively.</p>
<p>One side reduces; one side increases. Shi Yan had released his Soul Burial Ground for quite a long time. While they weren&rsquo;t aware of anything, the vitality of the three prisoners had been drawn significantly.</p>
<p>The Sea Clan warriors had used a large amount of energy while Shi Yan had taken in the light spots of their vitality. His spirit, soul, and Qi were filled, as he was brimmed with tremendous energy.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Dark Firmament Star, the Grand Palace.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s eyes flared up while gluing to the big magical mirror in front of his eyes. He was apparently astounded. Then, he turned to Princess Zi Yao next to him. &ldquo;Yao-er, this boy knows how to use Space power Upanishad, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was a little bit embarrassed. She had just told him Shi Yan had focused on his main power cultivation, and now he suddenly performed Space power Upanishad, which abashed her. &ldquo;Father, the powers Upanishad he&rsquo;s cultivating are mixed, indeed. However&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji waved to stop her. He beamed a faint smile. &ldquo;According to you, he knows what&rsquo;s he doing. I do want to see if he does know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao gave a forced smile.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji rubbed his chin. &ldquo;Such a greedy kid. If someone else has the Dead power Upanishad, he will never lay his eyes on anything else. The Dead power Upanishad alone is rare in the Raging Flame Star Area. Not many people have the chance to see it before. He isn&rsquo;t satisfied with this power. He still cultivates different powers Upanishad. I don&rsquo;t know what this man wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His understanding of Space power isn&rsquo;t shallow,&rdquo; explained Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji nodded, &ldquo;I can see that. As he&rsquo;s able to tear a space slit at the True God Realm, it&rsquo;s proven his understanding of space power isn&rsquo;t just ordinary. However, once he reaches the King God Realm, taking more than one at a time isn&rsquo;t good for his cultivation in the future. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao felt a headache. &ldquo;Yeah. But this man&rsquo;s quite special. He has many secrets. Father, take your time and watch him. Even I don&rsquo;t have a deep understanding of him. I can&rsquo;t see how many things he&rsquo;s concealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Du Tian Ji nodded, showing that he got interested.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>In the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Shi Yan retrieved the energy he had burst out above his head. The massive space slit faded away little by little.</p>
<p>Looking at the three experts of the Sea Clan with their pale faces, Shi Yan grinned. He strolled toward one of them.</p>
<p>His steps were firm, and everywhere he passed by, big trees and beautiful foliage yellowed then shriveled; insects hiding deep underground stopped singing.</p>
<p>Da Lei&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. He was shaken inwardly, acclaiming in his head: Here it comes!</p>
<p>Whenever it was released, only the ones immersed in the Soul Burial Ground Dead Upanishad could sense it.</p>
<p>People standing outside couldn&rsquo;t detect the Soul Burial Ground on the images projected by the mirror lake. The reason why Da Lei could find that Shi Yan was using this power Upanishad was from the different conditions of the flowers, trees, and insects. Since he had witnessed this with his own eyes before, he knew the wicked and cruel signs of this power Upanishad.</p>
<p>Also, they couldn&rsquo;t see the tiny light spots like raindrops congregating at Shi Yan.</p>
<p>However, those onlookers could spot the difference wherever Shi Yan walked by. They were startled, but they didn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening there.</p>
<p>Besides Da Lei, Leona was the only one among the others who was sensitive enough to recognize it.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw that the foliage, flowers, and even the big trees shriveled, her dark green eyes sparkled. She stopped her wild laughter, pulling herself together to focus on the situation in the field.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo, Rochester, Carthew, and Du Tian Le hadn&rsquo;t realized anything. They just saw the three Sea Clan experts slowly had their eyes gloomier as if their Qi, spirit, and soul were taken away.</p>
<p>The decrease in their fighting will was easy to notice. In the opposite condition to them was Shi Yan&rsquo;s boiling fighting will. His eyes sparkled with exciting light. Just like a hungry beast walked out of the deep forest, he needed meat to fill his empty stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead Sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan sauntered, his face calm and cold. When he was around one thousand meters away from those three experts, he halted, stooped, and shouted.</p>
<p>A deadly, silent, and desperate aura suddenly diffused from him. Brutal, bloodthirsty, resentment, and other negative energy gushed out from his acupuncture points. Flows of energy weaved into an ash-gray mist, congregating atop of him, creating a massive gray curtain.</p>
<p>Inside that gray curtain was the thick aura of Death, which seemed to be able to cut all kind of vitality.</p>
<p>This is one of the supernatural martial techniques he had experimented and created with the Dead power Upanishad he had comprehended. With the Dead power Upanishad as the foundation, negative energy was condensed into an attack, creating a massive Dead Sky Curtain in the air, which was grumblingly pressing down.</p>
<p>The Dead Sky Curtain covered the three experts of the Sea Clan. They were panicked, their faces gloomy.</p>
<p>Inside that gray sky, negative feelings multiplied. In their eyes, it was a world of death. They saw no hope of life. Everywhere was cold and deadly silent. But they could hear countless ghosts crying, calling for them from inside that dead world.</p>
<p>Being perplexed, they suddenly had a strange thought that they were part of that dead world, and it absolutely belonged to them no matter what.</p>
<p>When this negative mood arose, it meant their fighting will and belief had been smashed. Now they couldn&rsquo;t create a complete thought. Naturally, they could never urge the energy in their body wholly.</p>
<p>The confusedness in their eyes became clearer, and the three of them seemed to be completely foolish. They stood still at their spots, just letting the Dead Sky fall on them.</p>
<p>The deadly energy inside the Dead Sky condensed and created the massive Death Seal. They grumblingly exploded in the ash-gray clouds, and instantly pressed down on the three prisoners. At that perilous moment, they woke up instinctively.</p>
<p>They urged the God Domain one more time, trying to stimulate the leftover energy in their bodies. With the loud sound of a furious water current, a flow of tenacious water power extended, creating the white waves swarming toward the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t change his face. A thought popped up in his soul.</p>
<p>The powers of the Earth Flame, the Vermilion Bird True Flame, and the flaming solar energy in his body fused into one furious and wild flame, flying out from his sleeve. The flaming dragon stormed toward the water waves the other three had created.</p>
<p>The fire dragon wound, marching forward. Shriveled, dried plants ignited and burned. Even the rigid rocks were melted into a strange viscous substance. Shortly, the area of several thousand meters in front of Shi Yan had become a fire sea.</p>
<p>Flames covered everywhere. The Earth Flame and the Vermilion Bird True Flame seized the chance and flew out discreetly, releasing their flaming energy into the sea of fire.</p>
<p>The God Domain that the three prisoners had created with efforts was burned by the furious, rolling flame. Their energy was consumed faster. The Sea Clan was always afraid of fire. It&rsquo;s their nature. That&rsquo;s why they were petrified again.</p>
<p>The evil energy of the Dead Sky had affected their Soul Consciousness, storming into their soul altar and affecting their God Souls.</p>
<p>Three poor Sea Clan experts at the First Sky of King God Realm had made wrong assumptions, which helped Shi Yan&rsquo;s wicked and cruel force break their souls. The Dead Sky then controlled their mind, making them walk toward the Dead Sky and the sea of fire.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was calm. He released his Soul Consciousness to watch each of their commotions. He didn&rsquo;t dare to be careless.</p>
<p>The onlookers were dazed, gazing at the mirror lake. They all wore a bizarre face.</p>
<p>Since they weren&rsquo;t inside the Dead Sky, they didn&rsquo;t know how the evil energy there had affected the souls of the prisoners. In their view, they saw only the three experts of the Sea Clan got stunned then got crazy as they proactively walked toward the fire sea and let the ash-gray mist cover them.</p>
<p>At that moment, the onlookers suddenly realized that the three Sea Clan experts were about to be finished under Shi Yan&rsquo;s strange and wicked powers. They had no hope of overturning the situation.</p>
<p>And it was true.</p>
<p>The three experts of the Sea clan walked into the fire sea. Their God Bodies couldn&rsquo;t resist the burning force of the Earth Flame and the Vermilion Bird True Flame. Shortly, they were melted turning into a puddle of blood, which was then evaporated into a blood-red mist.</p>
<p>The strangest thing was they didn&rsquo;t feel pain, just standing dazedly as if their souls had gone away. They weren&rsquo;t aware of their God Bodies being melted gradually.</p>
<p>People watching the battle from a corner of the Purgatory Star had their eyes sparkling looking at the warriors in the mirror lake. They suddenly felt a chill sent down their spines. A cold and fearful feeling arose from their hearts.</p>
<p>The deaths of the three Sea Clan experts weren&rsquo;t bloody or tragic. But they were so evil and bizarre, which was like watching something virtual and eerie.</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t treasure his life? Who can keep silent being burned? Who will go upon his own initiative to die?</p>
<p>The calmer the deaths of the three prisoners of the Sea Clan were, the more frightened the onlookers were when they looked at Shi Yan in the Extreme Purgatory Field. They all felt their scalp numb.</p>
<p>This kid is thorny and scary. No one knows what he has done to the enemies and made them willing to die without feeling pain or fright. What kind of power Upanishad is that?</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo, Rochester, and Carthew put on the dark and gloomy face. A gleam of fear flashed in their eyes. They were discreetly putting up guard, thinking that Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t an easy opponent. They didn&rsquo;t know which power Upanishad he was cultivating that had such evil and sinister effects.</p>
<p>Da Lei was uncertain. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, knitting his brows tightly.</p>
<p>Only Leona had gained back her calmness as if she had finally verified something. She strangely relaxed, eating the crystal clear fruits. She looked calm and deliberate as if her question had been answered.</p>
<p>Chapter 776: Pick the Tough Target to Start!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Three warriors of the Sea Clan at the King God Realm were burned down, leaving only bone dust on the ground.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood in the center of the rolling fire and retrieved his Dead power Upanishad with negative energy. He squinted, absorbing the Essence Qi of the three King God Realm warriors into his body. He held a look of indifference with no traces of fatigue after a fierce battle.</p>
<p>In fact, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t consume much energy at all.</p>
<p>With the Earth Flame and the Vermilion Bird Flame&rsquo;s assistance, he could simply destroy the opponents&rsquo; Water power Upanishad. His Space power Upanishad had swallowed an enormous part of their energy. He expected a smooth victory.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t have enough time to calm down in his sea of fire. Shortly, he frowned and then snorted.</p>
<p>The Purgatory Token on his waist sent him eight energy flows of living beings. Apparently, his battle with the three Sea Clan experts had alerted the prisoners around here. They silently gathered.</p>
<p>At the other corner of the Purgatory Star, the five feudal vassals were still sinking in fright. At this moment, they were sensitive to any changes. They were all clearly shaken. Their eyes shifted to the mirror, holding their own gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mwahahaha!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo laughed fiendishly. He didn&rsquo;t say anything but his face said it all.</p>
<p>In Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s eyes, Shi Yan had just finished a tough battle killing three Sea Clan experts. Therefore, he must have consumed a lot of his energy.</p>
<p>At this moment, more and more prisoners were coming to him. One of them had reached the Second Sky of King God Realm. With his experience, Ao Gu Duo believed that that warrior wouldn&rsquo;t control himself and instead burst out and kill Shi Yan to take the Purgatory Token, which would help him survive the Extreme Purgatory Field and gain a new life.</p>
<p>Carthew and Rochester had the same thought. They frowned, observing.</p>
<p>Only Leona stayed calm and cold. She glared at Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s group and mockingly snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over for him,&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo spread his arms, laughing cheerily. &ldquo;You should prepare to hand me your life star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of Carthew&rsquo;s mouth twitched. He looked at Ao Gu Duo, and then Leona. He didn&rsquo;t say anything, his face strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand you my life star? Ao Gu Duo, are you blind? Watch it!&rdquo; Leona smiled faintly. Apparently, she wasn&rsquo;t someone who would yield easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zi Yao has chosen a good guard. If he can pass the challenge in the Extreme Purgatory Field, his attainment in the future is something we can&rsquo;t assess.&rdquo; Du Tian Le said with emotions. &ldquo;Battling with higher realm when he&rsquo;s at only the Third Sky of True God Realm and he won easily. I don&rsquo;t think many juniors in our divine nation can achieve such a feat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester nodded. &ldquo;This kid does have some tricks. No wonder why Zi Yao gave him the quota, which should be Ao Gera&rsquo;s. Yeah, I think that little girl&rsquo;s correct again. Her vision is getting sharper indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo looked at him indignantly, shouting. &ldquo;My nephew Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t want to compete with him. He knew he would receive a quota from me. That&rsquo;s why he gave the other his. Harrumph, I want to see if he can survive or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should watch carefully,&rdquo; Rochester lifted his head, looking at him without fear. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I suddenly believe that that boy will get out of the Extreme Purgatory Field alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rochester, you mean my nephew would die?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo spat out coldly with a ferocious look on his face.</p>
<p>Nodded, Rochester grinned. &ldquo;True. If Shi Yan could break through the King God Realm shortly, I believe he can survive. Your nephew? Perhaps he will die. Hahaha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo grimaced. He harrumphed indignantly, his eyes giving off a savage gaze as if his wild nature had been aroused.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Carthew and Rochester were feudal vassals like him, of course they wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of him. Sometimes, they would mock him, which enraged him badly.</p>
<p>He gazed at the mirror lake. If his look could cross that lake, with his cultivation base, perhaps he could use his look to pierce Shi Yan to death.</p>
<p>Too bad, Du Tian Ji had hired specialists to create this lake. It hid a great mystery that he couldn&rsquo;t use his soul to get through it.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; King Du Tian Ji of the divine nation nodded and rubbed his chin. &ldquo;Not bad at all,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>Zi Yao was happy. &ldquo;I told you, Father. This man is so mysterious. It&rsquo;s not easy to make him lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little girl. Your eyes had always been sharp. I am proud of you.&rdquo; DJ looked at her deeply. After a while, he sighed. &ldquo;Unfortunately, you are not a man. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have such a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face darkened as sorrow pierced her heart. She just sighed and said nothing.</p>
<p>Inside the furious fire, the temperature was getting higher and higher. The ancient trees around had contributed to this mighty fire. The burning fire got beautifully fiercer. In the fire sea, Shi Yan was calm, standing upright like a spear, watching here and there.</p>
<p>Deep inside the dark forest, eight prisoners were hiding. One of them was at the Second Sky of King God Realm. His life magnetic field was obviously stronger than the others&rsquo;. Shi Yan spotted them via his Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare to act rashly. There were seven First Sky of King God Realm warriors and one Second Sky of King God Realm warrior. Even if he was more arrogant, he wouldn&rsquo;t dare say that he could defeat this force, especially since he had just finished a battle. Absorbing the Essence Qi of the Sea Clan experts would take time to filter. If he engaged in another battle at this moment, it would be too unfavorable to him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare show a trace of fatigue.</p>
<p>He knew that when those hungry wolves saw that he was tired, they would swarm over wildly and slash him, grinding him to take his Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>At this moment, he became calmer, pondering in the sea of fire. Abruptly, he faced the sky and laughed crazily. In the ear-piercing whistle, he took action first.</p>
<p>Clusters of flaming energy balled next to him. Just like the burning meteors from the sky, they started to precisely bombard those hiding warriors.</p>
<p>Rumble Rumble Rumble!</p>
<p>With the fireballs falling, those who were hiding urged their God Domain to retreat or to use their powers to resist.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>The fierce whistle that could prickle people&rsquo;s eardrums exploded inside the field.</p>
<p>Although nobody could detect the source of the hissing, they all felt an extremely sharp force. Three Bone Thorns darted so fast that no one could actually see them move. With space power, they glided and disappeared, leaving only the terrifying whistle.</p>
<p>The God Domain of one of the hiding people was pierced instantly. A Bone Thorn appeared, flying towards his neck.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A low, rumbling sound echoed from that man&rsquo;s direction. In just a blink, that man showed himself. He was an expert of the Dark Spirit Clan, the one who had the highest realm among the prisoners hiding here.</p>
<p>Second Sky of King God Realm!</p>
<p>Boom Boom!</p>
<p>Two other Bone Thorns appeared from the shadows, furiously stabbing.</p>
<p>The Dark Spirit Clan&rsquo;s expert put on a grim face while both of his hands were making hand seals and different techniques in the air. Light sparkled gloriously.</p>
<p>Just like the blooming firework, the Bone Thorns and his hand seals brought more light which flashed dazzlingly, hurting people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>His hand seals and techniques turned into special symbols of the Dark Spirit Clan. Just like living creatures, they stopped the furious Bone Thorns. However, he had to retreat.</p>
<p>Massive fireballs flew toward seven other warriors. They quietly retreated, not daring to stay and sneak into this battle.</p>
<p>The Second Sky of King God Realm Dark Spirit Clan expert had to make the hand seals continuously while the three Bone Thorns were chasing after him like the spooky ghosts. No matter how hard he wiggled, he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of them. After one futile attempt, they would disappear. Immediately, they would reappear from a cunning angle, which made the other struggle hard to dodge and resist.</p>
<p>Shortly, that man glared at Shi Yan from a far distance, snorted, then ran away.</p>
<p>When the other seven saw the Second Sky of King God Realm running away, they didn&rsquo;t stop to think and immediately ran for their lives.</p>
<p>In just a blink, no one was hiding near Shi Yan.</p>
<p>At this moment, sweat started to bead on his forehead. His tense nerves relaxed. He hastened to use pellets to adjust his conditions.</p>
<p>The man at the Second Sky of King God Realm was truly strong. Shi Yan had used the Bone Thorns with space power but he couldn&rsquo;t pierce through his God Domain shortly to attack his God Body.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had tried his best to apply the knowledge of space power to his attack. He had even added Star energy into the Bone Thorns. However, it was only enough to make his opponents afraid of him, not sufficient to deal any damage.</p>
<p>The reason why the expert retreated was because he couldn&rsquo;t estimate Shi Yan&rsquo;s real competence. He was afraid that once he fought with him, both would receive damage, which was the best chance for the other seven prisoners to attack them. In the end, he couldn&rsquo;t get the Purgatory Token and he could have been wounded badly or even gotten killed.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood that if there weren&rsquo;t so many people hiding and waiting for a chance around them, that Dark Spirit Clan&rsquo;s expert probably would not have given up his scheme. He would do everything he can to kill Shi Yan.</p>
<p>The main reason why the other had left, besides Shi Yan&rsquo;s beyond-realm performance, was that he was afraid of stealthy operations of the others. Thus, he had to leave for now.</p>
<p>Choosing the strongest to attack had given the best intimidation effect. It happened all according to Shi Yan&rsquo;s plan. Although he had to use a lot of his energy, no one dared to stay near him now. He had assumed correctly. He found the way to deal with them.</p>
<p>If he had chosen a First Sky of King God Realm warrior to attack, the result wouldn&rsquo;t have been as desired. He wouldn&rsquo;t have created the scaring effect. Instead, he would have created the chance for that Second Sky of King God Realm warrior to kill him with one strike. In the end, he would have died pitifully here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out. Cover ten miles around. Tell me immediately when any creature approaches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Soul Consciousness sensed a while in the Purgatory Token. He ordered the heaven flames resolutely. When all the heaven flames flew out of the fire sea, he left the place immediately, crazily flying toward the more perilous and isolated area.</p>
<p>Shortly, his image disappeared in the view of Leona and the other. His figure wasn&rsquo;t projected in the mirror lake anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very clever. He has many fighting experiences, too. Being calm at a critical moment like that&hellip; he&rsquo;s truly a character.&rdquo; The master of the divine nation suddenly laughed in the Dark Firmament Star far from them. He nodded, &ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s not bad. Not worse than Ao Gera. I&rsquo;m anticipating that he and Ao Gera could have a battle. I think it would be more interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face was gloomy. A gleam of begrudging sorrow sparkled in her eyes.</p>
<p>Ao Gera and Shi Yan were her subordinates. No matter who won or lost, she would suffer from grief.</p>
<p>Chapter 777: Getting Stronger!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know that both Leona and Ao Gu Duo had placed a big bet on him or the fact that the master of the divine nation in the Dark Firmament Star was watching him.</p>
<p>In the Extreme Purgatory Field, after killing three First Sky of King God Realm Sea Clan warriors, he immediately ran one thousand miles away and found a cave in a quiet mountain to absorb the Essence Qi of the three King God Realm warriors.</p>
<p>Since he had reached the Peak of True God Realm, his acupuncture points had expanded and were able to store more energy.</p>
<p>In addition, he found himself unable to fall into bedevilment easily. The negative moods couldn&rsquo;t drag him into insanity anymore and he could focus with greater clarity..</p>
<p>This change had arisen earlier. When he was in the sea of meteorites, he had always concentrated on exploiting ores which cleared his mind and purified his God Soul.</p>
<p>He found that when he focused on achieving a certain task and keeping his mind clear, he wouldn&rsquo;t fall into bedevilment easily.</p>
<p>When he killed that expert of the Dark Clan, the Soul Gathering Pearl, the mark on his forehead, and the Inner World Five Devils had fused together, creating a section in the soul altar. When that section in his soul altar was built, his soul and mind became tougher and more relaxed.</p>
<p>He thought that the reason why he wouldn&rsquo;t fall into bedevilment easily was related to the establishment of his soul altar.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sat cross-legged in the dim cave, staying in the slits between the big rocks in the case. He closed his eyes to more clearly feel the changes in his body.</p>
<p>The mysterious, refined energy didn&rsquo;t move this time to his Essence Qi ancient tree since it was brimmed now. Unless he could break through to the King God Realm, which would expand his Essence Qi ancient tree several times, he wouldn&rsquo;t receive any benefit from this mysterious energy anymore.</p>
<p>The mysterious energy diverged into two pathways into his body. One flooded his muscles, blood, and bones, increasing their strength and refining them one more time.</p>
<p>The energy going through the other path was converted into his Immortal Demon Blood. Half of the Essence Qi of the three First Sky of King God Realm warriors were turned into Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>There were about twenty-some drops of Immortal Demon Blood. He stored them in a place in his body. He could use these to fight back his enemies in an emergency.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had tried the bursting power of the Immortal Demon Blood in Carthew&rsquo;s gravitational room. Shi Yan decided that he must collect the Immortal Demon Blood by hunting experts in the Extreme Purgatory Field as he expected to carry out his plan to change his blood.</p>
<p>At the moment, he had more than seventy drops of Immortal Demon Blood stored in his body. Although it was still far from the quantity he needed, he felt hopeful.</p>
<p>Every time he adjusted his breath and conditions to refine his body, he calmed down and sensed his three powers Upanishad: Space, Star, and Death and Life.</p>
<p>Every time he engaged in battle, he would use these three powers to utilize supernatural martial techniques depending on the circumstance. Gradually, his understanding of the three powers Upanishad deepened.</p>
<p>It was quite different from the warriors. When Shi Yan broke through the True God realm, he had the three powers Upanishad create a tier of his soul altar.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was why he was unable decide which would be his main power and which would be his supportive power. In his point of view, all three powers Upanishad were all profound. None of them were weak. To him, they all provided tremendous support.</p>
<p>The fight with three warriors of the Sea Clan made him realize the extent of assistance that all the three powers had given him.</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t had space power, he would have never dissolved their formidable attacks and defeat them. Without the Dead Upanishad, their souls wouldn&rsquo;t have been affected, which led them to an unknowing death.</p>
<p>His resolute victory also related to other powers Upanishad that he had been cultivating. Using the correct of the three powers Upanishad precisely during a battle was the key to winning battles.</p>
<p>To him, the three powers Upanishad were all his main powers. He didn&rsquo;t want to give up any of them. He strongly believed that his three powers Upanishad could thrive together. In the future, they could boost his fighting competence to its maximum potential.</p>
<p>While quietly looking further ahead and retrieving the Soul Consciousness, Shi Yan felt changes in his body. He sent his soul into the soul altar and slowly understood.</p>
<p>After a while, he grinned. Touching the Purgatory Token, he flew out of the cave.</p>
<p>A flow of Soul Consciousness was poured into the Purgatory Token. Signs of energy of living beings within ten miles around would be shown in the token, which Shi Yan could check easily.</p>
<p>Shi Yan crossed through the vast forest aimlessly. He wanted to seek for a possible battle.</p>
<p>A flow of feeble energy sent out from the Purgatory Token. Shi Yan concentrated and sensed it. He grinned fiendishly and accelerated towards a lake.</p>
<p>After one hour.</p>
<p>The battle ended. A First Sky of King God Realm prisoner floated in the lake. His life was cut off.</p>
<p>He squinted, standing quietly by the lake. After a while, he departed.</p>
<p>He became a hunter. Prisoners in the adjacent areas became his prey. Of course, the roles were all relative. Some prisoners would initially consider Shi Yan delicious prey.</p>
<p>He was still at the True God Realm. Prisoners who detected him all thought that he was a soft persimmon that they could squeeze easily. From his death, they would earn the Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Most of the time, whenever he showed up, his target would laugh crazily, leaving him no time to talk. They would attack him first.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Extreme Purgatory Field, he found only villains. And, the participants&rsquo; realms were also high. The Third Sky of True God Realm was the entry level. There was no target better than such a contestant at the True God Realm. Thus, whenever a prisoner found him, they immediately became excited.</p>
<p>However,, those prisoners would quickly find that Shi Yan was actually the chewiest bone among the contestants in this Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Through the Purgatory Token, Shi Yan found his prey unceasingly. Once locating the one to attack, he would immediately entangle his prey and kill him. Afterward, he would take the dead man&rsquo;s Essence Qi to restore his energy, refine his bones and body, and condense the Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>Time flies quickly.</p>
<p>Three months had passed just like a blink of an eye. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t remember how many battles he had engaged and how many people he had killed. His fighting will remained full and his energy had always been at the peak of his realm.</p>
<p>Through battling during this period, the number of Immortal Demon Blood in his body had reached a frightening figure of three hundred!</p>
<p>This was a record he had never reached before.</p>
<p>Three hundred drops of Immortal Demon Blood could replace his blood in both of his arms. He had tried it. Once he replaced the blood in his arms with the Immortal Demon Blood, his arms felt like they had endless energy. He felt like he could tear the God Body of a King God Realm like he could rip off a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The Immortal Demon Blood hid some kind of evil, torrential energy that could fuse perfectly with his power. However, Shi Yan had never tried this kind of energy during his battles.</p>
<p>However, he believed that when he was backed into a corner, he would stimulate all the energy of the Immortal Demon Blood to overturn whatever situation. He could become the winner from what would seem like a clear loss.</p>
<p>After three months of fighting, he had used his opponents to perceive the essence of his three powers Upanishad.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field was an incomparably magical place. In this area, his perception and sensibility toward the powers became very sensitive.</p>
<p>In each fight, he had used the three powers Upanishad to kill his enemies. Afterward, he would obtain a new level of comprehension of the three powers Upanishad. After each battle, when he was refining the Immortal Demon Blood, he would summarize his mistakes he made during the battle and learn new skills in using the power.</p>
<p>Gradually, his understanding and perception of the three powers Upanishad became profound.</p>
<p>Today, he had hunted down five First Sky of King God Realm warriors. Seeing the pieces of bodies he had shattered lying in the blood puddles around the place, his face was cold, eyes shining like diamonds.</p>
<p>His body slightly shivered as he tried to calm his mind to learn the essence of using his power Upanishad in the previous fight. His soul reached back to the past to learn something from his fight.</p>
<p>A blinding light flashed gloriously in his soul altar. He was baffled. His eyes sparkled with a strange light. Starlight twirled around his body. Death and Life, the two different attributes, scattered uncontrollably around him.</p>
<p>Fine space slits sizzled and appeared spontaneously in the void near him. Space seemed to be in an uncontrollable chaos.</p>
<p>He was standing indifferently while his Soul Consciousness floated and entered some mysterious domain.</p>
<p>After a while, he made a passionate expression as if he saw something wonderful. He quickly stormed out of his place, flashing like a beam of light to find a place for his ascetical training.</p>
<p>He now had a good grasp of those mysteries. He just needed a way to continue studying. As long as he could harvest something, the threshold of the new realm, which had troubled him for a long time, would be wide open.</p>
<p>Once he reached the King God Realm, he believed that the realm of his prey in the Extreme Purgatory Field would be upgraded from the First Sky of King God Realm to the Second and Third Sky of King God Realm. When that happened, his Immortal Demon Blood could be condensed faster.</p>
<p>Shortly, he disappeared.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>In a corner of Purgatory Star, the five feudal vassals were sitting on their mountains together with Du Tian Le and watching the scenes in the lake.</p>
<p>The mirror lake had been divided into some smaller sections in which one of the villains was showing off his talents.</p>
<p>The lake would clearly project the battles. That&rsquo;s why Leona, Ao Gu Duo, and the others could watch most of the battles happening in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>In every battle, the three young people of Leona&rsquo;s team and three members of Ao Gera&rsquo;s team were like sharp weapons that could pierce through anything. Wherever they passed, most of the prisoners would be torn into pieces. Only the Third Sky of King God Realm warriors would proactively stay away from these pointy weapons to save their lives.</p>
<p>Besides those two forces, Yalan and Tie Mu under Carthew&rsquo;s command, and the other two warriors under Rochester&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t meet many troubles.</p>
<p>However, they had fewer achievements compared to Leona and Ao Gera&rsquo;s team. They could kill only a small number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was alone, so he could be considered a force himself. His achievement was relatively normal.</p>
<p>Chapter 778: True Colors</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>In three months, Shi Yan had killed many people. His achievement wasn&rsquo;t a small number, but it was still much smaller compared to the other five forces.</p>
<p>The warriors he had killed were all at the First Sky of King God Realm. He hadn&rsquo;t killed any Second Sky of King God Realm warriors. Moreover, after each battle, he would disappear for several days, a different habit compared to the other five forces. The other forces would continue their slaughter as if they had never been exhausted.</p>
<p>The achievement contestants could complete in the Extreme Purgatory Field did not only depend on the number they killed but also the realms of the ones they killed.</p>
<p>According to Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s rule, killing a Second Sky of King God Realm expert was equal to killing ten First Sky of King God Realm warriors. Leona&rsquo;s team and Ao Gera&rsquo;s team had killed several Second Sky of King God Realm experts. Their number wasn&rsquo;t something Shi Yan could compete with at the moment.</p>
<p>Since his real realm was still the True God Realm, he was limited. For the time being, he didn&rsquo;t dare battle the warriors at the Second Sky of King God Realm.</p>
<p>Only after he had entered the King God Realm could he skip the level and battle with the others. When that time came, he would be confident that he wouldn&rsquo;t get himself killed.</p>
<p>In his current condition, maybe he could kill a Second Sky of King God Realm warrior but it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. He would get hurt, and possibly suffer from severe wounds. The Extreme Purgatory Field hid dangers at every place and at all times. There wasn&rsquo;t a single peaceful moment in this place.</p>
<p>When the warriors battled against each other, they would generate tremendous energy fluctuation that would attract the other prisoners.</p>
<p>When someone sees you tired or wounded, he will not talk about rules. He will kill you instantly.</p>
<p>Since Shi Yan had a precise assumption to the situation, he hadn&rsquo;t dared to provoke the Second Sky of King God Realm warriors.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was afraid of defeat. He was afraid of bad wounds which would make him the prey of prisoners hiding elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had his own rules. Perhaps it was because of his cautiousness that he was able to survive until this moment, continue getting stronger and accumulate energy, and wait for a chance to break through.</p>
<p>Today, after three months of collecting Immortal Demon Blood and being patient, his chance has finally arrived.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>A corner of the Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>Leona, Ao Gu Duo, and the others were still watching their teams fight in different areas. Their faces were cold and indifferent. However, they didn&rsquo;t quarrel or mock each other anymore.</p>
<p>The result of this competition became gradually clear. If nothing unexpected happens, Leona&rsquo;s team and Ao Gera&rsquo;s team will become the forces that have killed the most and claim victory.</p>
<p>Yalan, Tie Mu, Rochester&rsquo;s team, and Da Meng&rsquo;s team hadn&rsquo;t faced any difficult situations yet. However, from the current scores, it would be difficult for them to win.</p>
<p>In their eyes, after three months, the winners would be Leona&rsquo;s and Ao Gera&rsquo;s teams.</p>
<p>And, what made people wait was the big bet between Leona and Ao Gu Duo.</p>
<p>They were waiting in silence for the encounter between Shi Yan and Ao Gera in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>However, the Extreme Purgatory Field was really vast, approximately half of the Purgatory Star. The chance for them to meet each other on the field was very slim.</p>
<p>Unless they proactively searched for each other.</p>
<p>This was how Ao Gera searched for Shi Yan. Before he killed someone, he would ask about Shi Yan&rsquo;s whereabouts. He wanted to locate Shi Yan quickly to start his bloody slaughter.</p>
<p>He remembered Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s words. His resentment towards Shi Yan had enraged him daily.</p>
<p>However, the prisoners who had met Shi Yan were all killed. Ao Gera couldn&rsquo;t find any news of Shi Yan&rsquo;s location. He was quite irritated.</p>
<p>Today, Ao Gera&rsquo;s chance came as he met the Dark Spirit Clan Second Sky of King God Realm warrior who had encountered Shi Yan. As they were at the same realm, being the God&rsquo;s favored one, Ao Gera was stronger than him. Moreover, Ao Gera wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p>
<p>That man&rsquo;s fate was determined.</p>
<p>He was defeated and wounded badly. His body and soul were detained.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t hasten to finish him. He asked with a cold stare, &ldquo;Do you know anything about a True God Realm contestant? He&rsquo;s one of us, one of the two weakest. But he doesn&rsquo;t know how to summon the beasts. Tell me what you know and I will let you die intact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dark Spirit Clan warrior had both his soul and energy restrained. He had heard about Ao Gera and his brutal methods before. Thus, he hesitated a bit then spat out, &ldquo;I know his general location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ao Gera&rsquo;s eyes brightened. He was surprised. &ldquo;You just need to tell me the estimated location. I can let you die without pain. I&rsquo;ll keep your God Body intact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him three months ago. Then, I hid for a while. I know where he is.&rdquo; the man pondered for a few seconds. He knew that he couldn&rsquo;t avoid Ao Gera&rsquo;s slaughter. If the other dragged his soul out and searched his soul using special techniques, his secret would be revealed. Thus, he shared what he knew about Shi Yan&rsquo;s whereabouts honestly.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s body was ripped off by countless beams of gold light. Blood splashed like a rain shower. The thick smell of blood permeated the area.</p>
<p>Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t let the man die intact. He stooped and smiled evilly as if he had released out his anger. Gold lightning strikes shot out from his God Domain, grinding that man&rsquo;s flesh body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, I found you,&rdquo; Ao Gera stooped, his eyes sinister with an evil intent. He suddenly said, &ldquo;Change the direction. It is time to take that brat life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two warriors under Ao Gu Duo understood his personality so they were not surprised by his emotions. They nodded, telling him that they understood.</p>
<p>This team of three followed in the direction the man had told them, moving fast.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is brutal. He has no humanity. He doesn&rsquo;t talk rules. He even lied to the man who died. Well then, I like him.&rdquo; The master of the divine nation Du Tian Ji laughed slightly while watching Ao Gera&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>A confused look sparkled in Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes. Her bold brows knitted together, her face unnatural.</p>
<p>Until now, Ao Gera was always nice and gentle in front of her, giving her a feeling similar to a mild, spring breeze. She had never seen this other face of Ao Gera.</p>
<p>In this place today, she had finally witnessed Ao Gera&rsquo;s brutal deeds. She understood that the Ao Gera in front of her was one person. Behind her back, he was a completely different person.</p>
<p>The lake in her heart rippled as a small rock was thrown into it. She pondered.</p>
<p>That man had never hid his true self. From the beginning until now, he always acted cold and harsh. Compared to Ao Gera, he seemed to be&hellip; easier to approach.</p>
<p>She contemplated quietly. She was a little absent-minded. Ao Gera&rsquo;s deed had chilled her heart.</p>
<p>The master of the divine nation showed a faint smile as he was not bothered by Ao Gera. He laughed louder. &ldquo;Zao-er, don&rsquo;t you feel lost? In our divine nation, Ao Gera is infamous indeed. After he&rsquo;s become your retinue, he&rsquo;s tried to control himself. You have never seen him in this manner I guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded bitterly. &ldquo;When he was with me, he was always nice and gentle. He treated people well and friendly. I let him handle my Glorious Amethyst Star. My people liked and respected him. They said that he was like a tender sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji was surprised. &ldquo;My silly little girl. It is because he is chasing you. That&rsquo;s why he had to show you his best face. Didn&rsquo;t you know his reputation before you met him? Did you just ignored it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao pondered for a while. Then she said begrudgingly, &ldquo;Perhaps when he was with me, he was too nice and gentle. It made me not believe in the rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, a new thought startled her.</p>
<p>That asshole didn&rsquo;t change his manner in front of me. He never wanted to show off his perfect features. He often told me cold words that made me hate him&hellip; Is it true that he doesn&rsquo;t think about me? That&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t mind what I think about him?</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, she felt lost somehow. She felt a little bit angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal. When your father chased your mother, I was always gentle and tender. I didn&rsquo;t show her my evil face. I tried to protect her because I cared. Although Ao Gera&rsquo;s infamous, he is honest to you. He has to eat the bitter fruits. I&rsquo;m sure about this.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji smiled. &ldquo;And about that boy, I think he doesn&rsquo;t have any bad will towards you. That&rsquo;s why he shows his true colors to you. It is good, anyway. If you wanted to use him and he always hid his honest thoughts, it would not be good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people pretending in front of me. Too fake. I&rsquo;m willing to let Ao Gera show his true colors to me. I don&rsquo;t want him to wear a mask when he&rsquo;s with me.&rdquo; Zi Yao suddenly lifted up her head, looking behind the master of the divine nation. &ldquo;I think staying with someone like Shi Yan is much easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji stayed silent as if he was recalling something, his eyes showing mixed emotions. After a while, he muttered, &ldquo;Perhaps I was wrong that year. Your mother got angry with me when she found out that I was so brutal. Perhaps, I shouldn&rsquo;t disguise myself. She wouldn&rsquo;t have questions in her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes flashed. &ldquo;Father, how did my mother die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji grimaced. He snorted and didn&rsquo;t talk more.</p>
<p>Since Zi Yao was anxious, she asked nothing else. However, her curiosity wouldn&rsquo;t die that easily.</p>
<p>Long afterwards, Du Tian Ji opened his mouth again. &ldquo;Zao-er, if you could choose between Ao Gera and Shi Yan, who would you choose? Ao Gu Duo stands behind Ao Gera. Although that boy&rsquo;s cultivating the Dead Upanishad, he seems to have nothing related to that person. From what I&rsquo;ve observed, his potential is not as strong as Ao Gera. He can&rsquo;t assist you well. If you could choose one of them to be the survivor, who would you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was surprised and she panicked. After a long time, she stooped and whined, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, you don&rsquo;t need to choose. Only one of them will survive. They will help you choose themselves.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji smiled faintly and his face relaxed. Zi Yao didn&rsquo;t know what her father was thinking.</p>
<p>Chapter 779: A Frightening Change</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Some lake in Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le stooped to watch the lake, holding the blood crown in his hand.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he made a stern expression and felt surprised. He couldn&rsquo;t help but cry, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona could feel something too. Her line of sight fell on an area in the lake. An uncontrollable joy crossed her dark, green eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? Earth and heaven energy in that area is changing. From this situation, perhaps someone is breaking into the new realm?&rdquo; Du Tian Le was startled. Then, he recalled something. &ldquo;Shi Yan is in that area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was shaken.</p>
<p>Rochester, Carthew, and Da Lei were surprised. Strange light shot out from their eyes as they shifted their looks to that area.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo grimaced and couldn&rsquo;t hide his snort. He seemed to be very irritated.</p>
<p>In the mirror lake, massive energy was gathering inside a cave of a hill. That kind of energy looked like immense, gray clouds. The energy seemed to be tied by an invisible entity that kept pulling them, gathering them together. Strange beams of light shot out from that cluster as if they were refining energy.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the mass of that gray energy was as big as a room. Gradually, the energy in its core had pulled and gathered more earth and heaven energy. Shortly, the mass of energy clustered at that area had covered ten mu (1) of land.</p>
<p>Peculiar energy fluctuations appeared in that area. From time to time, they could see light shoot out from a small slit in the space.</p>
<p>From their perspective, they could only see energy continually gathering. They could see neither what was happening inside the cave nor what Shi Yan was doing.</p>
<p>However, they knew that only one contestant knew how to use space power and make space crack. That person was Shi Yan.</p>
<p>So although they couldn&rsquo;t see his figure, they were sure he was the one who was creating such a tremendous commotion.</p>
<p>Earth and heaven energy condensed and refined unceasingly, creating the miraculous power that could change the body. This was the most evident sign that happened when a True God Realm warrior was breaking through to the King God Realm.</p>
<p>Apparently, at this moment, Shi Yan was immersing in his breakthrough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been just three months, a short period and he can make it to this step. Not bad. In fact, he&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Carthew was sinking in thought. He was astounded for a while before talking, instinctively looking at Leona.</p>
<p>Leona wasn&rsquo;t shaken. She was calm, and hope could be seen through her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this boy can get out alive, his future potential is immeasurable.&rdquo; Da Lei suddenly spoke up after many days of keeping silent. His eyes raked through people then said seriously. &ldquo;I met him three years ago. At that time, he had only the Second Sky of True God Realm cultivation base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would never mistake it. The battle that took place three years ago had left a deep impression on his mind that he would never forget.</p>
<p>He would never forget that Shi Yan, at his Second Sky of True God Realm, had subdued his son Da Meng three years ago.</p>
<p>Through that battle, he could see a shadow behind Shi Yan. The shadow that had disappeared for so many years, but he still respected it out of fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why he didn&rsquo;t dare kill Shi Yan even though he felt so ashamed. He didn&rsquo;t dare attack him himself but he had planned some stealthy plans.</p>
<p>He was afraid of the shadow behind Shi Yan. He was afraid that if he made a wrong assumption, disaster would fall on him and his family.</p>
<p>That man was an undying legend of the Raging Flame Star Area. Whoever had known about his legend would never dare face him.</p>
<p>Da Lei&rsquo;s cold explanation had attracted many people.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo couldn&rsquo;t stay calm. He shot up from his seat, trying to hide the fright on his face. &ldquo;Da Lei, are you sure? That kid had only the Second Sky of True God Realm cultivation base three years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester expressed his admiration. &ldquo;Zi Yao&rsquo;s good fortune is here. Finally, I know why she wanted to give Ao Gera&rsquo;s quota to Shi Yan. I got it now. That little girl isn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew was shaken. His eyes brightened as he took a deep breath. &ldquo;Three years. He needed just three years to enter the Third Sky of True God Realm from the Second Sky of True God Realm. If he had accumulated for many years, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a big surprise. However, his Third Sky of True God Realm has just been established after three years. And now he was able to walk through the door leading to the King God Realm. Three years. He has used only three years. He&rsquo;s a monster! Such a monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>In their eyes, when Shi Yan was still at the Second Sky of True God Realm, he could have a lot of time accumulating energy and perceiving his realm. Breaking through the Third Sky of True God Realm in three years wasn&rsquo;t something too special to achieve.</p>
<p>They thought that Shi Yan must have had a long time cultivating before that.</p>
<p>But this was different.</p>
<p>The time he took to enter the King God Realm from the Third Sky of True God Realm had taken him less than three years.</p>
<p>How can someone comprehend that?</p>
<p>The five great feudal vassals and Du Tian Le were startled. They all fell into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think after a warrior reached the Third Sky of True God Realm, even if he uses magical pellets and medicine every day, he can&rsquo;t fill the Essence Qi ancient tree within three years, let alone spend countless days comprehending his powers Upanishad. Three years is just a flash in our life, a small ripple in the long river of life. It isn&rsquo;t worth mentioning. But he&hellip;&rdquo; Rochester shook his head, forcing a smile. &ldquo;I had spent almost one hundred years to find a chance to leap up from the Third Sky of True God Realm. This is considered fast already. Many have spent several hundred years to reach the King God Realm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody stayed silent..</p>
<p>Even foul-mouthed Ao Gu Duo had zipped his mouth with a gloomy and uncertain face. No one knew what he was thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he can maintain this cultivating speed,&rdquo; Leona gloomy voice arose before pausing from looking at the grimaced Ao Gu Duo, &ldquo;his boasting words can become true. Within one hundred years, he can take the head on your neck, Ao Gu Duo. These are no longer the words of a madman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody else recalled this event. They shifted their strange looks toward Ao Gu Duo.</p>
<p>Under their scrutinizing looks, Ao Gu Duo darkened his face and said nothing. He grimaced more, his sturdy body trembling. Apparently, the other had poked his wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she had just bragged. I never thought that I had underestimated him.&rdquo; Carthew suddenly laughed. He picked up the strong liquor from the maid standing next to him, gulped, then laughed louder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drunk and chatted with him. Perhaps I can brag about this later. Haha. Interesting. Maybe I can witness a miracle. A new star is rising in the sky of the divine nation with its glorious light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems I will have to flatter him when he gets out of there. Haha.&rdquo; Rochester added with an odd look.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo looked like he was about to shoot fire from his eyes. He was shivering indignantly. His face had darkened to the acme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too excited. Breaking in the Extreme Purgatory Field isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. Did you forget where he is?&rdquo; Du Tian Le suddenly spoke up, frowning deeply. &ldquo;How many could have a decent end breaking to a new realm in this Extreme Purgatory Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing him, the shaken Ao Gu Duo laughed sinisterly. &ldquo;Oh yeah. No matter how endless his potential is, risking his life to break through the new realm in the Extreme Purgatory Field is no different from finding a way to death. Haha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona remembered the special features of the Extreme Purgatory Field. She couldn&rsquo;t hide her pale face as she felt a little anxious.</p>
<p>What happened was not different from what they anticipated.</p>
<p>After Du Tian Le finished, new changes happened in Shi Yan&rsquo;s area.</p>
<p>Within one hundred miles around, many prisoners were hiding. From the peculiar change of earth and heaven energy, they knew what was happening.</p>
<p>Someone was about to break through in the Extreme Purgatory Field! This realization stirred up the prisoners. They didn&rsquo;t hesitate. All started to move toward Shi Yan&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p>Any warrior breaking through to the new realm shouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed. Especially when they were about to break through a big realm! This breakthrough needed to be carried out discreetly. They even needed strong warriors to guard them. Once they got attacked, it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon if they got killed.</p>
<p>It was different from the time Shi Yan broke through to the True God Realm. To reach the King God Realm, he needed to gather earth and heaven energy, which couldn&rsquo;t be done quickly.</p>
<p>At this moment, he couldn&rsquo;t be distracted so he couldn&rsquo;t urge his power to resist the enemies. He needed to focus wholeheartedly to break through. If he got a lot of enemies waiting for this moment, he would be surrounded and have no means to withstand.</p>
<p>Every one of the prisoners knew that it was convenient for them to attack him at this moment. Thus, all of them started to flood this place.</p>
<p>Soon, savage villains appeared one by one in front of Shi Yan&rsquo;s cave. There were around ten with several Second Sky of King God Realm warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, everyone has their own fate. He doesn&rsquo;t know the dangerous features of the Extreme Purgatory Field, and he dares take such risks. Haha.&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo calmed down as the big rock hanging in his heart seemed to disappear. He could smile now.</p>
<p>Rochester, Carthew, and Du Tian Le were solemn. They all frowned and sighed inwardly. They thought that Shi Yan was acting rashly. He wasn&rsquo;t careful as he had made so many ferocious villains surround him.</p>
<p>Even Leona was restlessly agitated. She scolded him in her mind, thinking that Shi Yan was too arrogant. He understood the perilous characteristics of the Extreme Purgatory Field, but he dared to break through in this evil place.</p>
<p>Her worries weren&rsquo;t only because of a life star but something else&hellip;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s life was related to one of her secrets and even her future. She shouldn&rsquo;t be tense, but she didn&rsquo;t want to stand and stare at the prisoners taking Shi Yan&rsquo;s life while he was in the middle of his breakthrough.</p>

<p>Chapter 780: The King&rsquo;s Heart</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>The Grand Palace of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji rubbed his chin, smiling in a relaxed manner. &ldquo;That kid doesn&rsquo;t value his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s bold brows knitted tightly. She clenched her teeth and mumbled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s thinking. He knows how dangerous the Extreme Purgatory Field is but he still decided to act rashly.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo, Rochester, and Leona had the same concerns.. More than ten hungry-wolf prisoners gathered outside the cave where Shi Yan was cultivating. They all gazed at the cave.</p>
<p>There were no good guys in this pack. They were all the felons of the divine nation. Their thirst for blood was their basic instinct.</p>
<p>To confine them, the five great feudal vassals had put a lot of effort. Many of them were infamous in the Raging Flame Star Area for their bloody hands.</p>
<p>Many warriors would shake like a leaf seeing them outside.</p>
<p>Today, they were gathering here for a sole purpose. The Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Purgatory Star, the biggest prison of the empire, only imprisoned the death-sentenced inmates. Once they were kept in the Purgatory Star, no one even dreamed about breaking out.</p>
<p>Hotshots guarded this place year round and the prison also had intimidating restrictions and barriers. If they took risks and broke out, death would be their only consequence.</p>
<p>The reason why they were kept alive was because the empire needed them. It needed them to die in a valuable way. The Extreme Purgatory Field was their stage, their blood and fire fate.</p>
<p>With their forsaken destiny, they had only one way to live which was through the Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Taking the Purgatory Token was the only way for them to get out of the Purgatory Star. No matter how serious their crimes were, the empire would clear them all.</p>
<p>A Purgatory Token meant life, a dawn of hope.</p>
<p>At this moment, that dawn was in front of them. It was also easy to reach.</p>
<p>What prisoner wouldn&rsquo;t be excited?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like we can&rsquo;t wait for he and Ao Gera to engage in battle. Warriors have to concentrate wholeheartedly while breaking through. He won&rsquo;t be an exception.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji smiled faintly. &ldquo;What a pity, his potential wasn&rsquo;t bad. He was just too rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao gritted her teeth. She was worried and felt chills.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know why she didn&rsquo;t want to see Shi Yan experiencing bad situations. This thought was much stronger than her worry for Ao Gera&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the villains gathering more and more, looking like they were about to take action, some images flashed in her mind.</p>
<p>Da Meng fought with Shi Yan, which frightened Da Lei, to save her imperial dignity. She and Shi Yan ran away in the amethyst war chariot through the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. She remembered the moment he controlled the flaming meteorites bombarding the others wildly in the strange forbidden place. The time they spent together in the barren and isolated land. Each of his jokes, his actions&hellip;</p>
<p>Those images played in her head and she couldn&rsquo;t wash them away.</p>
<p>A wisp of bitterness rippled in the lake of her heart, expanding to her whole body. While she didn&rsquo;t realize that, her beautiful eyes sparkled, expressing worry and tension which had never happened before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been so many years and she had never met a man who could make her yearn for him, worried about him like that. She was worried that he would be killed.</p>
<p>Ao Gera had stood behind her for so many years, but she had never felt the same way towards him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zi Yao knew that the man who came from an unknown continent had rooted deep in her heart, occupying an important position she could never dismiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confused,&rdquo; Du Tian Ji frowned, talking coldly and heartlessly. &ldquo;People who plan for big schemes won&rsquo;t notice the minor details. They won&rsquo;t let anything distract their minds. No matter who he is, he is just a sword in your hand, the support you need to move forward. You have to remember that the sword in your hand is just a tool and you should never let the sword stab yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao was shaken. She woke up from her thought, shaking her head miserably. She said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a callous heart, how could you survive the cruel and harsh competition? If you&rsquo;re not cold and calm enough, you will harm not only yourself but also your people.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji snorted. &ldquo;Girl, you can&rsquo;t compete with your brother Du Jia in these manners. You&rsquo;re soft hearted. How will you succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get the throne, Du Jia attacked me and my brother. Is this the necessary quality to be a King?&rdquo; Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes shown with anger. &ldquo;Father, were you just like my brother that year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was more heartless than him,&rdquo; Du Tian Ji parted his lips with a cold and sinister face. &ldquo;You and Du Jia aren&rsquo;t blood siblings. You have different mothers. It is normal for him to attack you guys. That year, no need to mention my siblings born from other mothers; I even killed my own brothers. My own brothers who stood in my way, I killed them.</p>
<p>Zi Yao face lost color in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could get back to that time, I would still do the same. For the apex of the martial path, for the prosperity of the divine nation, there is no man that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill!&rdquo; Du Tian Ji snorted, his face heartless and resolute.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, strange energy was rippling. Earth and heaven energy gathered thickly on an area more than ten mu. Sparks were sent into the sky with lots of energy.</p>
<p>Flows of earth and heaven energy became purer, oozing out from the energy area. They streamed out and then were pulled into the cave by some unknown force.</p>
<p>In the adjacent areas by the river, in the forest, or even underground, the prisoners couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer. They showed up one by one, gazing at the cave like a pack of hungry wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furlow, you&rsquo;ve been watching for a while. Why haven&rsquo;t you attacked yet?&rdquo; A Ghost Mark Clan warrior at the Second Sky of King God Realm turned and looked at the other.</p>
<p>These people were imprisoned for a long time so they knew each other well.</p>
<p>The man named Furlow was a Sea Clan warrior who had lost one arm. He also had the Second Sky of King God Realm cultivation base. He snorted, &ldquo;Larkey, if you want the Purgatory Token, you should go now. Haha. Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t compete against you. Go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Larkey were the two Second Sky of King God Realm warriors in this group. They understood each other, and they knew that they were all tough and cruel.</p>
<p>They were secretly afraid of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m not in a hurry. I&rsquo;ve been imprisoned for too long. I&rsquo;m not going to act impatiently now.&rdquo; Larkey cracked a smile, showing his yellow teeth. &ldquo;But you, I remember you saying that you have a son. His life is tough out there. Since you&rsquo;ve been jailed, he has suffered a lot. I can&rsquo;t say if he would still be alive now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing him, Furlow&rsquo;s face drained of color and snorted again.</p>
<p>The truth was that he couldn&rsquo;t wait. His son suffered and was bullied frequently out there. He calculated that his son was about to break through to the Sky Realm.</p>
<p>Furlow knew that the Sky Realm breakthrough required a lot of materials and lucky encounters. It would be better if he could have the divine pellets for support and received a good power Upanishad from the Source of Power Upanishad Inheritance. His Sky Realm was an important turning point.</p>
<p>He must leave this place. He must help his son break through. Thus, he felt panicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li Mu!&rdquo; Furlow pondered for a while before calling a First Sky of King God Realm warrior standing near him with a savage look on his face. &ldquo;You get in there and check it out. If you help me take the Purgatory Token, I promise you, that I will take care of your daughter well after I get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warrior whose name was called hesitated with a cold look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t go, then don&rsquo;t blame me!&rdquo; Furlow rolled his eyes and showed his ferocious face. &ldquo;You should take the chance that I&rsquo;m giving you while you still can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Mu reared back from Furlow&rsquo;s furious gaze. He felt like a snake was slithering around his neck. He was scared.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a while. Keeping his daughter in mind, he gritted his teeth. &ldquo;Boss, promise me. If I die and you get out, please take care of my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&rdquo; Furlow nodded, &ldquo;if I get out alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Mu didn&rsquo;t say more. He bit his lips and stormed out of the crowd, dashing straight to Shi Yan&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>The crowd of prisoners and villains were restless. They gathered uncontrollably, getting inevitably closer to Shi Yan&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p>At the same time, Leona and the others brightened their eyes, focusing their view on the lake to see if Shi Yan would resist this attack.</p>
<p>When he was breaking through his new realm, anyone could simply land attacks on him if he hadn&rsquo;t prepared.</p>
<p>Li Mu dashed like lightning. While he was in the air, he had urged his God Domain. His God Body strengthened like a tree trunk. Bark grew on his skin and his body looked like a giant root of a ten-thousand-year old tree. When he released his God Domain, the plants around him also shook. Big branches were twisted and broken. His God Domain drew the broken branches, turning them into sharp wooden swords, darting toward the cave.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>The wooden swords brought their sharp power and exploded one by one at the entrance.</p>
<p>Li Mu took this to chance to disappear into the cave.</p>
<p>The people observing waited for something to happen.</p>
<p>There was no commotion, no aura, or even a single sound. Li Mu was like a droplet that caused no ripple when fallen into the sea.</p>
<p>The crowd of prisoners and villains were tense. They looked at the cave confusedly. An unknown chill rose in their hearts.</p>
<p>Leona&rsquo;s eyes brightened again. In a relaxed manner, she picked up another piece of fruit, taking a bite while still looking at the lake.</p>
<p>If there was nothing reported by Li Mu, it meant Shi Yan had prepared something in the cave which proved that Shi Yan knew what he was doing. Knowing this, Leona relaxed a little. She knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to kill Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sa Lou! You try!&rdquo; Larkey grinned fiendishly. &ldquo;If you die, I will take care of your family. Now move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was another warrior at the First Sky of King God Realm. Under such a threat, he had to jump into the cave.</p>
<p>The same thing happened. There was no sound or commotion of a furious battle. Those who entered the cave seemed to disappear into thin air.</p>
<p>Everybody could feel the shivers down their spines.</p>

<p>Under Larkey and Furlow&rsquo;s command, the two First Sky of King God Realm warriors disappeared like a stone that left no ripple after sinking into the ocean.</p>
<p>Then, the prisoners, villains, and lunatics showed up. They calmed down and grimaced.</p>
<p>From the results of the two First Sky of King God Realm warriors, Larkey and Furlow&rsquo;s threat wouldn&rsquo;t be effective. No one was stupid enough to get out there and die in vain.</p>
<p>Some didn&rsquo;t leave immediately. They stared at the cave entrance for a while before retreating quietly. Their silhouettes flashed, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>Those who stayed didn&rsquo;t move and only half of them remained. They were the ones who had a reason to leave this Extreme Purgatory Field as quickly as possible. They had reasons to survive.</p>
<p>In the world out there, they had someone they cared about or grudges they needed to resolve. The danger that the cave showed didn&rsquo;t scare them or make them leave.</p>
<p>Larkey and Furlow were of the latter type. They stayed. The two Second Sky of King God Realm exchanged uncertain looks.</p>
<p>After a while, Larkey suddenly said, &ldquo;That kid must have arranged something in that cave. If we send a single warrior in there, he will likely be in danger. But if everyone goes in at the same time, I think the traps he has set won&rsquo;t work against them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing for a while, he looked at Furlow. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harrumph, you know I must leave soon. How can I give up just like that?&rdquo; Furlow gritted his teeth. &ldquo;No matter how strong he is, he must be weak while in his breakthrough to the new realm. As long as we break his barriers and see him, we can kill him easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many agreed with him.</p>
<p>They soon finished discussing and joined hands to attack.</p>
<p>They gawked for a while. Then, the onlookers started dashing forward. They turned into many silhouettes and urged their God Domain, advancing towards the cave.</p>
<p>Both Leona&rsquo;s group in the Purgatory Star and the two in the Grand Palace in the Dark Firmament Star felt excited again. Their eyes were glued to the lake.</p>
<p>As they knew it would be perilous inside, they had boosted their power as much as they could, releasing the God Domain.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>All of a sudden, space slits appeared at the cave entrance like floating sharp swords that sparkled dazzlingly.</p>
<p>Three warriors who jumped into the cave first didn&rsquo;t have time to scream as space slits had ripped their bodies and sucked their dismembered bodies in. They disappeared silently.</p>
<p>Many villains screamed in fright and attempted to retreat. They didn&rsquo;t dare move further inside</p>
<p>However, as soon as the space slits appeared, they scattered. In the area where energy was gathering outside the cave, similar space slits emerged in every corner.</p>
<p>Those space slits were long and narrow, but they were enough to dismember the warriors, leaving no trace of their prior existence.</p>
<p>Although some were quick enough to dodge, they were attacked by the space splits. When the slits passed through them, their limbs disappeared bizarrely. Some were so unlucky that their heads disappeared into the void.</p>
<p>Instantly, another six First Sky of King God Realm died tragically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F*ck! It&rsquo;s Space Power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, it&rsquo;s f*cking bad! A warrior cultivating space power is breaking through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn! Too bad, I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screams and curses resonated from the crowd. They were all ashen. They felt as if their hearts were torn apart, unable to think logically from extreme fright.</p>
<p>Both Larkey and Furlow were scared out of their wits. Those space slits had frightened them. They froze, not moving a single muscle.</p>
<p>Leona relaxed and ate the crystal green fruits. She cast a glance at Ao Gu Duo, who looked pale now. She mocked, &ldquo;Did you think that everybody was an idiot? He dares to break through in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Of course he knows how to protect himself. Check it out and see the results of those idiots like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breaking powers Upanishad and stirring up space. This kid&hellip; is space power his main power Upanishad that is going through a break through?&rdquo; Carthew was baffled. He suddenly found his words. &ldquo;I told you. He doesn&rsquo;t look like a careless man. Would he break through without arranging his defense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cultivation of space power, when a warrior breaks through the important realm and creates the God Domain, space slits will appear thickly around him. It seems that we didn&rsquo;t consider this. No wonder why he isn&rsquo;t scared.&rdquo; Rochester also understood. He grinned. &ldquo;Seems like this brutal kid has planned this ahead of time. Those who wanted to take his life deserved to fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were joking and discussing, space slits appeared more densely at the cave entrance in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The oncoming warriors gawked. They halted in the area filled with space slits. No one dared to move an inch. They all became seriously cautious.</p>
<p>At this moment, a magical intent domain expanded from the cave. It seemed to fuse with earth and heaven energy covering their heads.</p>
<p>A solitary aura flooded out. Under the wicked effects of the Dead Upanishad, those who stayed suddenly felt their soul fatigue and their energy was grabbed by an invisible hand that pulled it into the cave.</p>
<p>Fragmentary starlight flashed from time to time where earth and heaven energy had gathered. The starlight rolled like the Milky Way and became clearer.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field seemed to not be able to conceal the starlight in this place. The starlight and the starry sea in outer space seemed to have a connection, creating a magnificent galaxy.</p>
<p>Thick space slits that were created by condensed space, were the God Domain of warriors cultivating Space power Upanishad. The Soul Burial Ground was the domain of warrior cultivating Dead Upanishad while the beautiful galaxy was the unique form of the Star power&rsquo;s God Domain.</p>
<p>Three different powers Upanishad performed the distinctive God Domains. The inmates who had jumped into this area wept without tears.</p>
<p>They would never have imagined that Shi Yan, who was hiding inside this cave, could have three cunning and mighty powers Upanishad at the same time. And what was hard to accept the most was that all his three powers Upanishad could create the God Domains!</p>
<p>This was unimaginable! It goes against the cultivating natural principles of warriors in the Raging Flame Star Area.</p>
<p>When a warrior broke through the King God Realm, only his main power could create the God Domain. No matter how profound his auxiliary powers were, they would hardly be able to create the God Domain.</p>
<p>This was why each warrior had only one God Domain. Also, most of the warriors chose only one power Upanishad to cultivate for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The creation of the God Domain hid the magical mysteries and principles of Nature. Even the great sages couldn&rsquo;t tell how the God Domain was created or understand its mysteries.</p>
<p>Signs of three different God Domains created from Shi Yan&rsquo;s breakthrough not only shocked the intruders but also people in the Dark Firmament Star and the Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All three powers Upanishad creating the God Domains. This is a miracle!&rdquo; Carthew muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he balance or fuse them?&rdquo; Rochester&rsquo;s eyes expressed fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F*ck that brat!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>An evil smile hung on the corner of Leona&rsquo;s mouth, but she didn&rsquo;t say a thing.</p>
<p>The master of the divine nation, Du Tian Ji, jolted up from his throne, his eyes blazing like torches. He gazed at the mirror in front of him, staying silent for a long while. His face distorted bizarrely.</p>
<p>Princess Zi Yao covered her mouth behind him as she couldn&rsquo;t believe what her eyes showed her. Strange, dazzling light shot out from her beautiful eyes. Her soft body shivered slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are miracles in this world. I believe what I see.&rdquo; Du Tian Le stood up from his mountain, walking to the corner and gazing at the lake. &ldquo;If he succeeds, he will bring another color to the Raging Flame Star Area. If he works for the divine nation, our territory would double shortly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one doubted this.</p>
<p>Leona, Carthew, Rochester, Da Lei, and even Ao Gu Duo quieted down. They didn&rsquo;t oppose his idea.</p>
<p>Creating three God Domains while breaking through to the King God Realm meant that Shi Yan&rsquo;s attainment in three powers Upanishad was all profound. At the same time, he could balance his three powers miraculously.</p>
<p>They had never heard or seen anyone in the Raging Flame Star Area who had three God Domains.</p>
<p>Today, many witnessed Shi Yan achieve such a miracle. He had filled this vacancy.</p>
<p>His appearance told people that the martial path wasn&rsquo;t as narrow as they had always thought. They realized that a real, excellent warrior would not always cultivate just one power Upanishad and create only one God Domain.</p>
<p>This miracle broke this presumption, leaving a deep impression in people&rsquo;s hearts and revealing a brand new picture.</p>
<p>People started contemplating.</p>
<p>Even the master of the divine nation, the strongest warrior, Du Tian Ji, was baffled. He started to doubt the principles he had trusted. He couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed at the magical features of the martial path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we all wrong about it?&rdquo; Du Tian Ji muttered. &ldquo;The general knowledge of warriors in the entire Raging Flame Star Area isn&rsquo;t complete, is it? Are we all wrong about the mysteries of the martial path? Is our current explanation of powers incomplete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, perhaps people in the higher-level continents aren&rsquo;t like us. They can cultivate more powers at the same time. Shi Yan has the inheritance from that man and that man wasn&rsquo;t from our Raging Flame Star Area. Maybe he came from another higher-level star area where people know the truth of powers Upanishad. Our understanding is shallow. At the very least, Shi Yan has proven that warriors could be able to create the God Domain of all powers Upanishad they cultivate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao looked at him, talking in a soft voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has opened a door for us. It makes me more determined. I must escape. I must break all the chains to see if the sky outside is this brilliant!&rdquo; Du Tian Ji gave a low shout. His eyes expressed his resolution, proving that he has finally made up his mind.</p>
<p>Chapter 782: King God Realm!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>The sea star, thick space cracks, and the Soul Burial Ground were released. These three primitive forms of the God Domain were revealed at the entrance of the cave. Some strange phenomena had happened.</p>
<p>Prisoners of the Extreme Purgatory Field who intruded this place froze in the air. No one dared to move.</p>
<p>Hazardous space slits were operating around them. If they moved, space cracks would cut their bodies.</p>
<p>But, no movement did not necessarily mean no harm.</p>
<p>After the Soul Burial Ground appeared, the unique features of this God Domain were revealed. The prisoners soon felt their souls fatigue. They could even see the light specks that looked like fireflies flying out of their bodies. Just like the gathering energy, they congregated in that cave.</p>
<p>Everybody was frightened and restless. Witnessing the three God Domains with different attributes had shaken them.</p>
<p>Leona, Ao Gu Duo, and Du Tian Ji, the owner of the divine nation in the far-away Dark Firmament Star, were frightened. They realized that the principles they had believed for so many years could potentially be wrong.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s powers had opened a brand new door for those warriors. It told them that the martial path is constantly changing and that there was more than one way out. Cultivating many powers Upanishad at the same time could lead them to a wider and brighter road.</p>
<p>No one knew what was happening to Shi Yan in the cave.</p>
<p>However, they all knew that Shi Yan was in the most critical phase of his breakthrough. Once he got through this challenge, he could step up to the sky and dazzlingly suppress any youth who was believed to be a genius.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Inside the cave.</p>
<p>More and more space slits appeared in front of the cave. Three meters from the entrance of the cave, there were cut limps of the two warriors who had jumped in first.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that there were more space slits in the cave. The moment they stormed in, their bodies were divided into five or seven pieces and the larger portions of their bodies were dragged into the space slits. They would never see the bodies again.</p>
<p>Shi Yan sat indifferently inside the cave surrounded by many space slits.</p>
<p>From the outside, the pure earth and heaven energy that flowed looked like five-colored lightning strikes that entangled him and slithered into his body like snakes.</p>
<p>His body sent blazing sparks into the air. It looked like he was placed on the stone table, and the earth and heaven energy was the blacksmith that was forging him with the flaming iron hammer.</p>
<p>To the majority of True God Realm warriors, the pain of refining the God Body would make them wish for death.</p>
<p>However, Shi Yan&rsquo;s reaction was different. He was strangely calm. He had challenged things at the acme for his whole life. He could endure the pains normal people could even think about enduring. His tough mentality wasn&rsquo;t something people could comprehend.</p>
<p>The main reason for this was his strong foundation. His body had been quenched many times. He had felt all kinds of pains and tortures.</p>
<p>If he had to compare, his creation of the God Body today wasn&rsquo;t very hard to endure. Thus, he looked different compared to most of the warriors. He was calm and even a little numb.</p>
<p>Earth and heaven energy brought the true power of the world. Just like a magical knife, it carved deep marks on his body to enhance it by a level.</p>
<p>He had swallowed the pellets he took from Zi Yao, which helped with the creation of God Body. Those pellets helped thicken earth and heaven energy, creating a fierce flood and accelerating his rate of absorption.</p>
<p>Earth and heaven energy proactively seeped through his flesh, blood, bones, internal organs, and each vessel of his body. This energy seemed to have a magical effect that flooded his entire body and enhanced his bone&rsquo;s toughness, tenaciousness of the vessels, muscles, and tendons.</p>
<p>He was like a divine weapon that was processed by different energies. He slowly became unbreakable. He was now as imposing as a mountain with tremendous, pure energy.</p>
<p>His changes weren&rsquo;t only in his blood and flesh: his soul altar seemed to also undergo changes.</p>
<p>The power Upanishad tier in his three-tiered soul altar was covered with a layer of mysterious light. However, Star, Space, Death, and Life powers Upanishad were still visible. They were all wonderfully connected with the energy in his God Soul, giving him a deeper knowledge of the nature of these three powers Upanishad.</p>
<p>He just sat neatly like that and patiently let his body be developed. His soul guided the three powers Upanishad.</p>
<p>The God Soul and the three powers Upanishad had fused perfectly. The three powers Upanishad rose magically in a deep place inside his God Soul. Each power became a chaotic, shining cluster, releasing an immense halo.</p>
<p>The lusters of the Seals of Upanishad were the signs of the God Domain. When he understood his Seal of Upanishad more clearly, those lusters would expand gradually to magically change his soul.</p>
<p>Thus, the space slits appeared more and more outside his cave and their coverage also expanded.</p>
<p>The halo of the Dead Upanishad had two layers: one was vigorous while the other was cold and desolate. The vigorous layer covered his Sea of Upanishad and protected his God Soul and God Body. The dead layer dispersed and affected those around him, absorbing their souls.</p>
<p>This also made the prisoners and villains not dare to move outside the cave. They slowly lost their life force.</p>
<p>Those people were covered in the dead layer, which had pulled the light spots of their life force and drew them back to the vigorous layer to boost Shi Yan&rsquo;s living energy and increase his strength. This also frighteningly increased the power of the absorption force of the dead layer.</p>
<p>The dead layer took away the life force and sent it to the vigorous layer. Then, it benefited Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul and God Body, which would also boost the energy of the dead layer, making the Soul Burial Ground more imposing.</p>
<p>These two layers supported each other and increased their powers. And the one to receive these benefits was Shi Yan himself.</p>
<p>At the same time, the star sea was the performance of the Star Seal of Upanishad. The starry sea was the external sign of the Star Upanishad. The blinking stars in the sea of stars were thick and glorious.</p>
<p>However, it was different from the Dead Upanishad. The Starry Sea wouldn&rsquo;t initially attack living beings proactively. Shi Yan needed to use his soul to control it. As he was still in the critical time of his breakthrough, naturally, he couldn&rsquo;t do this, which meant the mysteries of the Starry Sea God Domain couldn&rsquo;t be performed.</p>
<p>Even so, space slits of Space power and the life absorption of the Dead power were enough to keep him safe. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anyone who came to attack him.</p>
<p>When the God Domain was created, it would create a significant commotion according to some principles of Nature, which led to the expansion of the Domain&rsquo;s coverage and power. This was especially true for his space power Upanishad that created the space slits &ndash; the terrifying defense like a grand mountain.</p>
<p>The Dead Upanishad was a cunning and evil power that could attack the others proactively. As long as there were living beings near him, the Dead Upanishad could show its nature and draw all of the creatures&rsquo; life force.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, Shi Yan stayed safe and comprehended his three Seals of Upanishad and the magical powers of the God Domains. He didn&rsquo;t notice the situations out there.</p>
<p>Time flew hurriedly.</p>
<p>Soon, the prisoners and villains in front of the cave didn&rsquo;t dare to move. Since their life force was being drawn away, they became dizzy and foolish unknowingly.</p>
<p>With only one wrong step, they fell immediately into the space slits and died on the spot.</p>
<p>After they died, their Essence Qi wouldn&rsquo;t scatter away. Just like the gathering energy, they flew into the cave, pouring into Shi Yan&rsquo;s acupuncture points, becoming part of his powers.</p>
<p>Those warriors continued to fall one after another into the space slits. Before each tragic death, the victim&rsquo;s life force was already too feeble.</p>
<p>In the end, both Furlow and Larkey didn&rsquo;t have the luck to dodge the danger. They fell dizzily into some space slits eventually.</p>
<p>The two Second Sky of King God Realm were devoured. Their Essence Qi poured into the cave.</p>
<p>Deep inside the cave, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know what was happening out there. He still cultivated indifferently, refining his God Body and creating the God Domains. Without Shi Yan&rsquo;s consciousness, the Essence Qi ancient tree in his body had expanded three times larger.</p>
<p>The experts watching the scene fell silent, their eyes glued to the dark cave, waiting for something.</p>
<p>Time flew quietly.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Seven days later.</p>
<p>Today, the God Domains created by three different powers Upanishad suddenly disappeared. Earth and heaven energy that gathered here for a while had also gone, leaving no beam or trace.</p>
<p>Outside the cave, cut limbs lay on the ground. No one died intact.</p>
<p>Everyone concentrated, holding their breath as if they were waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p>Even Leona was anxious as she didn&rsquo;t know the final results.</p>
<p>After a while, a sturdy figure appeared at the cave entrance. He frowned, looking at those cut limbs on the ground. He smiled evilly then walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it! He really did it!&rdquo; Du Tian Le couldn&rsquo;t hold his surprise and screamed, &ldquo;It seems like cultivating many powers at the same time is possible! Our belief has to change because of this kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man can have three God Domains at the same time, each of them in perfect harmony with the others. This man is a miracle,&rdquo; Carthew said emotionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think his real fighting in the Extreme Purgatory Field starts from now. Haha, at the True God Realm, he could kill the First Sky of King God Realm warriors. Today, he has finally reached the King God Realm. I think that the opponents he fights will change from now.&rdquo; Rochester looked at Ao Gu Duo and laughed slightly. The hidden meaning in his words was explicit.</p>
<p>Ao Gera has only the Second Sky of King God Realm, would he become Shi Yan&rsquo;s prey?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo, be prepared to give me a life star.&rdquo; Leona smiled darkly. Joy filled her eyes as she knew she was not wrong.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zao-er, your fortune isn&rsquo;t bad. You&rsquo;ve met such a magical kid.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji glared at Zi Yao before smiling strangely. &ldquo;Ao Gera is dead. I&rsquo;m afraid that kid isn&rsquo;t weaker than him. If they encounter each other, I&rsquo;m not sure who would win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had always evaluated Ao Gera with high value. However, at this moment, he wasn&rsquo;t sure of anything.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan had overturned his negative situation, breaking through to the King God Realm, striding to a brand new level.</p>
<p>Chapter 783: Wear The Domains!</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Shi Yan had never felt so fresh and powerful before.</p>
<p>The King God Realm in the Grace Mainland was the highest existence. He had been on that continent for so long but he had never seen anyone at the King God Realm.</p>
<p>Bao Ao, Jie Ji, Kante, and even Xuan Ming had tried for their whole life to reach the King God Realm. However, due to the energy-draining situation in the Grace Mainland, they were limited. Being unable to break through to this realm was the greatest regret of their lives.</p>
<p>The time he had stayed in the Raging Flame Star Area wasn&rsquo;t too long. It was just eight or nine years. However, in this short period, he had ascended from the True God Realm directly to the King God Realm and created the God Domains.</p>
<p>And he got three marvelous God Domains!</p>
<p>Strolling through the Extreme Purgatory Field, Shi Yan let all of his heaven flames fly back to the soul altar. He didn&rsquo;t need to be cautious anymore.</p>
<p>He was so confident. He believed that in the Extreme Purgatory Field now, only the Third Sky of King God Realm warriors could trouble him. And even they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to kill him.</p>
<p>Walking step by step, he immersed in the joy of the magical God Domains. Never had he felt so happy before.</p>
<p>From just a single thought, the God Domain of the Dead Upanishad was activated. A twenty-meter radius around Shi Yan was the maximum coverage of his Dead Domain. Big trees yellowed, flowers shriveled, and insects stopped crying.</p>
<p>With another thought, the Starry Sea appeared. Magical Starlight dots were created by his energy. They scattered beautifully and gloriously everywhere.</p>
<p>His soul altar spun slightly and his space power had activated its God Domain. A powerful energy that could control space was urged.</p>
<p>Within twenty meters around him, the wind stopped, foliage froze, and even earth and heaven energy were restrained; it couldn&rsquo;t move anymore.</p>
<p>The three powers Upanishad included Death and Life, Star, and Space would create the God Domain as his God Soul flickered.</p>
<p>The three God Domains had their own magical features. While moving, he tried them from time to time restlessly.</p>
<p>Staying inside the God Domain of the Dead and Life power Upanishad, Shi Yan could absorb the energy of living beings around him to strengthen himself. While the creatures themselves didn&rsquo;t notice, they had their soul energy taken out.</p>
<p>The God Domain created by Star power Upanishad was a space full of stars. Under this starry dome, his Star Martial Spirit became sensitive. As his soul flickered, he could immediately hide in any star.</p>
<p>Within twenty meters, he could change his location, disappear and reappear in any starlight dots, giving them his magnificent powers to attack his enemies.</p>
<p>The God Domain created by space power wasn&rsquo;t as dangerous as the space slits when he broke through the new realm. Shi Yan understood that only a deeper understanding of space power Upanishad and the God Domain could help him create the space slits that shielded him. When he gets to this point, he knew that no one would dare approach or ambush him.</p>
<p>Space God Domain had more magical features. Space of area that this God Domain covering was restrained tightly.</p>
<p>He only needed to urge his power and flicker a thought for all things inside his God Domain, including air, energy, rock, and foliage to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Imprisonment was the basic specialty of Space Upanishad, one of the derived foundations of Space power.</p>
<p>He believed that in a battle with an opponent, urging his space power and creating the God Domain would detain the other&rsquo;s body and soul in his space.</p>
<p>Unless the other was prepared or had a force that was mighty enough to untie his bind, that warrior would simply be killed.</p>
<p>Breaking through the King God Realm had given him chances to create three God Domains and enlarge his Essence Qi ancient tree several times.</p>
<p>Anyway, the benefits he had harvested weren&rsquo;t that simple.</p>
<p>The God Body is another advantage he got now. At this moment, the recovery ability of his Immortal Martial Spirit had been upgraded. At the same time, his Petrification Martial Spirit was also enhanced. His sturdy physique had reached a new level, which could be considered morbidly abnormal, under this great time of quenching by earth and heaven energy.</p>
<p>He had tried and found that even the three Bone Thorns he had forged couldn&rsquo;t break the defense of his God Body. He would need to use the maximum power to even pierce through his body.</p>
<p>Ordinary King God Realm warriors who dared to engage in close combat with him would be torn apart, leaving nothing, not even the bone dust.</p>
<p>Due to his strong foundation and excellent body conditions, the God Body he had condensed wasn&rsquo;t something ordinary King God Realm warriors could compare to.</p>
<p>He had a premonition that even the Third Sky of King God Realm warriors couldn&rsquo;t have a tough God Body like his.</p>
<p>As his power had been improved many times, his confidence was boosted. He believed that if he had had his today&rsquo;s realm in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field that year, even if he didn&rsquo;t manipulate the flaming meteorites, he could have fought Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo without much struggle.</p>
<p>After his realm was upgraded, his vision widened, and he had a huge confidence boost. He decided not to hunt First Sky of King God Realm warriors.</p>
<p>His main targets were the prisoners and the villains at the Second Sky of King God Realm now!</p>
<p>Once the Purgatory Token had reported the living energy of Second Sky of King God Realm warriors, he would attack them proactively. This would help him accumulate Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Hovering above a lake in the Extreme Purgatory Field, Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was cold and harsh. A bloodthirsty gleam flashed in his eyes. While his thought flickered, so many stars twirled around his body, arraying a magical formation. Abruptly, he attacked someone in front of him.</p>
<p>It was a Sea Clan brutal butcher at the Second Sky of King God Realm. They had fought for a half a day already. The other had thought that he had finally found a soft persimmon that he could squeeze to get a Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Shortly, he knew he was wrong. Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t a soft persimmon but a ferocious beast that didn&rsquo;t bare its fangs!</p>
<p>The God Domain of his Star power was created. Shi Yan&rsquo;s figure flashed in the starlight. Sometimes he disappeared, leaving no aura.</p>
<p>The brutal Sea Clan man had Water power. He was unceasingly expanding his God Domain. Ten thousand tons of water in the lake rolled into the sky, morphing into rough dragons. They attacked Shi Yan furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mwahaha!&rdquo; Shi Yan sneered, waiting until the water dragons storming into his Star God Domain. He immediately created Space power Upanishad, creating the God Domain.</p>
<p>Transparent water dragons storming toward him suddenly halted in the air. They froze bizarrely in front of him, unable to even wiggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disperse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan pointed and a strange light shot out, hitting each water dragon.</p>
<p>Furious sounds of water flowing echoed. Those water dragons had turned back into currents of water, falling into the lake underneath.</p>
<p>His figure moved. The lake was still, the wind stopped moving, and energy was restrained where he hovered. Except him, anything in his God Domain couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>The Sea Clan warrior grimaced. The three God Domains had almost collapsed his mentality. Every time he thought that he could do it, Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Domain changed to another kind, which made all his attacks fail.</p>
<p>On the still lake, Shi Yan sauntered. Suddenly, he roared like a savage beast, disappearing into the starlight.</p>
<p>In the next moment, he reappeared next to that Sea Clan expert. He retrieved his God Domain and bumped into the other with his physical strength.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An earth-shaking explosion echoed from the transparent water barrier created by the Sea Clan expert. His crystal clear defense shattered like pieces of jade. Water-light shot out.</p>
<p>Shi Yan laughed louder, marching toward that warrior, engaging in a battle inside his God Domain. He bombarded him with star power. Stars spun, and shot towards him.</p>
<p>The power of his body continued expanding endlessly. Light spots that scattered from the shattered crystal wall fiercely pierced his God Body. However, they couldn&rsquo;t damage him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Space Imprisonment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was battling enthusiastically, Shi Yan suddenly let out a low shout.</p>
<p>The man in his God Domain halted as if he was tied by so many ropes in the air. He didn&rsquo;t even move.</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled while walking toward him. He patted the man&rsquo;s head. His big head exploded. Blood and brain scattered.</p>
<p>Retrieving his God Domain and taking in almost all of the Essence Qi in that dead man&rsquo;s body, Shi Yan grinned before standing up.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Half a year had passed unknowingly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan became a God of Slaughter in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Wherever he passed through, any villains he could sense had become a source of his Immortal Demon Blood.</p>
<p>During this period, he had accumulated experiences in using the God Domains through many battles. His understanding of the three God Domains gradually became profound.</p>
<p>After each battle, he would quiet down and review to find the advantages and disadvantages of the God Domains. In the next battle, he would try to minimize the disadvantages and promote the intimidating features of his God Domains.</p>
<p>After half a year of battling, he became fluent in using God Domains. He didn&rsquo;t feel shaky when combining the power of the three powers. He gradually started to understand the secret of coordinating the three powers to reach its most powerful potential.</p>
<p>Among the prisoners and villains he had killed, not only the First Sky of King God Realm, at least ten Second Sky of King God Realm prisoners were erased.</p>
<p>The number of Immortal Demon Blood he had accumulated was almost one thousand drops.</p>
<p>He used the Immortal Demon Blood to replace his own blood. In his eyes, this event was getting closer. He thought that if he had enough time and the number of brutal persons in the Extreme Purgatory Field was adequate, perhaps he could finish his blood replacement here.</p>
<p>The vast Extreme Purgatory Field was worth the most magical place in the entire Raging Flame Star Area. In this place, his perception of powers Upanishad had become much sensitive. After each battle, he always had a new harvest.</p>
<p>His perception and understanding of the three power Upanishads had increased every day.</p>
<p>Today, while he was searching his preys, he met his acquaintances.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu.</p>
<p>Their situation was apparently not good. They had wounds all over their bodies. They were distressed as if they were trying to run away from someone. They were moving towards him.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised.</p>
<p>Chapter 784: The Cunning Old Fellow</p>
<p>Translator:&nbsp;Sigma_ Editor:&nbsp;SSins</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu were both at the Second Sky of King God Realm. They had followed Carthew for many years so they must have various fighting experiences. Who could make them run with such haste like this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu didn&rsquo;t stop. In fact, upon seeing him, they started to attack.</p>
<p>Yalan cultivated the Earth power Upanishad. As soon as she activated her God Domain, the land in her area suddenly twirled. Boundless earth energy immediately turned into a mist of dust, snatching over Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Tie Mu didn&rsquo;t hesitate. Gusts flew around his body. The wind blades sparkled like shining knives, cutting hundreds of trees around him into pieces.</p>
<p>Since they had been together for a while in the gravitational room, Shi Yan understood their powers Upanishad well. They were using Wind and Earth powers Upanishad. Once they urged the God Domains, they could cooperate well which made people not be able to fly to the sky or to get underground seeking escape.</p>
<p>This is also why Carthew let them two enter the Extreme Purgatory Field together.</p>
<p>The two powers Upanishad exploded together. The gray dust rolled on the ground working with the tornados in the air, covering Shi Yan&rsquo;s instantly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s consciousness was affected badly. Staying in that grey area, he couldn&rsquo;t locate their positions. Energy tornados were marching furiously, uprooting the giant trees. Such energy movement was strong enough to cut his body into small pieces.</p>
<p>It was different from the prisoners Shi Yan had encountered. Yalan and Tie Mu&rsquo;s forces were tremendous individuals as their understanding of earth and heaven powers were more profound.</p>
<p>Their God Domains had coordinated their attack together. After Shi Yan got covered, he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it. The tornado rolled his body into the air, spinning it. Shi Yan felt dizzy immediately.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu were the experienced warriors with long battling times in outer space. They had so many divine pellets. They trained their bodies marvelously while also using their wonderful powers Upanishad.</p>
<p>As Shi Yan stayed in their God Domains, he had to be very careful. He immediately released his Space God Domain.</p>
<p>Shortly, the energies of earth and tornado were frozen for three seconds.</p>
<p>But he could hold them only for three seconds.</p>
<p>After three seconds, their two powers got rid of his constraint and moved towards him again.</p>
<p>However, three seconds to the King God Realm warriors like Shi Yan were more than enough. Especially in fighting, it was enough for him to do many things.</p>
<p>He escaped Yalan and Tie Mu&rsquo;s God Domain, approaching them shortly. He shouted angrily. &ldquo;What the heck are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While shouting at him, he accumulated the energy of his God Body. Special powers of his twirled around him. Starlight spots as brilliant as diamond scattered around him thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Star Upanishad!&rdquo; Tie Mu screamed in astonishment. He suddenly woke up, shouting, &ldquo;Yalan, he&rsquo;s real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan was startled. She scrutinized Shi Yan and then said, &ldquo;In the gravitational field, you and I talked. How many siblings do I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An older brother and a younger sister,&rdquo; Shi Yan frowned skeptically. &ldquo;What did you ask that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan calmed down, exhaling in relief. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu looked like he had finally put the burden aside. He panted. &ldquo;I thought it came again. F*ck it. That freak has almost made me collapse mentally. So many illusions. I can&rsquo;t help it anymore. I can&rsquo;t differentiate reality from an illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. &ldquo;What did you encounter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two retrieved their powers. The God Domains disappeared. The area became calm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken through?&rdquo; Tie Mu&rsquo;s eyes were sharp, screaming with astonishment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken through in this Extreme Purgatory Field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan was frightened. She continued shouting &lsquo;monster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frowning, Shi Yan expressed his impatience. &ldquo;True. I&rsquo;ve broken through, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter right now. Tell me what happened. What did you do? Why did you need to hide? Who in this Extreme Purgatory Field could put you into such a disordered state? Ao Gera&rsquo;s team or Madame Leona&rsquo;s team?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of them,&rdquo; Yalan and Tie Mu forced a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those prisoners? They besieged you?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised, asking disbelievingly. &ldquo;Although they aren&rsquo;t weak, you guys are experienced warriors who have been through perilous training. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old fellow at the Third Sky of King God Realm. He cultivates a peculiar power Upanishad that could create illusions. People, scenes, rocks, rivers, mountains; he can create everything you can name, just like a real world.&rdquo; Tie Mu was still scared. &ldquo;In his illusions, we were attacked by so many friends and even Sir Carthew. We almost got killed. Then, when we diverged, we would meet the illusion of each other. We would be ambushed wickedly. We are exhausted. He has been chasing us this entire time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan felt helpless. &ldquo;Although the warriors in the Extreme Purgatory Field are all at the King God Realm, we aren&rsquo;t afraid of them when we join hands. However, that man has a special power. Until now, we haven&rsquo;t seen his real face. We only heard his sinister laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t help but be stern. &ldquo;Third Sky of King God Realm? He knows how to create illusionary worlds and creatures. You guys couldn&rsquo;t use the Soul Consciousness to detect it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our realm is lower than his. We can&rsquo;t break the illusion. The illusionary characters he created also have living energy fluctuations. We can&rsquo;t say if it&rsquo;s real or not.&rdquo; Tie Mu shook his head, unable to avoid a headache. &ldquo;Anyway, his power Upanishad&rsquo;s lethality isn&rsquo;t good. Otherwise, we wouldn&rsquo;t have survived until now. However, after getting deceived so many times, we&rsquo;re exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like your trouble isn&rsquo;t small,&rdquo; Shi Yan contemplated and then smiled. &ldquo;If we meet him, just join hands. Is that old man still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, his Soul Consciousness checked the Purgatory Token on his waist. Shi Yan sensed carefully for a while but he didn&rsquo;t find any beam of living energy. He relaxed his vigilance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is around here. This cunning old fellow is like a resentful ghost that will never disperse. He hasn&rsquo;t left yet. Oh f*ck. He has targeted us for our Purgatory Token. It would help him survive!&rdquo; Tie Mu cursed, facing the sky and yelling indignantly. &ldquo;Hey f*cking bastard, if you have the guts, come here and fight. What is interesting about your stealthy operations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehehe. I like to hide the head and show the tail. I don&rsquo;t dare meet people. You guys should show mercy to me.&rdquo; A voice floated in the vast forest like a wind they couldn&rsquo;t catch or locate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting. Another prey at the First Sky of King God Realm. Hehehe, I&rsquo;m even more certain now that I could get out of this damn place.&rdquo; The sound of the voice wound around many times, sounding close occasionally and far away at other times.</p>
<p>Shi Yan changed his visage.</p>
<p>He sensed the Purgatory Token the second time. His face darkened as he muttered. &ldquo;He can avoid the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s sensing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu and Yalan nodded miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he do that?&rdquo; Shi Yan was baffled. &ldquo;My Purgatory Token has never failed in the Extreme Purgatory Field. It&rsquo;s obvious that the old man&rsquo;s around but we can&rsquo;t detect his living trace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. This is his dangerous feature. With the Purgatory Token, we would be the hunters. But now, he knows where we are but we can&rsquo;t detect him. We are under the light while he stays in the dark. We&rsquo;ve become his prey.&rdquo; Yalan frowned and pulled her hair. &ldquo;This cunning old man is familiar with the Extreme Purgatory Field. Seems like he hasn&rsquo;t been here only once. He can use his understanding of the topography and the special situation of each location to create illusions. If he didn&rsquo;t understand the terrain here like it was the back of his hand, he couldn&rsquo;t be so subtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girl, you&rsquo;re right. Until today, I&rsquo;ve been participating in the Extreme Purgatory Field five times. I&rsquo;ve been the prey every time. However, I&rsquo;ve been living for well over two hundred and fifty years. Hehehe, the Extreme Purgatory Field is a good place. If I haven&rsquo;t reached the bottleneck of my realm and I can&rsquo;t make a good use of the conditions here, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to leave urgently. Perhaps I could give you a chance to live.&rdquo; The inwardly evil-hearted ridicule arose timely as if he was about to ambush. No matter how much they lowered their voices, he could still hear them clearly.</p>
<p>What he had said paled Shi Yan, Yalan, and Tie Mu.</p>
<p>Participating in the Extreme Purgatory Field five times meant that he has been in the Extreme Purgatory Field for at least two hundred and fifty years. He was a condemned-to-death felon two hundred years ago. As he was able to withstand the Extreme Purgatory Field five times, he was definitely a tough character.</p>
<p>According to him, if he hadn&rsquo;t reached the bottleneck of the Peak of the King God Realm, he would stay for more.</p>
<p>With such a character watching them and their Purgatory Token, Yalan and Tie Mu didn&rsquo;t know what to say. They could only blame their bad luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;m a nice guy. Actually, I don&rsquo;t need your lives. If you guys give me a Purgatory Token, I won&rsquo;t continue watching you guys anymore. How does it sound?&rdquo; The old man giggled in the dark, talking sinisterly. &ldquo;Your little buddy at the First Sky of King God Realm is the weakest. It should be easy to kill him, right? Okay. Kill him and you will have an extra Purgatory Token to give to me. I&rsquo;ll let you guys go. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This old fellow said he was cunning and wicked enough to attempt to tear apart the relationship between Shi Yan and the other two.</p>
<p>Hearing his words, Yalan and Tie Mu became silent. Their eyes sparkled strangely.</p>
<p>Shi Yan shuddered inwardly. He couldn&rsquo;t help but snort. He looked at the two coldly and frowned, waiting for their decision.</p>
<p>There are no friends in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Except for oneself, one shouldn&rsquo;t believe trust anyone else. This is what Yalan and Tie Mu had taught him before.</p>
<p>Today, what they taught finally surfaced&hellip;</p>
<p>Chapter 785: Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain</p>
<p>Translator: Sigma Editor: SSins</p>
<p>Outside the Extreme Purgatory Field, Du Tian Le and the five great feudal vassals were frowning as they had no idea what was happening in the crystal mirror lake.</p>
<p>A corner of the lake was covered by grey mist which concealed everything. Shi Yan, Yalan, and Tie Mu were there.</p>
<p>Carthew&rsquo;s face darkened. The light sparkling in his eyes showed his fright. He turned and shouted at Du Tian Le, &ldquo;What is happening? The last time I saw my two soldiers was three days ago. Where did that gray mist come from? Why does it hinder our view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Le frowned as he couldn&rsquo;t explain, either. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Perhaps someone who knows the mysteries of the Extreme Purgatory Field has blocked the view from the outside, preventing us from seeing what is happening there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Carthew snorted. &ldquo;How are my two troopers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Du Tian Le answered begrudgingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either. I&rsquo;m not the ones who designed this Extreme Purgatory Field. It is a mysterious natural formation that is intertwined with the will of earth and heaven. Before our King was throned, the Extreme Purgatory Field had existed. It is the most magical area of our divine nation. I don&rsquo;t wish to learn all of its mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is trouble now. Shi Yan is also there and we don&rsquo;t know what is going on.&rdquo; Rochester spread his arms and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in this boy the most. But now, I can&rsquo;t see anything. It has become too boring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yalan and Tie Mu would soon face Shi Yan. I don&rsquo;t know what would happen between them.&rdquo; Da Lei chuckled. &ldquo;Although Yalan and Tie Mu weren&rsquo;t ordinary, Shi Yan has reached the King God Realm. During this time, he has killed many warriors within the same realm. I&rsquo;m really curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carthew&rsquo;s face grimaced.</p>
<p>Of course, he knew that Shi Yan was tough. They had been watching Shi Yan the whole time. They paid attention to each of his battles. They noticed that the way he used energy and his Domains were getting more profound day by day.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t surprised anymore seeing Shi Yan fight warriors whose realm was higher than his. None of the normal warriors at the Second Sky of King God Realm could flee from his hunt. After half a year, at least ten warriors had died in his hands.</p>
<p>While they hadn&rsquo;t noticed, the number of prisoners Shi Yan had killed had surpassed the records of Da Lei, Yalan and Tie Mu, and the two warriors under Rochester&rsquo;s command. His record was just a bit fewer than Leona&rsquo;s team and Ao Gera&rsquo;s team.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, it would not be long before Shi Yan&rsquo;s record surpassed Ao Gera&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In the most critical time, Shi Yan, Yalan, and Tie Mu were all covered in the thick gray mist. As they couldn&rsquo;t see what was happening inside, everybody was irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like someone is very familiar with the Extreme Purgatory Field. He can affect the energy moving inside and stay hidden from our view. This one is experienced and cunning. I think he will have a close fight against Shi Yan soon,&rdquo; said Leona, frowning.</p>
<p>Everybody was curious. They concentrated and gazed at the lake down there but they couldn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Besides them, the master of the divine nation in the Dark Firmament Star also frowned, his face cold and harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, what is happening? Why can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Zi Yao was surprised. &ldquo;When the Extreme Purgatory Field opened, wasn&rsquo;t it under your control?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with a strange light. He contemplated for a while before saying slowly, &ldquo;I know how to open it but I did not make it. When I got the divine nation that year, the Extreme Purgatory Field had already existed. It has been there for tens of thousands of years! An Imperial Master of our divine nation had used the wonderful natural formation of the Extreme Purgatory Field to make it. The mysteries in that formation are the most subtle and magnificent ones. I&rsquo;m not good at this evil stuff. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know all of its mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imperial Master?&rdquo; Zi Yao was shaken. &ldquo;The divine nation hasn&rsquo;t had an Imperial Master for quite a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. The Imperial Master position has been vacant for so many years. I wanted to offer him that position, but he rejected it.&rdquo; A bit of loss sparkled in Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Zi Yao knew who he was talking about. The old man secluding in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field was one of the top alchemists in the Raging Flame Star Area. Several hundred years ago, he was famous in this star area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The previous Imperial Masters of our divine nations were all famous. They had deep understanding of the nature of powers Upanishad. Our Source of power Upanishad Inheritance was created by them. Unfortunately, there hasn&rsquo;t been an Imperial Master for several monarchies before my reign. Also, no one is qualified enough to hold this position.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji sighed. &ldquo;Usually, the Imperial Master will be in charge of the Extreme Purgatory Field. But we don&rsquo;t have a suitable candidate so I have to do take charge myself. However, I&rsquo;ve dedicated my life to the acme of power so I didn&rsquo;t study about the heaven way evil techniques. My understanding of the Extreme Purgatory Field isn&rsquo;t deep enough, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the reasons why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. This Limitless Divine Mirror of mine was made by the last Imperial Master of our divine nation. If it couldn&rsquo;t reflect the real situation of the Extreme Purgatory Field there, I have no other alternative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the requirements to become the Imperial Master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top-grade blacksmith and alchemist. He must acquire a firm grasp of natural formations, understand the nature of powers, be able to refine and force Divine Grade pellets and tools. He must also be able to carve formations, barriers, and restrictions. And achieve the best merit for the divine nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Shi Yan&rsquo;s a blacksmith, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blacksmith?&rdquo; Du Tian Ji burst out laughing, shaking his head. &ldquo;This kid cultivates mixed powers indeed. He is greedy enough to have a bit of everything. Perhaps he is just an amateur blacksmith without a significant attainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can forge Divine Grade tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divine Grade?!?&rdquo; Du Tian Ji was surprised. He couldn&rsquo;t help but shout, &ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s face changed. He got startled and expression was odd.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The cunning, old man was still trying to drive a wedge between Shi Yan and the other two. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m only one person here, so I need only one token. Even if I had more, it would be useless. I just want to get out of here alive. I don&rsquo;t want to be imprisoned in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Our deal is quite simple. You kill that boy and give me his Purgatory Token. I will leave you alone. Simple, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He buzzed nonstop like a fly trying to manipulate Tie Mu and Yalan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are the Second Sky of King God Realm warriors and you coordinate well. If I have to kill you, I have to use a lot of my energy. Perhaps I can be hurt. But he is different. He has only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, and he has broken through just recently. If you kill him for me, I don&rsquo;t need to use my powers and you can get rid of me. We all end up happy. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>That old fellow used cruel and sinister words which had poked right at their weakest nerves. His plan seemed to work. Yalan and Tie Mu looked touched, their faces uncertain.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was calm but he was on guard.</p>
<p>Actually, he didn&rsquo;t have a deep relationship with Tie Mu and Yalan. They had only met several times and talked a bit in the gravitational fields.</p>
<p>This kind of relationship had no foundation. If they want to kill him to save their lives, Shi Yan thought it would be possible.</p>
<p>He stood and squinted. All of a sudden, he sat down quietly right in front of Yalan and Tie Mu. He stooped, breathing regularly as if he was musing on something.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu looked at him with confused and uncertain faces.</p>
<p>The seducing voice of the cunning fellow continued to attack at their weakest points.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t say anything. He closed his eyes like he was sleeping. He looked defenseless. His aura was retrieved.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu&rsquo;s minds struggled for a while. They exchanged looks like they had finally made up their minds. They sat down cross-legged like Shi Yan had done and steadied their affected mind. Slowly, they pulled themselves together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you, you mean and shameless bastard. I almost got tricked.&rdquo; Tie Mu was foul-mouthed. &ldquo;Come if you do have power. Come kill the three of us. You motherf*cker, stop using your tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan waited in silence with closed eyes. He grinned and he relaxed his tense nerves.</p>
<p>Brilliant starlight spots appeared gloriously in the area of twenty meters around Shi Yan. The lights were blinding as the stars spun mysteriously around him. Yalan and Tie Mu maintained a safe distance from Shi Yan. They all released the God Domains. They formed a triangle but their God Domain didn&rsquo;t overlap. All were waiting in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want to court death, don&rsquo;t blame me. Sigh, too stupid. It&rsquo;s obviously an easy choice. Why do you make it more complicated like this?&rdquo; The floating voice of the old man swayed. Sometimes it was near them, and the other times it was far away.</p>
<p>At the moment his voice arose, gray mist overflowed quietly. They covered the three of them instantly.</p>
<p>Their God Domains had no strange reactions or detected any unique energy fluctuation. It seemed this gray mist was just a normal cloud without any magical effects.</p>
<p>However, the soul altars of Shi Yan&rsquo;s group were tense right after that gray mist engulfed them.</p>
<p>It was like that mist had carried along some unknown dangers&hellip;</p>
<p>Their soul altars suddenly shook. Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul trembled while his face changed.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Shadows started to appear next to him. Those silhouettes sat on the ground. They were Yalan, Tie Mu, and Shi Yan himself. Even the God Domains looked alike.</p>
<p>The one sitting on his left looked identical to him. That Shi Yan opened his eyes, looking around with astonishment. His bearings were exactly the same as Shi Yan&rsquo;s, giving him an illusion of watching himself in the mirror.</p>
<p>Just like that figure, sitting not far from him were more than ten Yalan and Tie Mu. All of them had clear living energy fluctuations. The Purgatory Token on his waist all of a sudden signaled countless of lives.</p>
<p>When Shi Yan looked at that man, the man was looking back at him, too. While Shi Yan was perplexed, an evil smile beamed on the face that was identical to his.</p>
<p>Shi Yan shouted inwardly. He didn&rsquo;t think much but changed his God Domain to the space restraining domain.</p>
<p>Chapter 786: Break The Illusions!</p>
<p>Space power Blockade!</p>
<p>The whole world was suddenly silent. No wind. No sound. All the energies seemed to have simultaneously force quit. Everything stopped all of a sudden.</p>
<p>The man that looked exactly like Shi Yan had his eccentric smile frozen.</p>
<p>More than ten Yalan and Tie Mu around Shi Yan halted, their face frozen in place.</p>
<p>Shi Yan extended his arm. A divine light dot departed from his fingertip, dashing like the lightning towards that man.</p>
<p>Tut!</p>
<p>His body exploded, turning into gray mist. A wisp of Soul Consciousness twisted, flashed from his body before disappeared.</p>
<p>Boom Boom Boom!</p>
<p>His finger pointed on the youths sitting near him. They perished one by one, releasing a beam of soul remnant.</p>
<p>Farther from him were the illusions of Tie Mu and Yalan. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare act rashly.</p>
<p>Each of the illusionary bodies had the living energy fluctuations and his Purgatory Token had reflected their living signals. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t tell who was real and who were the replicas.</p>
<p>As he couldn&rsquo;t tell which one was real, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t dare act recklessly as he was afraid of hurting Yalan&rsquo;s and Tie Mu&rsquo;s real bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Space power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp voice arose in the forest nearby. The cunning old fellow seemed to be scared. He screamed darkly. &ldquo;It has been so many years since I&rsquo;ve seen someone using Space power Upanishad. You&rsquo;re rare, really rare. I want to see if the space power Upanishad can break my Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his voice stopped, shadows started to ooze out from nowhere, floating like ghosts that couldn&rsquo;t be caught. They all dashed toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Even though the shadows hadn&rsquo;t come close to him yet, the area that Shi Yan&rsquo;s Space Domain covered suddenly had a tremendous change.</p>
<p>Instantly, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t see Tie Mu and Yalan anymore.</p>
<p>He was standing on a small, isolated island. This island had some barren mountains. Rolling waves from the ocean lapped the shore. Shi Yan could even hear the sound of waves and seawater moving.</p>
<p>The shadows had disappeared, becoming part of his surroundings that his Soul Consciousness couldn&rsquo;t sense anymore.</p>
<p>Tie Mu and Yalan weren&rsquo;t in this illusion. They were forced to move somewhere else. Shi Yan&rsquo;s Purgatory Token couldn&rsquo;t detect them.</p>
<p>That old cunning man understood the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s features well. His Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain would counter the ability to sense living beings of the Purgatory Token. He wasn&rsquo;t going to let Shi Yan have any assistance.</p>
<p>Understanding this anomaly, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t hesitate to take back the wisp of Soul Consciousness he had sent into the Purgatory Token. He didn&rsquo;t need its help anymore.</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s domain was peculiar and wicked as it could affect God Souls and Sea of Consciousness. Under such circumstance, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t release the Soul Consciousness anymore. Any creatures that appeared in this place would be treated as his enemies.</p>
<p>The surroundings changed again. Gradually, flowers bloomed on this island. Each of them was so beautiful and fresh. Stars blinked in the night. Luxuriant, green foliage appeared.</p>
<p>The small, cold island suddenly revived vigorously and brought people.</p>
<p>Seeing this vibrant scene, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable. He vaguely felt like an invisible danger was creeping towards him, a danger that could attack him in any minute.</p>
<p>A feeble wisp of energy fluctuation that was hard to detect flashed in the illusion.</p>
<p>Shortly, flowers and floras on the island flew out as if they were just given powers.</p>
<p>Strong energy fluctuations attacked!</p>
<p>Billions of tons of seawater condensed into different kinds of sea monsters, baring fangs and claw, roaring crazily on their way.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s Space Domain couldn&rsquo;t stop them!</p>
<p>Those floras and the sea monsters seemed to have a long time growing in his Space Power and got used to its features. When they attacked him, his Space Domain could not seal them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood that all that he saw were just hollow images so his Space Power couldn&rsquo;t constrain them. However, the energy stored in them was real, which was the condensed energy of a King God Realm warrior.</p>
<p>If Shi Yan were careless, this kind of power could hurt him or even kill him on the spot.</p>
<p>Seeing the danger coming, Shi Yan was as calm as usual. His soul altar spun a little bit and his God Domain changed.</p>
<p>Countless stars appeared like precious gemstones. Shi Yan looked like he was immersing in the sea of gems. Light shone gloriously around him.</p>
<p>Star power Upanishad was activated. Stars around him started to revolve fast. Shi Yan put himself in the star sea flying as he pleased. His body flashed and arrived at different stars in just a blink. No one could detect his whereabouts.</p>
<p>So many perilous attacks swarmed over him but they could neither find nor lock Shi Yan in the sea star. At the same time, the starry sea started to wear out their energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another God Domain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s voice reverberated in the air. Apparently, he was startled. His voice trembled. In the center of his echo, a flood created by fierce energy stormed towards the center of the star sea.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Domain seemed to take a formidable hit. The space of ten meters around him shattered. Broken stars fell. The energy of his Star power Upanishad was in disorder.</p>
<p>All illusions vanished. Their energy fused into one big flow, turning into the furious flood current with a face that looked exactly like his. It snatched down from the sky and was about to swallow Shi Yan.</p>
<p>The island broke. Seawater ran fiercely, flooding the island. This fatal scene looked like the doomsday was coming. Shi Yan felt his soul trembling seeing this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death Seal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His God Domain changed again. Massive seals condensed in the sky. His Dead Upanishad covered the whole area.</p>
<p>The Dead Seal stamped the air. Shortly, Shi Yan was surrounded with numerous Dead Seal, covering the entire area.</p>
<p>His negative energy crazily poured into the domain. His God Body was swollen. Energy flowed massively in his vessels unceasingly. Brutal energy gushed out from him, making each Dead Seal as big as a small mountain. They bombarded everything he saw.</p>
<p>Wicked Dead Upanishad spread out, restraining all of the oncoming attacks. At this moment, his quick Life Upanishad found a strange beam of living being energy undersea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan showed a faint smile, his face still stern. Big Dead Seals gathered and combined, making a giant hand that could even cover the whole sky. That hand then furiously pounded the sea bottom.</p>
<p>Just like a breaking mirror, countless fragments of the illusions scattered under this attack. Shi Yan&rsquo;s surroundings became normal.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu were fighting with their own illusions near him. The illusions entangling them also had vitality and energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>However, as Shi Yan maintained his God Domain in the mode of Dead and Life Intent Domain, all living energy fluctuations of creatures in his domain were amplified and became clearer.</p>
<p>Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t see the difference between Yalan, Tie Mu, and their replicas, but in his God Domain, the living fluctuations of the illusions weren&rsquo;t as clear as theirs.</p>
<p>It was enough for him.</p>
<p>He could find their real bodies now.</p>
<p>A deep hole appeared near him which was created by the bombarding of his Dead Seals. Immense gray mist diffused from that hole.</p>
<p>A skinny, rickety figure appeared in that gray mist.</p>
<p>It was a sloppy, dirty old man with disheveled hairs and scabs. He was wearing a muddy, long grey robe. His face was also covered in dust but his eyes were sparkling and fiery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three powers Upanishad. Three different God Domains. Boy, how did you do that? Using three powers alternatively to break my Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain, I can&rsquo;t deny that I surrendered. I really want to know how you could create three God Domains at the same time?&rdquo; The skinny old man floated in the gray mist like a wandering ghost. He looked at Shi Yan with a dark, gloomy gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve just created them not long ago. During the battle with you, I got to know how to shift between them subtly. Indeed, magical things could happen.&rdquo; Shi Yan was indifferent. &ldquo;If you want to use the Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain to delude me, I don&rsquo;t think it will be easy anymore. I can distinguish any creature in my domain to see if they are real or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evil power Upanishad,&rdquo; the old man mumbled then snorted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that breaking my Thousand Fantasy Fields Domain means you won. Since you have only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, I can defeat you using only my power and my God Body. The reason why I didn&rsquo;t show up is that I wanted to save energy. But if you break my God Domain, I have no choice but to widen your knowledge. Lets see how vast the gap between my Third Sky cultivation base and your First Sky cultivation base is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He attacked immediately.</p>
<p>Shi Yan became serious. He didn&rsquo;t wait until the old man struck his first attack. A thought arose and the crazy hissing echoed.</p>
<p>Three Bone Thorns were invisible, leaving only the ear-piercing whistle in the air. They were moving across spaces, gathering energy.</p>
<p>The old man suddenly became alert. He slightly discolored and squinted as if he was trying to detect the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Shi Yan immediately entered the Rampage Realm. Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes turned blood-red as negative energy gushed out from his body. Pallid tentacles extended from each of his acupuncture points.</p>
<p>This was the first time he urged the Rampage Realm after entering the King God Realm.</p>
<p>His refined body looked like iron or jade shriveled at the moment energy was accumulated. Scarlet halo bloomed from his body and reflected in his eyes, making him look more eccentric and evil.</p>
<p>Bloodthirsty, wild energy erupted like a volcano from his God Body before fusing with his magical Dead Intent Domain. The coverage of the Soul Burial Ground was tripled, reaching an astonishing thirty meters!</p>
<p>Desperation, bloodthirstiness, resentment, and other negative feelings multiplied. The ability to steal life force increased strongly.</p>
<p>In this moment, Shi Yan looked like a demon that crept out from the bottom layer of Hell. His body diffused the aura of termination. His existence seemed to destroy all creatures in the world.</p>
<p>Chapter 787: Counter-attack</p>
<p>After breaking through to the King God Realm, this was the first time Shi Yan had used all of his powers.</p>
<p>In his previous dozens of battles, he had encountered some Second Sky of King God Realm warriors. However, such characters couldn&rsquo;t stimulate all of his powers. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t use much energy to kill them.</p>
<p>Only this old man with his Third Sky of King God Realm and the eccentric power Upanishad had made him use the Rampage Realm, which had taken all of his energy.</p>
<p>Standing on the freezing ground, Shi Yan squinted. His blood-red eyes were sharp and cold like sabers that gazed at that old fellow.</p>
<p>The hissing of the three Bone Thorns was like a crying ghost which irritated people.</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns with space power could be invisible and didn&rsquo;t even have shadows. It was hard to locate or lock them down using Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>Although he was at the Third Sky of King God Realm, in the horrifying buzzing, he had no other way around but spending a part of his energy to stay cautious, preventing the three Bone Thorns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inner Fantasy Thousand Folds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man lowered his voice and shouted. His shriveled body leaped up all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Then, the senile man turned into a ten-meter-tall giant. His skinny body swelled as if it contained endless power.</p>
<p>He faced the sky, and roared while swinging his arm. With the sound of bone exploding, a palm pressed down from the sky, snatching Shi Yan, covering all of the area where he was standing.</p>
<p>Refined energy compacted in his palm like so many electric god dragons, creating the whole new world in that instant.</p>
<p>Shi Yan looked at the sky.</p>
<p>He saw many shadows in that giant palm. They were Shi Jian, Shi Tie, Yang Tian Emperor, Yi Tian Mo, Xia Xin Yan, He Qing Man, and Bing Qing Tong&rsquo;s sisters.</p>
<p>In that palm were all the people Shi Yan cared about. At this moment, they became his archenemies. They were storming towards him with cold and sinister faces.</p>
<p>Each of his loved ones became the killer who wanted to take his life. Energy revolved everywhere, swarming toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>His soul altar was affected. His God Soul was enchanted. Sorrow, disappointment, and deep bitterness arose in his heart.</p>
<p>While he was puzzled, those people became the real Death which wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>Heart Delusion Technique!</p>
<p>This was the bizarre and evil feature of the old man&rsquo;s power Upanishad. It could affect people&rsquo;s hearts, delude their minds, and make them believe that all that they saw were true.</p>
<p>Seeing his family members and friends want to take his life, Shi Yan, this cold and harsh person, felt lost. His heart made him restrain his enormous energy as he was afraid that he could hurt his loved ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten us and you just want to live your good life, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you returned yet? Don&rsquo;t you know that we are struggling in the dead puddle of the Grace Mainland because of energy shortage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you have a good life, do you remember us? You forgot us, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His family members and friends threw question after question at him which messed his mind up more. Shi Yan was baffled and didn&rsquo;t know how to answer them.</p>
<p>His mind was chaotic. His will was reduced. He couldn&rsquo;t release all of his powers.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan fell under such struggling circumstances.</p>
<p>The giant body that the old man had created beamed a sinister smile while his other hand also pressed down. He performed the other magical illusions a second time, which was to deceive people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Those silhouettes stormed over, bombarding their attacks on him. Each figure had turned into a sharp attack with pure energy. All fell on Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Boom Boom Boom!</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s upright body was hit hard, settling down to dozens of meters underground. A massive hole appeared right when where he had just stood.</p>
<p>Illusions disappeared.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was kneeling inside a hundred-meter-large hole. Blood covered his entire body. His bones cracked and so did his eyes.</p>
<p>He woke up immediately.</p>
<p>Intensive pains spread across his body while his energy was chaotic. Forces in his body shot like lightning. All had lost its balance. The struggling Shi Yan thought that if he died, he would feel better. The circulation of his energy and power was stagnant.</p>
<p>The giant body of the old man stood vigorously. He stooped and watched Shi Yan in his hundred-meter-deep hole. He was surprised. &ldquo;Kid, your God Body isn&rsquo;t broken yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, the First Sky of King God Realm warrior&rsquo;s body couldn&rsquo;t bear much of his attacks. It would explode and only the soul altar could escape.</p>
<p>He thought that Shi Yan must be dead under his savage attack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he had underestimated the toughness of Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Body. His attack had just hurt Shi Yan badly, and it couldn&rsquo;t explode his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey old freak, I won&rsquo;t let you live so comfortably.&rdquo; Shi Yan had blood all over his face. Blood also trickled from the corners of his eyes. He looked brutally angry. &ldquo;I hate family members and friends illusions the most. Since you&rsquo;re so shameless and sinister, don&rsquo;t blame me for giving you the same treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, Shi Yan shot out of the hole like a sharp sword.</p>
<p>His God Domain was filled with negative feelings like death, desperation, resentment, bloodthirstiness and more. They condensed into a torrential sea of negative energy. Just like the beast getting out of its rein, it flooded over the old man like a Milky Way, covering his entire area.</p>
<p>Not only did the old man know how to delude people with illusions. In his God Domain, Shi Yan knew how to use the same mysterious trick.</p>
<p>Filled with resentment, Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul manipulated the three Bone Thorns and got them out of the space slits.</p>
<p>As soon as they appeared, the three Bone Thorns aimed at the old man&rsquo;s eyes and nape, stabbing directly like three silver lightning strikes.</p>
<p>The old man discolored. He didn&rsquo;t expect that the Bone Thorns could have space power and be so cunning. He urged his energy, creating moving halo covering his body.</p>
<p>Those moving halos looked like small fish swimming around him. When the three Bone Thorns arrived, the halo entangled them all. Shi Yan&rsquo;s Bone Thorns looked like they were tied by something invisible, sinking into a swamp.</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns Shi Yan had refined himself were made of a bone of a level eleven beast with more than ten auxiliary materials, which greatly enhanced their hardness and sharpness. This weapon of his had reached rank 1 Divine Grade.</p>
<p>Although it was the defense of a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior, hurriedly countering the three Bone Thorns had used all of his power.</p>
<p>While the old man used his energy to create the moving halos that prevented the three Bone Thorns, he didn&rsquo;t have extra energy to create more illusions. Shortly after, all illusions that were affecting Shi Yan, Tie Mu, and Yalan vanished.</p>
<p>Shi Yan used his negative feelings to create the negative sea engulf the old man.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hesitate and clapped his hands in front of his chest. Lights congregated between his palms creating a big light sword. Shi Yan slashed his sword, fiercely stabbing through the negative sea and aiming at the old man&rsquo;s glabella.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yalan and Tie Mu released their God Domains after they had got rid of the illusions. Tornadoes swept around. Earth changed. Beams of furious energy fell on the sky like shooting light from outer space. They all aimed at the old man.</p>
<p>The Three Bone Thorns struggled to move due to the moving halos. As if they had consciousness, they retreated and disappeared into folds of space.</p>
<p>At this moment, the negative sea, which was filled with evil and wicked negative emotions, had engulfed the old man. Although he was good at deluding people, the old man was affected. He seemed to be dragged into Hell. What he saw were all the bloody ghosts and demons that surrounded him.</p>
<p>His God Soul was affected so that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create the illusions in just a short period. Right at this moment, the light sword slashed down. This sword made the old man stop making illusions and to focus on gathering energy to create the moving halos around his body for defense.</p>
<p>The light sword slashed down grumblingly. Light shot out everywhere. The beams of light that had created the divine sword flew out, shifting into tens of thousands of stars that darted towards him.</p>
<p>Twirling gusts wrecked havoc everywhere, covering the old man. Under his feet, a heavy restraining force pressed the old man down on the ground, keeping him from flying away.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu were both the Second Sky of King God Realm warriors. As they were the troopers under Carthew&rsquo;s command, they had enough fighting experience. They were good at continuous attacking. After they got rid of the illusions, they immediately released their powers. The intimidating scene they created was not less than Shi Yan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>A wisp of divine light appeared. Shi Yan walked to that old man. His soul flickered and the God Domain changed again.</p>
<p>Both of his hands joined together, and a magical effect was created. He held the Space Domain tightly in his palms, making an incomparable space mystery. Massive light balls bombarded the old man instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Space Imprisonment!&rdquo; Shi Yan shouted.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Cracking sounds echoed from the space where the old man stood. It seemed that everything there was imprisoned. However, Wind and Earth power Upanishads of Yalan and Tie Mu were exceptions. They were still flowing furiously.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s body stopped moving. Countless moving lights around him were frozen eccentrically.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu&rsquo;s powers hit him immediately. Explosions continued. Light sparks shot out from the old man&rsquo;s God Body.</p>
<p>Shortly after, that old man looked like Shi Yan with blood covering him entirely as if hundreds of sabers and swords had slashed him. He was in utter confusion with disheveled hair, giving him a funny and pitiful look.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>The hissing sound of the Bone Thorns arose again. The three Bone Thorns appeared, stabbing his chest and back.</p>
<p>Pfff!</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns pierced the old man&rsquo;s God Body. Bones cracked. The old man spat out blood. However, his face glowed strangely. He then disappeared like a ghost, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>All of his aura, energy fluctuations, and life magnetic field were gone. No one could detect him.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu walked over after the old man disappeared. They frowned while searching, touching their Purgatory Token to see if they could sense something.</p>
<p>Chapter 788: Break Into The Prohibited Area</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sense living energy fluctuations in five different directions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan stroked the Purgatory Token, frowning while scanning everything around her. She talked with a slight headache.</p>
<p>Tie Mu scowled and had a worried look. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this old freak affected the Purgatory Token to deceive us. His aura currently signals in five different directions. I don&rsquo;t know which way we will find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan walked over to them. Blood dripped from his body. He wiped away a trickle of blood on the corner of his mouth, smiling coldly. &ldquo;The signals in all five directions are all fake. This old freak is really cunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at him for a few seconds. Later on, Yalan said, &ldquo;You are truly fierce. You have become so mighty after breaking through to the King God Realm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the previous battle, Shi Yan was the main force as his power had stopped the old man for a while. That was the golden chance for Yalan and Tie Mu to attack and wound him.</p>
<p>If Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t distracted the old man, they would have had no way to get rid of the illusions so quickly. And of course, they would have had no chance to damage that man.</p>
<p>They had seen the battle between Shi Yan and the old man. They understood that they didn&rsquo;t have the means to counter that old fellow but Shi Yan did.</p>
<p>Although their realms were one level higher than his, they had had no way of dealing with that old fellow.</p>
<p>The powers Shi Yan had demonstrated frightened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. I know where he is. F*ck him. This old dog is too cunning. He has provoked us to separate and make us kill each other so that he could clean us up at the end. When he saw that we didn&rsquo;t buy it, he used the illusions to delude us. Basically, he didn&rsquo;t want to spare anyone of us alive.&rdquo; Shi Yan snorted then continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left a wisp of Soul Consciousness in his Sea of Consciousness. I can locate him. The directions our Purgatory Tokens have sensed are all made up. None of them is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re at the First Sky of King God Realm but you could leave a beam of your Soul Consciousness in his Sea of Consciousness. Are you sure?&rdquo; Yalan&rsquo;s eyes brightened, not believing him.</p>
<p>Tie Mu gawked. &ldquo;Impossible! You and he are at two different levels. It&rsquo;s possible that he can leave a beam of his Soul Consciousness in your Sea of Consciousness. But how could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cultivated special powers Upanishad. My Soul Consciousness has mixed with space power. It can avoid his sensing for a short while. However, it won&rsquo;t last long. We should hurry. If we are too late and he deletes my wisp of Soul Consciousness, we won&rsquo;t be able to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu reacted quickly to what he said. They nodded and didn&rsquo;t linger.</p>
<p>Shi Yan took the lead. His body flashed like the rainbow, weaving through the forest like a shuttle. Yalan and Tie Mu stayed close behind him.</p>
<p>After one hour, he halted, looking at the valley in front of them and waving his hand. &ldquo;This place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu stopped, looking at that valley disbelievingly. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
<p>The valley in between the mountains was covered in layers of gray shadows and mists. Folds of barriers were set that covered the whole area. Chaotic energy stayed inside the barriers particularly. It seemed to hide the extreme dangers.</p>
<p>That area was apparently a prohibited land in the Extreme Purgatory Field. The magical Extreme Purgatory Field had so many similar areas. When normal participants encountered such places, they would try to avoid them at all costs. No one dared to intrude.</p>
<p>Rumors said that those barriers were made of the initial natural formations of this land. The Imperial Master of several previous generations had created them. Let alone the participants, even the owner of the divine nation Du Tian Ji couldn&rsquo;t understand all the mysteries of those barriers.</p>
<p>Before the participants entered the Extreme Purgatory Field, the host would explain and tell them to stay away from those prohibited areas.</p>
<p>According to them, those forbidden areas were the key nodes that created the Extreme Purgatory Field. These areas hid so many mysterious dangers. If they entered those places rashly, their soul altars could possibly vanish. They could also break the balance of the Extreme Purgatory Field which would prevent it from functioning properly.</p>
<p>Almost all the participants followed this rule. They wouldn&rsquo;t enter these places willingly. Out of those who dared to intrude, not many got out alive.</p>
<p>Magical energy fluctuations signaled from that valley, stating that it was one of the banned lands of the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wouldn&rsquo;t dare intrude such a place if he still had his previous cultivation base. He would leave early to get away from running into any unexpected troubles.</p>
<p>However, it was different now. That cunning old fella was hiding in there. Once he could recover and show up for a second time, he would bring greater dangers. If they didn&rsquo;t take the chance to destroy him when he got hurt, Shi Yan would never forgive himself for not preventing this wicked man from doing evil deeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dared to get in there. What are we afraid of?&rdquo; Shi Yan glared at Yalan and Tie Mu, his face persistent. &ldquo;Whether you are coming with me or not, I&rsquo;m going in there. This cunning old fella has grudges against us. He won&rsquo;t leave us alone easily. He is much more familiar with the Extreme Purgatory Field than we are and he can even dodge the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s sensing. If he is alive, he will always be some hidden danger. We must destroy him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That freak has joined the Extreme Purgatory Field many times. He must be familiar with this place. If he dared to get inside, I think he has some backup. We don&rsquo;t know anything about this place. Isn&rsquo;t it too risky?&rdquo; Tie Mu said with a worried expression on his face. He couldn&rsquo;t make up his mind.</p>
<p>Yalan frowned as she struggled to decide whether to get in there or leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the prohibited area hides some secrets, secrets related to the Extreme Purgatory Field. Maybe due to those secrets, that old man could dodge the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s sensing. If he might know that, why can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Shi Yan pondered for a while and then shouted, &ldquo;I must get in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he flew like a sharp sword piercing toward the barriers covering the valley.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It was like he had bumped into a giant rubber ball. His flying body bounced back with a tremendous force. An immense energy ran through his body. The impact made him dizzy.</p>
<p>Confused, Shi Yan went back over to Yalan and Tie Mu. His face darkened. &ldquo;Strong barriers. Hard to break. I can&rsquo;t pierce through it. Damn it. How did he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must know the mysteries of the barriers.&rdquo; Yalan&rsquo;s face was somber. She hesitated for a while and said, &ldquo;I think we should give up. If we take risks and intrude, I&rsquo;m not sure if we can gain the upper hand in his familiar fighting arena. However, if we attack him outside, we can join hands and win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu supported her. &ldquo;Shi Yan, don&rsquo;t act rashly. Being stubborn isn&rsquo;t always good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who can achieve big accomplishments are all crazy and stubborn.&rdquo; Shi Yan contemplated for one second and laughed sinisterly. &ldquo;It is just a barrier. I think I will be able to break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, his thoughts flickered. The Sky-breaking Shuttle appeared from the Storage Ring. He sent a beam of his Soul Consciousness into the shuttle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to break that barrier. How much energy do you need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-third of your power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wisps of fine energy circulated, rolling grumblingly and massively pouring into the Sky-breaking Shuttle.</p>
<p>Receiving the energy from his body, the Sky-breaking Shuttle, designed to break all kind of barriers and restrictions, turned into a shooting light that tore layers of barriers, flying toward the center of the forbidden land.</p>
<p>Shi Yan turned around, glaring at Tie Mu and Yalan. He ignored their astonished faces, turned into a bunch of light before disappearing shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He broke it? Did he just break it?&rdquo; Tie Mu&rsquo;s eyes showed that he couldn&rsquo;t believe what he just saw. He shook his head. &ldquo;Who is this boy? How can he be so magical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder why he has the potential to replace Ao Gera. He is such a tough character. I finally know why Master Carthew favors him. Yalan contemplated for a while, her face astonished. She turned to Tie Mu. &ldquo;What should we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Tie Mu was hesitant. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the situations in there. If we barge in, I&rsquo;m not sure if we will be safe. The old man is a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior. This place is his den. I don&rsquo;t think intruding is a good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yalan pondered for a while and nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Forget it. We should wait for a while. I know intruding into someone&rsquo;s territory would be taking a big risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were talking, the light passage created by the Sky-breaking Shuttle gradually vanished, cutting of their entry. Even if they wanted to get in there, they lost their chance..</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>The scene changed subtly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was standing in a beautiful blooming valley. Two streams crossed each other, which were clear enough to see the bottom. Small fish swam back and forth happily. Wild grass grew up to people&rsquo;s waist in every corner of the valley. They looked like the fuzz of a giant beast.</p>
<p>The air was fresh, cool, and humid in the valley. Earth and heaven energy were very thick. The wild grass was mowed in a small area of the valley where a small cottage stood. The door was open, revealing an old, pale man using pellets to recover.</p>
<p>He was the old man Shi Yan had encountered.</p>
<p>In the moment Shi Yan saw the man, the old man also noticed him. He jolted up, his expression changing dramatically in surprise. He shouted, &ldquo;Kid, how did you get in here? Didn&rsquo;t those barriers make you struggle? How could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is impossible.&rdquo; Shi Yan frowned. His eyes were still blood-red as he was maintaining the Rampage Realm. Energy boiled and rolled in his body massively, his aura brutal and malignant.</p>
<p>He walked step by step towards that old man. His eyes became more ruthlessly bloodthirsty. &ldquo;You got hurt badly. You want to hide and recover in here so that you could continue playing with us. Haha, you have a good place, indeed. Seems like you&rsquo;ve been staying here for a long time and got familiar with the conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That old man stopped restoring his aura and walked out of his cottage. In front of him were the two crossing streams. He had installed the net to restrain the fish in the streams. It seemed that he kept the fish for food.</p>
<p>The whole scene was beautiful and harmonious. The old man stood by the stream and he stooped to watch the small fish, inhaling the pleasant fragrance of flowers permeating the air. He wasn&rsquo;t tense or anxious at all. He even beamed a smile at Shi Yan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came. My Purgatory Token is here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan smiled, slightly shaking his head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 789: Deterrent Force!</p>
<p>A corner of the Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>Leona, Ao Gu Duo, and the others frowned while looking at the lake, their faces astounded.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu reappeared. After the battle between Shi Yan and the old man finished, their surroundings reappeared.</p>
<p>In the area they had fought, there was a deep pit that could be recognized from a thousand miles away. Yalan and Tie Mu were discussing something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Shi Yan?&rdquo; Carthew knitted his brows. &ldquo;There was a battle. Who did they fight? Shi Yan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Rochester curled his lips. &ldquo;But where is that kid? If Yalan and Tie Mu fought Shi Yan, who would win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a pretty even match,&rdquo; Da Lei squinted. &ldquo;Anyway, it seems like Yalan and Tie Mu won. Shi Yan disappeared. Did he get killed?&rdquo; That was what he wanted to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carthew, your subordinates are still enthusiastic. Haha.&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo grinned. &ldquo;Shi Yan has killed a lot of people. He brought death, now he has to bear it. If he got killed, it would not be abnormal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you order Yalan and Tie Mu to do something?&rdquo; Leona&rsquo;s face darkened. A gleam of brutal thought sparkled deep in her dark green eyes.</p>
<p>Carthew was scared out of his wits and he kept shaking his head. &ldquo;How could I? I like that kid a lot. I have treated him well. In my gravitational room, he spoke with Yalan and Tie Mu. I didn&rsquo;t think they would battle each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he explained, Leona snorted and didn&rsquo;t say more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some force had covered that area. I don&rsquo;t know what happened but I think the three of them won&rsquo;t compete against each other,&rdquo; Du Tian Le said uncertainly while rubbing his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Carthew mumbled to himself, curious about the situation.</p>
<p>The situation was similar in the Dark Firmament Star. Du Tian Ji also had this suspicions. He looked at that giant mirror with astonishment. He was baffled for a while then muttered, &ldquo;Our divine nation hasn&rsquo;t had an Imperial Master for a long time. I know the previous Imperial Masters all lived in the Extreme Purgatory Field. That place should store their inheritance. After this training ends, it&rsquo;s time for us to find an Imperial Master. How about the business you have done?&rdquo; He glared at Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s bold brows knitted together. Her beautiful eyes flared a strange halo. She pondered for a while then shook her head. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to take the Imperial Master role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knot in his heart hasn&rsquo;t been untied yet. It seems that I will have to work on him myself.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji nodded as if he already knew this result beforehand. &ldquo;After screening him, I can say that he is currently one of the most impressive alchemists of the entire Raging Flame Star Area. If he agrees to assist the divine nation, we will have more strong experts. Sigh&hellip; only if we had an Imperial Master, he could inherit from the few generations before him. We would have been able to give a clear path. What a pity. It is shameful for me to talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao kept silent, her face complicated. She didn&rsquo;t know exactly what had happened that year. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s shame was related to her mother&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zao-er, you are not young anymore. Do you have anyone in mind right now?&rdquo; Du Tian Ji suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s beautiful face blushed. She shook her head shyly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think about this for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously, Old Fan of the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce told me about his son. You&rsquo;ve heard about his only son, Fan Tian Po. His background and abilities are not weaker than Ao Gera. In the Raging Flame Star Area, the name of Fan Tian Po is well known. His bearings aren&rsquo;t bad either. I heard that he is handsome. He is also excellent in many aspects. You know Old Fan&rsquo;s status and position in the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce. If we want to talk about the perfect match for you in the Raging Flame Star Area, he would be the one. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Zi Yao shook her head after contemplating for a while. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know about this at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright then. I also need time to think. Consider him.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;The Ethereal God Realm is a big door. I don&rsquo;t dare go before preparing. However, I have to do it. If something happens to you, you better find the man in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field. He will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, if something happens to you, what about our divine nation?&rdquo; Zi Yao forced a smile. &ldquo;The five great feudal vassals have their own forces. They&rsquo;re all mighty. Without you, who would suppress them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji kept silent. After a while, he answered deliberately, &ldquo;I believe in their loyalty to the divine nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Da Lei&hellip;&rdquo; Zi Yao wanted to say something but she didn&rsquo;t finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not babble!&rdquo; Du Tian Ji shouted, giving an angry look. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m about to break through, I&rsquo;ll have my arrangement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded begrudgingly. Her look shifted to the shining mirror once again. She didn&rsquo;t know why she was worrying about Shi Yan. Perhaps it was because she didn&rsquo;t want anything bad to happen to him.</p>
<p>She had heard about Fan Tian Po of the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce. She knew he was a great character. But she didn&rsquo;t know why she had no interest in him.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>One of the forbidden lands of the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The old man who was good at using illusions stood nonchalantly where the two streams crossed each other. He silently watched the fish swimming back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you familiar with this place?&rdquo; Shi Yan walked over to him in a normal pace. His calmness was scarily abnormal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I got used to this place. I survived the Extreme Purgatory Field on many close occasions thanks to this place.&rdquo; The old man scooped water with his hands and drank it. He stooped and chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurt, and so are you. In this place, you won&rsquo;t have any back up. You didn&rsquo;t recognize how perilous this situation is for you, did you? I&rsquo;m glad you came. This means I can get your Purgatory Token, get out of this damn place alive, and gain back my freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Shi Yan grinned. &ldquo;Then I want to see how you can take the Purgatory Token on my waist. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;re both wounded. But there&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;ll never be better than me at. I am younger than you and my recovery ability is much faster than what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young? Being young is useful, my ass!&rdquo; The old man finally stood up, looking at him in the eyes. &ldquo;Kid, if you want to court death, don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just want a Purgatory Token, right?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised for a while. He said, &ldquo;In fact, your wish is easy to fulfill. If I can help you, will you share the secrets you know with me? It&rsquo;s just a Purgatory Token, I&rsquo;m sure I can get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was caught off guard but he still laughed out of interest. &ldquo;What do you mean you will get a Purgatory Token for me? You know what that means, right? I don&rsquo;t know you. But I know you want to kill a participant, the young talented and favored subordinate of one of the five feudal vassals, right? Will you do this for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Shi Yan pursed his lips. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t kill them, someone else will. I have someone I must kill in this place. He&rsquo;s hunting me down with all of his best efforts too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man didn&rsquo;t hasten. He stretched leisurely, glaring at Shi Yan. &ldquo;Tell me, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard about Ao Gera?&rdquo; Shi Yan pondered before asking.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes got colder. He snorted. &ldquo;Of course I know him. Ao Gu Duo&rsquo;s nephew, a genius of the divine nation. You want to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan nodded. &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve been idle in the Extreme Purgatory Field for so many years. But how do you know about Ao Gera? It seems like you hate him. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been out for all these years but people will be put in the Extreme Purgatory Field from time to time. From them, I get information of the world outside.&rdquo; The old man snorted with a cold visage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people who are related to Ao Gu Duo. Ao Gu Duo has imprisoned me here. Ao Gera is his nephew who has outstanding performance. Of course I have to notice him. If I had known he was here, I would have found and targeted him. Whatever will irritate Ao Gu Duo, I will do them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ao Gu Duo captured you? Haha, interesting, interesting. Seems like we have common goals.&rdquo; Shi Yan laughed evilly. &ldquo;By the way, what did you do to get yourself jailed here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has nothing to do with you!&rdquo; snorted the old man.</p>
<p>Shi Yan just laughed, unbothered by his response. One hundred meters away from the old man, he took off his clothes, discarding them conveniently before stepping into the stream to wash the bloodstains on his body.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes suddenly sparkled with divine light as he focused on the young man.</p>
<p>Using the stream&rsquo;s freshwater to wash away the blood on his body, Shi Yan revealed a refined iron-like body that didn&rsquo;t show even a single cut.</p>
<p>The old man had fought him just one hour ago. He understood that although Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Body didn&rsquo;t explode, he received a lot of cuts and wounds. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had so much blood on his body.</p>
<p>However, Shi Yan now stood vigorous without a single scratch. Energy in his body circulated smoothly. His God Body shimmered, showing that he was in his peak condition. Nothing in his body provided evidence that he got hurt badly.</p>
<p>After one hour of adjusting his aura and energy, there was not much change for the old man. The old man still had a lot of wounds on his body. The holes deep to the bone that the three Bone Thorns left on his chest and back were still there. His waist, abdomen, arms, and legs were covered with cuts which were caused by Yalan and Tie Mu&rsquo;s bombarding powers.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was no longer damaged. This discovery silenced the old man as he had planned to attack him one more time.</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that Shi Yan intruding this place alone and bragging in front of him wasn&rsquo;t just mere boasting. There was a reason why he had such confidence!</p>
<p>In front of the old man, Shi Yan washed before putting on new, clean garments. All of a sudden, he urged the power of the Immortal Demon Blood, pouring it into his arm. His iron fist pounded the ground grumblingly.</p>
<p>Boom Boom!</p>
<p>The impact from his fist touching the ground caused great tremors. An area of several thousand meters seemed to get hit by a meteor. The ground cracked as if there was an earthquake. The pits that appeared were so deep that people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see the bottom.</p>
<p>The condensed energy of the Immortal Demon Blood was sent to the ground, creating an earth-shaking scene. The tremendous energy ran deep under the Extreme Purgatory Field. Grumbling noise from the tremors continually echoed. The mountain near the valley was trembling as if it was about to collapse. Such a scale of damage was really scary indeed.</p>
<p>Even the old man at the King God Realm discolored in fright. He didn&rsquo;t dare act rashly anymore.</p>
<p>Shi Yan retrieved his powers, looking at the dozen-meter-deep pit in front of him with satisfaction. He turned around, smiling at the old man. &ldquo;You still want to ambush and kill me eh? Yeah, do you still think you would succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face darkened and he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we talk for a while?&rdquo; Shi Yan calmed down, strolling towards the old man, his face casual and peaceful. He wasn&rsquo;t worried about being ambushed.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face was gloomy and uncertain. He gazed at Shi Yan for a while and said, &ldquo;True. You&rsquo;ve proven your abilities. I can&rsquo;t kill you easily, it is true. Alright, I&rsquo;ll go with the less risky option. What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 790: Forbidden Area&rsquo;s Wonder</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know how you are able to avoid the sensing powers of the Purgatory Token? How can you hide your life magnetic field? And how did you enter this forbidden place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood firmly by the stream. Although he remained alert, he looked nonchalant. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t think that this old man would attack him for the second time. He could tell that the old man should understand now.</p>
<p>Indeed, he didn&rsquo;t dare attack anymore. Like Shi Yan, the old man calmed down eventually. &ldquo;What you want to know is related to this stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While talking, he took out a cube-shaped stone from his sleeve. That stone had some patterns that looked like natural drawings or formations. It held magical energy that made the patterns move and shimmer.</p>
<p>The old man bared his teeth in a broad smile. He threw the stone at the ground. &ldquo;Try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan sent a wisp of Soul Consciousness into the Purgatory Token. Magically, the life magnetic of the old man was visible in the Purgatory Token. The token was even able to precisely sense the strength of his life energy.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes brightened, studying the cube stone. He said with astonishment, &ldquo;This stone can cut off the sensing of the Purgatory Token and keep my Soul Consciousness from detecting you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the old man smiled arrogantly. He quickly picked up the cube stone. &ldquo;With this gem, the contestants in the Extreme Purgatory Field can&rsquo;t find me with their Purgatory Token. With this gem, I can enter ninety-nine forbidden places of the Extreme Purgatory Field easily without worrying about the barriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cube stone disappeared into his sleeve. Shi Yan&rsquo;s sensing did not work again. He couldn&rsquo;t use the Purgatory Token to lock the old man. Although they were standing face to face, his Soul Consciousness couldn&rsquo;t sense the living fluctuations of this old fella.</p>
<p>This cube stone seemed to be able to hide the God Soul and the soul altar. It was a marvelous device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; Shi Yan was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehehe, I can&rsquo;t tell you. I can only say that there are several stones like this. Except for me, the others who keep this stone are all the craziest prisoners of the Extreme Purgatory Field. After participating in the Extreme Purgatory Field for several times, we agreed to keep this a secret. Even the owner of the divine nation Du Tian Ji doesn&rsquo;t know about it.&rdquo; The old man grinned. &ldquo;It is also why I&rsquo;ve joined the Extreme Purgatory Field five times but remained alive. If I encounter someone I can&rsquo;t fight, I hide in the forbidden places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes brightened. He nodded, &ldquo;No wonder. Seems like you&rsquo;ve had good encounters in the Extreme Purgatory Field. You said there are ninety-nine forbidden places like this place. Do they all have layers of barriers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ninety-nine in total. I guess they are the formation eyes and the key nodes that contain the Extreme Purgatory Field. The existences of the ninety-nine forbidden lands maintain the balance and the magical effect of the Extreme Purgatory Field. Only while holding this square stone can you get in there safely.&rdquo; The old man gazed at him, his eyes bizarre. &ldquo;It is shocking that you were able to get in here. How? As far as I&rsquo;ve known, even I, at the Third Sky of King God Realm, can&rsquo;t get through such complicated barriers without this cube stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you either,&rdquo; Shi Yan beamed a faint smile. &ldquo;Everyone has his own secrets. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk much, neither will I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Now, I will take you somewhere.&rdquo; The old man pondered for a while then smiled. &ldquo;Perhaps you will like it. Oh right, I&rsquo;m Jiang Ge. You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me. I&rsquo;ll take you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man named Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t bother with the blood stains on his body. He became more excited, walking quickly through the cottage to another place deeper inside the valley.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t linger. He nodded and followed him quietly.</p>
<p>Flowers bloomed everywhere in this valley, grass also present in the entire area. Water murmured. Fish swam. The whole place was peaceful and harmonious like a fairyland.</p>
<p>No matter how hard people could imagine, they would never picture a wonderful place like this in the bloody Extreme Purgatory Field. The forbidden lands were intimidatingly dangerous, but they also hid a different world.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge looked very familiar with this place. While walking deep into the valley, he explained, &ldquo;Just like me, those who have the same cube stones occupy their own territory. Yeah, they&rsquo;re the forbidden places. Five out of the ninety-nine forbidden places are actually wonderful. You will see soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan listened to him attentively before asking, &ldquo;If you stayed in the forbidden land of the Extreme Purgatory Field after three years of bloody training, will people be able to detect you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Ge turned around, laughing. &ldquo;What do you think?.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People out there can&rsquo;t find you, can they?&rdquo; Shi Yan replied uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;m being honest. After each time I used my forbidden territory, I always got out. However, the four others who hold the territory of the four wonderful forbidden places have never left. They stay in the forbidden lands all the time. The owner of the divine nation deemed them dead. He doesn&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;ve survived and lived a better life. Since I have something to do, I have to go out. The other four consider the forbidden lands their home. They no longer want to leave.&rdquo; Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t turn to see him. He explained before walking away.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes sparkled strangely, amazed at what he was hearing.</p>
<p>If what this old man said was true, there were four other people like him in the Extreme Purgatory Field with the cube stones. Despite the fact that the lands were harsh, they have stayed in Extreme Purgatory Field for a long time. Age and realms for the other four were probably not normal. They must all be tough characters.</p>
<p>Since they got the cube stones, even Du Tian Ji couldn&rsquo;t find them or know their situations. Although they can dodge the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s sensing, why did they stay for several hundred years in the Extreme Purgatory Field?</p>
<p>Soon, he realized the answer.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge suddenly stopped, pointing at the end of the valley and shouted, &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan stopped walking. At first glance, he was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>It was a grand palace.</p>
<p>Stood between the two mountains at the end of the valley was a grand palace. The high mountain that jutted up to the sky provided shade for this palace. Thick clouds hovered above the palace like water ink that blocked light and didn&rsquo;t disperse.</p>
<p>The grand palace radiated immense divine light. It looked like this palace was made of gold, jade, and gemstone It was tall and pleasing to the eyes. Stone pillars stood in the center, supporting the palace. This scenery looked exactly like what you would find in a fairyland..</p>
<p>At this moment, they were standing next to the nearest pillar which could even shield the whole sky. Lifting up their heads to look at the palace, they felt so small.</p>
<p>Magical energy fluctuations diffused from time to time from the foundation pillar of the palace. They rippled out like magnificent waves. Each wave had at least dozens of layers, and each layer was a magical barrier. They were all mysterious and conveyed the might of Nature, which silenced them in awe.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Shi Yan wanted to go in.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge shouted all of a sudden. &ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan halted, turning around to look at him with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those rippling waves can easily take your life away. I&rsquo;ve been here for so many years but I can&rsquo;t dissolve it. You shouldn&rsquo;t take risks, alright?&rdquo; Jiang Ge grinned bizarrely. &ldquo;The other four&rsquo;s situations aren&rsquo;t different from mine. They also have a grand palace like this in their forbidden places. Do you get why they aren&rsquo;t trying to leave so quickly now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this palace?&rdquo; Shi Yan was surprised.</p>
<p>Nodding, Jiang Ge&rsquo;s face was solemn. &ldquo;I can tell you that the five palaces in the Extreme Purgatory Field should belong the five previous Imperial Masters of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. Du Tian Ji might know about this, but it is not certain. The former Imperial Masters hid something from the owner of the divine nation. That is why they didn&rsquo;t let him know about the mysteries of this place. I don&rsquo;t know what they hid in there, but I&rsquo;m sure that these palaces have something. The other four also believe the same thing. They aren&rsquo;t hurrying to leave because they want to discover this secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan discolored in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have a reason, I would never leave this place. I would break the defense there and get into the palace to see what&rsquo;s in there.&rdquo; Jiang Ge&rsquo;s face was serious. &ldquo;Kid, I brought you here to tell you that. If you give me a Purgatory Token, I will give you the cube stone. Although I can&rsquo;t make it, I think you can. I can&rsquo;t wait here any longer. I need to leave. Just consider this an exchange. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t bear a loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got the cube stone but you can&rsquo;t get in there?&rdquo; Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t agree immediately. He was still suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stone can only bring me through the barriers of the forbidden place. I can&rsquo;t get in the palace. I&rsquo;ve tried many times. My knowledge and power aren&rsquo;t enough to solve this problem. Perhaps, my realm isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; Jiang Ge forced a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base and you can&rsquo;t do anything. Why do you think I can?&rdquo; Shi Yan burst out laughing, shaking his head. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be fooled. You don&rsquo;t want to fight but you want to keep me in this place for the rest of my life. You want to use a secret to bind me. Good plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know what is in there?&rdquo; Jiang Ge frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. But I don&rsquo;t want to do things in vain. I don&rsquo;t want my efforts to be in vain by wasting time in this place where even birds don&rsquo;t want to poop.&rdquo; Shi Yan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds don&rsquo;t even poop?&rdquo; Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t know whether to cry or smile. &ldquo;Kid, you don&rsquo;t know your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once the three years of the training in the Extreme Purgatory Field ends, the sensitive feelings towards earth and heaven powers will disappear. Why only three years? Because they can only hold it for three years. No more. After three years, the Extreme Purgatory Field will be like other places. It won&rsquo;t be able to offer assistance to warriors and their realms. Ninety-four out of the ninety-nine forbidden areas will be the same. The energy there will disappear. However, the five forbidden areas with the palaces won&rsquo;t disappear. The sensitive sensing of natural energy will remain here forever!&rdquo; Jiang Ge shouted.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was shaken. He finally understood the heavy conditions that this old man offered him.</p>
<p>Chapter 791: Disappear Quietly</p>
<p>If a warrior doesn&rsquo;t go out and enjoy the subtle mysteries of the Extreme Purgatory Field to understand natural powers better every day, even if he has a bad innate endowment, accumulating for years can help with their understanding of powers and realms.</p>
<p>This forbidden land was a magical area that could help warriors progress their realm. Staying in this area, a man&rsquo;s perception of realms and powers becomes clearer and stronger.</p>
<p>Such an enticement was big enough. Shi Yan was touched. His mind was in a flutter.</p>
<p>However, while he was still dismayed, Jiang Ge&rsquo;s Fantasy Upanishad suddenly appeared!</p>
<p>Jiang Ge had been waiting for this chance for a long time. Seeing Shi Yan&rsquo;s confused eyes, he seized the moment and attacked.</p>
<p>He activated the Thousand Fantasy Domain. Jiang Ge looked at him. Magical light shot out from his eyes.</p>
<p>A gleam of confusion crossed Shi Yan&rsquo;s face. He couldn&rsquo;t differentiate illusions from reality. Jiang Ge&rsquo;s figures multiplied in his vision. Layers of water-like barriers suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>A beautiful figured appeared in his retinae. It&rsquo;s Xia Xin Yan. More people appeared unceasingly&hellip;</p>
<p>Shi Jian, Yang Tian Emperor, Yang Mu, Yi Tian Mo,&hellip; They all came, smiling as if they wanted to tell him something&hellip;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was baffled. He felt betrayed. His God Soul was tempted. He didn&rsquo;t realize that he was walking towards that group of people.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>His body immediately bumped into those layers of water ripples. He seemed to be bound and couldn&rsquo;t even wriggle. Shi Yan&rsquo;s face changed dramatically.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shi Yan found that he was standing next to a towering pillar under the palace. Layers of barriers tied him. His God Soul was restrained. Chaotic energies gathered. The magical barriers revived and started to affect him.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge suddenly smiled. &ldquo;Shi Yan, you&rsquo;re still a tender sprout. I&rsquo;m too familiar with this place. Should I be so kind to bring you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bound with so many layers, Shi Yan was enraged but he had no solution. The barriers were subtle and magical that acted like countless ropes tightening around his body. He couldn&rsquo;t wiggle out of them.</p>
<p>He kept thinking of ways to escape as Shi Yan contacted the Sky-breaking Shuttle. &ldquo;How can I get rid of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your power is insufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barriers in this place are all strong and marvelous. Even if I take all of your energy, I can&rsquo;t break them. Unless you know the method or reached the Peak of King God Realm, you won&rsquo;t be able to do it. I don&rsquo;t know the realm of the person who built the barriers, but the wonderful features of this place are beyond my imagination. My Maker was just a Sacred Grade blacksmith. His Realm wasn&rsquo;t enough to make me a higher grade treasure, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan grimaced.</p>
<p>This is the first time the Sky-breaking Shuttle failed him completely.</p>
<p>He thought there was no barrier that the Sky-breaking Shuttle couldn&rsquo;t break in this world. But today, he found that he was wrong. He had underestimated the might of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation&rsquo;s Imperial Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be outraged. In fact, I don&rsquo;t have any bad intentions. If you can break the mysteries of the barriers while you are in here, not only can you can escape but you will be able to get in the palace. Then, you will know the secret that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out even after spending more than two hundred years here.&rdquo; Jiang Ge beamed a faint smile. The cube stone in his hand glistened. A tender beam of light like a feather fell on Shi Yan&rsquo;s waist and took his Purgatory Token. &ldquo;Haha, I tell you this. I have no grudges against Ao Gu Duo. He did put me in this damn place, but it was because I wanted to get here. My purpose was to enter the Extreme Purgatory Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan could only stare at the man taking his Purgatory Token away. He had no solutions and he just remained silent, his eyes cold and dark.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge&rsquo;s face darkened and became sinister. &ldquo;That year, I was at only the Sky Realm. My whole family was massacred. My wife was raped in front of me. I must survive to take revenge! But my archenemy was too strong. I wasn&rsquo;t his match. Living was hard for me at that time, too. Although the Raging Flame Star Area&rsquo;s vast, I can&rsquo;t find enough shelter. But the Extreme Purgatory Field was just the place that I needed. My hands are soaked in blood. I&rsquo;ve killed many to make Ao Gu Duo jail me in the Extreme Purgatory Field. Staying here, I can avoid my enemy&rsquo;s pursuit. Also, I can have a better place to cultivate and increase my realm. That is why I&rsquo;ve stayed idle here for two hundred and fifty years. From the Sky Realm, I&rsquo;ve reached the Third Sky of King God Realm. I&rsquo;ve sacrificed a lot for my revenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face distorted savagely while talking. &ldquo;Finally, today, I gain the force for my revenge. Since you have only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base and Ao Gera is at the Second Sky of King God Realm, I don&rsquo;t see how you will have a chance to kill him if he also has help from others. I don&rsquo;t want to make this bet, either. If I can have the Purgatory Token from you, why would I take a risk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Ge gradually pulled himself together. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to hate me. I still think this is just an exchange between us. I told you the secrets that I kept for years. If you can break the barriers and get into the palace, perhaps you will have the luck that I can&rsquo;t imagine. If I didn&rsquo;t want to leave so badly, I wouldn&rsquo;t do this to you. I would stay here like the other four until I found the secrets of this place. I&rsquo;m now giving this honor to you. You should thank me. You&rsquo;re still young. You still have time to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I can&rsquo;t stay here with you. Enjoy. I need to get out of here.&rdquo; Jiang Ge rubbed his chin. &ldquo;After another year, the Extreme Purgatory Field&rsquo;s training will end. I will leave first. If we meet again, I will make up for your loss today. And yeah, I have to remind you that the other four aren&rsquo;t easy to talk to like I am. If you meet them, you have to be careful. They are the true villains of the Raging Flame Star Area. They are very patient and are all at the Third Sky of King God Realm. After so many years studying this place, the five of us have found that if one of the five palaces is broken, the others would change accordingly. Solve this mystery yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jiang Ge finished, he laughed evilly before leaving.</p>
<p>He passed by the small cottage, roasted some fish, ate them then picked some stuff. He left with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>
<p>After one hour.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge appeared from the forbidden place.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu were waiting outside. Seeing him, they were startled. They immediately got on guard, preparing for Jiang Ge&rsquo;s sudden attack.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge looked at them who looked like they were encountering the archenemy. He laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so tense. I won&rsquo;t risk my life fighting you. I got what I want.&rdquo; He shook Shi Yan&rsquo;s Purgatory Token.</p>
<p>Tie Mu was shaken, shouting, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Shi Yan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, of course.&rdquo; Jiang Ge laughed louder. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t treasure his life. He shouldn&rsquo;t have broken into the prohibited area. The barriers there had torn him into pieces. I didn&rsquo;t need to move my finger to receive this piece of Purgatory Token. So wonderful, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu and Yalan grimaced listening to him. They tensed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, I just need a Purgatory Token. If you don&rsquo;t want to get into more trouble, don&rsquo;t act rashly.&rdquo; Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t bother with Tie Mu and Yalan. He left quietly and hurriedly as if he had something to finish.</p>
<p>Yalan and Tie Mu looked helplessly at the man leaving. They didn&rsquo;t dare act recklessly.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge had the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base and his Thousand Fantasy Domain had affected them directly. Yalan and Tie Mu understood that without Shi Yan, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fight the old man.</p>
<p>The two contemplated for a while, their eyes gazing at the forbidden area. After a while, they sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad. Shi Yan was quite the character. I have never seen anyone that excellent at the First Sky of King God Realm. If he survived, he would have been the most dazzling star of the divine nation,&rdquo; Yalan said with emotions.</p>
<p>Tie Mu nodded heavily. &ldquo;He was too reckless. He didn&rsquo;t listen to us. If he didn&rsquo;t go inside there, that freaky, old man wouldn&rsquo;t have done anything to him. If we went together, that man wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to attack us. Sigh&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t expect things to turn out like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it. He chose his path. We had no choice.&rdquo; Yalan shook her head with regret. &ldquo;We should go. We still have a mission to finish. We should accomplish our task before saying more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tie Mu agreed. He glared at the prohibited land for the last time before leaving. They didn&rsquo;t know that Shi Yan was still alive inside.</p>
<p>After Jiang Ge left Yalan and Tie Mu, he wandered aimlessly, leaving no shadow. Ao Gu Duo and the others outside couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>His cube stone had concealed him from the Purgatory Token&rsquo;s sensing and the people using the lake to watch what was happening inside the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge moved discreetly in the Extreme Purgatory Field. He visited four other places, the four forbidden lands.</p>
<p>He and the other four had made an appointment. He told the others that he couldn&rsquo;t stay here any longer and that he must leave. A boy had replaced him. He would finish what Jiang Ge couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Moving between the four forbidden lands took him half a year. Participants in the Extreme Purgatory Field were still killing and chasing prisoners and bloodthirsty villains.</p>
<p>No one had met Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo, Leona, Du Tian Ji, and Zi Yao in the Dark Firmament Star couldn&rsquo;t use the magical mirror created by the former Imperial Master to spot Shi Yan in the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>That forbidden land was able to avoid all kinds of sensing abilities. Everyone thought Shi Yan was dead.</p>
<p>Time flies fast. Soon, the training in the Extreme Purgatory Field had come to an end. The term of three years was about to end.</p>
<p>Ao Gera didn&rsquo;t see Shi Yan. The battle that everyone had been waiting for didn&rsquo;t take place.</p>
<p>When the magical effects of the Extreme Purgatory Field vanished, Du Tian Le and the five great feudal vassals cooperated in checking the battlefields. The lucky prisoners and villains who survived were jailed again.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le faced the sky and shouted to call for the participants. Gradually, they came one by one. But Shi Yan had never shown up. Leona waited in silence. Her face gradually darkened.</p>
<p>Chapter 792: Calm Down And Break The Barriers</p>
<p>Ao Gera, Da Meng, Yalan, and Tie Mu gathered as Du Tian Le were calling for them.</p>
<p>Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t come up yet.</p>
<p>Leona continued to grimace.</p>
<p>After a while, almost all the participants gathered but Shi Yan was still not present.</p>
<p>Ao Gu Duo suddenly smiled. &ldquo;Leona, will you uphold our bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester, Carthew, and Da Lei also peeked at Leona with strange looks. Rochester and Da Lei seemed to take pleasure in her misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigh. I thought that Shi Yan would win. I didn&rsquo;t expect that he would die in there. Big mistake. I wanted to wait until he got out of there and flatter the new star of the divine nation. This is so unfortunate.&rdquo; Rochester shook his head in disappointment and regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Shi Yan is dead, someone else should have the Purgatory Token.&rdquo; Leona snorted, glaring at Ao Gu Duo who was content with his triumph. &ldquo;If he dies, I&rsquo;ll give you a life star, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo laughed.</p>
<p>While they were talking, Du Tian Ji in the faraway Dark Firmament pondered for a while and then said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face was gloomy. Grief sparkled in her beautiful eyes. She got up quietly.</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji touched the bright mirror in front of them. Divine light radiated gloriously. A slit appeared at the center of the mirror. The king and Zi Yao disappeared into the slit.</p>
<p>In the place where they could see the lake of the Extreme Purgatory Field, Du Tian Ji, and Zi Yao reappeared. After he identified which way to go, Du Tian Ji brought Zi Yao through several thousand miles and showed up at the place where the five feudal vassals gathering with just a single thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Including Du Tian Le, the five feudal vassals kneeled down on one knee, greeting him with respect.</p>
<p>The contestants, including Ao Gera, kneeled down on both knees, bending their heads over to show their humble admiration and respect to the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; Du Tian Ji nodded, his bearings calm and natural. &ldquo;Who is the winner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lika,&rdquo; Du Tian Le pointed at the first female warrior under Leona&rsquo;s commands. &ldquo;She killed the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Du Tian Ji smiled. &ldquo;Our divine nation&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Fantasy Sky Ring (storage ring) flew out from his finger toward Lika. &ldquo;Five Creator&rsquo;s Divine Pellets for you to use when you break through to the Original God Realm. It has the best efficacy that will give you endless torrential soul energy. A suit of level 4 Divine Grade armor. It can fuse perfectly with your God Body to increase your fighting abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lika was thrilled and she received the Fantasy Sky Ring. She kept saying thanks. &ldquo;Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty. I will dedicate my life to the divine nation until I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to give thanks. You&rsquo;ve earned them.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji smiled. His line of sight shifted to Du Tian Le. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll seal the Extreme Purgatory Field shortly. The training in the Extreme Purgatory Field ends now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still missing one person,&rdquo; answered Du Tian Le.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Du Tian Ji turned around, looking behind them. &ldquo;Get out. You got the Purgatory Token so you are exempt from all charges. From now on, you can go anywhere you want in this vast space. You&rsquo;re free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leona and Ao Gu Duo all turned around to look.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge showed himself, his face calm. He kneeled down. &ldquo;Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed Shi Yan?&rdquo; Zi Yao shouted in a hoarse voice, her face ferocious. Cold light sparkled in her beautiful eyes, which could scare people.</p>
<p>Leona also snorted. Her dark green eyes were like those of a serpent. She also made people tremble.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge discolored. &ldquo;Not me. I didn&rsquo;t kill him. He entered a forbidden area and the energy there tore him into pieces. I just picked up his Purgatory Token.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forbidden land?&rdquo; Du Tian Ji frowned but he didn&rsquo;t chase further. He waved his hand, not waiting for Leona or Zi Yao to ask the man more questions. &ldquo;Hand back the Purgatory Token and leave now. From now, you are free from your prior crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t say anything else. He left the Purgatory Token on the ground, thanked Du Tian Ji, before soaring up into the sky. As though he was afraid of the others&rsquo; words, he disappeared instantly.</p>
<p>Leona and Zi Yao gazed at him with hatred and resentment.</p>
<p>Ao Gera smiled brightly, walking towards Zi Yao. He bent his body. &ldquo;Your Highness, are you alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Yao looked at the smiling face of Ao Gera whose look never changed. She didn&rsquo;t know why she felt so irritated. Anyway, Ao Gera was her subordinate and he had been following her for years. He had given up everything for her. She had no reason to trouble him. She nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. Shi Yan saved me. I just don&rsquo;t feel well when he faced such an unexpected ending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan had joined hands with Bloody Slaughterer Ka Tuo to kill you, Your Highness. He didn&rsquo;t deserve your worries.&rdquo; Ao Gera said seriously.</p>
<p>Zi Yao&rsquo;s face got colder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the others said. He saved me in the Solar Star Exploding Fragment Field! There might have been something between him and Ka Tuo. But he was never his partner!&rdquo; she said resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say this is true, then it is true. I believe you, Your Highness.&rdquo; The smile on Ao Gera was forced. He was astounded for a while. In his eyes, Shi Yan was dead. There was no need to push it further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leona, when will you pay for our bet?&rdquo; Ao Gu Duo smiled. He felt so good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we leave the Purgatory Star, you send your men to my territory, I will hand you a life star.&rdquo; Leona&rsquo;s face grimaced. She snorted with icy, cold eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is over. Do what you need to do. You don&rsquo;t need to stay in Purgatory Star anymore.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji advised faintly before nodding to Leona. &ldquo;Come to Dark Firmament Star with me. I have something to discuss with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Leona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Ao Gera return to Glorious Amethyst Star and prepare. You&rsquo;ll depart to the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce soon to meet Old Fan and carry the task I&rsquo;ve given you.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji looked at Zi Yao.</p>
<p>Zi Yao nodded quietly. She felt a little bit lost. &ldquo;Father, I want to stay in Purgatory Star for a few days before I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, as long as you understand it. Although Shi Yan was your excellent subordinate, he is dead. Don&rsquo;t dwell on it for too long. The divine nation has many important matters now. Don&rsquo;t get distracted for too long.&rdquo; Du Tian Ji arranged things and then nodded to Leona. They left through the lake to return to Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the four feudal vassals Ao Gu Duo, Rochester, Carthew, and Da Lei adjusted their delegations and departed. They seemed to have a more important business so they didn&rsquo;t linger here.</p>
<p>Du Tian Le sealed all the gates of the Extreme Purgatory Field. He also strengthened the prisons of the Extreme Purgatory Field to ensure nothing unexpected would happen. Then, he left.</p>
<p>Zi Yao stayed in the Purgatory Star for seven days. She checked all the exits of the Extreme Purgatory Field as if she was waiting for someone or something.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t let Ao Gera come with her. She wandered around the Extreme Purgatory Field alone. During the seven days, she didn&rsquo;t find anything. Her face became darker and her mood got gloomier day after day.</p>
<p>No miracle happened.</p>
<p>After seven days, Zi Yao left with grief and bitterness. She departed from the Purgatory Star begrudgingly.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t know that one of the seal exits she had passed by was very close to where Shi Yan was blocked. It was so close to Shi Yan that she just needed to dash for a bit to see him.</p>
<p>However, the forbidden land had blocked all of sensing for living beings inside. She couldn&rsquo;t sense Shi Yan&rsquo;s living energy. Eventually, she had to leave the Purgatory Star with deep regret.</p>
<p>Time flew quickly. The Purgatory Star resumed its calmness. Experts all left. The Extreme Purgatory Field was sealed. This land returned to be a quiet place.</p>
<p>Ninety-four out of ninety-nine prohibited areas had disappeared. The five forbidden lands with magical effects still existed. Shi Yan stayed in the deepest place of his valley, inching through layers of barriers with great efforts.</p>
<p>That grand palace hid in the deepest place of the forbidden land under the shade of a tall mountain. Thick clouds concealed it. No one could see anything through that layer of clouds.</p>
<p>He came closer to a towering, massive pillar.</p>
<p>Two years had passed.</p>
<p>During two years, he was always trying to decipher the subtle mysteries of the barriers. There were forty-nine layers of barrier covering the palace. At this point in time, he had broken twenty layers.</p>
<p>Each layer was a magnificent formation, which hid the great mysteries of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>The reason why Jiang Ge couldn&rsquo;t break those barriers through his two hundred and fifty years staying here was that he wasn&rsquo;t a blacksmith, which had limited his abilities. With his King God Realm cultivation base, he had to use the Soul Consciousness to discover that subtle formation. Of course, his progress was too slow.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was different.</p>
<p>He had a natural advantage. He had the experience of studying magical formations in the Blacksmith&rsquo;s Secrets of Success. He had gained an unimaginable amount of experience and wealth.</p>
<p>A layer of barrier consisted of many smaller formations. Although it was magically complex, a Divine Grade blacksmith with wholehearted dedication could still break it. Even it wasn&rsquo;t fast, he could still make progress.</p>
<p>If Jiang Ge had known that Shi Yan at the King God Realm had such tremendous forces and that he was also a Divine Grade blacksmith, he wouldn&rsquo;t have used those barriers to bind him.</p>
<p>After deciphering each layer, his understanding of blacksmithing would reach a new height. The formations that built the barriers all hid the magical truth of Nature. During this time, his realm was refined and strengthened, and his soul was sublimated.</p>
<p>His sensing of natural powers became much more sensitive in this place. While he focused on breaking the barriers, the benefits it brought to his realm was hard to estimate.</p>
<p>Whenever a layer was broken, his realm would be refined one level. This also benefited his soul altar. While Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t notice it, his three powers Upanishad had a subtle change when he attempted to comprehend the mysteries of earth and energy inside those barriers.</p>
<p>He had forgotten Jiang Ge&rsquo;s trap. Now he had just sunk into his work of deciphering barriers which were one of the most magical journeys of his martial path.</p>
<p>His mind changed as he had developed advantages. His work speed accelerated.</p>
<p>Today, he had broken through the forty-second layer out of forty-nine layers. He suddenly felt a marvelous commotion from inside the palace.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other four Third Sky of King God Realm warriors in the other four forbidden areas of the Extreme Purgatory Field, who were doing the same thing with him, all witnessed a strange occurrence. They were all shaken.</p>
<p>Chapter 793: Meet Up In Precincts</p>
<p>After Jiang Ge left the Purgatory Star, he dashed furiously in the general direction of the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce. He didn&rsquo;t have a war chariot or a battleship so he flew by himself at the fastest possible speed that a Third Sky of King God Realm warrior could travel at.</p>
<p>After three months, he flew past the star area near the Dark Firmament Star.</p>
<p>Every time he exhausted his energy, Jiang Ge would find a place to rest and use the Divine Crystals to recovery. Then, he would continue moving.</p>
<p>Today, when he consumed a lot of his energy, he found an abandoned mineral star.</p>
<p>That mineral star was almost empty. It had caves of various sizes. From a distance, it looked like a giant hornet hive. Its energy was exhausted a long time ago. No pieces of ore remained.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge beamed a faint smile. His body descended like a shadow on the mineral star.</p>
<p>Ten medium-quality divine crystals flew out from his Fantasy Sky Ring. As he sat down to absorb the crystals, he discolored in fright.</p>
<p>The darkness covered him like a dome of the sky.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a beam of light in that darkness. He couldn&rsquo;t even see his own fingers. It was like a prison that made his soul decay.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge was shaken. He was frightened, looking here and there but he couldn&rsquo;t see anything. His heart sank to the bottom of an abyss.</p>
<p>He was astounded and it took him a while for him to react. He kneeled down anxiously and said with respect, &ldquo;Greetings, Madame Leona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Raging Flame Star Arena had so many powers Upanishad and some of them were so famous that everyone knew.</p>
<p>The Absolute Dark Upanishad was the flagship of the leader of the five feudal vassals &ndash; Leona. No one else possessed this power.</p>
<p>As the endless darkness engulfed Jiang Ge, he was initially bewildered but then he immediately knew whom he was encountering.</p>
<p>The bloody butcher of the divine nation, Commander of the Bloody Legion, head of the five brutal devils: Madame Leona.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge had no intention of resisting. He kneeled down on one knee and slightly stooped his head. &ldquo;I wonder why Madame Leona has humbled her good self to visit this place, what are my orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint light was revealed silently. A woman looked as sinister and cold as ghosts that sat on the stone ground by a cave that ran deep into the ground. She squinted and said calmly, &ldquo;You have two options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Ge stooped lower with a serious face. &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, I will kill you, destroy your soul altar and detain your God Soul. Then, I will use my secret techniques to take your memories.&rdquo; Leona&rsquo;s voice was indifferent as if she was talking about something that had no relation to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to know the other option,&rdquo; Jiang Ge was in fear, his voice even trembling. &ldquo;Madame Leona, I want to live. Please give me a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all things you saw in the forbidden place related to Shi Yan in details. Of course, you can choose to lie if you think you can deceive me.&rdquo; Leona was nonchalant as though she didn&rsquo;t care about his killing him. She didn&rsquo;t show her intention of killing him. Her calmness scared her victims out of their wits.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge lifted his head up and his body shivered. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate and answered immediately. &ldquo;He is not dead. He&rsquo;s constrained in the forbidden place by the barriers. I took the Purgatory Token from him but I didn&rsquo;t harm him. There&rsquo;s a palace inside that forbidden place which has forty-nine layers of barriers. It should be built by the former Imperial Masters of the divine nation to conceal an unknowable secret, perhaps&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew he had only one chance in front of Leona. If he lied, this infamous woman would never give him a bit of her mercy.</p>
<p>Thus, Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t have the nerves to lie. He didn&rsquo;t even dare pause in his narration as he was afraid that she would think that he was taking time to fabricate his story.</p>
<p>Leona listened to him silently without interrupting him. Until Jiang Ge finished, she remained in thought.</p>
<p>Jiang Ge slightly lifted his head up, looking at her anxiously. He didn&rsquo;t dare make a small move, just waiting for Leona&rsquo;s final decision.</p>
<p>He understood how brutal and cruel this woman was. All stories about this woman were related to bloody massacres. He knew her realm, which was enough to erase him easily. No one would ever know he was buried or torn into pieces on this damn planet.</p>
<p>Thus, he didn&rsquo;t dare move or talk rashly. He just waited like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go.&rdquo; After a while, Leona waved to dismiss him as though she was waving a fly away. &ldquo;Remember, I&rsquo;ve never seen you and you&rsquo;ve never seen me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will remember your kindness for the rest of my life.&rdquo; Jiang Ge threw his hand into the air and swore. He watched her. Seeing her have no other commotions, he fearfully backed off little by little. As soon as he got out of Leona&rsquo;s Dark Domain, he ran like crazy and didn&rsquo;t dare stop even just for a second.</p>
<p>Leona stood up in the dark. Her dark green eyes shot toward the direction of the Purgatory Star for a long time. Then, she snorted, &ldquo;That little brat made me lose a life star. I&rsquo;ll remember this debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The absolute darkness drifted like a dark cloud into the immense starry area. It flashed, swayed, then went invisible.</p>
<p>The emptied mineral star resumed its quietness.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The prohibited area, sealed Extreme Purgatory Field, Purgatory Star.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was staying in the middle of rippling water-like barriers, gawking at the grand palace that was almost within his reach. A magical energy fluctuation sent out from a deep place inside that palace.</p>
<p>Just like the change of seasons, the palace seemed to continue operating now. Strange and grumbling explosions echoed from the ground under the forbidden land where he was suspended in the air.</p>
<p>The same changes also happened in the other forbidden areas. Four Third Sky of King God Realm warriors were also confined in the barriers like Shi Yan. They lifted their heads looking at the palace and feeling the energy waves sending out from inside.</p>
<p>The five forbidden areas in the Extreme Purgatory Field slowly moved and adjoined with each other in a way no one could ever imagine or have a chance to witness.</p>
<p>Although they looked slow, they were actually moving very fast. Within fifteen minutes, the five forbidden areas situated in five different regions of the Extreme Purgatory Field had magically fused into one intact piece.</p>
<p>Even the five wonderful palaces appeared as one place under some mysterious force.</p>
<p>Immediately, Shi Yan saw not only one but five palaces.</p>
<p>The five palaces looked like five radiantly dazzling massive pieces of a jewel. With the support of the towering stone pillar, they moved up to the sky over their heads.</p>
<p>The five grand palaces arrayed a pentagon in the air. Like Shi Yan, the other four were staying near their palaces and facing the sky with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>The other four didn&rsquo;t have Shi Yan&rsquo;s progress. After so many years, they had only broken through twenty-three layers. Shi Yan was more productive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surprised voices of the four arose from four different corners. They all gazed at Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed in his barriers and tilted his head, looking at the other four. A gleam of surprise sparkled in his eyes.</p>
<p>The four of them were at the Third Sky of King God Realm: three males, and one female. The three male warriors were all the old man with disheveled hair and dirty clothes. They looked like they hadn&rsquo;t cleaned their bodies for years. All of them looked helter-skelter, their eyes hiding brutal and malevolent intentions.</p>
<p>The only woman looked in her thirties. She was beautiful, wearing a snakeskin-like leather robe at knee-length, revealing her jade-like calves.</p>
<p>That woman wasn&rsquo;t human. She belonged to the Ghost Mark Clan. Delicate cyan tattoos were shown on her exposed white skin arms and legs which gave her a perfectly beautiful look, charming but also evil.</p>
<p>In her thirties, she was the flower at its most beautiful blooming time. Subtly, fine azure patterns were drawn on her delicate neck. She had two exquisite jade earrings dangling on her earlobes, which created the ding dang sounds when she moved. Her beautiful eyes were like a deep sea that people could never measure.</p>
<p>She eyed Shi Yan from a far distance with a beam in her eyes that signaled how she felt uneasy. Her eyebrows arched as she gave an inaudible snort.</p>
<p>When the other four were watching him, Shi Yan also observed them. Not long afterward, he looked sterner.</p>
<p>Just like Jiang Ge, they were all at the Third Sky of King God Realm. They were the death-sentenced inmates of the Extreme Purgatory Field. Their hands were soaked in blood. They were not good people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, are you the person Jiang Ge mentioned? You&rsquo;ve replaced him?&rdquo; An old man as thin as a bamboo stick that looked like a skeleton with human skin cover asked. His eyes sparkled with gloomy light. &ldquo;Seems like you are much faster than us. What did you do to combine all the forbidden places into one piece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three observed him, their eyes hiding their ferocious thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Jiang Ge trapped me, making me sink in here,&rdquo; Shi Yan frowned before continuing, &ldquo;He left, I guess. Since then I&rsquo;ve been breaking these barriers. Until now, I&rsquo;ve deactivated forty-two barriers. At the moment the last barrier was broken, the palace I saw suddenly changed, which brought us all here. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s the special effect of the forbidden lands. This wasn&rsquo;t my intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feng Rao, what do you think?&rdquo; The man who talked to him first pondered before turning to look at the woman who had strange and exquisite drawings on her body.</p>
<p>The other two old men also looked at the Ghost Mark Clan woman named Feng Rao. It seemed like she was their leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, this is good.&rdquo; Feng Rao cracked a strange smile. Light sparkled from her eyes. &ldquo;We four have spent a lot of time just to break around twenty layers. Jiang Ge was the worst. He had been holding us back. He left and arranged a good boy who could surpass us in just a short time. Aren&rsquo;t we lucky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, the other three acted oddly. Those old men didn&rsquo;t look like good people. They burst out laughing bizarrely as if they all agreed with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been patient for a long time just to find what was inside the palaces. This kid accelerated our progress. It is all good for us.&rdquo; Feng Rao smiled. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see that the barriers&hellip; are loosening a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we did,&rdquo; the three old men cracked strange smiles.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face darkened as he had a bad premonition. These four people were too relaxed and nonchalant. If their desire of knowing the secrets of this place was too much, they must have planned something.</p>
<p>Chapter 794: A Dark Enchainment</p>
<p>These four seemed to be different from Jiang Ge. Although Jiang Ge was curious to know the secrets of the palace, he was too far from the level of the other four. He wouldn&rsquo;t let those secrets keep him here like the others who would never leave until they reached the palaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, very good. With this kid, our progress will be much faster,&rdquo; the skinny man bared his teeth, smiling disgustingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s alright. Our purpose is to understand the secrets of those palaces. I heard they were built by the five former Imperial Masters of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. They hide an earth-shaking secret. I haven&rsquo;t gotten out of this place because of it.&rdquo; Feng Rao glared at the other three. &ldquo;You guys are curious, too, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three old men nodded simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; asked Feng Rao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Shi Yan, since Jiang Ge transferred his responsibility to you, you shall replace him then. Not bad. Just do what you were doing. Break the rest of the barriers.&rdquo; Feng Rao assigned him this task naturally as if it was obvious.</p>
<p>Shi Yan frowned, contemplated for a while and then laughed. He stopped moving inside the barrier.</p>
<p>The three old men darkened their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you laugh?&rdquo; Feng Rao&rsquo;s arched eyebrows rose. Her slender face outlined her bright eyes, which were sparkling with deep and strange light. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you interested in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am,&rdquo; Shi Yan shook his head many times faintly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be dim-sighted. I want to know why you guys want to get in there. You guys aren&rsquo;t like Jiang Ge. Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t know what was in the palaces. I think you guys know something. Yeah, maybe&hellip; you weren&rsquo;t forced to be jailed in the Extreme Purgatory Field&hellip; Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other four frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you came to the Extreme Purgatory Field on your own, with the goal to seek these forbidden areas. Am I right?&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled coldly.</p>
<p>The other four quieted down.</p>
<p>Feng Rao pondered for a while then probed. &ldquo;Do you know something, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan could feel something here but he was still calm. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m like you guys. I came here for this special place. I let Jiang Ge trap me here. It was exactly what I wanted. What you know, I also know. Haha. I just want to confirm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have the jade token?&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t easy to deceive Feng Rao. She snorted, &ldquo;Each of the five of us has a jade token? Jiang Ge kept one. If you don&rsquo;t have the jade token, how did you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the jade token,&rdquo; Shi Yan shook his head. &ldquo;But the one Jiang Ge had comes from my family. My family had kept it for a long time. After my family has declined, the jade token had been passed through many people before Jiang Ge got it. Jiang Ge has the jade token but he didn&rsquo;t know the real secret of it. I&rsquo;m here with the same goal as you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan had racked his brain to fabricate those lies. He thought it could work.</p>
<p>Indeed, Feng Rao&rsquo;s group changed their facial expressions listening to him. They seemed to buy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder why Jiang Ge wasn&rsquo;t so patient. He doesn&rsquo;t know much.&rdquo; The bony old man had his eyes flared as he nodded discreetly. &ldquo;If we have the same goal, we don&rsquo;t have much time to talk. The secret of those palaces can change the structure of the Raging Flame Star Area. People, do your best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feng Rao also nodded. &ldquo;Kid, our priority is to remove the barriers. Your fast speed helps loosen the barrier in our place too. If we continue this way, we can get in there soon. Wait until we break the barriers outside the palace. Then, we will talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three nodded.</p>
<p>Shi Yan pondered for a while. He didn&rsquo;t continue to quarrel with them. He got the conclusion he wanted.</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s team came to the Extreme Purgatory Field because of the forbidden lands. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Their imprisonment in the Purgatory Star was just their trick. Those four people were at the Third Sky of King God Realm. They were all cruel and malignant. With their abilities, it wasn&rsquo;t too difficult to kill a participant to take the ticket outside. They lingered here for something.</p>
<p>A secret that could restructure the Raging Flame Star Area. Shi Yan was interested in it all of a sudden.</p>
<p>He focused on breaking the left seven layers.</p>
<p>After breaking one layer, he would take a rest and talk with the other four. Through some conversations, he knew that Feng Rao came from the Land of God Punishment, the most chaotic place of the entire Raging Flame Star Area. Her status wasn&rsquo;t ordinary.</p>
<p>The skeleton-like old man was called Ganji was a warrior of the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce. The other two were named Pang Jia and Han Di. They were from the Underworld League. None of them came from the Dark Firmament Divine Nation which surprised him.</p>
<p>With the same goal, the atmosphere between them seemed to be harmonious without any dispute while the barriers were not yet lifted..</p>
<p>As Shi Yan had progressed fast, the breaking speed of the other four became faster accordingly. Soon, there was only one barrier in front of Shi Yan.</p>
<p>At this moment, Feng Rao said, &ldquo;We can take a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed in the water-like barrier and stopped his work. He floated in so many ripples, his face calm. Although he was surprised, he didn&rsquo;t outwardly express it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until they reach the last layer, we will join hands and tear the barrier at the same time to enter the palace.&rdquo; Feng Rao looked at him. &ldquo;Some of the layers in our places still remain. If you break it now, something will change accordingly in our places. At that time, perhaps we can&rsquo;t open the five palaces at the same time, and we won&rsquo;t receive anything from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji, Pang Jia, and Hand Di nodded.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know what Feng Rao said was true or not. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t take risks as he didn&rsquo;t know what hid in those palaces. If he broke into there alone, he could possibly encounter something dangerous.</p>
<p>Thus, Shi Yan stopped his work, bobbing in the water-like layer. He closed his eyes to comprehend what he had collected during this time of breaking barriers. Shi Yan was studying the subtle mysteries of magical formations that made these barriers.</p>
<p>Every magical formation contained different truths of Nature. The way to decipher the formation was to follow the trace of its energy using his knowledge of formation and barriers and the Soul Consciousness to solve it.</p>
<p>During this process, Shi Yan gained a deeper perception of other powers in the world. Although he didn&rsquo;t aim to dig his three powers Upanishad further, he still got something naturally.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stayed quiet and took out the divine crystals to restore his energy. He calmed down his mind to learn the specialties of his powers and didn&rsquo;t bother with the other three, who were still struggling breaking their barriers.</p>
<p>Time flew fast. A long time had passed.</p>
<p>Today, Feng Rao was the first one who had reached the final layer. She exhaled and glared at Shi Yan, who was meditating. She didn&rsquo;t say anything but took out the divine crystals to restore her power.</p>
<p>A long time afterward.</p>
<p>The other three also reached the final layer. Their faces brightened up as they were very excited.</p>
<p>Just like Shi Yan and Feng Rao, the other three didn&rsquo;t hasten to break the final layer. They quietly used the divine crystals to recover their powers to the peak.</p>
<p>Shi Yan had restored his powers. He observed them discreetly. His face gradually darkened.</p>
<p>He saw their cautiousness. It was obvious that they were so excited, but they all controlled and recovered their powers to the peak. Their intentions were clear to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>They all knew they had to use all of the forces in the next moment. Perhaps, after they had broken the final layer, the harmonious relationship between them would be demolished forever without any chance to cooperate again.</p>
<p>He understood that once all the barriers were broken, entering the palaces would trigger the big fight against these people. Since he had only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, among the five of them, he was the weakest.</p>
<p>Shi Yan knitted his brows tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di are all at the Third Sky of King God Realm, Han Di&rsquo;s the weakest. His time in the King God Realm wasn&rsquo;t for too long&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a wisp of Soul Consciousness that was hard to detect sneaked through the broken layers to Shi Yan from Feng Rao&rsquo;s. The eccentric Ghost Mark Clan woman stooped and opened her eyes to look at him.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di were still restoring their power. They seemed not to recognize Feng Rao&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t reply with Soul Consciousness. Your realm&rsquo;s low. If you release your soul energy, they can sense you immediately.&rdquo; Feng Rao&rsquo;s thought continued to reach him. &ldquo;You just need to listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment the barriers shatter altogether when we enter the palace, we will have an unavoidable battle. Since your realm&rsquo;s the lowest, I don&rsquo;t know how you got in there, but when we engage in a battle, you will inevitably die first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a suggestion. Once we get in there, the other three will launch attacks immediately. We will join hands. You&rsquo;ll help me to hold Han Di back for a while. You don&rsquo;t need to join the battle. Just stay outside. You shouldn&rsquo;t hurry because of the things in the palace. Even though Han Di&rsquo;s the weakest among us, he is not someone you can deal with easily. When I say hold him back, deal with him with a tool which you can pour your energy into that I will give you. You don&rsquo;t need to bother with Ganji and Pang Jia. If I win something, I won&rsquo;t forget your part. If you agree, you should give me a slight nod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan squinted, observing her for a long time. Then he slightly nodded.</p>
<p>Feng Rao parted her lips, forming a smile. Her eyes glistened. Next, she told him how to use the tool.</p>
<p>Among these four people, Feng Rao seemed to have the most exquisite cultivation base. Her understanding of powers Upanishad was the most profound. That&rsquo;s why she didn&rsquo;t worry that the other three could hear her soul thoughts sending to Shi Yan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genji exhaled foul air. The divine crystal in his hand turned into dust and scattered. The old man now looked refreshed and sound. He glared at Feng Rao next to him. Suddenly, he stooped and smiled, his smile worth studying.</p>
<p>He looked at Feng Rao then sneaked at Shi Yan. A gleam of disdain flashed in his eyes. Apparently, he didn&rsquo;t consider Shi Yan his equal opponent.</p>
<p>Shortly, Pang Jia and Han Di woke up. When they looked at Feng Rao, they seemed to be afraid of her. However, when they shifted their looks to Shi Yan, their fear disappeared.</p>
<p>Obviously, just like Ganji, they deemed Shi Yan nothing of a threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Feng Rao shouted.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stooped, placing his hands on the ultimate layer of the barrier. The other four also worked on their last barrier breaking.</p>
<p>Chapter 795: Small Character, Big Effect!</p>
<p>Shi Yan extended his hands, touching the barrier which had a wooden texture. Those magical wood textures connected each other. They were green-brown that looked more like a thick forest. An aura of floras diffused from this barrier.</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, Shi Yan felt like he was walking deep into a luxurious forest. He could even smell the fresh smell of green trees and grass. He could feel the breath of Nature.</p>
<p>Countless wooden pieces fused with each other, creating a sea of lush plants. The Essence Qi of Wood permeated everywhere thickly and vigorously.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other four placed their hands on the barrier.</p>
<p>From Feng Rao&rsquo;s direction, gold light emitted while red flame, white steam, and yellow Earth Qi gushed out from Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di&rsquo;s areas respectively.</p>
<p>Five Elements forces!</p>
<p>At first glance, Shi Yan understood that this ultimate layer hid the mysteries of Five Elements. They seemed to connect with each other, too.</p>
<p>The barriers of Five Elements &ndash; Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth &ndash; could always fuse with each other magically. These last barriers interlinked between the palaces. They kept the subtle powers of balanced Five Elements. Once they broke this balance, something beyond their imagination would happen.</p>
<p>Shi Yan observed the wood texture for a while, but he didn&rsquo;t hasten. He closed his eyes and quieted his mind to feel the magical vitality of the wood texture.</p>
<p>Shortly, a thought arose in his head. His mind flickered.</p>
<p>The Dead Upanishad was activated. The Soul Burial Ground diffused, expanding next to him. It engulfed the luxurious forest created by those wood pieces.</p>
<p>Wood energy emitted from those magical wood textures. Under the effects of the Soul Burial Ground, this Wood energy was absorbed gradually. The vigorous vitality was collected and gathered by Shi Yan.</p>
<p>His God Body suddenly received the lively power which boosted his power. The subtle power of Five Elements turned into beams of pure energy entering his flesh and bones.</p>
<p>This last barrier of Wood power was dissolved easily under his special power Upanishad. At this speed, this last barrier would soon vanish.</p>
<p>However, Feng Rao&rsquo;s group of four found themselves struggling. While they were breaking the barriers, their faces were grim. Sweat beaded their foreheads. They were focusing wholeheartedly not daring to be distracted.</p>
<p>The power in their God Bodies was draining fast. Shi Yan could solve his barrier easily, but it was troublesome for them.</p>
<p>They were urging their energy madly. Light sparkled from time to time from their bodies as they poured energy into the barriers. They closed their eyes to sense the leaks of the barriers which they would fill with their energy.</p>
<p>Those people didn&rsquo;t cultivate any power of the Five Elements. Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t guess it before they had released their God Domain. However, he understood that their powers were all mighty and ruthless. As long as they were persistent, when they wore out the energy of the barrier, they would finish it.</p>
<p>While he was observing Feng Rao&rsquo;s group, his marvelous Soul Burial Ground had absorbed almost all the Wood energy of the last barrier.</p>
<p>Seeing the last layer was about to be broken, Shi Yan suddenly stopped his activity. His God Domain disappeared. He relaxed and watched the other four. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t hasten to tear the last layer of barriers.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what was in the five places or the dangers hiding in there.</p>
<p>Thus, he didn&rsquo;t want to be the first one jump in there. As Feng Rao had reminded him, he stayed outside to see what would happen before he could decide his next moves.</p>
<p>Shortly, Feng Rao&rsquo;s group had worn out the energy of the final barriers and broken them.</p>
<p>Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Clear echoes arose from the other four&rsquo;s areas. Light dots of four colors scattered.</p>
<p>Four shadows dashed like meteors under beams of red light. They stormed towards the five palaces.</p>
<p>Ganji was the fastest. He just swayed and appeared in a palace. Pang Jia and Han Di followed him closely. Feng Rao, the one people feared a lot came last. While the other three dashed into the palace, Feng Rao paused, glaring at Shi Yan. Abruptly, an azure ball covered in lightning was shot toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was bewildered. He immediately tore off the last barrier. He urged Essence Qi on his palm and condensed them into fine beams like snakes. He caught the azure ball.</p>
<p>This ball was small enough for him to hold it with one hand. However, it was much heavier than it looked. The ball was covered with some strange spikes. At first glance, it looked like a hedgehog curling its body with immense lightning on its spikes.</p>
<p>After he had caught the ball, lightning power like ropes condensed and wound around his arm.</p>
<p>Azure lightning strikes and his Essence Qi fused. As Shi Yan&rsquo;s Soul Consciousness flickered like Feng Rao had told him, he used a strange technique to connect with an area inside that ball.</p>
<p>Shortly, he had formed a connection with that small ball. Now he could control the ball. Just like driving the amethyst war chariot, he could manipulate the ball easily.</p>
<p>Lightning strikes mixed with his Essence Qi which helped him control the lightning power.</p>
<p>Feng Rao threw him this toy to deal with Han Di. According to Feng Rao, Shi Yan could use the lightning power in this Thunderbolt Ball to subdue Han Di. It could even disrupt Han Di&rsquo;s God Domain.</p>
<p>Holding the Thunderbolt Ball in his hand, Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t hasten to leave or bother fighting Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di, which was taking place in the palace, just looking at Feng Rao from a distance.</p>
<p>Feng Rao nodded to him. She said nothing afterward. Her figure faded immediately. In the next moment, she appeared near Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di. As soon as she appeared, she instantly attacked Ganji.</p>
<p>The God Domain of these four emerged in one palace. At this moment, Shi Yan finally knew which powers Upanishad each of them cultivated.</p>
<p>Ganji&rsquo;s power was Gravity. In his affected area, blocks of stone that built up the palace were shaken as if they were about to collapse.</p>
<p>In his Divine Gravitational Field, the gravity was increased several hundred times. Besides him, no one could be free of this special effect.</p>
<p>Pang Jia&rsquo;s power Upanishad could make his body stretch or contract at will. When he performed his God Domain, his fingers could extend or shorten easily like a monster. His bones would be like the spiral spring that could be lengthened ten times.</p>
<p>This was one of the rarest power Upanishad that Shi Yan had ever seen.</p>
<p>Han Di&rsquo;s power Upanishad was Soul Dragging. Inside his God Domain, shadows of ghosts and demons moved back and forth. He could control them all. Anyone entered Han Di&rsquo;s God Domain would have his soul bound and be unable to control his body.</p>
<p>Now Shi Yan knew why Feng Rao had given him the Thunderbolt Ball. Han Di&rsquo;s power could control ghosts and souls, which got scared witless from thunder and lightning. Thus, thunderbolts were the nemesis of his domain.</p>
<p>The God Domains of Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di were somehow odd. However, the oddest was Feng Rao&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s power Upanishad was sound!</p>
<p>When her God Domain was created, countless sadly grating and shrill voices reverberated. She shouted and her Essence Qi was poured into her God Domain, creating more sharp noises that sounded like brutal blades.</p>
<p>When Pang Jia or Han Di shot their energies into her strange domain, under her techniques and spells, their powers would be locked or burst off. They couldn&rsquo;t damage her.</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t know the real origin of those four, but he was sure they have peculiar God Domains. They were attacking each other in the palace as if they had seen a marvelous treasure in there. No one noticed Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Perhaps in their minds, Shi Yan was just a small character with only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to affect and change the situation of their battle. They decided to ignore him.</p>
<p>Feng Rao had used a strange sound technique to subdue the other three.</p>
<p>She shrilled. The ear-piercing voice and her energy became invisible spears crossing the space, aiming at Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di.</p>
<p>Only Han Di&rsquo;s peculiar power Upanishad could trouble her. Since Han Di could use the magical power of Soul Upanishad, he could make countless ghosts and evils came forth to create shields from the sharp sound spears. He didn&rsquo;t struggle much.</p>
<p>Sound has no weight. That&rsquo;s why Ganji&rsquo;s gravity power couldn&rsquo;t affect it. Those sound spears then wrecked havoc in his God Domain. Ganji felt that his hands were tied he couldn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Pang Jia didn&rsquo;t have any solution. Even if he could make his hands longer, when the sound attacked him, he had to shrink his limbs instantly, resizing his God Body ten times smaller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Feng Rao shouted while fighting one-on-three.</p>
<p>Shi Yan got out of the barrier and walked to the palace. Hearing her call, he hesitated for a while before flinging the Thunderbolt Ball.</p>
<p>Hundreds of azure lightning strikes moved like the electric eels toward Han Di&rsquo;s God Domain.</p>
<p>His GOd Domain felt each of blue lightning strike, and it burned many ghosts in there. Immense azure mist fumed.</p>
<p>Han Di&rsquo;s God Domain was shattered under the coverage of the blue lightning. It couldn&rsquo;t perform at its best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, you wish for death!&rdquo; Han Di was enraged. As he hadn&rsquo;t prepared to counterattack, his God Domain was disrupted. Feng Rao&rsquo;s maledictions had shot him badly. His God Body now had many bleeding holes. He was outraged, looking at Shi Yan with a flame of anger in his eyes.</p>
<p>His God Domain was damaged, making Feng Rao&rsquo;s power fiercer. Ganji and Pang Jia were completely subdued. They had no solution to wiggle.</p>
<p>Feng Rao was excited. While dealing with the other two, she distracted them for a while and went quickly towards an area inside the palace. A rainbow-like bunch of light like a ribbon shot out from her soft palm that flew directly to that area.</p>
<p>A fragment that looked like a turtle shell was shielded by a magical formation placed in that area. Feng Rao&rsquo;s rainbow was shot there, smashing the formation. The fragment that looked like a turtle shell was about to fall into her hand.</p>
<p>Shortly, a tremor was sent from the five palaces. From the other formations in the other four palaces, pieces of turtle shell flew out and gathered as if they were about to join and create something complete and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Chapter 796: Hiding Incompetence By Keeping Quiet</p>
<p>The five pieces of turtle shell used to be split up, but now they were reunited, becoming one intact piece under some force.</p>
<p>By the time the five pieces of turtle shell combined, a magical energy fluctuation bloomed fiercely from that shell.</p>
<p>Feng Rao discolored as if she could feel something terrible. She didn&rsquo;t say anything but flew away in just a blink.</p>
<p>Her figure swayed and she had gone very far away from that turtle shell.</p>
<p>Right at that moment, tens of thousands of seven-colored lights shot out from the shell, each of which was sharp enough to pierce through anything.</p>
<p>The rays of light were denser near the turtle shell. They shot out everywhere and became more scattering.</p>
<p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of rays shot out altogether.</p>
<p>Han Di wasn&rsquo;t so cautious. More than ten beams of light pierced him. His God Body revealed some spatial holes. Shortly after, Han Di&rsquo;s God Body was finished. Even his soul altar was pierced and exploded shortly.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia could notice the danger. They flew away after Feng Rao.</p>
<p>However, they couldn&rsquo;t dodge all the rays. Some lights had managed to prick their arms and waist that looked like the wounds caused by invisible swords.</p>
<p>They were lucky that those lights didn&rsquo;t hit their weak points. Unlike poor Han Di, they were still alive. They hastened to use pellets to stop the wounds from bleeding and grow flesh to seal the holes. Their intestines stayed in their tummy.</p>
<p>The unharmed were Feng Rao, who fled first, and Shi Yan, who was standing the furthest from the source of attacks.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was frightened since there was a scattering beam shot right next to him. Too close! If he hadn&rsquo;t listened to Feng Rao and went inside, he would have possibly gotten hit. The closer it was to the turtle shell, the thicker the beams of light were. They condensed and then expanded. The gaps between the beams enlarged when they shot out.</p>
<p>Shi Yan and Feng Rao had swayed between those gaps to dodge the fatal attacks.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of light beams bombarded thickly from the turtle shell before ceasing. In just a blink, condensed light covered the turtle shell while it was spinning in the area of the clear energy formation.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia simply cured their wounds and gazed at Feng Rao with rage and hatred. &ldquo;Bitch! Well-done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two had moved to stay in the gaps between the light beams. They didn&rsquo;t get hurt but they were pale. Apparently, they got hurt severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I are the same. If you haven&rsquo;t hastened to attack me, we wouldn&rsquo;t have caused the reunion of the five pieces of the turtle shell. Everything wouldn&rsquo;t have turned this way. I can only say that you deserve it!&rdquo; Feng Rao beamed a faint smile, not showing that she was weaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we haven&rsquo;t hindered you, would you have taken all the good things? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be ideal for you, eh? If you were a nice person, why wouldn&rsquo;t you spare some good things for us?&rdquo; Ganji was outraged. His eyes were cold and sinister as he was angry.</p>
<p>Pang Jia sneered looking at Feng Rao before glaring at Shi Yan. &ldquo;Bitch, you&rsquo;re good at calculating. You decided to cooperate with that kid and made him hold back Han Di, which made his God Domain ineffective. You&rsquo;re so cunning and malignant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the three of you have soon planned to fake your first fight and wait until I got into your trap. You wanted to kill me, the strongest first. Did you think that I wouldn&rsquo;t know your scheme?&rdquo; Feng Rao arched her brows and snorted. &ldquo;You can plan to attack me but I&rsquo;m not allowed to counterattack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised listening to their conversation. He felt grim. None of them were nice. All had bad intentions.</p>
<p>Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di all knew that Feng Rao was the toughest to deal with. They had a perfect plan that they would pretend to fight against each other to entice Feng Rao. The three of them would join hands and kill Feng Rao first. Then, they would check out the treasures of this place.</p>
<p>Anyway, Feng Rao had predicted their scheme. She wasn&rsquo;t fooled so she decided to join hands with Shi Yan to hold back Han Di, preventing him from utilizing his energy to the utmost. She was afraid of Han Di&rsquo;s power the most.</p>
<p>Thus, the cunning plan of Ganji, Pang Jia, and Han Di was ineffective. Feng Rao, in an opposite situation, had gained the upper hand and suppressed Ganji and Pang Jia. She almost got the piece of turtle shell first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, man proposes but God disposes. Even Feng Rao had a wrong calculation. The five pieces had reunited fast, leaving her no time to dodge the danger. Her plan failed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all old cunning foxes, indeed.</p>
<p>Shi Yan became more cautious. While they were talking, he silently swayed between the gaps of the light beams to the position nearest to Han Di&rsquo;s shattered body to absorb his thick Essence Qi. No one noticed this move of his.</p>
<p>Han Di was at the Third Sky of King God Realm. Even though he was dead, the energy he had accumulated for so many years wouldn&rsquo;t vanish so quickly. When Shi Yan came, the unowned Essence Qi beams seemed to find a new host. They discreetly congregated in his body.</p>
<p>The whole life Essence Qi of a King God Realm warrior was massive. Shi Yan hated that Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia couldn&rsquo;t quarrel longer so that he would have time to harvest this marvelous energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five pieces of turtle shell have united. You know what to do now?&rdquo; Ganji gritted his teeth, looking at Feng Rao indignantly. &ldquo;It was a good business but you guys have messed everything up. And now no one will get anything from this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blame me?&rdquo; Feng Rao made a cold expression. &ldquo;Why do you blame me? Didn&rsquo;t you want to kill me and steal the treasures? All of you are no good. No one has the right to blame the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, Ganji and Pang Jia quieted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea what to do since the five pieces have united. Alright, if you have any good solutions to get through those fatal beams to be close to the turtle shell, you can try. You can be sure that I won&rsquo;t attack you at this moment.&rdquo; Feng Rao pondered for a while. She was a little bit upset, though. She looked at the turtle shell while she wiped a flock of her long hair.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was standing fifty meters away from Han Di&rsquo;s body, frowning and looking at that area.</p>
<p>The five pieces of turtle shell were adjoined perfectly with each other. Halos supported the shell, lifted it up and spun it. Immense magical energy shot out unceasingly from it. No one wished to come close and touch it.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia looked at the turtle shell greedily. Their eyes couldn&rsquo;t conceal their dark desire. However, although Feng Rao had said that, they didn&rsquo;t have any solution besides to stare and think.</p>
<p>Feng Rao didn&rsquo;t answer. She hesitated for a while before moving towards Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Feeling Feng Rao coming close to him, Shi Yan slightly knitted his brows. He accumulated his energy and put up his guard cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back to me. Han Di&rsquo;s dead. You don&rsquo;t need it anymore.&rdquo; As she could feel Shi Yan&rsquo;s vigilance, Feng Rao stopped walking, looking at him from a far distance. She beamed a faint smile and extended her jade-like arm. The exquisite azure tattoos seemed to be moving on her arm.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia suddenly looked at Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Being astounded for a while, Ganji laughed evilly. &ldquo;Shi Yan, the Thunderbolt Ball is a rank 2 Divine Grade treasure. The lightning and thunder power of this ball is very dense and dangerous. It feels very good to use it and is very effective. You&rsquo;re experienced, I suppose? Do you really want to give it back to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you when I receive something, I would never return it, honestly.&rdquo; Pang Jia also laughed bizarrely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rank 2 Divine Grade treasure. Very useful to enhance your power. You have the lowest realm among us. With that treasure, you will have more support. If you give it back to her, will you be any different from a fool? She used you. She should pay you, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia took turns to give advice to Shi Yan as they wanted to separate him and the woman.</p>
<p>Feng Rao didn&rsquo;t say anything. She just beamed a faint smile and looked at him as if she was waiting for his decision.</p>
<p>Shi Yan also smiled, enjoying the Thunderbolt Ball in his hand. His smile became brighter. He had done something with that Thunderbolt Ball. He looked at Feng Rao and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; Feng Rao parted her lips and smiled. Her eyebrows like the new moon arched slightly. &ldquo;If you like it, I can give it to you. However, I need it to do something. After that, I will give it to you. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman won&rsquo;t take what the other likes. Keep your Thunderbolt Ball.&rdquo; Shi Yan chuckled and flicked his fingers. The Thunderbolt Ball flew out, turning into a blue lightning strike that fell into Feng Rao&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia snorted, their faces malevolent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; Feng Rao retrieved her Thunderbolt Ball. A bright smile appeared on her face. She glared at Ganji and Pang Jia then said, &ldquo;You are the stupid ones. You think your plan is good. Look what you&rsquo;ve done now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia grimaced even more.</p>
<p>Shi Yan looked at Feng Rao seriously. When he saw that the woman didn&rsquo;t check the ball and instead put it into her Fantasy Sky Ring right away, he beamed a sinister smile.</p>
<p>Shi Yan understood well that Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia were the same. She didn&rsquo;t care about him either.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Feng Rao wouldn&rsquo;t have given him the Thunderbolt Ball to aid him in dealing with Han Di. She thought that Shi Yan&rsquo;s real abilities couldn&rsquo;t harm Han Di without the ball.</p>
<p>And it was also the reason why Feng Rao had never thought that he could do something to her Thunderbolt Ball, which made her not check it.</p>
<p>It was an instinctive disdain.</p>
<p>A warrior at the Third Sky of King God Realm would naturally not put a warrior two skies lower than him in his eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t that they weren&rsquo;t careful; they just didn&rsquo;t know how morbidly formidable Shi Yan was.</p>
<p>The other three considered each other the strongest enemies. And Shi Yan, in their eyes, was just a foolish kid who knew nothing and couldn&rsquo;t influence this battle.</p>
<p>To their disdain, Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t angry. Quite the contrary, he felt happy. If someone doesn&rsquo;t know your real strength, he will ignore you, which troubles him much later in the battle with you.</p>
<p>Shi Yan accumulated his energy quietly, his visage relaxed. He calmly prepared everything carefully. He wanted to see what these three could do after all.</p>
<p>Chapter 797: Undying Wood</p>
<p>Rainbow light shot out everywhere from the center of the combined five forbidden areas. Gaps between those beams were visible.</p>
<p>Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia stayed hidden in the gaps, looking at the turtle shell with a grim countenance. They started to use their energy to pull it.</p>
<p>However, Feng Rao&rsquo;s sound power and Ganji&rsquo;s Pang Jia&rsquo;s special powers were all useless.</p>
<p>Pang Jia shrank his body ten times. He became just one-tenth of the size of a normal adult. He swayed between the beams to go closer to the shell. Then, he extended his index finger, resizing it to be as small as a needle to inch towards and touch the turtle shell.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when his needle-like index finger approached the hard shell, a strange energy wave shot out. The ceasing light started to change.</p>
<p>A rainbow light shot out like a ribbon, piercing through his index finger.</p>
<p>Pang Jia retreated rapidly. His body was now even smaller than a dwarf. He couldn&rsquo;t help but shiver. When his index finger resumed its normal size, it was broken and bleeding.</p>
<p>Pang Jia was frightened. He didn&rsquo;t dare try anymore, retreating to a place far away and using medicine to apply to his wound. His eyes had a look of distress.</p>
<p>His power was considered to have many advantages among the three of them. However, no matter how careful he was, he still got injured. This frightened him a lot. He didn&rsquo;t dare act rashly anymore.</p>
<p>Ganji and Feng Rao thought of no solutions. Their eyes glued to that strange shell, unable to conceal the desires in their heart. Anyway, they had no solution for this headache-given matter.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was still musing. He looked like he wasn&rsquo;t planning to take any action besides simply glaring at that shell.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what it was but he knew for sure that the halo twirling around that hard shell could pierce through any kind of matter. Even if he got his God Body at its greatest peak, he didn&rsquo;t dare try.</p>
<p>After a while, they had made no progress. Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia frowned, raked through their Fantasy Sky Rings, and criticizing each other. Their words became more malignant and sinister. They seemed like they would burst out fighting each other any time soon.</p>
<p>The exquisite azure drawings on Feng Rao&rsquo;s smooth, white skin started to move when she was enraged, giving her a bizarre beauty.</p>
<p>Although Shi Yan was busy, he looked nonchalant. He eyed the woman, Ganji, and Pang Jia without haste.</p>
<p>Compared to the other three, he looked more like an onlooker, someone who didn&rsquo;t care about what the results would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the jade token works,&rdquo; Feng Rao pondered for a while. She seemed to have something in her mind. She rose her hand then grabbed something.</p>
<p>The cube stone on Han Di&rsquo;s body flew up immediately, falling precisely into her jade palm, combining with the one she had.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia got it. They frowned and threw her their square stones with a dark face.</p>
<p>Shi Yan watched and found that their four square stones were exactly the same as Jiang Ge&rsquo;s stone. They seemed to make a key. The four stones combined to reveal the shape of a key.</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s group had their eyes brighten up as if they had finally found a solution they had never thought possible. They became excited looking at Shi Yan and shouting in unison. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Argh. . .&rdquo; Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t help but beam a forced smile. He shook his head under their intense looks, showed them his hands and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiang Ge didn&rsquo;t give you the stone?&rdquo; Feng Rao&rsquo;s beautiful eyes sparkled brutally. She was enraged. She thought that they could solve it finally but now the problem was Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia darkened their faces. The murderous intent in their eyes was obvious.</p>
<p>Three different auras slithered like invisible toxic snakes surrounding Shi Yan. If he made a wrong move, they would kill him instantly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was stern inwardly. He couldn&rsquo;t hold his snort. He was staying the furthest from the source of the rainbow light. Shi Yan moved quickly to the gap nearest to him. He gathered his energy to prepare for a battle with the rage of the other three.</p>
<p>Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia had laid all of their hopes on the cube stones. Now they had four stones connected to each other and formed the shape of a key. It just needed one more piece to complete this key, which seemed to be able to open the way to that hard shell.</p>
<p>The only exit was erased by Shi Yan&rsquo;s words. Of course, they were enraged.</p>
<p>Their looks with the brutal intentions as thick as black ink were aimed at Shi Yan coldly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s God Soul suddenly got extremely agitated. He continually urged space power in his Sea of Consciousness. Flows of Soul Consciousness with space energy twirled around his Sea of Consciousness and covered his soul altar.</p>
<p>The surging agitation gradually vanished. The soul confinement that the other three planted on his soul was ineffective.</p>
<p>A strange light sparkled in Feng Rao&rsquo;s exquisite and eccentric face. Her eyes blinked as she stooped and sighed. &ldquo;Not bad. You can dodge our soul confinement. No wonder why you aren&rsquo;t afraid at all. Seems like we&rsquo;ve underestimated you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have it, really. Even if you kill me, it&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled miserably. &ldquo;What about getting out there and bringing Jiang Ge back here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;F*ck it! Do you think we have so much time? Do you think you can get out of the Extreme Purgatory Field that easy?&rdquo; Pang Jia couldn&rsquo;t help but scold loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shi Yan, that is the Undying Wood. It is not the turtle shell like you thought.&rdquo; Shortly, a soul popped up in his Sea of Consciousness. The Vermilion Bird True Flame was talking to him. &ldquo;I have the Vermilion Bird&rsquo;s knowledge. The Undying Wood&rsquo;s really marvelous. It&rsquo;s the top treasure of the Wood Class in the Five Elements. It&rsquo;s tougher than the toughest metal. There&rsquo;s no sharp weapon that could cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undying Wood?&rdquo; Shi Yan was cautious discreetly. He was moved. &ldquo;Besides its hardness, what are its other characteristics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange treasure Undying Wood of the Wood Class has the magical but natural wooden texture. With this magical texture, the blacksmith with supernatural power could portray the formations according to that wood texture to create the most unimaginable and subtle abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I approach it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you take in a large amount of Wood Essence Qi in the last barrier you&rsquo;ve just broken? Use that Essence Qi to cover your entire body and try,&rdquo; the Vermilion Bird True Flame told him. &ldquo;My information comes from the Vermilion Bird before he left the Grace Mainland. We don&rsquo;t have deeper knowledge about the Undying Wood yet so it is not clear enough I heard that the Undying Wood comes from a divine tree after it became rotten. But this piece isn&rsquo;t rotten so it&rsquo;s called Undying Wood. Extremely strange, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Undying Wood comes from a rotten divine tree. The tree was rotten but its wood wasn&rsquo;t rotten. What kind of logic was that?</p>
<p>Shi Yan was surprised. He listened to the heaven flame attentively. He suddenly had a strange feeling that the creation of the Undying Wood contained some truth of Nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wood texture barrier you&rsquo;ve broken simulates the natural texture of the Undying Wood. Since you&rsquo;ve got it magically, can you condense it and use it to cover your body entirely? At least, you can cover one arm of yours to touch it?&rdquo; continued the Vermilion Bird True Flame.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was astounded for a while. He instinctively tried as he was told. He urged and drew the Wood Essence Qi from his flesh and bone, trying to pour it into one arm.</p>
<p>His arm became brown and gray just like a dried tree trunk. It looked a bit strange to him.</p>
<p>At this moment, the sinister looks of Feng Rao, Pang Jia, and Ganji still gazed at Shi Yan tightly. The murderous intent was so heavy that it could burst in any minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act rashly you guys,&rdquo; Shi Yan suddenly shouted, his face solemn. &ldquo;Wait a minute and give me time to try. I&rsquo;m a blacksmith. I have knowledge of formations and barriers. This is why I was able to break the barriers faster than you guys. Yeah, it&rsquo;s the barrier that creates those fatal light beams. Let me try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s group halted, their faces astounded.</p>
<p>They knew something was happening in that central area so they knew it wasn&rsquo;t the barrier like Shi Yan had said. They doubted his words.</p>
<p>However, they were shaken upon hearing that Shi Yan wanted to try. They thought that in the worst case, Shi Yan would be crushed into pieces in that source of light. In that case, they didn&rsquo;t need to do anything to erase him and they could even have a chance to observe the bursting energy of that fatal source.</p>
<p>The three agreed tacitly. They stopped gathering energy and just gave a snort while watching Shi Yan move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eye on the three for me!&rdquo; A thought was sent and the heaven flames started to fly around his soul altar. They accumulated energy and waited for a chance.</p>
<p>More Wood Essence Qi was urged out of his body and created a layer covering him entirely. Shortly, he became a shriveled tree log, his entire body brown and gray like a rotten tree.</p>
<p>In this special form, he carefully touched the light beams next to him.</p>
<p>Sizzle Sizzle Sizzle!</p>
<p>Contact between the light and his finger created strange sounds. The sharp light seemed to be softened magically. The tremendous piercing power vanished!</p>
<p>Shi Yan was excited. A bright smile hung on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>Ganji, Feng Rao, and Pang Jia noticed his moves. Divine light sparkled gloriously in their eyes as they gawked disbelievingly.</p>
<p>Shi Yan laughed contentedly while shooting like a brown light towards the Undying Wood. He didn&rsquo;t bother with the scorching looks of the other three burning his back.</p>
<p>Beams of light shining on his body were all softened. When the steam arose on all over his body, Shi Yan descended right over the Undying Wood. He didn&rsquo;t say anything but grabbed it fiercely.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of rainbow beams disappeared into the Undying Wood at the moment his fingers touched the piece of wood.</p>
<p>The Undying Wood became simple and natural but it was as heavy as a mountain. The subtle, exquisite wood texture of this piece looked like a strange but magical star map.</p>
<p>Pang Jia, Ganji, and Feng Rao&rsquo;s eyes reddened instantly. They didn&rsquo;t say anything but released their God Domains, dashing toward Shi Yan at their max speed.</p>
<p>Three waves of formidable energy swept over like three meteors shooting across the sky with an imposing momentum.</p>
<p>Rumble Rumble Rumble Rumble!</p>
<p>Shattering and collapsing sounds echoed from the five palaces. The Earth cracked. The mountain shook and collapsed.</p>
<p>The barrier covering this area was torn apart. Immense gray mist flooded into the place furiously. The strange magnetic field of the Extreme Purgatory Field vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Chapter 798: Star Map</p>
<p>The five pieces of Undying Wood had joined and created a strange star map. Shi Yan skimmed through it and found a small dot that looked like the mark of the treasure on a treasure map.</p>
<p>As he had been with Zi Yao for a while in the Glorious Amethyst Star, Shi Yan had a general knowledge of the Raging Flame Star Area&rsquo;s layout.</p>
<p>At first glance, he knew that the marked spot was near the border of the Land of God Punishment and the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce. It was the most magical area of the land where people could hide from the Soul Consciousness searching.</p>
<p>Besides the Lonesome Dead Territory, the Land of God Punishment had some more special areas similar to the Lonesome Dead Territory. The location on the map was such a similar spot. However, he hadn&rsquo;t had enough time to study carefully because Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia stormed towards him, trying to snatch the star map in his hand.</p>
<p>While snorting, Shi Yan immediately put the star map into his Fantasy Sky Ring. Seeing the palace collapsing and the barriers disappearing, he made up his mind quickly to use the Star power. His Soul Consciousness cooperated with space power, urging all of his energy. Just like a flow of shooting light, Shi Yan rocketed into the sky of the Extreme Purgatory Field.</p>
<p>The barrier shattered. All the energy sealing the Extreme Purgatory Field disappeared. There was nothing constraining them now.</p>
<p>A flow of light shot directly up into the sky. Shortly, it disappeared from the gray cloud layer of the Purgatory Star, heading towards the immense star area.</p>
<p>Beneath him were Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia chasing close after. A flame burned angrily in their eyes. They all escaped the Extreme Purgatory Field entering the dead, quiet outer space.</p>
<p>Those three people had dreamed of the star map for a long time. They had invested a lot of time and effort. At the very last moment, Shi Yan had interfered and taken what should have been theirs. They could hardly accept this.</p>
<p>Although they all had the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, Shi Yan&rsquo;s star power was magical. He was moving forward in the trajectories of the stars, making curve after curve in outer space. At the same time, he urged space energy to cross spaces in a short time. Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia couldn&rsquo;t get to him immediately. They could only stare as his figure disappeared further and further. Rage surged in their hearts.</p>
<p>While the four silhouettes flew away from the Extreme Purgatory Field, the guard of this special prison staying on the other side of the star spotted them and the commotion they were stirring.</p>
<p>Shortly, the Jailor spread his order. War chariots flew out one by one, entering dark outer space.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purgatory Field was a magical area of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation. It was the training place for the new generation of experts. And now it suddenly had a commotion that made the Jailor freak out. He hastened to report Du Tian Le on the event.</p>
<p>The war chariots of the Extreme Purgatory Field turned in the sky before moving into outer space. Experts guarding the planet came to the Extreme Purgatory Field. Seeing the earth shaking and mountain collapsing in that area, their faces darkened. They knew something really troublesome had just happened and it was out of their ability to control it.</p>
<p>When Du Tian Le got the news, he was frightened and indignant at the same time. He came there at his max speed and reported what happened to the owner of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation &ndash; Du Tian Ji.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Du Tian Ji seemed to seclude and cultivate. Du Tian Le&rsquo;s report sank like a rock into the sea. He received no response. This made Du Tian Le more anxious. He constantly ordered the Jailor to pursue and capture the escapees.</p>
<p>It was very dark and cold in outer space. Shi Yan squinted while his soul altar was spinning, urging the Star power Upanishad and Space power Upanishad to continue its powers at the same time.</p>
<p>Waves of space energy were rippling through his body. They seemed to be the doors that connected space to space shortly. His figure pierced through waves like a meteor. He was moving so fast that Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia could only sense him vaguely. It was going to be very difficult to catch him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F*ck it! We were all wrong! We&rsquo;ve been watching that area for a long time and finally, we let that kid take it all!&rdquo; Ganji cursed, his face dark and grimaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I catch that brat, I will skin him alive and draw his bones out!&rdquo; Pang Jia looked ferocious, talking through his gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Feng Rao stayed quiet. She was gloomy as resentment filled her heart. She had thought that she had used Shi Yan well. However, everything went the opposite of what she planned and it was now out of her reach. She couldn&rsquo;t imagine why Shi Yan at his First Sky of King God Realm could escape with such speed in the star sea. He was so fast that they could only keep up in sensing him. They could never come closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base. His energy should be limited. Since he is running madly like that, he will drain his energy fast,&rdquo; Ganji said after contemplating for a while with a malicious look. &ldquo;Just let him be content flying for a while. I don&rsquo;t think he can drop us in the end. Wait until his energy is drained considerably. Then, we will be able to catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. The First Sky of King God Realm has a limited endurance. He can&rsquo;t keep using his energy for a long time,&rdquo; Pang Jia nodded. &ldquo;As long as we know the direction he is going, I think we can capture him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful. When we flew out of the Purgatory Star, I saw the war chariots flying out. Seems like the Jailor of the Extreme Purgatory Field reported the situation and sent someone up here.&rdquo; Feng Rao wasn&rsquo;t as confident as they were. &ldquo;Those who belong to the Dark Firmament Divine Nation aren&rsquo;t easy to deal with. We shouldn&rsquo;t let them spot us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, Ganji and Pang Jia held solemn faces. They all knew how intimidating the experts of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation were.</p>
<p>The three of them immediately concealed their auras and retrieved part of their living energy fluctuations. They squeezed their jade tokens to stimulate the magical energy in it.</p>
<p>Those jade tokens weren&rsquo;t only effective in the Extreme Purgatory Field. After they left the place, they could still prevent the sensing ability of the warriors. After they had released the energy in their jade tokens, their auras and life energy faded away. They became invisible in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Warriors standing in the Purgatory Star&rsquo;s war chariots couldn&rsquo;t sense anything using their Soul Consciousness.</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, the war chariots scattered and started to search on a larger scale. Thus, their formation was stretched. Although the war chariots used the energy of divine crystals they couldn&rsquo;t be faster than the Third Sky of King God Realm experts when they used the surging energy in their bodies.</p>
<p>Gradually, those war chariots were left far behind Pang Jia, Ganji, and Feng Rao.</p>
<p>Shi Yan, of course, understood that Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia weren&rsquo;t easy to mess with. He didn&rsquo;t dare pause using the powers of his Star and Space Upanishad created in his soul altar. His flying was now like a light arrow.</p>
<p>As he flew at max speed, he couldn&rsquo;t check his location on the map. He just knew vaguely that he was heading toward the Land of God Punishment and the Nine Star Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>This star map should have been created by the former Imperial Master of the Dark Firmament Divine Nation a long time ago. The marked location should contain an earth-shattering secret. Otherwise, Feng Rao&rsquo;s group wouldn&rsquo;t have spent several hundred years hiding just to take this map. They sure wanted to get the secret of this map.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what the secret was or its significance, but if this thing had fallen into his hands, he wouldn&rsquo;t hand it out easily.</p>
<p>This was especially true for Ganji, Pang Jia, and Feng Rao. None of them had good intentions towards him. Feng Rao had used him to deal with Han Di so she could have a free hand to grab the star map.</p>
<p>Shi Yan wasn&rsquo;t a nice man. Since he was used and now he knew he had a big secret in that star map. Why would he not take it anyway?</p>
<p>Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t really bother with the dead pursuit by the three experts at the Third Sky of King God Realm. He didn&rsquo;t think that they could take his life easily.</p>
<p>Staying in that forbidden land and breaking layer after layer of barriers, the understanding of natural powers and his powers Upanishad was carved deeper into his mind.</p>
<p>Shi Yan believed that if he was given time to comprehend those principles and had abundant energy, breaking to the new level, the Second Sky of King God Realm, wouldn&rsquo;t be such a tough task.</p>
<p>He had this confidence. He was confident that when he reached the Second Sky of King God Realm, even if Ganji, Feng Rao, and Pang Jia joined hands to fight him, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch him.</p>
<p>Since he was confident, he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of them anymore. He sneered and accelerated.</p>
<p>The Essence Qi from Han Di&rsquo;s corpse was collected and refined in his acupuncture points. Gradually, energy started to gush out.</p>
<p>Shi Yan cracked a smile, guiding those beams of mysterious energy in his body. He was moving even faster.</p>
<p>If it was in the past, when the mysterious martial spirit was refining the Essence Qi from the dead, Shi Yan couldn&rsquo;t be distracted because he would risk negative feelings backfiring on him.</p>
<p>However, after the period of breaking barriers, his soul became steady. Thus, the negative feelings didn&rsquo;t affect him much. His mind was still calm and sound.</p>
<p>With the supplemental energy, his Essence Qi was refilled the second time. His moving speed wasn&rsquo;t reduced by energy shortage.</p>
<p>Feng Rao, Ganji, and Pang Jia were trying their best to find him in the galaxy. Half a month had passed quietly.</p>
<p>Although they were full of confidence, the three were now exhausted. They thought that since Shi Yan had only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base, he would slow down early from loss of endurance.</p>
<p>They were all wrong.</p>
<p>After half a month, they had consumed half of their energy. They had to slow down.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s speed didn&rsquo;t change. It actually increased significantly. The other three were exhausted. Their face grimaced even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that motherf*cker have only the First Sky of King God Realm cultivation base? Were we all wrong?&rdquo; Ganji panted, talking foul-mouthed. This was the sign that they used energy excessively.</p>
<p>Pang Jia gritted his teeth, his eyes like that of an angry ghost. He breathed heavily. &ldquo;If I can catch him, I will torture him to death! This brat is tough enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems we got tricked. We thought he couldn&rsquo;t be a threat and turns out he the one who got it all.&rdquo; Feng Rao regretted it too much she wanted to kill herself.</p>
<p>At this moment, the three of them didn&rsquo;t dare to look down on Shi Yan anymore. Being able to move in outer space fifteen days continually at fast speed and his energy wasn&rsquo;t running out yet, who has ever met such a First Sky of King God Realm warrior?</p>
<p>They cursed as their hearts sank. They now didn&rsquo;t consider Shi Yan a small character anymore. They were vigilant discreetly. They thought that when they saw Shi Yan, they had to pull themselves altogether, and they shouldn&rsquo;t be careless leading to capsize their boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Feng Rao suddenly shouted in awe. &ldquo;That brat isn&rsquo;t good now. His speed has slowed down two times. Fast! Faster! We must get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia put on the excited visage.</p>
<p>Chapter 799: Bare The Fangs</p>
<p>On a massive floating meteorite, gray-brown clusters of rock scattered. This place was bleak, lonesome, and cold. No living energy fluctuation could be found.</p>
<p>Shi Yan paled, revealing that he was exhausted as he consumed too much energy. A gleam of insignificant desperation crossed his eyes.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia had their faces brightened up. They couldn&rsquo;t hold in their sinister laughter while walking towards Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Feng Rao was careful. First, she frowned and surveyed the surroundings. Seeing no barrier or formation, she exhaled in relief but still put up guard. She sneered, &ldquo;So, no more running?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan forced a smile. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t run any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, you do have guts. You dare pluck out the tiger&rsquo;s tooth. You dare be greedy and steal what is ours. You don&rsquo;t even know how to treasure your life.&rdquo; Pang Jia grinned fiendishly, taking action first.</p>
<p>Ganji slowly approached, launching his God Domain. As soon as the hundred-time Gravitational Field appeared, it pressed the rocks which cracked and exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for you.&rdquo; Shi Yan acted as if he was really frightened and that he couldn&rsquo;t dodge his fate. He threw the star map made of the Undying Wood without any hesitation. The thing shot across the area, flying toward the middle area between the other three.</p>
<p>Ganji, Pang Jia, and Feng Rao showed their greed. They jolted immediately to grab the thing.</p>
<p>Feng Rao was still vigilant. Her plump lips curled a cold curve as she threw the Thunderbolt Ball out.</p>
<p>Immediately, several thousand azure lightning strikes slithered towards Shi Yan like a pit of snakes.</p>
<p>Shi Yan seemed to know the power of the Thunderbolt Ball. He paled and retreated.</p>
<p>However, since those several thousand beams of lighting were connected directly to Feng Rao and her pure energy in her body, it was hard to dodge them all.</p>
<p>Although Shi Yan was fast, he still received ten or more strikes. He screamed painfully. His God Body was charred with thick burns. It seemed his God Body had been exhausted and now it received even more wounds. Shi Yan was put to the point where he couldn&rsquo;t hold it anymore. The lightning struck him out of the place into the cold, starry space.</p>
<p>As Ganji and Pang Jia saw Feng Rao attacking Shi Yan and how he got hurt by the lightning and fell off the meteorite, they didn&rsquo;t focus on killing him. They hurled themselves towards the star map.</p>
<p>Before they had come here, they had a plan. Right when they saw Shi Yan, they would kill him first. However, when they saw Shi Yan throwing the star map out, they forgot their initial plan. Greed had dominated their minds. They wanted to take the star map at any cost.</p>
<p>Uncontrollably, Ganji and Pang Jia immediately attacked each other without showing mercy or politeness.</p>
<p>When Feng Rao saw Shi Yan get hit by the Thunderbolt Ball, she didn&rsquo;t dare waste time. She understood that Shi Yan could dodge his death for now but it didn&rsquo;t mean that he could avoid their ears and eyes everywhere. Thus, she decided to join the battle to compete for the star map.</p>
<p>As they were all at the Third Sky of King God Realm, when any of them grabbed the star map, he or she just needed to flee away at their max speed, and the others couldn&rsquo;t catch up with him or her.</p>
<p>Thus, whoever touched the star map first would gain a significant advantage.</p>
<p>At this moment, the three brutal villains at the Third Sky of King God Realm burst out the deadly battle for a star map that hid a tremendous secret. They attacked each other furiously and mercilessly. Their powers were urged to the acme as they hated the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t kill whoever went at the fastest speed to grab the star map first.</p>
<p>Staying on another meteorite in the dark sky, Shi Yan&rsquo;s eyes were cold and sinister. His stiff mouth showed his cold and harsh intentions. He gritted his teeth and brushed off the azure lightning strikes on his body.</p>
<p>Each of these azure lightning strikes was sharp and powerful. They cut his body fiercely and left fine cuts on his skin.</p>
<p>Since Feng Rao had the Third Sky of King God Realm and her Thunderbolt Ball was a Divine Grade treasure, Shi Yan hardly bore its attacks.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his power was refined and his God Body had been quenched many times. Now it had the toughness that normal people couldn&rsquo;t even imagine. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t get hurt badly. He just needed to urge his Dead power Upanishad to brush them off.</p>
<p>Shortly after, he destroyed all the lightning strikes that had managed to get in his body.</p>
<p>He had spent ten drops of Immortal Demon Blood to heal his bleeding cuts. His wounds healed quickly.</p>
<p>Rumble Rumble Rumble!</p>
<p>Furious energy waves swarmed over from the massive meteorite in front of him. Shi Yan understood that the three experts were trying to kill each other. For that star map, they demonstrated their mightiest powers.</p>
<p>The vicious intent in his eyes became darker. He stooped and sneered, but didn&rsquo;t hasten to show himself yet.</p>
<p>The three of them were the experts with a greater realm than his. Also, their powers were strange and supernatural. If he decided to be stubborn and played with them one-on-three, he would die a pathetic death.</p>
<p>After half a month of running madly, the other three had consumed a lot of their energy. As they were attacking each other crazily, no matter what the result was, their powers would be weakened badly. When their battled ended, Shi Yan could save a lot of efforts.</p>
<p>Thus, he had to bear Feng Rao&rsquo;s attack to erase the others&rsquo; doubts. He had given them the thought that he was hurt badly and that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create any trouble later.</p>
<p>Indeed, as soon as Feng Rao saw him get hit by the lightning strikes bloodily, her tense nerves had been relaxed. When she saw Ganji and Pang Jia fighting with each other, she didn&rsquo;t bother eradicating him. Instead, she joined the battle immediately.</p>
<p>If Feng Rao had been more careful, she would have flown out there to check Shi Yan&rsquo;s real condition. She wouldn&rsquo;t have been so incautious.</p>
<p>Too bad she got another wrong guess of Shi Yan&rsquo;s abilities.</p>
<p>Shi Yan swallowed the broad bean-like pellets and medicines. Shi Yan hid quietly by the meteorite, trying his best to recover quickly.</p>
<p>Ear-splitting explosions reverberated. Energy pressed the rock which exploded, shooting out of the massive meteorite near him. Seeing such scenes, Shi Yan felt excited. He laughed continually as he waited for a chance to take action.</p>
<p>The medicinal efficacy melted in his body, turning into the immense vitality that nurtured his internal organs. Half a month of running crazily couldn&rsquo;t really wear him out. With the Essence Qi from Han Di&rsquo;s dead body, his condition was much better than what the other three saw.</p>
<p>Pretending to be weak to lure the enemies and giving them chances to hurt him were all part of his plans.</p>
<p>Everything was playing according to his script. Shi Yan waited patiently and just sneered while waiting for the battle on the meteorite to end. He would wait until the sounds of the fierce battle stopped.</p>
<p>Those explosions were terrible. They had shattered the entire meteorite. From his location, he could see massive holes there. The meteorite near him crumpled. Rocks shot out everywhere. The battle taking place over there must have been formidable.</p>
<p>Shi Yan urged his energy to cover his entire body, hiding and moving toward the battle area.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Giant rocks under Ganji&rsquo;s manipulation were bombarding aimlessly. Each of those rocks was around a mu of land. When they curved in the air, the energy they contained was so intimidating.</p>
<p>Pang Jia shrank his body to one-tenth of an adult size. He seemed to be cooperating with Ganji to fight Feng Rao.</p>
<p>The star map lay still where Shi Yan had thrown it. It seemed like no one had touched it yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AHHHHHHH!</p>
<p>Feng Rao cried, the entire power of her body fusing with her sound, turning into an invisible spear that smashed Ganji&rsquo;s rocks into crumbles.</p>
<p>The three of them were entangling each other and draining their energy rapidly. After spending half a month running like crazy without a short break to recover, 70%-80% of their power had been consumed. At this moment, their God Domains weren&rsquo;t as strong as they used to be. Their fighting competencies had been decreased one level.</p>
<p>From what Shi Yan could see, Feng Rao was closest to him. He could see that her exquisite face was pale, which was the sign of consuming a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia were also worn out. However, they all clenched their jaws and resisted as they thought that if they could kill the others, they would be the ultimate winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gravity Lock!</p>
<p>Ganji suddenly shouted. The Gravitational Field covering his body shrank before bursting out much stronger.</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s body floating in the air sank down as if she got a whole mountain put on her shoulders. She felt helter-skelter.</p>
<p>Pang Jia shrank his body, ambushing an area. His arms were exposed like two slithering, boneless snakes. A flow of cold and malicious energy immediately attacked Feng Rao&rsquo;s tender body. Feng Rao shuddered, her figure became more unstable.</p>
<p>Several hundred rocks, each of them as big as a mu of land, fell directly on Feng Rao and buried her.</p>
<p>Ganji and Pang Jia cheered. They didn&rsquo;t care if Feng Rao was still alive or not and hurriedly flew to that star map. A minute ago, they had joined hands to deal with the woman, and now they started to attack each other. Different energies impacted in the void. Light shot out dazzlingly above the star map.</p>
<p>Pang Jia was weaker. He spat out a mouthful of blood. His shrunk God Body shattered under the impact. His eyes became empty.</p>
<p>Ganji laughed crazily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still an amateur compared to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While talking, he extended his hand to grab the star map. He was so contented thinking that his two-hundred-year of effort had been rewarded marvelously.</p>
<p>However, the buzzing hissing echoed right at this moment.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>The three blinding lights flashed then disappeared. They then stabbed Ganji&rsquo;s hand, piercing through and pinned it on a rock next to the star map.</p>
<p>At the same moment, an imposing punch created by starlight descended grumblingly like a mallet of the Archangel, covering Pang Jia&rsquo;s flying body.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>Sounds of breaking bones echoed from Pang Jia&rsquo;s body. His God Body exploded. His bones jutted out from the mess of his bloody flesh while his face was covered in blood. He was dying under this stealthy attack.</p>
<p>The massive starlight punch was condensed by countless star dots. After it finished its stealthy attack, it didn&rsquo;t stop but continued to pound on Feng Rao, who was still buried under so many rocks.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Massive rocks burst off in the furious screams of Feng Rao. The starlight punch had made a formidable hole on this meteorolite.</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s beautiful body was exposed in the middle of the deep pit. She was wounded. Blood and the delicate tattoos on her body created a red, eccentric and inspiring drawing.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s cold and harsh body appeared like a ghost next to Pang Jia. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate at all as he gathered space power covering Pang Jia who didn&rsquo;t have a bit of energy to move a finger now. He then cut Pang Jia&rsquo;s limbs cut and his soul altar exploded shortly after.</p>
<p>As Pang Jia had just died, Shi Yan dashed through the place, approaching Ganji. He laughed fiendishly, baring his bloodthirsty fangs.</p>
<p>Chapter 800: Cut Dead</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s ambush on Pang Jia and Feng Rao were deadly, particularly to Feng Rao who was pressed deeper into her pit so that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to wiggle out of there. These serial actions actually happened faster than a slow talk.</p>
<p>Ganji was pinned in the hard rock by the three Bone Thorns that pierced through his hand. Seeing Shi Yan gliding through the air to approach him, Ganji felt an extreme rage and pain. At the same time, he wanted to vomit blood.</p>
<p>No matter how hard he had imagined, he couldn&rsquo;t predict Shi Yan&rsquo;s dark and vicious mind. Shi Yan had condensed a chain from starlight to bind him tightly. Ganji discolored.</p>
<p>Crack Crack! He tried to urge his energy without caring about his bleeding hand. The Gravitational Field was rising one more time.</p>
<p>Two hundred times heavier gravity!</p>
<p>Shi Yan sank under the Gravitational Field effects while dashing forward. He fell toward Ganji.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, you court death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji roared indignantly. A massive rock under his feet flew out instantly like a cannonball, shelling Shi Yan grumblingly.</p>
<p>Boom Boom Boom!</p>
<p>The starlight chains thrust through that massive rock. Chipped rocks shot out massively.</p>
<p>Shi Yan stood like a mighty storm inside the shower of rock, his face cold and grating. His God Domain changed all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Space Confinement!</p>
<p>The rocks that curved and exploded in the air were suddenly suspended in the air. They stayed still strangely in the void.</p>
<p>Even Ganji with his Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base and his magical power was affected. He could only stare at Shi Yan who came closer as the energy in his body stopped circulating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ganji faced the sky and screamed. His face reddened as he furiously urged his power to break the Space Confinement. Ganji&rsquo;s Essence Qi condensed into the light blades that shot up into the sky from his body, aimed at Shi Yan. Shi Yan&rsquo;s face remained unchanged. While he was hovering in the sky, his powers Upanishad changed again. A slit was torn near the horizon, engulfing countless light blades that shot out from Ganji&rsquo;s body. With an imposing momentum, Shi Yan changed his God Domain a second time.</p>
<p>Shining massive hand seals as big as the doors pressed down, bombarding Ganji.</p>
<p>Boom Boom Boom!</p>
<p>The Dead Seals pounding on Ganji&rsquo;s body were like giant hammers. His God Body had many concave spots. He became extremely exhausted.</p>
<p>As the hand seals contained the mysteries of Death, as soon as they hit Ganji&rsquo;s God Body, they immediately started wreaking havoc on his bodily functions, preventing him from gathering his Essence Qi. The old man could only attempt to dodge with futile attempts.</p>
<p>Ganji, Pang Jia, and Feng Rao spent half a month strenuously chasing after him without any pause to refill their energy. Right when they arrived at this meteorite, the three had engaged in a battle, which was also the second time they had to use massive amounts of energy.</p>
<p>After being ambushed, one of Ganji&rsquo;s hands was useless now. Shi Yan&rsquo;s Dead Seals had shelled him badly. Eventually, Ganji was hurt severely.</p>
<p>The vitality in his body was running out under the Dead energy invasion. Ganji&rsquo;s face and God Body paled like a paper sheet. Blood trickled from the corners of his mouth. He was distressed.</p>
<p>Shi Yan hadn&rsquo;t shown even a hint of his mercy. His thought flickered and the wheezing sound of the three Bone Thorns arose again.</p>
<p>Shi Yan was gathering and condensing the Dead energy unceasingly together with the negative energy. Massive Dead Seals appeared in the air one more time. They looked more like the evil eyes gazing at Ganji. They pressed down with a loud crash.</p>
<p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh!</p>
<p>The whistle of the three Bone Thorns was so ear-piercingly loud that it felt like it could even stir up people&rsquo;s souls. It made Ganji&rsquo;s his heart crack.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack! As the Dead Seals were pressing down, the area where Ganji was lying looked like a block of tofu under a harsh impact. Chipped rocks became powder, scattering with the wind. The light cage Ganji was trying to maintain remained deformed, revealing his pale God Body.</p>
<p>The Bone Thorns thrust into Ganji&rsquo;s chest, smashing his internal organs. His broken bones and pieces of intestines splashed out from his body. Ganji was completely damaged under this strike. His God Domain disappeared, and the hundred times heavier gravity Gravitational Field vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk!&rdquo; Ganji screamed. He finally expressed true fear. He faced the sky and cried. &ldquo;Give me time to talk. We can negotiate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The massive starlight mallet pounded from the sky like a meteor falling into the Earth. It hit Ganji right at his chest. Right when he finished, his God Body couldn&rsquo;t hold it anymore. It exploded shortly. Cut limbs shot out as his body fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. You have the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base. I can&rsquo;t afford to be reckless.&rdquo; Shi Yan finally said something as he landed by Ganji. The three Bone Thorns spun around him like three lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Although Ganji&rsquo;s God Body was destroyed, his soul altar wasn&rsquo;t shattered. In this given circumstance, he knew that he couldn&rsquo;t resist Shi Yan anymore. Ganji didn&rsquo;t hesitate, making his soul altar fly out in an attempt to escape into outer space to preserve his God Soul.</p>
<p>As long as his Soul Seal hadn&rsquo;t been damaged, when his God Body was destroyed, he had two options, of which he could choose to find a host and cultivate to restore, or he could use a pregnant woman&rsquo;s baby to resurrect.</p>
<p>As long as his God Soul wasn&rsquo;t eradicated, he still had hope. With the right period of time, it wasn&rsquo;t impossible to regain his current realm.</p>
<p>The soul altar was a magical thing that nothing could compare to. Secret treasures that could break the soul altar were really rare in this world. Ganji&rsquo;s three-tiered soul altar floated like a ghost. He threw a glare at Shi Yan with resentment before running away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s face was icy cold. He touched his glabella and his soul altar flew out. The dark section of the second tier in his soul altar instantly released an eccentric and evil suction force.</p>
<p>Ganji&rsquo;s three-tiered soul altar struggled. His God Soul felt the deepest fear ever. However, no matter how hard he had shaken, the soul altar couldn&rsquo;t escape Shi Yan&rsquo;s black hole-like soul altar. Ganji&rsquo;s soul altar disappeared little by little. Shi Yan&rsquo;s eccentric power Upanishad had swallowed the three-tiered soul altar, leaving nothing.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>At this moment, a strange sound arose. The echoing and energy condensed, shooting towards Shi Yan&rsquo;s chest. As his soul altar had flown out of his body, his God Body became weaker. After the impact of that energy, blood in the shape of a flower bloomed on his chest. A hole was broken open right there.</p>
<p>Crack Crack Crack!</p>
<p>Feng Rao, who used to have no bit of energy remaining, floated up from her pit, wiping away the blood trickles from her mouth and her body. She was stunned, looking at the soul altar floating outside Shi Yan&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Feng Rao had never heard or seen any supernatural powers Upanishad that could engulf the soul altar. This bizarre and malignant power had never appeared in the Raging Flame Star Area before. None of the people there had ever heard about it. Such evil existence made Feng Rao shiver in fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, what kind of evil powers Upanishad are you cultivating?&rdquo; Feng Rao paled, holding the Thunderbolt Ball. She looked quite unnatural. While she was talking, each of her words was fused with her power Upanishad. For the time being, the extremely loud sound reverberated creating a tremendous sound wave swarming toward Shi Yan.</p>
<p>Feng Rao had startled Shi Yan. He didn&rsquo;t think much, immediately calling his soul altar back to his God Body. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t bother with the hole in his chest, using the space power as the foundation to create the God Domain.</p>
<p>Space Blockade!</p>
<p>Each syllable falling in his God Domain was frozen for a while. Shi Yan didn&rsquo;t reply to her. Starlight shot out from his ten fingers, breaking her words with a cold face. Shi Yan conveniently grabbed the star map and put it away. He turned and gazed at Feng Rao, his visage somber. &ldquo;It seems that it is not only me who calculates a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feng Rao&rsquo;s conditions were much better than what Shi Yan had thought. Ganji and Pang Jia had joined hands to attack her, putting her under the mass of rocks; Shi Yan had pounded her using the massive starlight punch.</p>
<p>Although Feng Rao had been hurt continually, at this moment, she looked robust. The energy was circulating vigorously in her body which proved that her Essence Qi was still abundant. This woman&rsquo;s competence was beyond Shi Yan&rsquo;s imagination and it was indeed intimidating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still calculated wrong,&rdquo; Feng Rao&rsquo;s face was dark and cold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve calculated that Ganji and Pang Jia would use tens of thousands of rock to attack me. I would wait under the pile of rocks they had put on me until they finished their battle. Then, I planned on coming out and cleaning it up. I didn&rsquo;t calculate that you could interfere and hurt me the second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Shi Yan angrily. &ldquo;The cunning one should be you. Ganji, Pang Jia, and I had underestimated you. And today, they are dead from your hands, the hands of the one that no one thought was strong enough. You&rsquo;ve gained the upper hand. I think Ganji and Pang Jia couldn&rsquo;t close their eyes even after their death now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shi Yan shook his head mockingly. &ldquo;I have the lowest realm here. If I haven&rsquo;t used tricks, I would have been killed quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hasten to take action. The bleeding hole in his chest had several broken vessels. Once he was engaged in a battle, they would affect his energy circulating. While he was talking, the Immortal Demon Blood was urged to heal the wounds.</p>
<p>It seemed that Feng Rao was also thinking the same thing. She understood that Shi Yan was tough. At the same time, Feng Rao was also wounded. Before she talked to him, she had swallowed pellets and medicines. She was recovering her energy quietly.</p>
<p>She had the Third Sky of King God Realm cultivation base and the pellets she used were all Divine Grade ones. She believed her recovery speed was faster than Shi Yan&rsquo;s. Ganji and Pang Jia were all dead. This area was bleak and isolated. No one would pass by. In other words, she had only one enemy, which was Shi Yan, of course. As long as she could kill Shi Yan, she could finally achieve her goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard about any wicked powers Upanishad that can swallow the soul altar. I&rsquo;m curious. Who are you after all?&rdquo; Feng Rao still maintained a distance from Shi Yan as she was afraid that he would take action when she wasn&rsquo;t vigilant. She was talking while also staying on guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also curious about what&rsquo;s hidden in that star map. Why is it worth f several hundred years of your time and even your life?&rdquo; Shi Yan smiled. The star map emerged on his palm. He cocked his head to look at it before looking back at Feng Rao. &ldquo;Will you explain it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you tell me the method and the power that you used to swallow the soul altar, I will tell you what the star map hides. How does that sound?&rdquo; Feng Rao gently wiped the blood on her body.</p>
<p>Her clothes were short, not enough to conceal the marvelous features of her body. Today, they were even more ragged, exposing her mesmerizing glamour. While she moved her jade-like hand, blue tattoo glistened strangely and beautifully, which were able to sway people&rsquo;s souls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come forward. We should talk.&rdquo; Feng Rao walked forward honestly. While her long legs were moving, her beauty flashed from time to time. Dreamy words came out from her mouth that made people drunk and listen to it.</p>
<p>Shi Yan&rsquo;s soul trembled. He couldn&rsquo;t help but think that she was starting to look hotter. The lustful flame of desire was ignited in the deep place of his heart. He started to gasp. He understood that this woman was attacking him. This was a seducing sound!</p>
