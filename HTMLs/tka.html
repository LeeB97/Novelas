<p>“Follow the boss, and push Happy away!” Finally, someone came out with a suggestion. The Dragon Swordsman was currently chasing after Su Mucheng. There was no way her Launcher could single-handedly lead the boss along forever; the other side would definitely need to send people to block the Dragon Swordsman in order to buy her some time. Couldn’t they then just chase after the boss, while also seizing the chance to roll over Happy?</p>
<p>As a result, they all swarmed, charging forward. On Happy’s side, everyone also swarmed, helping Su Mucheng buy time. They actually managed to utilize the strength of the entire guild.</p>
<p>Both sides thoroughly collided at last. At this moment, Herb Garden, Blue Brook Guild, Blossom Valley, and Void Walk felt that they had a common enemy, surprisingly banding together to fight against Happy. Happy’s players were put on defense, yet they were still unable to withstand the combined offensive of these four guilds. When it came to the strength of normal players, they were inferior to these professional guilds.</p>
<p>“Not good!”</p>
<p>As a result, these guilds bullied Happy with glee, only to suddenly discover that even as Happy’s players risked everything in order to defend their position, the Dragon Swordsman had already been led even further away. Already, they had lost sight of Su Mucheng’s Launcher. The Dragon Swordsman’s silhouette also disappeared behind the mountainside in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Within the four guilds, normal players and pros alike broke into chaos. How could they continue to pay attention to the players from Happy in front of them? So this giant crowd was just a distraction after all. Now, Dragon Swordsman had completely escaped from their frame of view. What corner would he be dragged off to now, to be secretly killed?</p>
<p>Several hundred people hurried chased over, only to realize that the mountain was far too tall, and the earth far too vast. It was as if the Dragon Swordsman had never spawned at all. Where would they even begin to search? The various guilds scattered their troops, dispatching them to go search. As for the pro players, they all seemed a bit lost. They couldn’t figure out how Happy had led the Dragon Swordsman away, just like that …</p>
<p>This would need a thorough tactical analysis.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The pro players naturally pondered the problem from their customary point of view. Just like when they carefully reviewed their opponents strategies after a match, they felt that the situation that had just come to pass should also be analyzed thus.</p>
<p>The online game was extremely easy for pro players since they didn’t have any opponents at their level. However, when an opponent at a high skill level appeared, then the game became quite a bit more complicated than even normal pro matches.</p>
<p>None of the players that had been sent out to search for the Dragon Swordsman had brought back any news, right up until the point where the system announced that the Dragon Swordsman had been slain by Guild Happy. As for where this had occurred, and who had participated, the club guilds surprisingly had no clue.</p>
<p>Everyone present was dejected, gloomily going through the motions of cleaning up in the aftermath. Those who could respawn did so, and any dropped equipment was picked up. In this process, it was difficult to avoid altercations with the other guilds. Still, no large scale confrontations occurred. These players all had habits acquired through years of works, and they normally wouldn’t argue over such small issues. The aftermath of a boss being stolen felt like the aftermath of a professional match, continuing to fight seemed completely pointless. After all, they were all guilds that had grown so large. Killing each other wasn’t going to destroy a guild. For example, after Samsara’s championship victory last year, Blue Brook Guild and Guild Samsara had engaged in a brutal conflict, the fires of war spreading throughout the world of Glory from guild members to wild fans alike. The result? It could only be said that both sides had suffered. After all, this was an online game, a character that died could respawn in the blink of an eye. It was true that equipment could drop, but it could also be picked up, turning into a back and forth cycle of you drop I pick and vice versa. Ultimately, which side profited? Neither, because in the end both sides would suffer losses. Only some lucky passerbyers stood to gain.</p>
<p>Thus, these kinds of battles were something the guild managers tried to avoid at all costs. It was only after important competitions, when the fans felt the need to vent, that the guilds felt compelled to stand firmly beside them. Even though they knew very well that this was not the sensible thing to do, they didn’t really have a choice. They could only think of it as a tax of sorts to the fans.</p>
<p>But now, they had simply lost a wild boss, and their feelings were unlikely to be that strong. The various players all felt a bit like they couldn’t really compete against Ye Xiu, yet the guild leaders were all desensitized at this point. Bringing in the cream of the crop to compete against Ye Xiu, and still losing the wild boss to Happy? Wasn’t this just another day in Glory?</p>
<p>Except … their guild had now brought pro players into the game as well. How come Happy could still so easily carry out their plans? This question was one that the various players from the club guilds couldn’t really find an answer to. In their eyes, pro players were in a completely different league. Whether they hadn’t played the online game for a long time, or had only played a little, Ye Xiu’s presence for the past year and a half was a very valid reason for their failures. But they had completely neglected this battle … just when would they win?</p>
<p>Chapter 1089: Dragon Spine Marrow</p>
<p>“What dropped?”</p>
<p>An elite member from Happy’s guild gave the last hit to kill the boss, Dragon Swordsman. At this moment, he was standing around the Dragon Swordsman’s corpse, looking nervously and expectantly at the materials scattered all over the ground.</p>
<p>Guan Rongfei’s addition to the team put Happy’s equipment development in the right track. Although he wanted to focus more on the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, after being in this line of work for so many years, he was still very clear on what his responsibilities were. All of Happy’s Silver equipment would be developed by him alone.</p>
<p>Guan Rongfei had already come up with several ideas based on Happy’s current materials. And Happy’s vast amounts of Level 75 uncommon materials broadened his horizons. Happy couldn’t compare with Excellent Era in terms of Level 70 and below materials. Happy couldn’t compare with other club guilds in terms of Level 75 normal materials either. However, for Level 75 uncommon materials, Happy instantly stood out. In the Level 75 update, Happy had established their position in the Heavenly Domain wild bosses battlefield. Their allies, Heavenly Justice, Radiant, Parade, and Conquering Clouds, had considerably fatter guild storages as well. And once Wu Chen joined and the guild had gradually grown, the guild drew less and less from the other four guilds, focusing on enriching their own guild’s storage.</p>
<p>For the other guilds, their materials were like a pyramid, the more high-end the material the fewer there was. But for Happy, it couldn’t be said that it was completely the opposite, but at least relatively speaking, their guild storage outdid the other club guilds.</p>
<p>A professional like Guan Rongfei knew very clearly what this implied. This meant that although the overall number of Silver equipment possessed by Happy might not be able to catch up to the powerhouses in a short amount of time, Happy might not lose to any other guild in terms of Level 75 Silver equipment. Don’t look at how the other guilds already had Level 75 Silver equipment, while Happy had none. That was only because Happy didn’t have many Level 70 Silver equipment. Happy also didn’t have a professional like Guan Rongfei working for them.</p>
<p>Wei Chen and Ye Xiu. Wei Chen’s knowledge was mostly limited to his Warlock class. Most of it was through experience. He lacked the theoretical foundation, so it was difficult for him to deduce many things from one case. As for Ye Xiu, his knowledge base was broader than Wei Chen’s, but his time was limited. Just a single Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was already making his head dizzy. He also needed to study strategies, watch over the growth of his players, and deal with in-game matters. He really couldn’t handle everything. As a result, for their Level 75 Silver equipment, Ye Xiu just didn’t bother spending any of his time and efforts into this area.</p>
<p>But with Guan Rongfei here, Ye Xiu was now completely free from this area. With a professional like him, the progress towards their equipment sped up considerably. After Guan Rongfei received the information on the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, he really wanted to hurry up and upgrade this equipment. He had all sorts of other crazy ideas too.</p>
<p>For this Dragon Swordsman, Guan Rongfei had a clear request.</p>
<p>Dragon Spine Marrow!</p>
<p>This was the name of the material that Guan Rongfei requested. Happy originally had four pieces of this material, but Guan Rongfei had expressed that the amount was far from enough.</p>
<p>“Four isn’t enough? How many do you need?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“The umbrella ribs.” Guan Rongfei replied.</p>
<p>“Umbrella ribs…..” Guan Rongfei’s boldness surpassed Ye Xiu’s imagination. The umbrella ribs were the frame that supported the umbrella. It required a rather high quantity of materials. This part had always been made using normal materials. However, Guan Rongfei was domineering. This guy actually wanted to use uncommon materials here. Was he planning on using only Level 75 uncommon materials for every part of the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella?</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too extravagant? Is there a need?” Ye Xiu was a bit doubtful. Uncommon materials were usually used for a few important parts of a Silver equipment. There had never been a case where a Silver equipment was completely made up of only uncommon material.</p>
<p>“It has to be.” Guan Rongfei was certain, “The structure of this piece of equipment is extremely complex. It can’t compare to other equipment. Along the way, you’ve probably already noticed that it needed more uncommon materials at higher levels. This is because if the quality of the material isn’t raised, getting such a complex structure to improve to a higher level isn’t possible.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure this is the only reason? And not because our Level 75 uncommon material reserves are still good, so you wanted to create a beautiful piece of Silver equipment composed of entirely uncommon materials?” Ye Xiu asked questioningly.</p>
<p>“That’s only the third reason.” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>Third reason… this guy really had this kind of thought. Ye Xiu really wanted to very politely give this guy a scolding, but Guan Rongfei followed: “There’s the second reason: this way is relatively economical.”</p>
<p>“Economical?” Ye Xiu felt like he had heard wrong.</p>
<p>“Yes, if you insist on using common materials, that’s fine too, but this will undoubtedly require more research into the other options. The amount of materials needed for the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella is already several times that of other equipment. The other options make things even more complicated. There are far more types of common material than uncommon material. If the choice of a common material turns out to be a mistake, then the amount of waste produced overall will be many times greater than other equipment.” Guan Rongfei spoke frankly and confidently when he talked about equipment. It was a completely different attitude than when he talked about anything else.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu felt like this was very logical. In the end, it was because Level 75 materials had only been around for half a year, not like Level 70 materials that had been studied for three years now. In addition, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was exceptionally complex. An uprecedented upgrade like for this umbrella was much more difficult.</p>
<p>However…..</p>
<p>“Is it really necessary to use all uncommon materials?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more dependable this way.” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“Are there enough Level 75 materials to upgrade the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella?” Ye Xiu asked. There were currently eight Level 75 wild bosses. No matter how high their efficiency was, their production rate wouldn’t be able to compare with Level 70 uncommon materials. There were around twenty Level 70 wild bosses.</p>
<p>“Don’t look down on uncommon materials!” Guan Rongfei said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll listen to you….. What are your thoughts right now?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu received a list of materials that Guan Rongfei needed. Because of their half a year of accumulation, they already met quite a few of the requirements. It was just this Dragon Spine Marrow……</p>
<p>“12.” When Guan Rongfei said he needed 12, it was as if this task was as easy as obtaining 12 lighters.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t there only be 8 umbrella ribs?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“But if it’s Dragon Spine Marrow, then I need 12.” Guan Rongfei’s reply practically said nothing, but Ye Xiu understood that Guan Rongfei meant that this material would be different than past materials, whether that was in length or bulk, which required 12 instead of 8 to accomplish.</p>
<p>“Don’t look down on uncommon materials?” Ye Xiu took Guan Rongfei’s statement and asked it back to him.</p>
<p>“It’s worth the money.” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>And now, the Dragon Swordsman had finally fallen. As for the Dragon Spine Marrow? Was there any? They were missing 8 pieces still. This boss only spawned once a week and it wasn’t guaranteed that they would kill it every time. Even if they did, it wasn’t a guaranteed drop……</p>
<p>How long had it been since Ye Xiu had looked forward to boss drops? This time, he deeply felt it.</p>
<p>Materials were scattered all over the ground. Wu Chen sucked in a deep breath of air and then began picking up the drops. Right now, he was a permanent resident of the game. The others only logged onto alternates and joined when they were needed. More often than not, they were on their mains and practicing in the Arena. Several practice routines had been implemented into the dedicated program that Guan Rongfei had created. Compared to the past, they didn’t need to go into the game and look for the correct environment anymore.</p>
<p>Item after item flashed in the team chat every time he picked up a drop.</p>
<p>Jade Cloud Sand, Burning Heaven Cloth, Mountain and Sea Ice…..</p>
<p>Drop after drop jumped up in eveyone’s eyes. These were all valuable Level 75 uncommon materials, but at this moment, no one cared about them. Finally, everyone saw the three words that they were looking for.</p>
<p>“Dragon Spine Marrow!!” Chen Guo was the first to shout. They were still missing seven.</p>
<p>“Another one!” Chen Guo yelled again.</p>
<p>A large number of materials usually dropped, so it wasn’t rare for several of a single type of material to drop. Everyone wished that all eight Dragon Spine Marrow would drop all at once.</p>
<p>“Three!” Chen Guo called out again, but her shout wasn’t as fast as Ye Xiu’s click. The moment that she shouted, everyone saw that two Dragon Spine Marrows had popped up on screen. A total of four Dragon Spine Marrows had dropped.</p>
<p>Are there anymore?</p>
<p>Everyone was staring at the ground. There weren’t many materials left.</p>
<p>Wu Chen continued to click rapidly. The numerous materials scattered on the floor were quickly swept clean. Chen Guo’s counting hadn’t been able to keep up with his speed. After three shouts, she closed her mouth. Everyone was looking at the team chat. Another one and then another one.</p>
<p>“Could all eight actually drop?” Wei Chen was stunned.</p>
<p>Reality wasn’t that crazy. In the end, six had dropped.</p>
<p>“Damn, only six.” Ye Xiu sighed.</p>
<p>Everyone was speechless. Due to how often they hunted wild bosses, they had a good understanding of the drop rate of wild bosses. It wasn’t rare for two or three of the same materials to drop. Four or five was rather rare, but it seemed to be their first time getting six of the same drop at once. He shouldn’t feel sad about that, and there definitely shouldn’t have been an “only” attached to it.</p>
<p>Once their harvest ended, Ye Xiu and the others logged off. Wu Chen took the materials along with the other guild members back to the city and continued to do his work.</p>
<p>This summer definitely wouldn’t be a relaxing one!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu opened up a file. It contained all of the material needs that Guan Rongfei had requested. Ye Xiu changed Dragon Spine Marrows from 8 to 2. Just this change alone wasn’t able to block the dazzling list contained in this file.</p>
<p>Chapter 1090: A Summer Not to be Overlooked</p>
<p>Ye Xiu couldn’t help but sigh at the list of materials sent by Guan Rongfei. If this list had been sent to any other club guild, it wouldn’t have just been a sigh. A huge storm definitely would have erupted.</p>
<p>Failing to get a wild boss was a common occurrence for any club guild, but frequently losing to a single guild somewhat broke the balance. And this imbalance had lasted for a year and a half already. Happy might not be completely monopolizing all of the wild bosses, but their profits this past year and a half far surpassed any other powerhouse. This was an undeniable reality.</p>
<p>When the clubs did an inventory of their storages at the end of season nine, the guild departments all presented unsatisfactory reports. There were only so many wild bosses. One more wild boss won by that guild was one less wild boss for this guild. And now, Happy had taken so many wild bosses away. With just the remaining wild bosses, how could there be enough for any of them to reach their expected goals?</p>
<p>The guild departments were embarrassed. Their bosses had unsightly expressions.</p>
<p>However, their bosses couldn’t scold them too harshly. It was no secret how powerful Guild Happy was. Guild Happy had a God like Ye Xiu watching over. If their guild leader could beat Ye Xiu, then their guild leader would have been promoted to the team long ago to win the championships.</p>
<p>Their only consolation was that their losses weren’t special cases. Their other competitors were also knitting their brows over this issue.</p>
<p>During this year and a half, they had tried all sorts of methods to solve this problem. When the Level 75 update came around, they even had their pro players rush into the game to increase their competitiveness without regard for their pro players’ conditions.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the pro players joining in was very clear, but it wasn’t absolute. After the update, it was still Guild Happy that led the pack.</p>
<p>For example, their defeat at the battle for the Dragon Swordsman was not a unique case. It wasn’t the first time that Happy had taken down the boss from the hands of other pro players.</p>
<p>It was just that in this battle, there were top tacticians like Yu Wenzhou, Xiao Shiqin, and Wang Jiexi participating. These tacticians had distinctly felt a reality: they couldn’t keep up with Ye Xiu’s tempo in these in-game battles.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>These experts instantly figured it out.</p>
<p>Even though they also stood at the top of Glory, they had been separated from the game for a long time. They still held an extremely large advantage when clashing against normal players, but when facing an equally-skilled player like Ye Xiu, this difference only became more obvious.</p>
<p>Although a bit exaggerated, one analogy would be that they were like noobs being beaten by an expert with far more experience than them.</p>
<p>This was certainly an awkward situation. The guild players had in-game experience, but they weren’t as skilled as Ye Xiu. The pro players had the skill, but they lacked the experience in large-scale wild boss battles.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a minor issue. Happy’s dominance was somewhat inevitable.</p>
<p>After the Dragon Swordsman battle, the participating guilds were all deeply reflecting on this issue.</p>
<p>Right now, it was summer break in the league. For the pro players, this break was an official holiday. The clubs didn’t have the legal right to demand them to do anything. They also had no obligation to undertake these in-game tasks. Even more importantly, helping out in the game was to improve their team’s strength. However, with the summer transfer window open, players might very well switch to another team. Consequently, players without too stable of a position would find it difficult to improve their team’s hardware. They would rather improve their own individual skill and improve what could be regarded as their software.</p>
<p>Every player had their own thoughts, but no matter the case, every player was chasing after their dream for glory.</p>
<p>For Team Thunderclap, their players didn’t seem to have any apprehensions about getting transferred away. They didn’t even go back home this summer and instead stayed to help out the team.</p>
<p>For Team Tiny Herb and Team Blue Rain, they had talented rookies with lots of room to grow. They didn’t want to waste these two months of the summer, so they made training their rookies the name of the game. Both rookies were training intensely and receiving pointers from their respective teammates.</p>
<p>For Team Hundred Blossoms, after rebuilding the team and experiencing a series of trials, they had finally walked out from their lowest point. Even though they had lost in the playoffs to Tyranny, everyone could see the fighting spirit of the new Team Hundred Blossoms. They were filled with ambition towards the new season. The day after being elminated from the playoffs, they had already started preparing for the new season. When Team Tyranny lost to Team Samsara in the finals, Zhang Jiale, who had come out of retirement and joined Team Tyranny, inevitably received hate from a few Team Hundred Blossom fans, but it was less than what people had expected. This was because more fans were invested in the new Team Hundred Blossoms. The fans had walked away from the past, looking forward to the new Team Hundred Blossom’s future.</p>
<p>Apart from that, there were other teams too.</p>
<p>For Team Tyranny, the old generals hadn’t given up yet. Would season ten be their last chance? No one knew the answer to that. Team Tyranny themselves might not know either, but they would treat it like their last chance and do everything they could because they could already feel that time was mercilessly dragging them from this world little by little. They needed to treasure every minute, every second. They definitely wouldn’t let two months of vacation wear away their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>For Team Samsara, while people were still in celebration over the defending champions, the team had snatched Excellent Era’s Sun Xiang and Battle God One Autumn Leaf at lightning speed. Their determination for the new season could easily be seen from this. Three consecutive championship victories was the mark of a new dynasty. Team Samsara was walking the road to an even greater glory. This summer, they wouldn’t be resting either.</p>
<p>For Team Wind Howl, astonishing everyone became a common occurrence, getting them to third place in the regular season. They had progressed into the semifinals, but were beaten cleanly by Samsara and eliminated from the playoffs. Losing to the eventual champions couldn’t be considered shameful, but for these proud and ambitious youths, this season had been like a tiger’s head but a snake’s tail. A loss was a loss. Even if others sympathized and forgave them, they didn’t feel good about it at all. They wanted wins from start to finish.</p>
<p>There was also Misty Rain, Void, 301, Royal Style, Conquering Clouds, Radiant, and Parade…..</p>
<p>With Glory’s season ten, the Glory competitive scene will have been around for ten years. It would the first complete season with Level 75s. Every team seemed to have a reason for not losing. Every team appeared to be more proactive. Because of their burning fighting spirit, this summer would blaze even more intensely.</p>
<p>Another Level 75 wild boss battle.</p>
<p>This was the focal point of the club guilds. It directly affected upgrading their team’s Silver equipment to Level 75. If Ye Xiu had a list of materials from Guan Rongfei, how could the other guilds not have their own list?</p>
<p>Barrier Mountains, Shadow Commander Shaan, a boss that mainly dropped Nightwalker class equipment and Nightwalker materials.</p>
<p>Team Blue Rain’s Warlock, Swoksaar. Team Blue Rain’s Ninja, Dark Forest. Team Wind Howl’s Thief, Mysterious Ghost. Team 301’s Asssassin, Scene Killer.</p>
<p>These four Nightwalker class All Stars were undoubtedly their team’s core. The Shadow Commander Shaan were their biggest priorities. Apart from that, there was Samsara, Void, Thunderclap, and so on…. These teams all had Nightwalker classes as part of their main roster and wouldn’t miss this opportunity. As for Happy, they had two Nightwalkers: Wei Chen’s Warlock, Windward Formation, and Mo Fan’s Ninja, Deception.</p>
<p>At a mountain stream in Barrier Mountains, Shadow Commander Shaan spawned. A mantle covered his body. He seemed to blend into the shadows as he walked along the cliff. When the guilds received the news, they quickly crammed into the mountain stream. But when they saw the terrain, their heads immediately started hurting.</p>
<p>To the left and right of the mountain stream were high cliffs. There was no way to arrange any proper formations. The mountain stream itself wasn’t wide enough. There was only enough space for one group to fight with the boss, but right now, there were one, two, three, four……</p>
<p>Fuck, there’s more groups than can be counted! Everyone was grumbling to themselves. Their guild leaders all kept silent because they were only the leaders in name. With the pro players watching over them, they tactfully stepped down to give them the authority, especially when the pro player was the captain.</p>
<p>“Captain Yu, this isn’t a good place to fight!” At Blue Brook Guild, guild leader Changing Springs was currently discussing the situation with captain Yu Wenzhou.</p>
<p>“Mm…” Yu Wenzhou replied. His left hand was tapping the edge of his keyboard. He was also pondering over their situation.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian wasn’t as quiet. He had dragged along Lu Hanwen, and the two Blade Masters had gone into hiding to who knew here. The only thing that Yu Wenzhou could hear was Huang Shaotian’s voice rattling on from outside the game.</p>
<p>“This time, we have to stay calm. We can’t reveal our identities so easily. Ye Xiu is a very despicable player. As soon as he finds out it’s us, he’ll definitely try to kill us as fast as possible. It’s just like last time. You know.” Huang Shaotian was currently lecturing Lu Hanwen.</p>
<p>“Senior, last time it was just you who revealed yourself, no? Who are you talking about when you say “we”?” Lu Hanwen asked.</p>
<p>“Excuses! If you don’t concentrate, he’ll easily see through you.” Huang Shaotian scolded.</p>
<p>“But….. he doesn’t seem to be here? I don’t see Guild Happy.” Lu Hanwen said.</p>
<p>“Hmph, impossible.” Huang Shaotian snorted, “He was just asking me on QQ where I was. He’s definitely here. He’s just hiding, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I get it.” Lu Hanwen nodded his head, “Even if he wasn’t originally going to be here, since you replied to him, telling him where you were, he’ll definitely be on his way.”</p>
<p>“What?” Huang Shaotian stared blankly. Something didn’t seem right with this logic?</p>
<p>“Hanwen…… ” Huang Shaotian spoke with heartfelt sincerity, “You know, my hands are incomparably fast. They move much faster than my mind. When I play, it’s like that. Sometimes, by the time I realize what the problem is, it’s like that too.”</p>
<p>“I get it. No wonder our captain often stresses that you need to control your hand speed. Lu Hanwen said.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, that’s because he doesn’t have this problem!” Huang Shaotian laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“The captain’s looking at us.” Lu Hanwen had noticed that Yu Wenzhou seemed to be interested in their conversation.</p>
<p>“Shut up! FOCUS! Do you know what focus means, Lu Hanwen!!!!” Huang Shaotian shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Chapter 1091: Before He Arrives</p>
<p>Because of the dangerous terrain, even though the guilds could jump into battle at any moment, for now they could only huddle together. Everyone looked around at each other, secretly preparing their skills and targets. Once their leaders gave the order, they could instantly and accurately launch their attacks.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou had also originally wanted to play it safe, but after hearing Huang Shaotian and Lu Hanwen’s conversation, he agreed with Lu Hanwen’s judgment. Ye Xiu and his team hadn’t heard the news about Shadow Commander Shaan’s spawn, they’d only casually asked about Huang Shaotian’s location. But now with Huang Shaotian’s reply, they were exposed. Aside from a boss spawn, there was no reason for Huang Shaotian to run to Barrier Mountains.</p>
<p>“Team Happy needs many things!” Yu Wenzhou thought to himself. He was very clear about the roster of that grassroots team, and knew that they had two Nightwalker classes, especially Windward Formation, who had history with Blue Rain. Yu Wenzhou’s current account Swoksaar was originally that person’s account, after all.</p>
<p>But right now, Yu Wenzhou was using an alt anyway, and so he didn’t let himself dwell on the past – the thought just crossed his mind briefly, and then he began to ponder how best to combat Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was undoubtedly the number one enemy. In the current situation, this guy would certainly break the equilibrium, so wouldn’t it be safer to sort everything out before he got here?</p>
<p>Just as Yu Wenzhou was about to speak, he heard another voice cutting before him. “I say, to make this easier, how about we negotiate a plan?”</p>
<p>The sound seemed to come from Thunderclap’s area. Yu Wenzhou was fairly sure who the speaker was, so he smiled and casually said, “You’re in a rush?”</p>
<p>“Before that guy arrives. I’m sure everyone understands what I mean,” said Xiao Shiqin.</p>
<p>“Mm… Agreed.” From Misty Rain came a woman’s voice. Misty Rain’s captain, Chu Yunxiu.</p>
<p>“Hmph…” From Wind Howl there was a disdainful cough. Tang Hao knew to whom these people were referring, and was unimpressed by their fear.</p>
<p>“What kind of plan?” Someone asked from 301 Degrees. It was their captain Yang Cong. 301’s strength here was slightly weaker compared to the others. If this became a direct battle, they would certainly be disadvantaged, so they were particularly interested in reaching some sort of agreement through negotiation to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Right now, the groups present were Blue Rain, Thunderclap, Misty Rain, Wind Howl, and 301 Degrees, with each team’s respective captains present. Tang Hao’s scoff wasn’t quite an agreement to negotiations, but it at least wasn’t a clear refusal, so he was automatically included in the talks.</p>
<p>“Let’s each send a representative to 1v1!” Yu Wenzhou was the first to propose a solution.</p>
<p>“Opposed!” Xiao Shiqin immediately objected. 1v1, at first glance, seemed to be fair. But it depended on each side’s members, and who they could send up! Blue Rain had Huang Shaotian, an absolute titan at 1v1s; he had a high chance of winning. Thunderclap could put up a fight. Itt wasn’t like they’d be instantly crushed by Huang Shaotian, but their chances of winning would definitely be smaller. As for the other teams, they were probably in a similar situation. Yu Wenzhou’s suggestion appeared to be fair, but it was definitely biased toward Blue Rain.</p>
<p>“Opposed!” As expected, Misty Rain’s Chu Yunxiu also expressed her dissent, following the same train of thought as Xiao Shiqin.</p>
<p>“You want a 1v1, then let’s 1v1!” On the other hand, Tang Hao was unafraid and boldly accepted the proposition.</p>
<p>Yang Cong hesitated. When it came to 1v1, his chances of winning were similarly low. But compared to a battle between the full forces of all sides, a 1v1 definitely increased 301’s chances of success. Huang Shaotian, Tang Hao, and the others were much bigger players than he was. But in a 1v1, no one would dare say for sure that a win or loss was guaranteed.</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t play a group battle, that’d waste too much time.” Yu Wenzhou chuckled. Seeing two votes against him, he knew that his suggestion definitely wouldn’t be accepted.</p>
<p>“Then to be fast, let’s just roll for it!” Xiao Shiqin said.</p>
<p>“Relying on luck to decide? That’s absurd! This should be decided by strength.” Tang Hao immediately expressed his objection toward this plan.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, I remember hearing that Tang Hao was especially bad at rolling! I heard that he almost always gets less than 50, isn’t that right?” From Blue Brook Guild’s side came another person’s voice. The fact that Huang Shaotian had managed to stay quiet until now was already quite a remarkable feat.</p>
<p>Originally, this was a captain-level conversation, and the other players were careful to maintain silence as they watched. Once Huang Shaotian spoke up, there were suddenly whispers everywhere. It was clear that this was a never-before-heard piece of gossip.</p>
<p>“What kind of skill is rolling?” Tang Hao fumed.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard that luck is also a part of strength? For example…”</p>
<p>“What about this?” Chu Yunxiu ruthlessly interrupted Huang Shaotian. By the time they waited for that guy to finish, Ye Xiu probably would have already slaughtered his way here.</p>
<p>“Each of us can send out a few people and attack the boss in teams. Whichever team has the highest damage output can have the boss,” Chu Yunxiu said.</p>
<p>“Hm, that’s not a bad plan.” Yu Wenzhou was the first to agree.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. That way, I think five people per team would be enough,” Xiao Shiqin said.</p>
<p>“Who’s controlling the aggro? What about healing?” Tang Hao asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll specially designate people to control the aggro and not count that in the damage output. Each side will be responsible for their own healing, and if they cause an OT, then they’re disqualified.” Chu Yunxiu efficiently laid out the details of her plan.</p>
<p>“Hm, if we do that, then I think sending three people per side would be enough. If there are more, then there’d be too much conflict. We’d get in each other’s way,” Yu Wenzhou said. If each side sent five people, then that’d be a large 25 person team attacking the boss. If the team was composed of all long-ranged classes, then it’d be a little better, but if there were more close-ranged classes, then that’d require careful coordination of position.</p>
<p>But this was supposed to be a competition. There was no way that someone else would willingly give up their position for you, and so there’d definitely be a lot of clashing. Even if everyone was on the same team and couldn’t damage each other, there could still be plenty of intentional interference with other players’ attacks.</p>
<p>“Exactly! Competition keep things interesting!” said Chu Yunxiu.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou felt a shiver. This woman, she didn’t have some deeper plan, did she? At the same time, he saw Xiao Shiqin’s Mechanic glance toward his Warlock.</p>
<p>These are in-game characters, we don’t need to meet each other’s eyes, do we? But it seems like you also have reservations about Chu Yunxiu’s plan? Yu Wenzhou quietly thought to himself, but he truly couldn’t find any reason to oppose her plan. At least, unlike his proposal of 1v1, the plan didn’t obviously favor one side over another.</p>
<p>“Then let’s hurry up and begin?” From Wind Howl, players had already jumped forward. Just by looking at their classes, it was clear that they were all members of Wind Howl’s professional team.</p>
<p>Once he saw the classes of those characters, Yu Wenzhou suddenly realized what game Chu Yunxiu was playing. Team Misty Rain had many long-ranged attackers! Even if long-ranged attacks could also be blocked, they were still much better off than the close-ranged classes vying for positions near the boss. This was what she had been counting on.</p>
<p>Then what should Blue Brook do? For this battle, they couldn’t just rely on the skill of the pro players, they also had to consider which classes would complement each other the best in this situation. Truly a competition of tactics! This was shaping up to be quite interesting.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou thought and eventually decided on a suitable team. They didn’t all have to be pro players. Here, the class composition mattered more. But just as he was about to call out names, he heard someone in the group shout, “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Above!”</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou raised his camera and saw the shadow of a character falling from the mountain’s cliffside.</p>
<p>“This is…” Yu Wenzhou startled, but there were already others with sharper eyes than his, who could see the ID on top of that shadow’s head.</p>
<p>Lord Grim!</p>
<p>An infamous name in their circles, Ye Xiu’s unspecialized Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Free-falling at an acceleration at 9.8 m/s, Lord Grim seemed like he was about to crash into the mountain stream, but no one believed that this guy would just slip and fall to his death. At this moment, three shots of gunfire sounded. Lord Grim pulled out his Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, sending an Anti-Tank Missile attack toward Shadow Commander Shaan.</p>
<p>The three shots fired one after another, three shots worth of recoil that slowed Lord Grim’s body.</p>
<p>And then, the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella opened, and with the Mechanic’s skill Rotor Wing, Lord Grim flew back up into the sky.</p>
<p>Not good!</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou already realized what was going on.</p>
<p>“Quick, pull the aggro!” Yu Wenzhou hurriedly shouted. The others now understood what this was all about. The long-ranged classes launched their attacks, while the Knights immediately came to stabilize the aggro.</p>
<p>But it was too late…</p>
<p>In order not to disturb the boss, the various teams had maintained a considerable distance between themselves and Shadow Commander Shaan. But now Lord Grim suddenly fell from the sky and opened fire. The boss’s reaction was of course instantaneous, especially since this was a Level 75 Nightwalker boss. Assassins, Thieves, Ninjas, they were all agile and lightweight classes.</p>
<p>The players couldn’t scale the cliffs to the left and right of the mountain stream, but this wasn’t an obstacle for this Level 75 boss. With one stride, Shadow Commander Shaan already leapt onto the cliffside, bounding and pedaling upward, instantly leaving behind all the long-ranged attacks of the players. Those clumsy Knights wanted to mock them, but there was no way for them to keep up with Shaan’s speed.</p>
<p>But would the boss be pulled away just like that?</p>
<p>Incredulous, everyone looked up at the midair Lord Grim. To fly completely above the top of the cliffs, that simply wasn’t possible for a player, was it? Whether an assassin’s Air Jump, or a Mechanic’s Rotor Wing, or a Witch’s Broom Mastery, or a Summoner’s Small Flying Dragon summon, or so on, the skills of these classes could help a player achieve heights that other classes wouldn’t be able to, but they wouldn’t allow a player to fly clear over these cliffs, would they?</p>
<p>It was true, these classes couldn’t accomplish it. But Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim was an unspecialized! If he used these skills in combination, this height…</p>
<p>Even though most of these skills weren’t sub-Level 20 skills, it was no secret that the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella could change forms to allow the usage of higher-level skills.</p>
<p>As expected, after the Rotor Wing, Lord Grim jumped up again in midair, a movement that could only be accomplished with the usage of the skill Air Jump. And then there was another shot, an Aerial Fire that sent his character flying higher. Lord Grim waved his hand, and that Myriad Manifestation Umbrella was in some unknown form and was stuck into the mountain. Lord Grim twisted his body, landing on and jumping off the weapon; with a tug, he pulled the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella back out of the cliffside.</p>
<p>Fuck! This umbrella had ninjato abilities too? Everyone could only look on with dazed expressions…</p>
<p>Chapter 1092: A Hundred Tricks</p>
<p>When Ninjas used ninjatos, they could climb rocks unlike other classes. Thus, in theory, while other classes couldn’t jump onto the cliff, Ninjas could use their ninjatos to climb on.</p>
<p>The other classes could only sit there and watch, while the Ninjas from the various guilds rushed out, brandishing their ninjatos in preparation to scale the cliff.</p>
<p>But using a ninjato required technique. Although normal players could perform a few tricks, knowing a few tricks wasn’t going to be enough to chase a target. What was needed was speed and efficiency. As a result, everyone watched as the Ninjas rushed forward aggressively, climbed for a bit, and then dropped down like dumplings one by one. The number of players who could stay on the cliff could be counted on one hand.</p>
<p>However, among the Ninjas who could remain on the cliff, there were a few that stood out, especially the fastest one. His movements flowed smooth as water. He was the number one Ninja in Glory, Team Misty Rain’s Li Hua, who used the character Dark Forest.</p>
<p>From Li Hua’s Ninja, everyone could see hope. Everyone was filled with expectations as they raised their heads high, hoping Li Hua could accomplish something. But soon afterwards, a cold bucket of water splashed on them, extinguishing what little hope they had left.</p>
<p>Someone had attacked down from above the cliff. A Laser Rifle shot over. Even though Li Hua reacted quickly and dodged it, that was just the first test. All sorts of long-ranged attacks rained down the cliff as if they were all trying to outdo each other.</p>
<p>His guild’s pro players closed their eyes, unable to keep looking. In this situation, Li Hua being able to smoothly scale the walls was quite good, but wanting him to pursue and attack? Intercept them? Forget about it…..</p>
<p>Yes, forget about it.</p>
<p>After dodging a few waves of attacks, Li Hua let out a sigh and chose to give up and return to the mountain stream along with the few other Ninjas, who were still hanging on.</p>
<p>“Thanks!”</p>
<p>In the global chat, Lord Grim said a single word.</p>
<p>“Despicable!”</p>
<p>“Shameless!”</p>
<p>“Bastard!”</p>
<p>“Ruthless!”</p>
<p>“Next time, you’ll see!”</p>
<p>After Lord Grim said thanks, replies came one after the other. The reactions and hand speed of the pro players were worthy of their reputation.</p>
<p>The conversation in the global chat caused a commotion for the players. Everyone knew who Lord Grim was, but who were the guys replying back? No one had heard of them, yet they dared to challenge Lord Grim? Did these idiots not know who Lord Grim was?</p>
<p>“Fuck, where’d so many idiots come from?” Someone felt indignant at the injustice and made a remark.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Do you guys not know who Lord Grim is?”</p>
<p>“If they knew, they’d probably shit their pants.”</p>
<p>“Haha, stupid noobs. They don’t even know who Lord Grim is. Go back to school.”</p>
<p>Trash talk came one after the other. The normal players might not be able to compare to pro players in fighting, but there was no lack of talented trash talkers. In an instant, words filled the screen. Everyone in the pro teams didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and couldn’t help but be at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“You guys don’t even know the situation and you’re bombing the screen. Who doesn’t know that Lord Grim is Ye Qiu? You guys need to get your facts straight first. Don’t you know how many people you’ve hurt with that screen bomb? It’s best if you don’t know. If you guys knew, you’d probably be crying tears!” For the pro players, there was only Huang Shaotian who wouldn’t be outdone by the normal players in trash talking. Huang Shaotian’s trash talking might not be too sharp and mean, but just the length alone would let him win if you went back and forth with him.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the Glory competition stage. This was the Heavenly Domain. Huang Shaotian wasn’t up against five people. He was up against the millions playing the game. As soon as the players saw that someone was actually returning fire, they weren’t going to let this rest. For a moment, the global chat had turned into a war. All sorts of players were talking trash about Huang Shaotian’s Blade Master.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian’s win condition was by length, but up against the torrent of players, he was defeated in the end. It was a miserable defeat too. Apart from being one against many, the global chat had another big limitation for Huang Shaotian: talking had a cooldown.</p>
<p>“They’re pissing me off!”</p>
<p>Because of the cooldown, he could only watch as people talked trash about him. For Huang Shaotian, there was nothing more hellish than this.</p>
<p>“You guys are all talk! 1v1 me! Does anyone dare to? Let’s take this to the Arena. Fighting a hundred of you pieces of wood wouldn’t be a problem!!!!” When Huang Shaotian realized that trash talking in the global chat was unwise, he tried to shift it to PvP.</p>
<p>How could the players retreat? People immediately replied. Some even ran over to create a room for Huang Shaotian to hurry up and bow down to them.</p>
<p>“That’s enough. Do you plan on making next week’s headlines?” Seeing that Huang Shaotian was actually intent on going to the Arena and have a bloody battle with these players, Yu Wenzhou finally spoke up.</p>
<p>In the end, Huang Shaotian didn’t go to the Arena. The players who had opened up rooms, waiting for him, waited and waited, but didn’t see him. How could there not scorching remarks fired at him? Fortunately, everyone in Team Blue Rain, including Huang Shaotian, had already logged off.</p>
<p>Shadow Commander Shaan was taken away by Happy just like this. If the guilds wanted to chase, they would have to go all the way around the cliff. There clearly wasn’t enough time, so their only choice was to give up.</p>
<p>Dragon Swordsman, then Shadow Commander Shaan.</p>
<p>Blue Rain and Thunderclap had been thoroughly beaten by Happy two times in a row. The first time, their loss was fine. Ye Xiu had shown that he was more familiar and experienced at large-scale in-game battles than them. But the second time, everyone had clearly gotten there first, but Ye Xiu seemed to have descended from the heavens, relying on his shameless unspecialized class to steal the boss. That made them furious.</p>
<p>Blue Rain, Thunderclap, and the pro players from other teams gave an announcement to their teams: when hunting for wild bosses, the first task is to be on guard against Ye Xiu. The danger from this guy was even scarier than the other guilds combined. It was as if nothing could be done about it. Today’s carelessness definitely couldn’t happen again.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, an opportunity to test the guilds had come. Both sides once again met. It was Gray Corner’s wild boss, the Brawler Killer Dinglong.</p>
<p>From this boss’s name, it sounded like he was a Fighter class, but in reality, he was a Gunner class. This time, there were a lot of guilds that got the news. Samsara and Tyranny. Their guilds unexpectedly didn’t get the news for the previous two boss fights. But they weren’t going to miss it this time. There was also Blue Rain and Thunderclap. After the two sides met, they remained silent for a long time. For this week’s Level 75 wild bosses, these two had done the best in terms of gathering intelligence. Three wild bosses had spawned so far and they hadn’t missed any of them. But so what? Despite not missing any of the spawns, the boss didn’t go to them in the end. They had busied about for nothing.</p>
<p>This was already the third time, and they didn’t want to go back empty-handed again. However, the confrontation this time was going to be more intense than before. Apart from them, there was Hundred Blossoms, Misty Rain, and Void? None of those were cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Fighting for wild bosses was like struggling for the championship title. Each side had a magnificent army with thousands of players, but only one side would win.</p>
<p>At the Gray Market, the Brawler Killer Dinglong had spawned. Since this was a street market, it was going to be a street battle. Even though the guilds hadn’t acted yet, they had already started sending out people in secret. There were many high points on the streets. For long-ranged classes, getting the high ground was extremely important for displaying their potential. Not long afterwards, the surrounding rooftops, pavilions, anywhere that was higher than the ground, had someone stationed there. The various guilds were all mixed together, looking at one another. No one said a word. They paid attention to the boss’s situation, while keeping an eye on the other opposing guilds. As a result, in order to protect their long-ranged DPSers, melee classes began to climb up to the high points to protect their players. The Gray Market was unreasonably rowdy.</p>
<p>“Oh, why are there so many people this time?”</p>
<p>There was no limit to the rowdiness. The guilds were on guard, pondering over how they should fight this battle. At this moment, the evil that needed to be defended against had finally appeared. They hadn’t found his character yet, but they could hear his voice.</p>
<p>Happy had come!</p>
<p>This news was like the news of an important person’s death. The news was being spread everywere.</p>
<p>But when they tried looking for Happy, they were all in a daze.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Happy.</p>
<p>Heavenly Justice, Radiant, Parade, Conquering Clouds… this group….. The guilds weren’t strangers to them. In reality, for a long time, Happy hadn’t been fighting alone. They would always be bunched together with these guilds, allying together to compete with the big guilds for the bosses.</p>
<p>The previous two times, Happy had operated alone. Now, these four guilds had come together. Happy had already grown to such a level. Did they still need this Alliance?</p>
<p>These guilds alone couldn’t compare with the powerhouses, but together, their strength was evident. The pro players from the various guilds were almost about to collapse. This Ye Xiu. When there weren’t too many people, he would play tactics with you. When the terrain wasn’t easy to fight in, he would play his class against you. This time, there were numerous guilds participating. The competition was intense, so now he was playing the numbers game… no matter what the scenario, he had something prepared for you!</p>
<p>The powerhouses wouldn’t be lacking in numbers either, but those responsible for undertaking an important task like fighting for wild bosses couldn’t be ordinary fans. The elite players needed to be organized and disciplined. They had to guarantee that they would be ready to form a group at any moment. The guilds had to ensure that there were always two or three groups ready. Normal players might occasionally have some time to spare, and would participate and have some fun, but if you truly wanted to be like these elite players and be ready on call tens of times a week, how many people could endure it?</p>
<p>Normal players played the game for fun. Elite players played the game as if it were work.</p>
<p>As a result, even though powerhouses had many players, for fighting wild bosses, which needed to be done tens of times a week, it wasn’t possible to have their entire guild come and fight. The number advantage that Ye Xiu and his allied guilds had was truly troublesome. It wasn’t easy to gather more elite helpers to face this type of alliance. For this alliance, if they saw that the situation wasn’t looking good, they could just leave. But the guild’s elite troops were an official establishment. They couldn’t just kick people out. That would damage their image!</p>
<p>Chapter 1093: Diversion</p>
<p>If you counted the five guild alliance, the wild boss of the Gray Corner, Brawler King Dinglong, had attracted twelve guilds. This was discounting those who might have gotten the message and were on their way.</p>
<p>With twelve guilds, there would be at least one elite team from each guild, making it a total of over a thousand characters clustered in this corner of the Grey Corner Blackmarket. There were quite a lot of people, but since it was a market, the terrain was full of stereoscopic buildings. The characters were scattered inside the buildings, outside the buildings, some on higher levels and some on lower ones. Even so, the place was still filled with characters. No space was left for the five guild alliance that had arrived a little late. And what aggro they had! As soon as they arrived, almost all the characters there had turned to look at them, prepared to fight.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Did you all form an alliance or something?” Ye Xiu asked loudly.</p>
<p>It would have been better had he not asked, but now that he had, everyone was going with it.</p>
<p>“That’s right, we’re getting rid of you first!” It wasn’t clear who exactly replied, but if they could represent the group to speak up, then they would have to be someone whose opinion was respected in the group.</p>
<p>“Tch, do you even know where I am?” Ye Xiu mocked.</p>
<p>Looking around, the crowd realized that they really didn’t know. Although pro players were skilled and had good audition skills, everyone was standing in clusters right now. While they could figure out the general area where Ye Xiu’s voice was coming from, they couldn’t find Ye Xiu’s exact location. Ye Xiu wasn’t like them, who used their main class on their alts. This guy was an unspecialized now, the combination of all 24 classes. This made his alt account situation rather complicated, too.</p>
<p>“Who cares where you are? If anyone dares come any further, we’ll kill them all!” Another unknown person spoke up with a threat this time. However, considering how things were looking right now, it didn’t seem like an empty threat. They were very united even if it was forced.</p>
<p>“Alright then, we won’t go any further. We’ll just stand and watch. You all go ahead,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Over a thousand people simultaneously sent a sweat emoji and the speech bubbles that popped up covered a huge area at once. It was an impressive sight, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Old Ye, you can’t just do that!” Someone jumped out of the crowd to speak. Everyone looked over. It was a Spitfire from Tyranny, fiddling with the automatic handgun in his hand.</p>
<p>“Yo, it’s you. How have you been? Good?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“I’m very well, thank you,” Zhang Jiale said.</p>
<p>“Did you cry?”</p>
<p>“Fuck off!” Zhang Jiale erupted.</p>
<p>“I told you ages ago. Tyranny isn’t good enough. If you want to win the championships, you should’ve come to Happy,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Boos immediately rose from the crowd. Even though this was God Ye Xiu, who had the most championship titles under his belt, everyone felt that this sort of boast was just crazy.</p>
<p>“Who are you calling not good enough?” A Striker walked out of Tyranny’s formation. After talking so much, Ye Xiu’s character had been exposed. This time, he was using a Launcher.</p>
<p>“Old Han came too? How lively. I like it. I feel like we pro players should come in game more often when we’re free to spar together, improve together, advance together,” Ye Xiu said in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“Stop spewing bullshit and disappear already. Or do you want us to send you off?” A Blade Master from Blue Brook also came out. Just from the speed at which he talked, it was doubtlessly Huang Shaotian.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale, Han Wenqing, Huang Shaotian!</p>
<p>The three surrounded Ye Xiu ready to attack. This face off alone was enough to have many people gasping! This was a face off that would only ever be seen in All-Stars! Not only that, the show at All-Stars wasn’t as intense or serious as the competition for bosses.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Trying to bully me with numbers?” Ye Xiu had his character back away as the elite teams of the five guilds behind him stepped forward threateningly.</p>
<p>“Either way, don’t even think of causing trouble this time.” Thunderclap’s Xiao Shiqin had come over as well. Seeing that the situation wasn’t bad, what with everyone so aggressively against Ye Xiu’s presence, he didn’t want to waste the chance to cooperate and kick Ye Xiu out of the competition.</p>
<p>“I’m not causing trouble. Can’t I even take a walk here now? What do you want? Are you big guilds clearing the place, having your pro players bully others?” Ye Xiu yelled.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the crowd’s fuse was blown. This guy was just being shameless!</p>
<p>“Why are we talking with this guy, just kill him!” Someone yelled.</p>
<p>“Who dares speak to me like that?” Ye Xiu yelled back.</p>
<p>With so many people and so many voices, no one could immediately tell who it was that spoke, but no one cared either. However, with five guild elite teams standing behind him, Han Wenqing and the others didn’t dare charge over. Otherwise, that guy would definitely order the five hundred people behind him to drown them in people. Hoping that he would come out and 1v3 them was a naive thought.</p>
<p>As a result, not only was the attention of pro players turned over this way, the elite teams were as well. Everyone began to advance as one. This time, it wasn’t just Ye Xiu’s character but all of the five guilds behind him who began to retreat.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? You want to fight, huh? You aren’t even going after the boss and you want to PK? That’s unfair!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to fight, then leave. We won’t let you have this boss.”</p>
<p>“You think we’re so easy to scare?” Ye Xiu called out.</p>
<p>“If you continue, it won’t be good for anyone. Why don’t you just take your people and leave?” Yu Wenzhou said from Blue Rain’s side.</p>
<p>“Why do we have to go and not you?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Because you have no chance of winning.” Yu Wenzhou continued to chat with Ye Xiu patiently.</p>
<p>“Heh, we might not have a chance of winning in a fight, but are we here to fight?” Ye Xiu suddenly laughed.</p>
<p>“Hm?” This reply had Yu Wenzhou lost for words. Then, he looked around, only to see that all the players from the guilds were facing off against the five guild alliance aggressively, cracking their fists and ready to fight at any time.</p>
<p>“Boss!” Yu Wenzhou, who was usually very composed, called out suddenly, his tone a little pained. At the same time, someone at their rear yelled out, “Boss!!!” as well.</p>
<p>That’s right, boss!</p>
<p>Everyone’s aggro had turned to Ye Xiu and everyone had forgotten that they were here to fight for a wild boss and not for Ye Xiu. Thus, when everyone’s attention was elsewhere, a small team appeared at the other end of the Corner. They had no guild tags above their heads, like a normal passing team of players. They suddenly attacked, immediately pulling Brawler King away.</p>
<p>Was this a coincidence?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou was one hundred percent sure that this was one of Ye Xiu’s schemes. This was his plan. He had managed to completely divert their attention.</p>
<p>All the teams hurried to respond, but that small team was definitely prepared and had planned for this. They knew exactly where to drag the boss, darting in and out of the streets of this black market smoothly. It was the elite teams of the guild that were having a lot of trouble. Operating as a whole in places like this made them clumsy.</p>
<p>It was a good thing that every guild had pro players. They didn’t have the time to take care of their entire team and all rushed out individually, using their own judgement and methods to search for the boss.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian, who had been at the frontlines of the face off against Ye Xiu, had managed to get his Blade Master to the frontlines of their hunt for the wild boss in the blink of an eye. With Yu Wenzhou’s calm and clear analysis and arrangements, he quickly caught up.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going?!!” Huang Shaotian yelled, his Blade Master jumping down from a roof nearby and using Sword Draw midair. A flash of sword energy gathered on his blade and flew out. The attack seemed about to knock down a bunch of people, but then someone in the team suddenly charged out, their spear swinging up and dispersing the light. The Sword Draw had been parried.</p>
<p>Having to parry when only able to see the flash of light caused by the sword energy from the attack and not the blade itself was something you could do if you relied on mechanics alone. Huang Shaotian hadn’t expected that his strike would be unsuccessful. Out of Happy’s members, only Ye Xiu would be able to this. So who was this person?</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian had no time to wonder. The Battle Mage struck out with his spear once again and Huang Shaotian hurriedly pulled back his sword to guard in midair. He had wanted to use this strike to glide through the air and continue to chase the boss, but he hadn’t expected that the other would realize his intentions and switch from a stab to a upwards flick. Huang Shaotian’s Blade Master wasn’t knocked to one side by this attack and was instead flicked upwards.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Huang Shaotian was shocked. The Battle Mage’s mechanics weren’t what was shocking, but rather his understanding of his intentions and judgements. This definitely wasn’t something that Happy’s rookies could do.</p>
<p>“Who do you think?” The other retorted.</p>
<p>“Holy crap how did you get here weren’t you a Launcher how did you become a Battle Mage?” Huang Shaotian yelled in surprise.</p>
<p>“I said, didn’t I? I have eight computers open, logged into eight alts. Didn’t you believe me?” Ye Xiu said, his spear once again striking towards Huang Shaotian’s Blade Master, but this time, he directly used an ultimate, Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart. Huang Shaotian’s Guard skill was on cooldown, so he couldn’t block the attack. Instead, he used a Rising Dragon Slash to pull his character higher in the air and dodge the attack. Then he saw that Ye Xiu’s Battle Mage had long since canceled the skill and left him in the air to run back to his team.</p>
<p>“Fuck, don’t you dare run!” Huang Shaotian hollered.</p>
<p>“Who’s running?” Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian looked over again. Ye Xiu hadn’t run. It was just that his Battle Mage had darted over by a body unit and blocked off Huang Shaotian’s path beforehand. He had never planned to leave with his team, but stay and stall Huang Shaotian.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Huang Shaotian immediately understood his intentions. By the time he was finished with Ye Xiu, who knew where the boss would be?</p>
<p>“Why are you such a slippery bastard?!” Huang Shaotian yelled.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you should learn from me!” Ye Xiu didn’t mind chatting with Huang Shaotian some more.</p>
<p>However, would a thing like speaking interfere with Huang Shaotian’s combat ability? Of course not. He kept chattering on and on even as he charged forwards. His intention wasn’t to fight Ye Xiu to the death, but to charge past him. But…</p>
<p>Lu Hanwen’s Blade Master arrived, Zheng Xuan’s Spitfire arrived, and Yu Wenzhou’s Warlock also arrived. Huang Shaotian had worked hard to find the boss, so obviously he’d only share his intel with his own people and not the other guilds. The ones who had gotten his memo and came were all Blue Rain’s people. Yet when they arrived, they found Huang Shaotian still here facing off against Ye Xiu. Where was the boss? It had left this street ages ago.</p>
<p>“It went that way. Don’t worry about me, you just hurry and chase after it,” Huang Shaotian called out.</p>
<p>“You think I’m not here or something?”</p>
<p>“Senior, you want to block us four on your own?” Lu Hanwen asked in shock.</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to his bullshit! Hurry and give chase, little guy,” Huang Shaotian yelled.</p>
<p>“I’m really worried for your IQ. You think you’re the only one who knows how to call reinforcements?” As his words fell, Blue Rain’s four pros were instantly surrounded.</p>
<p>Chapter 1094: There’s No Harm in Cooperating</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou looked left and right. They were surrounded by tens of players. With</p>
<p>this sort of encirclement, even if they were able to break away through their</p>
<p>superior skill, they wouldn’t be able to pursue the boss anymore.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou sighed. This encirclement wasn’t really a trap, but rather an opening</p>
<p>from them. He had analyzed which direction the boss could have been pulled away</p>
<p>and then assigned people to chase after the boss. Sure enough, Huang Shaotian</p>
<p>found the boss. In this type of situation, they obviously wouldn’t be sharing this</p>
<p>info with the other guilds. Not only would they not be sharing the info, they</p>
<p>had to protect this news from leaking. Thus, Yu Wenzhou didn’t immediately</p>
<p>dispatch Blue Brook Guild elite troops to throw themselves at the boss. Such an</p>
<p>obvious movement would definitely attract the attention of others. Yu Wenzhou</p>
<p>didn’t want to block Ye Xiu off from the boss, while also bringing along a</p>
<p>bunch of competitors.</p>
<p>As a result, Yu Wenzhou instructed his elite troops to continue spreading out as</p>
<p>if they were still searching for their target in an attempt to mislead the</p>
<p>other guilds. In the meantime, their pro players would get together and go</p>
<p>over. A small-scale movement naturally wouldn’t be seen through by others.</p>
<p>Their movements indeed didn’t arouse any of the other guilds’ suspicions, but Ye Xiu</p>
<p>had dispatched people to surround them, making them appear weak and outnumbered.</p>
<p>“Fighting isn’t beneficial to either side. You guys should leave!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou laughed bitterly. Wasn’t this what he had said to Ye Xiu a few minutes</p>
<p>ago. This guy was quick to return fire.</p>
<p>“Retreat.” Yu Wenzhou immediately ordered.</p>
<p>“What?” Huang Shaotian was shocked.</p>
<p>“Wasting time like this is pointless. It’s better to retreat!” Yu Wenzhou said.</p>
<p>Lu Hanwen and Zheng Xuan had started retreating. Even though Huang Shaotian was</p>
<p>unwilling, he respected his captain’s authority. After spouting a bunch of</p>
<p>trash talk at Ye Xiu, he retreated helplessly.</p>
<p>“A man who recognizes the facts of a situation is a true hero!” Ye Xiu sighed.</p>
<p>“You flatter me.” Yu Wenzhou said.</p>
<p>“If there’s ever an opportunity, there’s no harm in cooperating together.” Ye Xiu</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>“There will be one.” Yu Wenzhou smiled.</p>
<p>Afterwards, some more nonsense was said. Ye Xiu was naturally stalling to give time for his</p>
<p>players to kill the boss. As for Yu Wenzhou, he had already given up. After personally participating in numerous wild boss battles, he now thoroughly recognized just how complicated these battles were. Several guilds, sometimes more than ten, fought against each other in a chaotic war. There was no way to predict anything.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou had carefully studied Blue Brook Guild’s reports. He clearly saw that no matter which guild it was, their results were very inconsistent, following no patterns. It was possible that one week, one guild would succeed several times, while the next week, the guild failed to get anything. Whether it was Blue Brook Guild or Herb Garden or any other powerhouse, it was the same. Because of how chaotic the wars were, all sorts of impossible to predict events decided</p>
<p>the outcome each time. There was no absolute logic in any of these.</p>
<p>However, when Ye Xiu led Happy, the outcome was more consistent. Compared to the constant ups and downs of the other guilds, their relatively flat and smooth line was astonishing. Without a doubt, Ye Xiu was able to minimize the chaos happening in these battles, which meant that Ye Xiu’s way of conducting battles was very valuable as a reference. From what Yu Wenzhou saw, Ye Xiu’s tactical skill was certainly one aspect, but more importantly, he was able to accurately grasp the conflicts and balance between the guilds during these boss battles, allowing him to direct the overall direction of the battle. His tactical arrangements didn’t stop at just purely</p>
<p>battle aspects such as movements, focusing targets, switching targets.</p>
<p>Doing this wasn’t easy. Yu Wenzhou could see the painstaking amount of work that Ye Xiu put into this. It seemed even more difficult than them playing in competitive matches. There was only one match a week, but there were tens of wild boss battles every week. Just how much effort did it take him to do all this homework?</p>
<p>Therefore, when Ye Xiu suggested that they cooperate when an opportunity arose, Yu Wenzhou didn’t hesitate to agree. He didn’t mind Ye Xiu utilizing their guild’s resources because in his eyes, Ye Xiu was a huge resource too.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou replied to Ye Xiu and then talked about it with Changing Spring. After all, this was an in-game matter. Technically speaking, the team captain had no such authority in this area. However, pro players had high statuses, especially the captain. Even though they didn’t officially have any authority, their words held a lot of weight in anything related to Glory. A more assertive captain would practically be giving orders to the guild leader. Yu Wenzhou was rather polite. When he spoke to Changing Spring, it was more of a suggestion.</p>
<p>After Changing Spring heard Yu Wenzhou’s suggestion, he was stunned.</p>
<p>Cooperation. It wasn’t like he didn’t know how to do that. It was just that the competitions between the guilds, especially the ones between the top guilds like Blue Brook Guild, had a “wolves are here” feeling. No one trusted each other’s words. Whenever they cooperated, they would always be on guard for any backstabbing. Once or twice was fine, but if it was frequent, they wouldn’t be able to endure this type of provocation. In the end, they might as well just do things alone.</p>
<p>Nothing could be done about it. The competition between the guilds could be considered another battlefield for the teams aiming to be the champions. For them, injuring others was beneficial for themselves. As a result, if they weren’t able to get the boss, they didn’t mind making things more difficult for their enemies. It wasn’t just about strengthening themselves. It was also about finding a way to stop their enemies from growing stronger. In this type of environment, it was hard to have any good relationships with other guilds.</p>
<p>As a result, when Changing Spring hard about Yu Wenzhou’s suggestion for a cooperation, he was startled at first. He really wanted to say that cooperating didn’t fit this sort of environment. Don’t say look at how Happy allied with four other guilds, so we should do the same. The guilds that Happy had allied together with were all bottom-tier cheerleader guilds. The relationship between those guilds weren’t as tense. They were never really competitors in these boss battles anyways. It was like giving medicine to a dead horse. They might as well just ally together. Blue Brook Guild wasn’t in the same position as them though!</p>
<p>Changing Spring was still pondering over how to explain this to Yu Wenzhou, but then Yu Wenzhou told him who he was planning on cooperating with: Ye Xiu!</p>
<p>Lord Grim!</p>
<p>Changing Spring was more used to calling people by their in-game names. Yu Wenzhou actually wanted to cooperate with that guy! Changing Spring could feel his head going numb.</p>
<p>This was the first phrase that floated into Changing Spring’s mind. That guy was too treacherous. If they cooperated with him, they would be nibbled down to the very bone!</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu! This… isn’t this a bit hard?” Changing Spring heard who their collaborator would be. He couldn’t even manage to think about how he should words things and immediately expressed his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Hm? What do you mean?” Yu Wenzhou asked.</p>
<p>“According to our experiences interacting with him, he isn’t very trustworthy!” Changing Spring’s head shook like a rattle drum.”</p>
<p>“Really? His reputation is that poor?” Yu Wenzhou laughed.</p>
<p>“More like there isn’t anything good to say about it.” Changing Spring grit his teeth.</p>
<p>“As one of his competitors, of course you wouldn’t feel anything good from him. Have you ever seriously cooperated with him before?” Yu Wenzhou said.</p>
<p>“This…..” Changing Spring hesitated. When Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim entered the Heavenly Domain, they were already huge enemies. They had been trying to stop him the entire time. Cooperate? Changing Spring felt his face turn red. In the beginning, he didn’t know that this person was God Ye Qiu. Most of their thinking had been on how to recruit him. Recalling how they had actually been thinking about recruiting this God to get him to do labor for the guild, Changing Spring suddenly felt like he had been quite bold too.</p>
<p>“Blue Bridge, when you were in the tenth server, you interacted with him a lot. What are your thoughts?” Changing Spring asked Blue River.</p>
<p>“Uh, if it’s from a cooperative perspective, I feel like he’s reliable…..” Blue River couldn’t help but think of the tenth server and how the God had been hired by them to do work for the guild. The prices that Ye Xiu gave them made Blue River feel like Ye Xiu was a very understanding person. He wasn’t trying to cheat them and it was best not to try cheat him either. Under these conditions, the relationships between the two of them had been quite a happy one. How did they end up trying to kill each other? Blue River carefully recalled. It seemed to be when that guy stopped being up for hire and started doing his own work. Then, that guy monopolized all sorts of records, so the pioneering guilds stopped working with him and wanted to show him their might….</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Blue River realized that the top guilds had tried to suppress a competitor, except it turned out that their competitor was a God. In the end, they were like soldiers abandoning their armor as the furious dragon attacked them.</p>
<p>In this story, what they had viewed as the evil sect wasn’t really an evil sect. Weren’t they the bunch of bastards trying to bully the weak?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Blue River suddenly wanted to cry. From his understanding, evil sects always had the advantage at first, but then they would always be destroyed by the righteous sects. When had there ever been a lowly evil sect covered in dirt? That evil sect would be too weak, no?</p>
<p>“Then, are we going to be joining their five guild alliance?” Changing Spring said in a daze.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary. When the battle is in our grasp, we should have full rights to the boss. When the situation is hazier, considering a cooperation with them might give us a chance to turn things around! If you take a look at Happy, that’s pretty much what they’re doing. If they can take the boss alone, they won’t join up with the other guilds and share their spoils.” Yu Wenzhou said.</p>
<p>“I understand.” Changing Spring nodded his head.</p>
<p>Because Yu Wenzhou had decided to give up, Blue Brook Guild retreated from Gray Corner’s Black Market. The other guilds were still looking around. In the end, Xiao Shiqin was able to find traces of the boss, but they were too late. The boss was already about to collapse.</p>
<p>“So you actually found us. Why don’t you take a look at the time though?” Ye Xiu welcomed Xiao Shiqin, but he didn’t put up his guard. At this point, any guild with a bit of perceptiveness would have left already. Xiao Shiqin was an understanding person, yet he sill insisted on searching for them. Ye Xiu reckoned that he had other motives.</p>
<p>“So you ran here.” Xiao Shiqin sighed.</p>
<p>“What? Are you studying my tactics?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Haha.” Xiao Shiqin laughed, but didn’t answer back.</p>
<p>“If there’s ever an opportunity, there’s no harm in cooperating together.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“That sounds good.” Xiao Shiqin said and sent a friend request.</p>
<p>“No need to add me as a friend. If anything comes up, just message me on QQ. This bro’s got tens of alternates, how would you know which alt I’m using?” Ye Xiu didn’t hesitate to reject it.</p>
<p>Chapter 1095: Immortals Fighting</p>
<p>Another announcement for Happy killing the Level 75 wild boss Brawler Killer Dinglong was issued. Even though the vast majority of players had no way of participating in wild boss battles, that didn’t mean they didn’t care, especially the veterans. They were fully aware that wild boss battles directly affected a team’s strength. It could be considered as the second battlefield for pros outside the league.</p>
<p>And this week, of the Level 75 bosses, Happy had already taken down three of them. Such might made the other guilds feel gloomy, while shocking the rest of the players.</p>
<p>But in reality, this time’s Brawler Killer Dinglong didn’t solely belong to Happy. Their guild name was the one that appeared on TV, but Heavenly Justice, Parade, Radiant, and Conquering Clouds had participated too. Even though those four guilds had been a part of the backdrop, having a vast number of troops had been extremely crucial. The amount of work that they put in might not be much, but their contributions were essential. Ye Xiu’s generous treatment towards his alliance buddies made the four alliance guild leaders feel very embarrassed. They stubbornly insisted that he take a greater share, while they split the rest evenly amongst themselves.</p>
<p>After splitting up the spoils, the four guilds promptly expressed their wishes. The representative for these four guilds was Heavenly Justice’s guild leader, Team Heavenly Sword’s team captain, and Club Heavenly Sword’s boss, Lou Guanning. The holy trinity was too tyrannical. In the Alliance, only Lou Guanning possessed such status.</p>
<p>“God, why didn’t you call us for the last two bosses? Don’t forget about us!” Lou Guanning said.</p>
<p>“Yeah yeah yeah!” Those three guild leaders immediately added in their voices.</p>
<p>Happy had enjoyed the last two wild bosses alone, putting these four guilds into a state of panic. As Happy advanced through the Challenger League to beating Excellent Era to win the finals, their popularity had risen to new heights. In the end, they were also able to establish quite a powerful guild. Moreover, new guilds that developed along with the team were the most passionate and energetic. It was easy for guild members to disregard their own gains and losses, putting their efforts into strengthening the team. As a result, the four allied guilds felt like the importance of their alliance was dropping. In fact, Happy had already taken down two wild bosses on their own without their help.</p>
<p>Five guilds cooperating together meant splitting the boss’s spoils into five. And now, Happy had just taken down two wild bosses independently, which was equivalent to the five guild alliance taking down ten bosses. This comparison was too daunting. Anyone would know which choice to take. Thus, if Happy truly had the ability and renounced their partnership to take flight alone, the other four guilds wouldn’t blame Happy. If they were in Happy’s position, they would also make the same choice. In the end, everyone was working together for their own benefit. Joining hands and prospering together didn’t exist here because there could only ever be one champion.</p>
<p>Happy taking down two wild bosses on their own worried the four guilds. Lou Guanning had been looking for an opportunity to communicate this with Ye Xiu. Then, after another boss spawned, Ye Xiu called over the alliance to gather. Once this boss was taken care of, the four guilds huddled up and discussed with each other. In the end, they directly raised this issue with Ye Xiu, wanting to see what response Happy would give. Everyone had been working happily together for a long time. No one had been cheated. Suddenly, Happy went out alone without telling them. There were definitely unspoken criticism from them, but the problem was that they had never agreed that if a wild boss came, they must share it. The agreement was just that if the opportunity arose, everyone could work together, that’s all.</p>
<p>As a result, the four guilds had no grounds to criticize him, so Lou Guanning asked half-jokingly, hinting to Ye Xiu what their thoughts were.</p>
<p>How could Ye Xiu not understand the meaning behind his words? He laughed: “Is there really a need for me to say it? You all understand. After all, no team ever helps another for the fun of it, no?”</p>
<p>Lou Guanning heard his response and wanted to cry!</p>
<p>He was so direct. It was as if he were stating the obvious, and the four of them asking this question really made them seem foolish and naive. It went without saying. Everyone was fully aware. Not laying it bare could be considered as leaving them some face, but now that they had insisted on an answer, look, look how awkward the atmosphere is.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lou Guanning and the other guild leaders were familiar with Ye Xiu. They immediately composed themselves and laughed: “You’re right! If an opportunity arises in the future, don’t forget to call us!”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Ye Xiu smiled. In fact, he had called them over to kill Brawler Killer Dinglong for this very reason.</p>
<p>Lou Guanning had nothing else to say. The other three weren’t that familiar with Ye Xiu. They might have some other thoughts, but nothing would change because Ye Xiu’s words were spot on: in the end, they were still competitors. No team helped another for the fun of it. At least, that was definitely the case for them.</p>
<p>“Then, we’ll see each other again if anything comes up. We’ll be going first.” The three guilds bade farewell.</p>
<p>“Mm mm, see you.” Ye Xiu sent off the other guilds. Happy also called it a day. In-game matters continued to be taken care of by Wu Chen and Chen Guo. Ye Xiu and the others followed their usual routine and went on with their practice.</p>
<p>For their current practice, apart from improving their individual skill and teamwork, they also began analyzing their opponents. This work used to be done by Ye Xiu alone, but now he was having the entire team analyze. After all, he couldn’t micromanage everything that happened on the battlefield. More often than not, the players needed to make their own decisions. Understanding their opponents was homework that no player could ignore. In the Challenger League, the vast majority of their opponents had nothing worth looking into, but it was different now. For the current Happy, these 19 teams were like towering mountains. There were too too many things to study. What Happy lacked the most wasn’t skilled players or materials or equipment, but time.</p>
<p>Even so, they couldn’t go too crazy. A healthy schedule was also necessary, especially after last season’s finals. The issue of Tyranny’s stamina issue had triggered a fervent discussion. Now, no one would ignore the effects of keeping a solid schedule.</p>
<p>Happy needed large amounts of materials, but playing 24/7 to get every single boss was no longer something that the team would do. As a result, the fourth wild boss that spawned this week didn’t fall into Happy’s hands. Guild Happy had gotten the message and went to participate, without Ye Xiu watching over, their competitiveness instantly fell. This was also one reason why those four guilds in the alliance were gloomy, seeing Happy wanting to fly out alone. Everyone knew the value of having a skilled commander, let alone a top expert like Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>After a chaotic battle, the fourth wild boss this week, Gray Corner’s Underground Dark Hand, a Fighter, Gunner, and Nightwalker specialized boss, was snatched by Tyrannical Ambition. No pro players participated in this scuffle. According to the participants in this fight, this time’s boss competition gave them an almost serene feeling.</p>
<p>This type of serenity was quite rare. Tomorrow, when the sun came out, the pro players would pour onto the battlefield. The pro players on vacation were more free. At least, they weren’t required to practice during vacation. Practice was up to them to decide. Now that they had decided to go into the game and help the guild take wild bosses, why would the club object?</p>
<p>During the day, various battles bloomed where the bosses spawned. At night, the biggest topic in the Glory forums came from an anonymous post: what type of summer is this.</p>
<p>This summer, the number of pro players playing in the game had to be a record. In the early days, Glory was small. The number of pro players back then couldn’t compare to the number of pro players today. In this post, the original poster listed all of the pro players that he had seen during this week’s wild boss battles. From this, it could be seen that this poster was definitely an elite member of a top guild. An ordinary player wouldn’t have had the chance to participate in so many of these battles.</p>
<p>And from how the description in the post was practically incoherent, it was evident that this elite player was on the verge of collapse. Just a while before, these elite players were existences that everyone admired. Even though their roles were like jobs and they were under pressure that many players wouldn’t understand, these elite players did it in exchange for glory that ordinary players would never be able to obtain. But everything had changed now. The pro players pouring in made them… or at least, for this poster, it had resulted in a huge psychological blow to him. He didn’t know what he could do or what he could achieve. He was the fodder when immortals fought.</p>
<p>The post was pretty much just him crying and complaining the entire time. His choice to go anonymous seemed to be the last shred of clear-headedness in him. Even more pitiful for him, not only did this post not garner any sympathy, it brought laughter from all sorts of players. Seeing these elite players, who usually sat up high looking down on them, being stomped on by even more elite pro players was a form of pleasure to them. As for the pro players, how could they talk bad about them? The pro players were their idols!</p>
<p>In the end, this post became a source of laughter in this scorching summer. It had no impact on the situation. The teams were using this summer to do everything they could to strengthen themselves. They weren’t going to change just because of a single guild elite player’s complaints.</p>
<p>None of their plans changed. At this moment, the official Glory company made an announcement. Glory would be releasing a Summer Carnival event.</p>
<p>Event!</p>
<p>The players instantly knew what this meant: plenty of rewards. And the pro teams also woke up. For pro teams, events were also great opportunities to obtain generous rewards. But as per usual, if all they did was participate, the rewards would just be ordinary. The truly high-end rewards came out of intense competition. It was similar to dungeon records and wild boss battles. These types of competitions had always been what the game was about, and every event embodied this style too. Carnival. What type of competition would it be? And this time, there were so many passionate pro players participating. Just how fierce would the competition be?</p>
<p>Chapter 1096: Ghost Parade</p>
<p>Seeing the announcement, everyone naturally clicked on it to check the details and see just how much of a party it would be for it to be called a carnival.</p>
<p>But when they clicked on the page for this carnival, all they saw was a sinister ghost eerily staring back at them. The sound coming from their headphones was also the sound of evil winds. The less courageous players nearly had their hearts leap out of their throats. It was the scorching summer, but what arose from their hearts was a cold chill.</p>
<p>Summer Carnival: Ghost Parade</p>
<p>Scarlet-red words jumped out at them. At this moment, how could any of the players still felt like this was going to be a party? This event was clearly horror-themed.</p>
<p>Looking at the details, the event itself was actually quite simple. It was catching ghosts. It was a different approach to last last year’s Christmas event of catching Christmas thieves, but the end result was the same. However, the event rules this time were more detailed and complicated. After all, it didn’t coincide with a holiday.</p>
<p>The Ghost Parade would last one week. The system would release a certain amount of ghosts every day. The players just needed to find and kill these ghosts. The ghosts themselves gave experience, gold, materials, equipment, and so on. As for the more high-end rewards, those would be given out the same as always: through the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The leaderboard wasn’t as simple as the number of ghosts killed because the ghosts released could grow. As these ghosts killed players, they would grow stronger. Stronger ghosts gave more points. The total points obtained was how the leaderboard calculated rankings.</p>
<p>In the normal servers, there was a clear separation between level ranges. The Heavenly Domain was much simpler since everyone was Level 75. Apart from the points leaderboard, there were other titles that gave out rewards. It was similar to dungeon first clears; only the first player to accomplish the feat was entitled to a reward.</p>
<p>Experienced players understood enough of it with just a few glances. Glory events tended not to be too complicated. Their main feature was competition. Only rewards obtained through competing against others gave the most beautiful rewards. As for the rewards from killing ghosts, those could just be considered as participatory rewards.</p>
<p>Normal players didn’t have any hopes of making it to the top of the leaderboard, as per convention, Glory gave out final rewards depending on the player’s position on the leaderboard. No matter what ranking you got, there would be an equivalent reward for you, so no matter what, everyone would be trying their hardest. Moving up a few ranks on the leaderboards meant better rewards.</p>
<p>The Ghost Parade would start on 7/7, the second Monday of July. After the update, when the players logged on, the Glory world became similar to the event page, dark and murky. Dense black fog covered the sky. Not a single ray of light shone, yet there was no rain either. The entire world sunk into a fog of gray.</p>
<p>There were no demons yet. The first wave would appear at 7 PM. In the next few days, the other waves would also come out at 7 PM.</p>
<p>In this dark world, the players did their usual work as they waited for 7 PM to come.</p>
<p>At 7 PM, the sound of a bell toll suddenly rang throughout the entire Glory world. No matter what corner of the world you were in, even inside a dungeon, the bell toll resounded in everyone’s ears. The bell tolled seven times and the system released five huge scarlet words: Ghost Parade.</p>
<p>“AH!!!!” In a main city somewhere, an ear-piercing scream echoed. A female Blade Master leaped back four times, but still failed to break away from the pursuit of a bunch of round wooden barrels. These wooden barrels had originally just been very ordinary decorations on the streets. The players walked past them everyday. No one really paid any attention to them. At most, a bored player might step on it and jump around.</p>
<p>But when the announcement of the Ghost Parade came out, these wooden barrels seemed to have come alive.</p>
<p>That female Blade Master originally had her back to the wooden barrels on the lookout for these hundred ghosts to appear. How could she have known that there would be movement behind her? When she turned around, she saw these wooden barrels come to life, bending and twisting. A few of the lids on the buckets shook. It was as if these barrels were trying to swallow her.</p>
<p>The female player cried out in fear and hastily retreated. By the time the surrounding players noticed the commotion going on here, they saw a bunch of wooden barrels chasing after that female player. The female player wasn’t able to escape. Her Blade Master was instantly swallowed up by the barrels. Then, the barrels dispersed. A beauty had passed away. Only a belt was left. Equipment actually dropped!</p>
<p>The players were shocked!</p>
<p>This barrel ghost killed someone in an instant. These ghosts weren’t as simple as people had thought.</p>
<p>Without a clear grasp of the situation, the surrounding players didn’t dare rashly advance. However, the wooden barrels took the initiative. The ghost chose another player on the streets and charged over. There were barrels rolling on the ground and barrels jumping into the air. One of the barrels had even leaped several meters into the air, crashing down like the fall of Mt. Tai.</p>
<p>“What’s going on!!” The targeted player cried out and wanted to escape too, but these barrels had surrounded him, trapping him in the center. Following afterwards, the barrels converged and the player died.</p>
<p>The players on the street were struck dumb. They had been waiting for the ghosts to spawn, waiting to fight for every second, but then a bunch of dirty wooden barrels popped up and killed two people in just this short amount of time.</p>
<p>“It looks pretty strong. Ah?” A player said to his friend next to him, but he didn’t hear a reply. When he turned his head, his friend, who had clearly been by his side just before, had disappeared wordlessly.</p>
<p>“Water Mountain?” The player called out. No reply came. There was no sign of his friend anywhere either. Just when he was about to pull up his friends list and message him, he suddenly heard something rattling from behind him. He turned around to look and saw the willow tree next to him reaching out with its tentacle-like branches to catch him. At this moment, the player saw a silver badge hanging on one of the tree branches. It was his friend’s equipment.</p>
<p>The player instantly realized what had happened, but there was no time for him to scream. The willow branches climbed onto his shoulders and strangled him. His screen turned black. He couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>Health……</p>
<p>The only thing that this player could see was his health falling rapidly. This type of damage was enough to put this willow tree ghost at the level of a dungeon boss! Was this an opponent a player could solo? Dungeons were always played with a team.</p>
<p>The player fell into despair. He was ready to meet up with his friend. Suddenly, he heard several snaps. He could suddenly see again. Countless sword light linked together, cutting the willow tree ghost’s branches into bits and pieces.</p>
<p>The player couldn’t bother with thinking too much. He immediately struggled free and jumped back. Then, he saw that player also jump back. Those were clearly a Blade Master’s slashes, but then a fireball suddenly shot out from his fingers.</p>
<p>Fireball?</p>
<p>The player stared foolishly. Even if this was a low-leveled Elementalist skill, it shouldn’t be coming out from a Blade Master’s hands!</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, when he saw that person’s ID, he immediately understood. Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Lord Grim!</p>
<p>God Ye Xiu’s unspecialized – Lord Grim!</p>
<p>The player was stunned. This character hadn’t been around for very long, but he had already turned into a legend in the game. The player had heard from his friends from the tenth server about how Lord Grim had dyed the tenth server red with blood. When he arrived at the Heavenly Domain at Level 55, he was chased by Level 70 players, who were even top experts of the big guilds.</p>
<p>Then, Lord Grim’s identity was revealed. Lord Grim was God Ye Qiu. And from this moment on, Lord Grim’s life became more difficult whenever anyone met him.</p>
<p>Every famous character in the game had experienced this sort of vexation. Whenever famous characters logged on, the luckier ones would just be surrounded non-stop. The unluckier ones would be chased and killed. But for this type of large-scale event, these characters couldn’t miss it because the drop rate of all sorts of items would increase in this event. And among these items, there was one kind that was bound to a character and couldn’t be traded. Only the character who picked it up could use it, so no pro character would dare ignore it.</p>
<p>Skill books!</p>
<p>Even the most end-game content, wild bosses, very rarely dropped them. Finding a skill book from a random monster required heavenly luck. If not, these pro characters would have maxed out their stats even if they died. They wouldn’t be missing 100, 200 skill points back when they were Level 70.</p>
<p>The skill book drop rate was greatly increased like everything else, so pro characters naturally hoped to seize this opportunity. As a result, whenever a large-scale event came out, it wasn’t difficult to find pro characters. However, these pro characters wouldn’t be wearing their Silver equipment. If players killed them and their equipment dropped, it would be gigantic headache. Pro characters would just pick some random Purple or Orange characters to wear.</p>
<p>Lord Grim could obviously switch equipment too. It was just that his equipment had always just been in-game level equipment. His Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was a Silver equipment though. However, this weapon couldn’t be switched, so Lord Grim would definitely be able to show his full strength.</p>
<p>Fireballs shot out in rapid succession. The flames gradually spread until it covered the entire willow tree. The willow tree branches kept on twitching as if it were struggling. As the flames rose into the sky, it burned. Finally, it stopped moving. Lord Grim went back, raised his arms, and his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella transformed into a spear. With a Circle Swing, the willow tree was knocked into the air and then broke up into burnt chips. It had been thoroughly killed.</p>
<p>“How strange. That didn’t count as a first kill?”</p>
<p>The players on the streets were still screaming because of the various objects that had turned into ghosts. On the other hand, the God was wondering why he hadn’t gotten the first kill. This was the difference between them…</p>
<p>Chapter 1097: Intense Competition</p>
<p>The ghosts appeared so suddenly and unexpectedly, catching countless players off guard. As a result, Ye Xiu killing a ghost so easily and calmly made him seem that much more imposing. It wasn’t just the player that Ye Xiu had saved. The entire street of players quickly realized that someone over there had successfully killed a ghost.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like all that much?</p>
<p>This scene made the confidence of the players skyrocket. Quite a few immediately took out their weapons and charged at these strange phantasms.</p>
<p>Their spirited shouts quickly turned into cries of despair. Too many of them had only seen that a player had killed a ghost and hadn’t paid attention to that player’s ID.</p>
<p>Lord Grim, Ye Xiu. He was a figure that stood at the top of Glory. How could normal players hope to replicate his grandeur? Dungeon monsters weren’t that easy to kill for normal players.</p>
<p>The entire street transformed into a field of slaughter. The players hadn’t been prepared for the difficulty of this time’s Ghost Parade. Their confidence from seeing Lord Grim successfully kill the willow tree instantly disappeared into nothingness.</p>
<p>The players screamed and fled in fear. As for the imposing figure that had killed the only ghost over here, he became their savior. They couldn’t help but gather towards this player. After getting closer, they saw his name and finally understood that they had made a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>“God, save us!!” Several players begged. Lowering themselves in front of God Ye Xiu was nothing shameful.</p>
<p>“Everyone, calm down!” Ye Xiu called out, “These ghosts aren’t difficult to deal with. Pay attention to their weaknesses and then choose a target that you can easily restrain to fight! If that’s not enough, party up.”</p>
<p>Yes, if they couldn’t solo an enemy, partying with others was the easiest solution. The players in the game should understand. It was just that for this event, would playing alone or partying with others give more rewards? The players needed to consider this question before deciding, so no one had immediately formed a party. However, after realizing that these ghosts weren’t so easy to kill along with Ye Xiu’s advice, the players started calling over their friends or searching for a party to join. Ye Xiu received countless party invites.</p>
<p>As for the ghosts’ weaknesses……</p>
<p>“What type of weaknesses do they have, God?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>“I’m studying them too.” Ye Xiu replied. It was his first time seeing these types of monsters, “Wood is afraid of fire. Fire is afraid of water. Basic logic shouldn’t be wrong.”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu had tested this theory before. For example, against that willow tree, he had only thrown out a few low-leveled Fireballs, instantly burning that willow tree to ashes. It was far more efficient than hacking at the tree.</p>
<p>The players seemed to somewhat understand. At this moment, all sorts of ghosts were starting to attack them.</p>
<p>Look for weaknesses! The players started racking their brains. The very first ghost that had charged over at them made them want to cry. Wooden barrels. What was its weakness?</p>
<p>Fire?</p>
<p>These barrels were made of wood. Players with fire element attacks tried their hand, but it didn’t seem too effective.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The players pondered over this question but couldn’t figure it out. Ye Xiu was standing on the side and also sweating. When he said weaknesses, he had just been speculating. Who knew if all these ghosts had weaknesses? However, right now, the players were bitterly searching for one as if they were following an imperial decree. Ye Xiu suddenly felt like there was a lot of pressure on him.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, someone suddenly yelled in pleasant surprise: “Attack the bottom! Attack the bottom of these barrels. The lower you go, the lower their defense!”</p>
<p>Everyone was startled, but quickly responded. If a barrel didn’t have a bottom, then it couldn’t be used, so the bottom of the barrel was the weakness?</p>
<p>It was quite logical, but anyone who thought of such an answer had to be a bit crazy.</p>
<p>After finding this weakness, the players discovered that these buckets weren’t that difficult. A bunch of wooden barrel bottoms were destroyed. These wooden barrels instantly lost their liveliness. They fell to the ground and rolled around powerlessly.</p>
<p>“Kill!” Their morales had truly risen this time. After figuring out the trick, they suddenly became fearless.</p>
<p>As for Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>His goals weren’t so low. As he looked for monsters to kill, he checked the leaderboards.</p>
<p>The leaderboards were dazzling to the eyes. The event had just begun, but the pro players were already displaying what true strength was. The first ten and even as far as the first twenty places were occupied by pro players.</p>
<p>Troubling Rain, Vaccaria, Cloud Piercer, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, Desert Dust, Demon Subduer……</p>
<p>The previous events also had leaderboards, but they weren’t fully occupied by pro characters because if it wasn’t an event taking place during a holiday, pro players wouldn’t usually be the ones playing on these characters. It was usually someone from the guild department playing in their place. The staff members of the guild department could be considered elite experts in the game, but they were far from possessing the dominating skill of pro players. However, the Ghost Parade happened to take place during the summer. The pro players personally took up the task, resulting in them sweeping the leaderboards.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu looked at his ranking. He wasn’t in the top ten, but he wasn’t too far away either. He was currently ranked 16. Surrounding him were a bunch of pro characters. The points were constantly fluctuating. A few moments later, he dropped from 16 to 18, overtaken by Flying Sword and Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s working hard!” Ye Xiu mumbled. He couldn’t relax either. The street that he was on had quite a few ghosts, but there were also quite a few players. Everyone was fighting over them. No matter how skilled he was, it was hard to avoid his efficiency dropping. A quiet and desolate place was ideal. Unfortunately, when Ye Xiu logged on, he couldn’t find any good places. He could only blame it on his bad luck.</p>
<p>Yes, luck.</p>
<p>In this type of event, technical skill and tactical skill were secondary. Luck was most important, especially for pro players who were all at the similar skill levels. Only normal players would flee in terror because of these ghosts.</p>
<p>However, the normal players had started forming parties and helping one another as if it were a dungeon. Their combat power instantly shot up. The ghosts on this street were quickly cleared. Ye Xiu found the time to check the leaderboards again and found that he had already dropped outside of the top 20.</p>
<p>Only a fixed number of ghosts spawned every day all in one wave. As time went on, trying to catch up to those ahead required even greater luck. Today clearly wasn’t Ye Xiu’s day. After that street was swept clean, he looked for another place to hunt, but his kills were intermittent. He continued to fall on the leaderboards, making Ye Xiu feel even more helpless.</p>
<p>After going around several blocks, Ye Xiu realized with astonishment that there were bunch of tails following behind his butt.</p>
<p>Yes, not just one tail, but a bunch.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim stopped on a stone bridge in the city and turned around. He could already recognize some of their names. However, these guys were still pretending. Some of them were switching equipment. Some of them acted like they were chatting with each other. Some of them even pretended like they were just passing by, walking past Lord Grim.</p>
<p>“Which guild are you guys from?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>No one paid him any attention. They continued with their act.</p>
<p>“Stop pretending. You, the one following me since that clock tower. You, the one from the river area four. You, you were at that street in the very beginning, no?” Ye Xiu pointed at a few characters. They finally stopped pretending and started backing away cautiously. They were also sizing up the other players around them.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’re not all from the same guild?” Ye Xiu saw this scene and said.</p>
<p>Still no one answered. Ye Xiu didn’t need them to answer. These guys obviously weren’t here to admire him and ask for his signature. The big guilds had found his location and sent people here to mess things up for him. They couldn’t stop him, but they could at least slow him down.</p>
<p>“How mean! Who sent these people to follow behind my butt!!” Those players weren’t going to talk, so Ye Xiu could only go to the pro player chat group and fiercely denounce the conduct of these guilds.</p>
<p>No one paid him any mind.</p>
<p>Everyone was playing the game, and the pro player chat group was unexpectedly dead. How long had it been in the pro scene since everyone had gone into the game? Ye Xiu felt a bit dazed.</p>
<p>“Wu Chen, have our guild members take note of where the other pro characters are located.” Ye Xiu returned to the game and messaged Wu Chen. His Lord Grim was also in Guild Happy. Any orders that he gave in the guild would naturally be followed. However, their guild leader was still Wu Chen and since this was a new guild, establishing a guild leader’s authority was very important. Pro players abusing their statuses to do certain things in the guild was harmful to the guild’s management.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.” Wu Chen replied back and then announced it to the guild.</p>
<p>Guild Happy had also reached max capacity. There were certainly spies from other guilds inside. Five minutes hadn’t even passed since Wu Chen’s announcement and the pro player chat group started livening up again.</p>
<p>“Revenge breeds revenge*.” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>“There will never be an end to it!” Huang Shaotian finished the saying, but a sentence was too short, so he added in his own personal opinion: “Old Ye, do you really need to do that? Insisting on a going an eye for an eye is too unsightly!”</p>
<p>“Exactly! Events like this don’t come often. Let’s all be friends!” Samsara’s Jiang Botao also spoke his opinion.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you guys tell your guilds to withdraw the people tailing me?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Yes yes yes…” The pro players expressed. Not long afterwards, the anonymous stalkers gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>“Okay, there’s nothing wrong now, right? Let’s all have a friendly competition. Old Ye, you’ve gotta work harder! When I check the leaderboards, I can’t even see you!” Huang Shaotian said. His Troubling Rain was currently number one on the leaderboards. It was a rare chance for him to gloat.</p>
<p>But in time it took for him to type out these few words, the leaderboards suddenly changed.</p>
<p>“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!” Huang Shaotian roared in the chat group. Zhou Zekai’s Cloud Piercer had jumped from third to first, pushing Troubling Rain down to second.</p>
<p>“Ha.” Zhou Zekai rarely spoke in the chat group, and he only said one word.</p>
<p>Chapter 1098: Seaweed Monster</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian wouldn’t be Huang Shaotian if he didn’t shoot back. However, Ye Xiu wasn’t in the mood to admire his trash talking. He might have gotten rid of his tails, but his placing on the rankings hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>32.</p>
<p>That was his current placing. The street he began on had helped him stay in the top twenty, but after leaving the street, Ye Xiu’s luck wasn’t very good. He didn’t meet enough monsters to let him keep his position. His current 32nd place was temporary and considering how peaceful the street that he was on was, his placing would probably fall even more when he reached the end of the road.</p>
<p>No matter what, he couldn’t just stay there and not move. The ghosts spawned at the same time. If they weren’t there, they weren’t there; it wasn’t like you could wait at their respawn point for them to respawn.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu had Lord Grim walk over the stone bridge and ended up at a crossroads with a left, middle, and right path. However, all three choices seemed equally peaceful. Ye Xiu wanted to cry. Why was he so unfortunate today?</p>
<p>Let’s just keep walking! Ye Xiu thought to himself as Lord Grim stepped onto the bridge. He was about to continue walking when, suddenly, he realized that he couldn’t step forward. Next, his character’s view spun and Lord Grim was thrown to the ground.</p>
<p>Where did this attack come from? Ye Xiu was stunned.</p>
<p>The moment Lord Grim was about to hit the ground, he hastily Quick Recovered, but it didn’t work. The strike had been a grab, but it somehow managed to close in on Ye Xiu without him noticing, striking a direct hit.</p>
<p>It was only after his character had been pulled to the ground that Ye Xiu saw what had hit him as he turned Lord Grim’s view. Something had tangled itself around Lord Grim’s ankle.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t even have the time to look at it clearly when it suddenly yanked backwards. Ye Xiu slashed at it as it moved and Lord Grim’s sword struck an accurate hit, but nothing happened. The thing shrank and then, with a flick, pulled Lord Grim upwards into the air. With this, Ye Xiu had a clear view. This weird thing that came out of nowhere had crept out of the lake under the stone bridge. Seaweed covered the lake surface, almost entirely, and it was impossible to see what was actually at the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>Lord Grim switched the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella to its gun form and sent a Gatling Gun towards this unknown monster. Water splashed everywhere and seaweed flew into the air, but this thing was still unaffected just like when he slashed at it. Ye Xiu still couldn’t tell what was under the lake. Then, with a splash, Lord Grim was pulled under the water.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>As soon as he went under, Ye Xiu looked around, but didn’t find anything. The thing around Lord Grim’s ankle was still there. Ye Xiu followed it upwards with his eyes and suddenly realized, how come it was coming from above the water now?</p>
<p>What monster was this?! Ye Xiu could feel a headache coming on. If there was any difficulty in the Ghost Parade, then for Ye Xiu, it would be what he was currently experiencing: the ghosts were all completely new NPCs. He had never previously encountered any of them in game, so he didn’t know any of their characteristics or skills. Even Gods were newbies when up against these completely new monsters.</p>
<p>And now, Ye Xiu had encountered a very tricky one. Although he had confidence he could defeat his target, every minute spent on it was a minute lost. Just look, he had already fallen to 35 in this short span of time. Ye Xiu was still in the claws of this monster, but he still had time to check the rankings, finding he had fallen by another three places already.</p>
<p>In that instant, the monster finally launched another attack, and this time, Ye Xiu finally figured out what it was.</p>
<p>It was seaweed!</p>
<p>The seaweed that covered the entire surface of the lake, green like something that had been vomited out, was the true form of this monster. No wonder it had seemed to come from under the water at first, but later seemed to come from above. This thing was on the water’s surface!</p>
<p>It had taken Ye Xiu quite a while to figure out what he was fighting and the seaweed monster had already began to attack him by then. The seaweed that had been floating on the surface suddenly sunk in clusters, like will-o-wisps.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t know what kind of attack this was, but he wouldn’t let it hit him so easily. He hastily had Lord Grim swim further down. However, something tightened around his foot. The seaweed was still tangled around Lord Grim’s ankle.</p>
<p>What a long CC!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was shocked. Even if it was an NPC, their skills still couldn’t diverge from Glory’s design. Offensive attacks dealt damage and crowd control effects lasted a duration of time. No matter if it was damage or duration, there had to be a limit. How long had this seaweed been restricting Lord Grim’s movement? How was it still doing this? How long did this ghost’s skills last for?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t have the energy to spare on complaining because the will-o-wisp seaweed that had sunk down had attacked. Their attack was very basic, just throwing themselves at Lord Grim in an attempt to hit him. However, there were too many sunken clusters of seaweed to count. He could dodge one, but if they all began to attack together, then they’d form a net and then there wouldn’t be any room to dodge.</p>
<p>He had to dodge them preemptively!</p>
<p>The seaweed was preventing him from going down, and upwards… Above him was the water surface which was covered in seaweed. Going upwards would be putting himself in the monster’s embrace, an even worse choice.</p>
<p>Hurry up and break!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu could only keep going down. Snapping the restraint around Lord Grim’s ankle became key. He slashed down again. The seaweed bent with the slash, but it refused to snap. It was clearly extremely flexible and durable…</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t have time to try out new methods and could only follow his current line of thought. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella switched to its gun form. With a bang, a bullet shot out. As the bullet left the chamber, the umbrella was transformed into a sword once more, striking down.</p>
<p>The bullet hit the seaweed and the flash of the blade slashed down as well. This time, the seaweed was cut through completely. Ye Xiu hastily had Lord Grim dive as the clusters of seaweed swarmed forth, crashing together in a ball.</p>
<p>That was close!</p>
<p>It was rare for Ye Xiu to ever experience such a heart-stopping moment in the online game. After noticing the flexibility of the seaweed, Ye Xiu gave it a Spitfire’s Stun Bullet, and after causing it to tense, he was able to easily slash through it. Then his eyes landed on the cluster of seaweed behind him and had Lord Grim throw a Grenade over. It’d feel very good to blow it up.</p>
<p>As expected, it felt delightful!</p>
<p>The large cluster of seaweed was blown to pieces and several pieces hit Lord Grim. His health immediately plummeted, falling directly to red blood.</p>
<p>What the fuck!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu flailed in a panic. He immediately opened up the umbrella as a shield, while casting all his healing skills on himself and ingesting all the potions that would help him save his life. Only then was his health stabilized.</p>
<p>What a powerful attack! Ye Xiu was shocked. If just another two pieces had hit him, Lord Grim would have been KO’ed. This immense damage output was beyond anything Ye Xiu knew of. Their combative power rivaled that of dungeon monsters, but this sort of attack power was far beyond normal dungeon monsters, it was boss level, wild boss level even!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t dare underestimate this monster. The seaweed that had been blown apart by the grenade hadn’t died, floating in the water and preparing a new round of attacks.</p>
<p>How would he kill this seaweed? Would a Stun Bullet work again them? Ye Xiu had little to go on, but knew he had to try. He shot a small cluster of seaweed and struck down with his sword right after. The small cluster immediately broke apart, dispersing in the water as if it had dissolved.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was certain now, but he wasn’t happy. With the seaweed covering the entire surface of the lake, how many attacks would he have to make to kill it completely?</p>
<p>As for how the seaweed got so strong, Ye Xiu immediately got the gist. This seaweed floated ever so peacefully on the water’s surface like that, a very cunning disguise. Then, it would ambush passing players. Even Ye Xiu didn’t realize what was happening after being caught, so there was little need to explain how much worse it would be for normal players. Continuously managing to kill players this way, the seaweed monster had grown this strong.</p>
<p>Should he count himself lucky or unlucky? Ye Xiu didn’t know. Such a large monster would definitely provide many points, so he should be happy about finding it. The problem was, this monster wasn’t just big, but powerful. Could he beat it?</p>
<p>This thing’s attack power rivalled a wild boss. If its health was also that shocking, then Ye Xiu would just give up on it entirely. But for now, he decided to take a shot.</p>
<p>The small clusters of seaweed were just a method of attack for the seaweed monster. Destroying them was just defending himself. If he wanted to kill this monster, he had to attack its main body, the seaweed that was floating on the water’s surface. However, he had to deal with these small clusters first.</p>
<p>Not long later, Ye Xiu baited the small clusters of seaweed into trying to catch him again like before. Then, at the last minute, he dodged.</p>
<p>The small clusters of seaweed once again clustered up into a larger group. Lord Grim turned and delivered a Stun Bullet before his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella swung up as a spear, Dragon Tooth stabbing up before a Double Stab followed. As for skills like Falling Flower Palm that required him to get even closer, Ye Xiu didn’t dare use them before he tested them out. After the Double Stab, he finished it off with a Sword Draw.</p>
<p>The three skills were completed in an instant, and with the whooshing sound of flowing water, the scattered seaweed vanished.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>With this experiment a success, Ye Xiu’s spirits lifted. The seaweed monster was above him. After this experiment, Ye Xiu had a good idea of how to deal with it. Now he had to see if he could destroy the main body of the seaweed monster with the same method. If it had the durability of a wild boss, then he’d leave immediately.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Lord Grim entered attack range of the water’s surface, flicking his sleeves and gathering a chunk of the seaweed on the water’s surface into a ball with a Shadow Cloak. Then, a Stun Bullet and an attack!</p>
<p>Chapter 1099: Jumping to Number One</p>
<p>Dragon Tooth, Double Stab, Sword Draw!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu chose to continue use what had worked before, except that after three skills, the cluster of seaweed was still good and well. The durability of the main body was, as expected, slightly better. However, it was only slightly. Ye Xiu quickly followed up with a fourth skill and, at last, the seaweed he had gathered with Shadow Cloak dispersed into nothingness. Ye Xiu gave a long sigh of relief. In that moment, he had been rather nervous, because the effects of Stun Bullet had a limit to its duration. When he had delivered the first strike, he knew that the problem wouldn’t lie in if he could deal enough damage to destroy the main body or not, but time. Could he deal enough damage in the time given by the Stun Bullet?</p>
<p>In the end, he succeeded. This made Ye Xiu feel much more secure. Lord Grim jumped out of the water, right through the destroyed cluster of seaweed. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened into a Rotor Wings and he immediately left the water behind him.</p>
<p>The seaweed monster wasn’t willing to let go of its target so easily, hurriedly sending out a tentacle to catch him. Ye Xiu had been expecting that and had Lord Grim rise up at full speed. The seaweed wasn’t slow either, but characters could move around in the air with Rotor Wings, so Ye Xiu would naturally use this to dodge. Ye Xiu wasn’t planning to leave. Leaving the lake surface was just to wait for his skill cooldown. Low levelled skills always had short cooldowns, but those that had a bonus effect like Stun Bullet would have a longer cooldown, otherwise, if someone could endlessly keep their opponents CCed – and one like stun, too – there’d be no need to fight.</p>
<p>Stun Bullet’s cooldown was a full ten seconds and Ye Xiu was currently trying to last through these ten seconds. However, he wouldn’t just keep dodging. As he dodged, Lord Grim threw a Grenade down. The surface of the lake exploded. Though this didn’t really do any damage to the seaweed, since it had come out of the water, the seaweed had all been squeezed into a cluster.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was relieved. If he could gather the seaweed like this, then killing the seaweed monster would become much faster.</p>
<p>Soon enough, the cooldown for Stun Bullet was over and Lord Grim landed as Rotor Wings ended, striking his sword at the water’s surface and sending out an Earthquake Sword to sweep the seaweed together. Then, he added a Shadow Cloak. This time, he had gathered even more seaweed, but when Lord Grim began to attack, Ye Xiu knew that this wasn’t good.</p>
<p>The more he gathered, the more health the seaweed had. This was a very logical design. Ye Xiu hadn’t neglected that, of course. He had gathered the seaweed this time with the intention of trying things out. After making so many attempts, he was now certain he’d be unable to destroy the seaweed in the time the Stun Bullet gave him.</p>
<p>Stun Bullet’s stun effect lasted for two seconds and this duration wouldn’t see much increase as the skill’s rank was raised. After all, the control effect of a stun was very powerful. An eight or ten second stun would be beyond broken. When Stun Bullet was maxed out, the stun effect would only be increased to 3.5 seconds, so it was up to the player to decide how many ranks to raise it in accordance to their reliance and usage of Stun Bullet. Lord Grim’s Stun Bullet was only rank one with the basic two second stun. Using four skills in two seconds was already his limit and Ye Xiu had to make sure he didn’t slip up at all. Now, the seaweed had even more health, so Lord Grim, with his abysmal damage output, wouldn’t be able to destroy such a large cluster no matter what.</p>
<p>This result was greatly disappointing for Ye Xiu. However, with two rounds of gathering to go on, he now knew very clearly on how much to gather at one time. Then, all he had to do was repeat.</p>
<p>The seaweed was cleared up bit by bit by Ye Xiu and the lake soon returned to its original clean state.</p>
<p>He was nearly done.</p>
<p>Seeing the two clusters of seaweed over there, Lord Grim swam over and then Ye Xiu heard voices coming from the bank.</p>
<p>“It’s right over here!”</p>
<p>“We don’t know how many players it’s killed already. This seaweed monster is extremely powerful, so keep your guards up.”</p>
<p>“However, we’ve already found a way to defeat it. Witches and Spitfires, make sure to cooperate. You’re the key.”</p>
<p>A large group of people had gathered at the lakeside. Normal players weren’t idiots either, having also found a way to deal with the seaweed monster. It was just that they had no way of completing all the steps on their own, so they could only get helpers to cooperate with them. The group of people had excitedly rushed over to kill this massive monster, but what they were met with was a clear lake. Where did the seaweed that was said to be taking over the lake?</p>
<p>“Shit! No way!”</p>
<p>Some observant players quickly noticed Lord Grim’s existence, swimming to a cluster of seaweed, Shadow Cloak, Stun Bullet, then a rapid stream of combos… Wasn’t this the strategy their team leader had been emphasising the whole way here?</p>
<p>“Are you goddamn kidding me?!”</p>
<p>The one who had gathered all these people here was a Spitfire player. The first time he had came, he had been ambushed by the seaweed monster and killed. Then, running over to get his revenge, he had been killed again. He couldn’t accept it and came again. By then, the seaweed monster had grown quite a bit and he was even less of a match, but this time he had discovered a way to kill the seaweed monster. The fourth time, he had charged over, thinking that knowing the method to killing the monster would assure his victory, but he had underestimated the strength of the seaweed monster. After dying four times in a row, he finally relented and went and gathered a team, also figuring out a good way to gather the monster. However, by the time he returned, he found most of the seaweed gone and the one who did it had done so with the method he had gained through four sacrifices.</p>
<p>“Who dares!” The leader was enraged. He thought that this person had been watching him and stole his method. He was a dirty thief.</p>
<p>Chasing after the figure along the bank, the team leader held up his gun to shoot, but was suddenly knocked into by one of his companions. With a stumble, his shot missed.</p>
<p>“What?” The team leader was furious.</p>
<p>“Are you stupid? Shadow Cloak, then Stun Bullet afterwards, then followed up with a combo including Sword Draw. Can’t you tell who this is through those variety of skills?” The one who had knocked into the team leader said.</p>
<p>The team leader paused. In the past, if anyone saw a character using skills across different class types, they’d think it was an NPC, but now, all the players knew that there was such an existence: God Ye Xiu and his unspecialized, Lord Grim.</p>
<p>The team leader trembled as he walked along the bank a little further, and by then, Lord Grim was also swimming towards the last cluster of seaweed. The name above his head was finally visible to the team leader.</p>
<p>Lord Grim. Sure enough, it was Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Immediately, the misunderstanding of stealing his method was dismissed. If he couldn’t even figure out this method on his own, then would he still be God Ye Xiu? It was just that the team leader had been bustling around, sacrificing himself and gathering helpers, confidently returning to reap his profits, but in the end he didn’t even manage to get the scraps. That was too depressing…</p>
<p>“There’s another cluster!” The team leader couldn’t accept this. “Witches, go, Shadow Cloak!”</p>
<p>The Witch didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you guys doing anything? Did you disconnect? You there?” The leader yelled.</p>
<p>“And try to steal God Ye Xiu’s kill? Are you crazy?” The Witch asked in shock.</p>
<p>“But I found it first!” The team leader wailed.</p>
<p>“Found it first…” The entire team was speechless. Though they understood this guy’s feelings, you might have “found it first”, but if you “found it first” yet didn’t kill it first, then it wasn’t yours. This was common sense.</p>
<p>“Go on, hurry up and go!” The team leader went to yell at another Witch, seeing that the first one refused to move.</p>
<p>This one seemed to be close with the team leader and didn’t have the heart to reject the other. However, he went up slowly, raising his broom into the air for several seconds without doing anything. By the time he was done posing, Lord Grim had ended the battle. The one who had been about to attack turned back around in relief. “Oops, it’s too late now…”</p>
<p>The team leader cried. However, he neither had the skill or a good reason to bother Ye Xiu about this. What made him even more jealous was that after the seaweed monster was killed, Lord Grim’s position on the rankings had managed to instantly jump to first.</p>
<p>The team leader hadn’t noticed at first. What brought it to their attention was someone suddenly yelling about it in the global chat.</p>
<p>“Fuck fuck fuck!! What cheat did you use, Ye Xiu!? How did you suddenly get to first, did you kill the GM?! You cheat, I’m reporting you, isn’t there a GM here to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen?!”</p>
<p>The cathartic speech came from Huang Shaotian’s Troubling Rain. The entirety of Glory was silent. No one had thought they would get the chance to admire Huang Shaotian’s trash talk in the game’s global chat.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian had been overtaken by Zhou Zekai, but then his luck had been pretty good and rapidly took his place back. As for Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim, he was thirty something already, so Huang Shaotian had disregarded him as a competitor. But that was when he killed a monster and wanted to check his score, only to be met with Lord Grim’s name above his Troubling Rain’s.</p>
<p>Am I seeing this correctly?</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian rubbed his eyes and after confirming what he had seen, immediately exploded in rage in the global chat.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu himself had noticed before him. This seaweed monster had managed to raise his points all the way to first place. He was also very surprised at that. Immediately, he thought of an idea of getting a bunch of smurfs to feed up a monster and then killing it with his main account, then noticed Huang Shaotian’s yelling in the global chat.</p>
<p>“Ha.” Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>None of the the players found anything out of the ordinary about this, but the pro players were all laughing their heads off by then.</p>
<p>Just now, in the pro player chat, didn’t Zhou Zekai give the same response when Huang Shaotian had been trash talking after being overtaken by Zhou Zekai? Now Ye Xiu was copying Zhou Zekai. Huang Shaotian was probably choking on his anger by now. The global chat in the game had a message cooldown, so he couldn’t spam. Instead, the pro player chat was flooded by him.</p>
<p>Seeing the number of new messages jumping rapidly, Ye Xiu knew that it had to be Huang Shaotian erupting again, as well as those who were greeting him despite knowing that he was just trash talking. Ye Xiu was thinking about the possibility of raising a monster. The only thing he wasn’t sure about was how many characters he’d have to feed to a monster to get it to grow to this level. Was an experiment necessary?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu thought about this as he had Lord Grim climb back onto the bank. On the bank, the team of players stood there, stunned. After the trash talk in the global chat, they also realized that Lord Grim had managed to jump to first place. The sheer number of points the seaweed monster was worth was clear for all to see. Even though they wouldn’t have as many gains after the points were distributed amongst them, it would still be quite heft. But now, it was all for nothing. Everyone was disappointed, but what could they say when faced with God Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>“So amazing, God!”</p>
<p>“God, are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“Don’t rush off, God…”</p>
<p>The players fawned over Lord Grim like a paparazzi.</p>
<p>Chapter 1100: Raised Monsters</p>
<p>“Raise them?”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu couldn’t do his monster raising plan alone. He needed to coordinate with his guild for this to work. Directly asking guild members to sacrifice themselves was somewhat inhumane, so he would need to rely on his alternate accounts to complete the task.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was just about to discuss with Wu Chen how exactly they should carry this out, but Wu Chen already replied back: “This isn’t going to be easy.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve already tried it. The base value of a ghost is 100 points. If the ghost kills a player, it’s value will increase by 1. Let’s put aside issues like manpower and account cards on hand. Let’s just look at the problem with the ghost killing players. If a player doesn’t wear any armor and doesn’t defend, a ghost will need 10 or 20 seconds to kill the player. Killing 100 players is equal to 100 more points. If we average it out and say 15 seconds per person. 100 players would need 25 minutes. Of course, the ghost having the ability to attack en masse and killing faster the stronger it grows are factors, but if you consider the issue of the possible risks involved and our current manpower, raising a monster won’t be an easy task.” Wu Chen explained.</p>
<p>“Oh, understood.” Ye Xiu replied. As soon as he heard that a single player killed was only worth one more point, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy to make this work for the current Happy. Putting aside the calculations that Wu Chen made, finding enough manpower would require a lot of effort. He didn’t have enough on hand. The Internet cafe customers had account cards, but who was going to help him for no reason? Especially since all of the Glory players were all busy with this event too. As a result, his only option would be to hire people. With Happy’s current resources, he could afford it, but was that worth it just for this event?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu calculated, but then he felt that something wasn’t right. When he had killed that seaweed monster, Lord Grim had obtained 625 points. It had already killed 525 players? It had only been an hour since the event had started. It didn’t conform with Wu Chen’s calculations. How did this seaweed monster do it? Could it be that its original value was high? It had started out as a mini-boss level ghost? The event never said anything about that though!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was pondering over this mystery, when he saw a team of players from the far end of the street charging over. He recognized the person in front, Samsara’s guild leader, Three Realms Six Paths.</p>
<p>When this team reached the bridge, they hastily looked towards the water beneath the bridge. In that instant, Ye Xiu realized something. As for Three Realms Six Paths, the instant he saw Lord Grim, he stopped looking under the bridge and shouted: “FUCK YOU!!!”</p>
<p>“Uh… you guys raised it?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>He figured it out. This monster that had eaten 525 players hadn’t grown naturally. It had been intentionally raised by people. Ye Xiu hadn’t been the only one to think of raising a monster. Just look at Wu Chen. Wu Chen had already tested it before Ye Xiu had even asked. He had clearly noticed that there was a potential exploit. As for the other guilds, their in-game experience was far richer than pro players, so they had noticed it too. Those guilds had the manpower and the accounts to carry out something Happy couldn’t. As a result, raising a monster seemed to be an obvious course of action.</p>
<p>Samsara had tried, and the ghost that they found was quite a good one.</p>
<p>This seaweed monster had weak defense and low health. It seemed to be a feature that all ghosts in the Ghost Parade had in common. But apart from that, it had powerful attacks and the scattered seaweed clumps could attack many players at once, making it a ghost perfect for growing quickly.</p>
<p>Even though it had been raised……</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you have anyone guard it?” Ye Xiu raised an honest question. What had just happened was one of the “potential risks” that Wu Chen had mentioned. Ye Xiu had just taken away all of the effort that Samsara had put into the ghost, yet now he was giving them a suggestion.</p>
<p>Three Realms Six Paths wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t anyone guarding it? They obviously had people in the beginning, but as the seaweed monster became stronger, players started coming over and becoming its food. That was a cherry on top for Samsara, so not only did they not stop them, they welcomed them! As a result, the guards felt like there was no need to watch over it. They might as well just become its food and make it grow faster.</p>
<p>Lord Grim just happened to pass by and get caught by the seaweed monster. He just happened to be an unspecialized too, allowing him to kill the seaweed monster alone because of his multi-class skill set. After Samsara saw Troubling Rain cursing in the global chat, they realized something wasn’t right. They didn’t know if other guilds were raising monsters, but they were doing it. Three Realms Six Paths immediately asked the players stationed there whether the seaweed monster was safe and sound, but the team guarding the seaweed monster had sacrificed themselves and were on their way back, so when Three Realms Six Paths asked, they kept stalling.</p>
<p>Three Realms Six Paths suddenly had a bad feeling and personally went over. The others were still checking under the bridge, but Three Realms Six Paths immediately noticed that Lord Grim was on the bridge. Lord Grim had suddenly gained 600 points in one go and jumped to first place. The seaweed monster that we had painstakingly raised had been snatched away by this fucker?</p>
<p>Three Realms Six Paths felt bitter! But after cursing “Fuck you”, he couldn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>How could he blame Ye Xiu? He couldn’t because Ye Xiu had already started scolding him justly and forcefully: “You have to watch over it!! You guys raised such a terrifying monster. Who knows how many innocent players were harmed? I almost died too! You’ve gotta be more careful next time!”</p>
<p>NEXT TIME?! This bastard was thinking of a next time??</p>
<p>If this were someone else, Three Realms Six Paths would have had called everyone over to blast this guy to smithereens. But it had to be Ye Xiu….. It wasn’t like he revered Ye Xiu. It was a question of whether they could actually beat him. He didn’t have that many people on his side, and all of them had been “food”. They had lost a lot of experience and had no equipment on them. If they actually tried to fight him, they would probably be the ones getting eaten, no?</p>
<p>Three Realms Six Paths grit his teeth, but he could only swallow his anger. They could only blame themselves for being too greedy, wanting to use other passerbiers as fodder. If they had made their guards stay to watch over it, their guards could have warned other people not to come over. They could have at least warned a dangerous fellow like Ye Xiu… fuck, would he have left just because they warned him? In reality, Three Realms Six Paths didn’t think so. The purpose of a guard wasn’t to warn people. Was a warning going to stop other people? When was the Heavenly Domain ever so peaceful? Especially between the club guilds.</p>
<p>There were no grounds to argue with him. What’s more, he didn’t even know. Have him pay? Three Realms Six Paths wasn’t naive enough to say that. This time, he could only take the blow and watch as Lord Grim marched out magnanimously. As for the food, they were standing on the bridge, staring blankly at the clean river water.</p>
<p>He obviously needed to tell the pro team what had happened because Three Realms Six Paths had already told them that they were raising a big monster for the pros to come get the points. But now, there was nothing. He had to at least tell them.</p>
<p>Samsara wasn’t the only one raising monsters. Clubs had their own dedicated in-game divisions. How could they not do any research towards this event? After looking at the rules, the club guilds had already been planning on doing this way before the event even started. It was just that they didn’t know the specifics yet. When the even started and they tested it, they found out that one death was only one point. Such miniscule gains only allowed these guilds to gather enough manpower to raise a single big monster. Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim suddenly jumping to first wasn’t anything too surprising. Even though Huang Shaotian had been cursing in the global chat, he also understood.</p>
<p>However, why did Happy kill it so early? Why did Happy kill their raised monster so fast?</p>
<p>The rather innocent people thought in this way. However, some people thought of the storm that Ye Xiu always brought up wherever he went and guessed something very close to the truth: he hadn’t stolen someone else’s monster, did he?</p>
<p>As a result, in that instant, it wasn’t just Three Realms Six Paths checking on the situation. The various guild leaders were all asking about their raised monsters. Unfortunately, it was only Samsara with the grievous news.</p>
<p>The other guilds heard that their raised monsters were safe and sound. They instantly felt their hearts relax. However, in the end, they were also curious about whether a guild had gotten unlucky or not.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to find out. They didn’t even need to put their spies to use. Someone directly asked about in the guild leader chat group.</p>
<p>“I say… did Lord Grim steal someone’s monster?” The first to speak was Tyrannical Ambition’s Jiang You. As Excellent Era’s old rival in the past, Tyranny always analyzed Ye Xiu from the worst way possible.</p>
<p>When Jiang You asked, the other curious guild leaders didn’t need to ask. They simply replied with a “Not ours.”</p>
<p>In the end, Three Realms Six Paths typed out a sad face. Everyone saw it and immediately understood.They rejoiced in their hearts, but they put on a fake smile and consoled him: “Oh no, how could you be so careless?”</p>
<p>How could Three Realms Six Paths not know how happy these guild leaders were, but he really needed to speak his mind right now. These competitors of his were quite good listeners too.</p>
<p>After hearing Three Realms Six Path’s tragic story, everyone naturally consoled him. Even though hadn’t done it intentionally, with their impression of Ye Xiu, they weren’t going to defend him. They could only look at him through an evil lens.</p>
<p>“That guy definitely knew!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was so obvious. How could he have not!”</p>
<p>“What a terrible person!”</p>
<p>“The scum among Gods!”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s got to be more careful!”</p>
<p>As they chatted, the guild leaders ordered their monster raising team: “Be on high alert, especially against Lord Grim and anyone from Happy! Samsara too!”</p>
<p>Don’t look at how everyone seemed to sympathizing with Three Realms Six Paths. In reality, they treated him the same as Ye Xiu. They looked at him in the worst way possible too. Samsara’s raised monster was gone. Would they try to steal someone else’s? Everyone had thought of this issue.</p>
<p>And at the same time, this exchange had let everyone realize that raising monsters wasn’t something that they alone were doing. All of the guilds were doing the same. Then….. Where were they? If they could be stolen, they they had to try!</p>
<p>As a result, in an instant, the spies and open accounts of the various guilds started moving.</p>
<p>Chapter 1101: Revival Point</p>
<p>While the various guilds pondered how to steal the monsters raised by other guilds, they certainly wouldn’t forget to protect their own. Each of them sent extra players to stand guard over their own monsters.</p>
<p>After receiving news from guild leader Changing Spring, Blue River sighed. Another round of deception and scheming was beginning again… how tiring! Nowadays, Blue River no longer led teams. He preferred to serve as an ordinary guild player, just fighting wherever he was told. But there was an overabundance of players willing to do such work in the game; Blue River was more valued for his ability to lead and manage teams. Changing Spring understood and respected Blue River’s state of mind, but faced with the current situation, he still highly valued Blue River’s ability, and ultimately sent Blue River to organize patrols at the revival points of each city.</p>
<p>Revival points!</p>
<p>These were unavoidable for the guilds raising monsters. Even if they brought Clerics with the Revive skill, Revive’s cooldown was thirty minutes, not to mention that there was a limit on how many times in a row a player could be revived. It would be impossible to rely on Revive to seamlessly continue the process of raising a monster. Because of this, during this process, there would inevitably be players travelling from the revival point to feed themselves to a monster. And these players had a distinguishing characteristic: in order to quicken the process, they often wouldn’t wear any equipment.</p>
<p>Blue River quickly understood this point and began to direct his subordinates.</p>
<p>Changing Spring gave him three five-man teams. Including Blue River himself, that made 16 people in total. There was a reason for this number – there were 32 cities in the Heavenly Domain, and therefore 32 revival points. 16 people meant that each person was responsible for two cities. After Changing Spring finished distributing the troops, he began to take action.</p>
<p>Kansas City was one of the two cities for which Blue River was responsible. By the time he arrived at the city, Blue River had already switched to another account. His main account Blue Bridge Spring Snow was a well-known figure in-game and attracted much attention, so he couldn’t use it for covert operations like this. Now that he switched to an alt, Blue River tried to lie low, picking roads that weren’t frequented by many people as he quickly made his way to the revival point.</p>
<p>Once he was close, Blue River stopped.</p>
<p>A good deal of time had passed since the start of the event, and the guilds must have reached a steady rhythm in raising the monsters. If Blue River stayed here for a while, he was sure that he would make some discovery. The guilds had to be efficient, so they wouldn’t be raising the monsters somewhere in the deep mountains and forests – too much time would be wasted travelling.</p>
<p>Blue River hid his character behind a corner of a wall. Because there was an event going on, there were more players online than usual. In addition, the inherent difficulty of Ghost Parade made the death count high. There was a constant stream of players emerging from the revival point. Every time the white light flashed at the revival point, Blue River tensed. At the same time, he closely observed the players and his surroundings, and he discovered that there were several other players nearby doing the same thing that he was! Some were ducking this way and that as they furtively looked around, while others merely waited casually by the revival point as if they were meeting up with someone. Blue River turned his camera, studying his surroundings, and sent a message to Changing Spring, advising him to conceal their tracks carefully. Blue Brook Guild definitely wasn’t the only guild that had sent players to watch the revival points.</p>
<p>“How many did you find?”</p>
<p>Just when Blue River sent the message, he suddenly heard a voice from right beside him, startling him so badly that he burst into a cold sweat and instinctively directed his character to roll to the side and unsheathe his sword. But once he finished the roll and saw the other player’s name, he faltered.</p>
<p>Lord Grim!</p>
<p>What kind of luck was this?</p>
<p>Blue River felt like he was going crazy.</p>
<p>32 cities. 1 in 32 chance. Yet despite the odds, he still ran into this difficult guy. And this guy had just directly approached him! Was Blue River exposed?</p>
<p>No… no, he shouldn’t have, this must be a coincidence because Blue River had been very careful, choosing the most cautious and secure route here. And this guy wasn’t even using an alt, he was directly using Lord Grim, so of course he would be taking the quieter roads as well. So for the two characters to meet here like this, it could be considered an inevitable coincidence.</p>
<p>Blue River steadied himself. And then… and then without waiting for him to say anything, the other side had already asked, “Which guild are you?”</p>
<p>I’ve been seen through…</p>
<p>Blue River felt regret. Even though he wasn’t using an account with the guild tag, in this current situation, who could fool anyone? Hadn’t Blue River just sent a message to Changing Spring to warn Blue Brook Guild to be more careful?</p>
<p>“I’m in… Herb Garden.” Even though Blue River was sick of this sort of deception, with things as they were now, he still had to play this game. He didn’t have a plan in mind, but concealing his identity was a basic first step. With this easy lie, Blue River allied himself with Blue Brook Guild’s death rivals, Herb Garden.</p>
<p>“Oh, how despicable, you’re trying to steal the monsters that other people raised?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you doing the exact same thing?” Blue River felt like coughing blood as he replied. It’d been a while since he’d seen him, and the great God was still as shameless as ever!</p>
<p>“Haha, I’ve actually already stolen one, you want to guess how I did it?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“How did you do it?” That caught Blue River’s attention. Was the God about to reveal some sort of ultimate technique?</p>
<p>“I was just passing by and picked it up. How lucky!” As Ye Xiu spoke, he sent a thumbs up emoji to float above Lord Grim’s head.</p>
<p>Blue River resisted the urge to stab him, and laughed dryly. “Lucky indeed.”</p>
<p>“Did you discover anything here?” Ye Xiu then asked.</p>
<p>“Not yet.” Blue River’s reply was automatic, but once the words left his mouth, he regretted it. Why was he telling him anything?</p>
<p>“There, there, and there, there, those are all guild alts, right?” Lord Grim lifted his Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, pointing in several directions as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Should be,” Blue River said.</p>
<p>“If all the guilds continue like this, what do you think will happen in the end?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Blue River stared blankly…</p>
<p>The actions of the various guilds were too predictable. If it were really just one or two or three guilds sending people to monitor the revival points, they probably wouldn’t be exposed. But now, however many guilds there were, that was how many people there were. With that many people loitering about the revival point, it’d be very difficult for them all to conceal themselves. If they discovered each other like this, they’d send news to their own guilds, and then… and then of course the players who were sent to be food for the monsters would disguise their identities by putting on equipment and what not so that they would be harder to recognize.</p>
<p>At that point, in order to tell if a player was food, then you’d have to check their stats. Repeatedly dying in-game would cause their stats to drop drastically. But checking another player’s stats was much more of a hassle. Blue River’s current hiding place was far enough away from the revival point that he couldn’t see the stats of the players appearing there, so if he wanted to check, he’d have to go closer. But if he did that, then it’d be obvious that he was monitoring the revival point. If the opponents were really in this city, and they discovered him doing this, then what would they do?</p>
<p>Blue River was still thinking when he saw a person’s shadow pass by him. He glanced and saw that Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim had actually just walked right out there. He boldly stood at the exact center of the revival point, turning this way and that, surveying all of the revived players.</p>
<p>This guy, he’s already just doing that!</p>
<p>Blue River was dumbfounded, and his mind rapidly ran through calculations. If he were in charge of raising a boss, and suddenly received news that Lord Grim was sitting at the city’s revival point, what would he do?</p>
<p>He would certainly pause the feeding process.</p>
<p>And then… and then things would be difficult! Taking direct action against Lord Grim would be akin to admitting that yes, our guild’s boss is right near here. Even if they were able to kill Lord Grim, he would certainly come back. The revival point was unavoidable, and moving the monster elsewhere was even more unrealistic. Would they have to send a special team to protect the players who were being fed to the monster? Then that would just attract all of the other guilds to attack them! And considering that the monsters were ultimately being raised to be fed to professional characters, it was very likely that the attackers would be the gods of the various teams! That was a terrifying thought! No, it couldn’t be allowed to come to that.</p>
<p>Just thinking about this all was enough to get Blue River sweating. And so he decided, if he were trapped here by Lord Grim waiting at the revival point, the safest plan would be to just sacrifice a little time. Lord Grim had no reason to wait at this revival point forever if nothing happened, and the feeding could resume once he left.</p>
<p>As Blue River thought this, another character appeared at the revival point, and this time, Lord Grim fixed his sight on this one character.</p>
<p>Was that…</p>
<p>Blue River jolted. He was too far away, but he saw that once this character noticed Lord Grim, he also immediately stopped moving. Blue River had a feeling that this was the person they were hoping to find.</p>
<p>Which guild was still bold enough to continue sending players?</p>
<p>Blue River wondered. He didn’t consider himself especially smart, so he figured that any issue that he could think of, the other guilds absolutely would have realized as well. When there was someone so domineering monitoring the revival point, there really shouldn’t be any reason for someone to expose themselves like this! But as soon as he thought that, Blue River suddenly realized, there was one situation where that could happen, which was… the guild didn’t know that there was someone so bold at this revival point.</p>
<p>The guilds had only just started to mobilize, and then monitored and investigated each other. When the plans couldn’t keep up with changes, there would inevitably be mistakes. This guild member was wearing equipment, which showed that their guild had realized that everyone was spying on each other. But they hadn’t yet sent their own people to monitor all of the revival points, so there was a hole in the reports they received. They just inferred the condition of this revival point from what they knew about the other revival points. And so, they put on equipment and boldly continued, only to find that there was an anomaly at this revival point.</p>
<p>Were they overconfident?</p>
<p>Of course they were. But then again, aside from Ye Xiu, who else could be this domineering?</p>
<p>Blue River ultimately felt that this guild was just unlucky, very unlucky that Ye Xiu came to their city and dragged the fox by the tail out of its den.</p>
<p>“Kansas City, a guild is raising a monster, the situation right now is unclear.” Blue River immediately sent a report to his guild.</p>
<p>As for the player at the revival point, once discovered by Ye Xiu, he obviously wouldn’t lead him to where the monster was being raised. This alt just directly logged off.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’ll have a lot to do here.” Lord Grim walked over and spoke to Blue River.</p>
<p>We? Blue River wondered. Since when was there a “we” in this?</p>
<p>Chapter 1102: Who’s Raising this One?</p>
<p>Blue River had sent his message, but the members from other guilds, who were who were also clustered around the revival point, weren’t slow either. Kansas City’s teleportation formation was soon bustling with people sent by each of the big guilds. It didn’t matter who was raising the monster, only where it was located.</p>
<p>There were guildless alts, as well as many famous guild elites that were easily recognizable even without their guild tag. These people met each other at the teleportation formation, but quickly went their separate ways. However, after going their ways, they didn’t forget to send people to spy on one another.</p>
<p>Kansa City was soon filled with a jumble of different people ,and Blue River also received a message from Changing Spring, telling him and the other teams from Blue Brook to regroup.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Receiving the message, Blue River immediately headed for the coordinates Changing Spring had sent. However, he had only taken a few steps before realizing something was wrong and turned to look.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, following me?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Haven’t your people from Herb Garden arrived?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“What does that have to do with you?” Blue River yelled.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need a powerful helper like me?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Haha, of course we welcome powerful helpers, but not you.” Blue River laughed coldly. Did this guy still think he could take advantage of them after so long?</p>
<p>“Is that so? What a shame. I’ll be off then,” Ye Xiu said, a shrug emoji appearing above Lord Grim’s head as he turned to leave.</p>
<p>Blue River watched him go, but soon realized that the scouts from the other guilds hadn’t left the revival point. Their gazes were all locked onto one character: Lord Grim. Soon enough, they all began to head in the same direction that Lord Grim went.</p>
<p>Blue River suddenly came to a realization.</p>
<p>There was no way they could let a dangerous person like Lord Grim go unwatched. He had brought on the current situation, so why wouldn’t he have tricks up his sleeve?</p>
<p>Of course he would!</p>
<p>This guy definitely had some sort of scheme. They couldn’t be careless; they had to keep an eye on him.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Blue River hurriedly had his alt follow as he sent a message to Changing Spring: “I’m not coming anymore. I’m keeping an eye on Lord Grim.”</p>
<p>“!!!” Changing Spring, who didn’t like chatting through messages, used three exclamation marks to express his emotions.</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s here. He’s also the one who leaked that there was a monster located here.” Blue River explained.</p>
<p>Chang Spring didn’t dare be even a little careless, immediately turning to order the other members of the guild. “We need another three teams in Kansas City.”</p>
<p>“Three teams! Is that necessary!?” Someone objected. “Stealing raised monsters is just to get some points, but it’s also very important that we keep up with the event on a larger scale. Isn’t it too risky to have so many elites focus on the raised monsters?”</p>
<p>“You’re right.” Changing Spring calmed himself immediately. “We need to keep a balance. We don’t need three. One team will be enough.”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, Lord Grim. Just the name could cause a guild leader to lose his cool at once. The trauma his presence had left on these people in the Heavenly Domain was clear as day.</p>
<p>What was he planning here?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Changing Spring wondering about this. He wasn’t the only one allocating more people to Kansas City.</p>
<p>Kansas City suddenly became an important tactical point for them. They hadn’t even found the raised monster, but were already on their highest guard against Lord Grim. During all of this, the situation in Kansas City brought a lot of attention. The guilds that hadn’t check this city yet all heard of the unusual situation and quickly gathered people. This was almost like stealing a wild boss. The activities of guilds were obvious. This was because if you had few people, you wouldn’t have a chance of winning, but if you had many, then it would be very hard to cover up your movements.</p>
<p>With this, the guilds fell into a very awkward situation.</p>
<p>Manpower!</p>
<p>How much manpower should they send?</p>
<p>For a wild boss, they would naturally have all the elites join in the fray, but now they had to consider a balance. They didn’t want to waste their resources on this battle and affect the overall score of the guild in this event. It was just that different guilds had different ideas of balance. Some guilds would think one team was enough, others, three. That meant if they faced three teams with one team, they wouldn’t have a winning chance.</p>
<p>Thus, the guilds looked for the monster as they scouted out the strength of the other guilds. After that, they would make the necessary adjustments. Most of their adjustments were to increase their numbers, because it wasn’t just enough to have the same manpower as the others, but they had to be stronger. That way, they would have a better hold. Thus, if one side made adjustments, the other side would, too, then this side would notice and make more adjustments. Was there an end to this loop?</p>
<p>After sending two more teams to Kansas City, Tyrannical Ambition’s Jiang You was the first to break. He jumped into the guild leader chat and sent a message. “Holy crap, are we planning to put all our manpower here?”</p>
<p>“Where?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>Jiang You was about to type, but then stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>The one who asked was Blossom Valley’s guild leader, Blooming Blossoms. Did Hundred Blossoms have any people in Kansas City yet? If they didn’t, then wouldn’t he give it away by speaking? Jiang You hurriedly looked back at his message history. He really couldn’t recall if Hundred Blossoms had or not.</p>
<p>Yet soon enough, someone gave him an answer. Herb Garden’s Arisaema replied, “Stop pretending, Blooming. Where do you think?”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m just testing the waters. Is everyone here?” Blooming Blossoms said.</p>
<p>Jiang You wilted. The communication between them guild leaders never hid any good intentions. But, speaking of, since when did they start gathering to chat about things like this? They hadn’t had this habit before; they would just scheme against each other in the past! Jiang You thought for a while until he saw someone mention a name in the chat.</p>
<p>Lord Grim!</p>
<p>That’s right. It wasn’t until after this guy appeared that their relationship had changed. Just this one person had managed to force these rival guilds to work together against a common enemy. He really was something! And this time, was this person here again? Tyrannical Ambition had been a little late to the game, so they didn’t know Lord Grim’s role in all of this, and Jiang You had only just gotten wind of his participation.</p>
<p>No wonder everyone was willing to talk about this together again! Could it be that everyone would be facing a dire situation whenever this guy appeared?</p>
<p>By now, all the guilds that could come had come to Kansas City, so there was no problem in openly discussing this. However, they had a problem to solve!</p>
<p>“Hey everyone…” Herb Garden’s Arisaema spoke up, “The event is still ongoing and time is precious. Expending too much manpower and time on this isn’t worth it. I suggest that we settle things peacefully for once and don’t fight. Let’s just use luck to decide this. Finders keepers, okay? This way, we won’t have to endlessly put more resources into this.</p>
<p>“Good idea!” Someone immediately agreed.</p>
<p>“My ass!” Yet soon enough, someone objected. Curt and straightforward, it was Blue Brook’s Changing Spring. It was impossible to have this guy type out and explain things clearly. It was a good thing that someone else had also thought of the same thing as him. Soon enough, the guild leader of Howling Heights, West Riding Wind said, “Hey, have you guys forgotten that this isn’t a wild boss? This thing has an owner, and that owner is someone amongst us!”</p>
<p>Arisaema was stunned. He really had forgotten about that.</p>
<p>“Could it be Herb Garden’s?” A guild leader immediately suspected. Though it didn’t really matter, Arisaema’s suggestion of a peaceful resolution, not adding more manpower, finders keepers was just too much of a benefit for the owner, causing people to immediately suspect them of being the owners.</p>
<p>“Tch…” Arisaema immediately acted uncaring, but was it real nonchalance or was it pretending? Like the whole question around who the owner of the monster was, this was unimportant as well, so no one bothered to press. It was just that after realizing the target they were acting against was amongst them, everything became awkward. No matter what they came up with, the defending side would be able to put in precautions against them all! Poor guy, though, having to discuss how to deal with himself with everyone else. That was pretty harsh!</p>
<p>“How troublesome…” Some people began to complain. They clearly had not an inkling of an idea as to how everyone should proceed.</p>
<p>“Who’s monster is it? It’s not like you can run with it anymore, just tell everyone already!” Someone yelled.</p>
<p>No one would own up to it, but this made many of the guild leaders realize something.</p>
<p>They couldn’t run…</p>
<p>If the guild that was raising the monster also realized this, then what would they do?</p>
<p>Doubtlessly, kill it immediately!</p>
<p>“Quick, check the rankings, see if anyone’s points just jumped,” Some guild leaders swiftly gave the order.</p>
<p>But then, they thought things through again. What was the goal of raising monsters? To give them to the pro team. Even if Kansas City’s raised monster was still rather small, it would still be better than a normal monster. If they were being forced to kill it, then they could also call people from the pro team over!</p>
<p>“Keep an eye on the teleportation formation, send people to the gates, take note of pro characters!” The new order immediately spread through the guilds. Each guild leader had about the same reaction speed to situations like this.</p>
<p>Pro characters!</p>
<p>This was key. If the other was forced to kill, then they had to call pro characters over. Pro characters, pro characters…</p>
<p>This order was swiftly relayed to everyone at Kansas City. Many people quickly replied to their guilds, “Pro characters? Does Lord Grim count?”</p>
<p>Lord Grim?</p>
<p>Damn!</p>
<p>Several of the guild leaders suddenly jumped up. Could it be that the monster being raised here belonged to Happy?</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, the guild leaders became excited. Always, it had been Happy giving them blow after blow, and them? They hadn’t ever seemed to be able to manage to deal a painful strike back. This time, they finally had the chance. So it was Happy who was raising a monster in Kansas City?</p>
<p>Chapter 1103: Who?</p>
<p>“Happy!” Changing Spring ran excitedly to the chat group to type a message.</p>
<p>“What?” But his exclamation was too short. No one understand what he meant.</p>
<p>“Kansas City’s monster should be Happy’s! From our reports, the only pro character at Kansas City is Lord Grim. Does anyone else have information of any other pro characters there?” Another guild leader explained in Changing Spring’s place.</p>
<p>Other pro characters? No, none.</p>
<p>“But… wasn’t it Lord Grim who revealed this information?” Several guild leaders hadn’t gone over their heads just because it might be Happy’s. Misty Castle’s Misty Lock asked.</p>
<p>“What?” The guild leaders had been very excited, but then they discovered that they seemed to have neglected an important detail.</p>
<p>How shameful!</p>
<p>It was such a stand-out logic, yet these grand guild leaders had unexpectedly neglected it. What a disgrace.</p>
<p>“So no matter who it belongs to, it can’t be Happy’s. Why would they invite trouble to themselves?” Misty Lock said.</p>
<p>“Or maybe it’s some sort of scheme?” A guild leader was dead-set on it being Happy’s.</p>
<p>“Scheme? What type of scheme requires one to reveal one’s own raised monster?” Misty Lock was doubtful. Then, he saw a report come in on his QQ. He clicked on it.</p>
<p>“Our raised monster has been discovered!!”</p>
<p>“What? By who?” Misty Lock was shocked. It was too sudden.</p>
<p>“By Happy.”</p>
<p>“Hold the fort.” Misty Lock couldn’t think too much. He could only give this reply. But before he could even get back to the game, a reply had already come: “We can’t hold it!”</p>
<p>They were truly unable to hold it.</p>
<p>After news of a raised monster being exposed came out, the big guilds dispatched scouts to probe the situation, while they also increased their defenses and vigilance towards their own breeding cities. However, at this moment, outside of where Misty Castle’s raised monster was located, every character there was from a pro team.</p>
<p>Soft Mist, Steamed Bun Invasion, One Inch Ash, Deception, Little Cold Hands, Concealed Light, even….. Dancing Rain!</p>
<p>This was everyone in Team Happy apart from Lord Grim. Even though they were a new team, if they could beat Team Excellent Era, how could in-game elite troops be a match?</p>
<p>Misty Castle tried to form a defensive line in an attempt to stop them, but their defenses were instantly broken through. Happy’s team headed straight for their raised monster. Misty Castle’s most effective method of obstruction was probably their angry yells and curses.</p>
<p>A raised monster didn’t have the same amount of health as a wild boss. In addition, no matter how long a monster was raised, it would always have a weakness. Ye Xiu hadn’t taken long to kill a seaweed monster worth 625 points, let alone an entire team charging at one. Misty Castle’s raised monster might be a bit stronger than Samsara’s seaweed monster, but under the combined attack from a team of players, it died even faster than the seaweed monster.</p>
<p>“It’s over…..” Besides reporting to their guild leader, Misty Castle’s players couldn’t do anything else. They couldn’t stop Happy’s team from breaking through their defenses, let alone killing Happy’s team. The monster, which they had spent close to two hours raising by sacrificing countless alternate accounts, was taken away by Happy just like that. Even though their guild was also working hard trying to steal other guild’s monsters, they were still incredibly furious after getting theirs stolen away.</p>
<p>By the time Misty Lock returned to the game, everything was already over. He had no time to do anything.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>Misty Lock now had plenty of time to ponder over what had just happened</p>
<p>His heart was in chaos. Even though he had the time, he wasn’t in the mood to ponder over this question. The guild leader chat group was still arguing over what Lord Grim was trying to do, exposing Kansas City like that.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Seeing the guild leaders repeatedly ask this question, Misty Lock suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>Could Lord Grim… be trying to divert their attention?</p>
<p>The guild leader chat group was in a fervent discussion. All of the guilds were focused on Kansas City. What about the other cities? It didn’t seem like there was any information on the others. At least, Misty Castle didn’t have any. But what about Happy? Not only had they found where Misty Castle’s raised monster was located, they sent their pro team to kill it.</p>
<p>Was it Misty Castle being unlucky or could it be the start of Happy’s scheme?</p>
<p>Misty Castle’s intuition told him that it was the latter. Lord Grim revealing Kansas City not only diverted Misty Castle’s attention, but all of the other guilds. No, it would be more precise to say that they weren’t focused on Lord Grim, but rather the monster located in Kansas City. But who had first discovered this monster? Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Did Kansas City really have a raised monster? Misty Lock was starting to become suspicious of it. Their guild had searched for so long already, yet they hadn’t found anything. What about the other guilds? They all seemed to be busy, but if they found anything, they wouldn’t share it with anyone else. Even if they killed it, they might pretend like it hadn’t been killed yet. Trying to confirm anything was very troublesome!</p>
<p>Misty Lock discovered that they seemed to have walked into an alleyway, starting from when Kansas City’s monster had been revealed. Misty Lock was very doubtful that this alley would end up being a dead end, but he didn’t have any plans of telling these doubts to anyone because his guild had already suffered. It hoped that the other guilds would also suffer too. Now that he no longer had a raised monster, he needed to steal someone else’s. As for what exactly Happy was scheming, why couldn’t Misty Castle take advantage of their scheme too?</p>
<p>Kansas City.</p>
<p>Blue River had been carefully following Lord Grim the entire time, going around and around the city. Lord Grim wasn’t moving too fast because whenever he saw a ghost, he would go kill it. He wasn’t very focused on searching for raised monsters.</p>
<p>Blue River understood the reason very well.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu had previously done everything on his own because Happy didn’t have the conditions for it. Now that Happy had grown, even if it couldn’t compare to the powerhouses yet, it wasn’t so small anymore that God Ye Xiu had to personally do everything. If Lord Grim had truly been focused on searching for raised monsters, Blue River would have been suspicious. But Ye Xiu prioritizing killing monsters, while also scouting around in the passing was reasonable. It was very reasonable.</p>
<p>There were no signs showing that Lord Grim was doing anything unusual, but Blue River always had an uneasy feeling in his heart. His intuition told him that he was definitely missing something.</p>
<p>Blue River replayed over and over everything that Lord Grim had done today including all of the small details.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his cellphone rang.</p>
<p>Blue River checked his cellphone. To his surprise, it was Changing Spring.</p>
<p>Blue River’s expression changed. Changing Spring could have easily contacted him online. He could even see that both Changing Spring was online both in the game and on QQ. Instead, he chose to make a phone call, meaning that he had something very important to say. This was because this guy refused to change his habit of not liking to type. If there was something important to say, he would always choose to make a phone call.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Blue River picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Our raised monster has been stolen by Happy.”</p>
<p>That was the first sentence he heard.</p>
<p>“How? Impossible!” Blue River whispered. He could still see Lord Grim from his screen, “Lord Grim is still on this side.”</p>
<p>“Lord Grim didn’t go, but the others in Team Happy went.” Changing Spring said.</p>
<p>“The others…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, everyone else in Team Happy apart from Lord Grim.”</p>
<p>“…” Blue River didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“What is Lord Grim doing right now?” Changing Spring asked.</p>
<p>“The same as always. Wandering around while occasionally killing monsters.” Blue River said.</p>
<p>“He obviously knew what his team was doing, but he was still idly killing monsters. There must be a scheme in this.” Changing Spring was exasperated.</p>
<p>Blue River stared blankly. His mind was a mess. He had replayed all the events that had happened today with Lord Grim, but he still wasn’t able to find the important point.</p>
<p>“Does Kansas City have a raised monster or not? We’ve been searching for so long!” Changing Spring shouted.</p>
<p>“Of course, there’s one… I’ve personally seen that character…..” Blue River said, but then he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“What about that character?” Changing Spring heard the hesitation.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve seen that character before…..” Blue River tried hard to search his memories, but his deepest impression of this character was that he had a dark red status. This was the main point he had noticed because he had tried to determine how much experience this character had lost based on his lowered stats to see whether he was a feeder or not.</p>
<p>“What’s his name?” Changing Spring asked.</p>
<p>“Backside Attack… Where have I seen him before?” Blue River thought hard.</p>
<p>“Backside Attack?” Changing Spring was even more puzzled than Blue River. However, the number of people at his disposal was more than just himself. He immediately had the entire guild reflect on this name.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the collective knowledge of the guild was boundless. Soon afterwards, an upper level player from Blue Brook Guild pointed out: “He used to be from our Blue Brook Guild. There was this one boss fight where they and Ye Xiu ripped us off. Did you forget, guild leader?”</p>
<p>Changing Spring suddenly thought to himself.</p>
<p>Changing Spring remembered quite clearly that time’s fight for the Level 65 wild boss Swamp Hunter Leipu. Apart from Ye Xiu participating and extorting them, more importantly, he had talked with one character, the character called Windward Formation. At that time, Windward Formation had been a part of Blue Brook Guild, but because of an incident, Changing Spring kicked him out. After that, he found out that Windward Formation was unexpectedly Team Blue Rain’s former captain. How could he forget about that experience?</p>
<p>As for this Backside Attack, he didn’t have much of an impression of him. But with this reminder, Changing Spring understood that this guy must be together with Windward Formation, together with Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Everything has come to light……</p>
<p>The so-called feeder had been from Happy. As for those distinctly lowered stats, it wasn’t just Changing Spring even Blue River got up. After that boss battle, that group of players had been attacked by all of the guilds and they annoyed everyone for a long period of time. But they were just purely annoyances. In terms of actual combat, those guys weren’t their opponents. In the end, all of them lost a lot of experience.</p>
<p>And now, this type of trash account was being used by Ye Xiu and it was being used well too.</p>
<p>All of the guilds were focused on Kansas City. And at this moment, their rears were being wiped by Team Happy. A team… a pro team</p>
<p>Chapter 1104: Leaderboard Dominance</p>
<p>Changing Spring’s target shifted back to the guild leader chat group, where everyone was trying to cheat each other.</p>
<p>He wasn’t someone who liked to chat through typing, so after there was nothing really important being talked about, he stopped paying attention to the group.</p>
<p>The guild leader chat group suddenly became quiet at some point. If one looked through the chat log, guild leaders talked less and less as time went on. Something urgent seemed to have happened and every guild leader suddenly left the discussion, one by one. Up until the end, one of the sentences was left hanging as if it had suddenly been cut off.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>The strangeness in the chat group made Changing Spring realize that the tragedy of getting their raised monster stolen wasn’t unique to just Blue Brook Guild. Where did those guild leaders, who suddenly stopped chatting, go? Could they all have received emergency alerts, reporting that their guild’s wild boss was being stolen?</p>
<p>They couldn’t all have been Happy, right?</p>
<p>Thinking of this point, Changing Spring suddenly felt frightened.</p>
<p>How? Their guilds had been searching for the raised monsters of other guilds the entire time. Even if they had focused more of their attention on Kansas City, they hadn’t relaxed their searches for monsters in other cities. Why? Why was Guild Happy so efficient? How did they find out where every raised monster was located?</p>
<p>“What information do we have on Guild Happy?” Changing Spring couldn’t help but turn his head and ask one of his subordinates.</p>
<p>“Happy? Information?” This subordinate stared blankly, “None.”</p>
<p>“None?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have enough manpower. Everyone’s busy searching in the other cities for raised monsters!” The subordinate reported.</p>
<p>Changing Spring suddenly froze.</p>
<p>He suddenly realized something. Happy had found these raised monsters so efficiently through a certain method.</p>
<p>It was very simple: send a message in the guild and have everyone in the guild pay attention for any powerful monsters.</p>
<p>Why didn’t the other guilds employ such a simple method?</p>
<p>One word: slow.</p>
<p>The guilds had moved too slowly. From when Lord Grim suddenly jumped to number one on the leaderboards to the guild leaders trying to cheat each other in order to set their own plans in motion. They figured that they had to be discreet, so that the others wouldn’t figure out their plans.</p>
<p>In reality? Unnecessary! It was completely unnecessary. In this sort of situation, which guild wouldn’t want to steal other people’s monsters. Wasn’t it pointless to hide their intentions from one another?</p>
<p>The guild had been thinking too much. Not only did they want to take advantage of others, they were also afraid to take losses, so they hoped to catch the others off guard and kill them in one go. They didn’t want to encounter a well-prepared defense.</p>
<p>But it turned out that if everyone was being sneaky, no one was being sneaky. Everyone’s intentions were laid bare in the end. Despite having reached this step, their thoughts still hadn’t changed. They still hadn’t thought of directly getting their entire guild involved in the search. News of just a single Kansas City had made them excited enough to all start chatting about it.</p>
<p>Ha, what a joke.</p>
<p>Changing Spring actually laughed out loud.</p>
<p>While their chat group had been bickering about Kansas City, everyone in Happy had already mobilized for who knew how long already. Happy might have already found all of their monsters’ locations by that time.</p>
<p>The guilds had tried to catch each other off guard and do things in secret. Guild Happy, on the other hand, brandished their swords for everyone to see, directly calling out to everyone in the guild. And the outcome? Happy’s large-scale movements actually became secretive, completely catching the other guilds off guard.</p>
<p>Because they had to act discreetly, they needed trustworthy helpers. The guild spies were naturally trustworthy, so with them temporarily being assigned elsewhere, there were no spies left, leaving them unaware of Happy’s movements.</p>
<p>Was it their stupidity that allowed Happy’s plan to work beautifully, or was it Ye Xiu guessing that they would act stupidly? Changing Spring didn’t know. The silence in the chat group let him know that their guilds had paid the price for their stupidity. After having waged war with each other for so long, it was as if they were now all carved from the same mold. Changing Spring once again couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>In the chat group, someone had finally discovered how abnormal the chat group felt and typed in chat, breaking the ice.</p>
<p>“Happy.” Herb Garden’s Arisaema typed just one word.</p>
<p>Emojis followed one after the other.</p>
<p>Petrified…</p>
<p>Sweating….</p>
<p>Anger…</p>
<p>Fuming…</p>
<p>Sadness….</p>
<p>(Replace these with QQ emojis for better effects)</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly had a gut feeling that there was an 80 90% chance that everyone had been duped by Happy. Whether or not someone had escaped from Happy’s clutches was no longer their concern.</p>
<p>Everyone ran to check the leaderboards.</p>
<p>Everyone had been checking it constantly. If someone had instantly shot up like Lord Grim had, they would have definitely noticed it. No one had noticed anything when Happy had cleaned up another raised monster because it was Happy’s team that went. Lord Grim killing the seaweed monster alone gave him 625 points, which would obviously make him shoot up the leaderboard. The seaweed monster was equivalent to killing 6 monsters, but for Happy’s team, since the points were divided amongst everyone, the point increase wasn’t as big. These ups and downs happened all the time in the leaderboards. It was nothing particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>They hadn’t noticed Team Happy’s rise in the leaderboards until they, who were originally at who knew where, had squeezed into the top 200, top 100, top 50, top 30 rankings. And from this, they realized that Happy hadn’t stolen just one raised monster.</p>
<p>Misty Castle’s raised monster had been stolen first, but instead of telling others, Misty Lock had kept it a secret. Now, the fruits of their efforts had been reaped. Even though Misty Castle lost their raised monster, seeing the other guilds suffer lifted Misty Lock’s mood. And relatively speaking, the earlier a raised monster was stolen, the smaller the losses were.</p>
<p>After these emojis were spammed, the chat group returned to silence. No one knew what to say. Condemn Happy? Condemn Ye Xiu? Everyone was dealing with shady business. The only difference was that Happy had succeeded and they had failed. Condemning Happy or Ye Xiu was the same as slapping their own faces.</p>
<p>This time, the guild leaders didn’t explode in fury amidst this silence. They simply left. They told the unfortunate news to their teams. The teams didn’t criticize them too excessively either. It was just that, after Happy had swept their pots clean, sending their characters up the leaderboards, the outcome was too stunning. Who knew how many pro characters had been left in the dust by them.</p>
<p>On the leaderboards, of the first ten places, Team Happy had stolen away five spots, monopolizing the top three.</p>
<p>Lord Grim, Deception, Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>After those three, it was Huang Shaotian’s Troubling Rain, who was spamming the pro player chat group in anger.</p>
<p>At this point, there weren’t many monsters left. Many players weren’t able to find anymore. The fluctuations in the leaderboards became less and less frequent. Even though the system showed that there were still 21 ghosts left, the Heavenly Domain was so vast. Twenty one was too few. Many players didn’t want to waste their time wandering around for a chance to encounter one. Some of them directly logged off, while others started doing their normal day to day routine.</p>
<p>Most of Guild Happy’s players had left to do their own things too. However, their most trusted members were all called together.</p>
<p>The play had come to an end and now it was time for the audience to go?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t think so. He believed that the other club guilds didn’t think so either. As the end neared, there were fewer and fewer monsters. As soon as a monster was discovered by a guild, that guild would certainly start raising it, and it would be easier to protect too. After all, the event could practically be considered over already.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu had called Guild Happy’s most loyal members and tasked them with watching revival points. If a guild was going to raise a monster, a revival point must be used. Watching a revival point would reveal their activities. At the same time, an announcement was made in the guild chat. Players who hadn’t logged off yet should be mindful for any monsters, as well as movements from the other guilds.</p>
<p>For normal players, the event had ended, but for the club guilds, it was just the beginning. The remaining targets might be the key to their comeback on the leaderboards. These 21 monsters became the deciding factors for their victory. The guilds were sending out their forces, searching or monitoring their competitors’ movements. There weren’t just Happy’s players at the revival points. All of the parties involved had made arrangements.</p>
<p>It was just that this time, even with their enormous resources, they failed to make any progress.</p>
<p>21, 20, 19, 18…</p>
<p>The number of ghosts continued to decrease, but these ghosts were killed by players, who just happened to encounter one on accident.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, announcements were made by the various guilds in the global chat: spend money to buy the location of these ghosts.</p>
<p>After one guild sent it, the other guilds followed suit. How could a club guild not afford these types of rewards? With everyone offering rewards, players either compared offers between several guilds or looked for the one they liked the most. The guild leaders didn’t directly shout out an exact offer in the global chat. If not, if everyone kept raising the bar and entered a price war, when would it stop?</p>
<p>Although they were unwilling, in the end, midnight struck. The system announced that today’s Ghost Parade was over. There were still 17 ghosts remaining, but when the system event ended, the system automatically removed them from the map.</p>
<p>Yes, after the guilds started offering rewards, no one managed to find any of the 17 remaining ghosts all the way until the system removed them. The leaderboards didn’t change.</p>
<p>The drops from killing ghosts was one portion of the rewards for the event. The other rewards came from leaderboard rewards. The leaderboards were split into daily rankings and overall rankings. The daily rankings would reset every day, while the overall rankings accumulated over the course of the event. When the day ended, the rewards could be given out. The rewards would obviously be given out according to the rankings on the leaderboards. There was no luck involved. Someone at a lower ranking wouldn’t get better rewards than someone at a higher ranking.</p>
<p>An event was an event. Just killing ghosts gave good rewards. The leaderboard rewards were even more resplendent, especially the top ten rankings. The system publicly announced those in order to excite players. Five of Happy’s characters, Troubling Rain, Cloud Piercer, Demon Subduer, and Peaceful Hermit received brilliant rewards.</p>
<p>Chapter 1105: Comprehensive Textbook</p>
<p>What was the significance of the leaderboard?</p>
<p>Most directly, of course, it was that the system used to distribute rewards. Even the club guilds couldn’t disregard these extremely valuable rewards, so they too actively strove for the top spot.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the leaderboard was also a way of proving the strength of an individual or a guild. An in-game event like Ghost Parade was partially based on luck, but when the top of the leaderboard was entirely occupied by pro level accounts, it was clear that luck only mattered when skill levels were similar. In front of the crushing power of pro players, no matter how good an ordinary player’s luck was, he simply couldn’t compete with the raw skill of the pros.</p>
<p>The club guilds paid close attention to leaderboards, whether it was for the first wave of dungeon records for new servers, the records for the highest-level dungeons, or the rankings for in-game events. The rewards were part of the motivation, but aside from that, ranking higher meant showing off their strength and expanding the influence of the team.</p>
<p>The pro teams relied on their performance during the season to demonstrate their strength, but the club guilds, their representatives in-game, were a presence closer to home. Unlike pro players, the guilds didn’t exist in a separate space; they existed right alongside the numerous ordinary Glory players.</p>
<p>Expanding the team’s influence through activities in-game was one of the most important jobs for every club guild. And the leaderboard was the main battlefield for all of this.</p>
<p>Thus, after the first day of the Night of a Hundred Ghosts leaderboard battle, the club guilds were unhappy. Very unhappy.</p>
<p>It had been a rare opportunity for the pros to mobilize in-game, but in the end, the various guilds had been unable to coordinate well with their respective pros. Ultimately, of the top 27 places, 9 were occupied by members of Guild Happy. They managed to steal a third of the top spots. Of the top 10 places, Happy had snatched 5. First, second, and third place, Happy dominated, not leaving a single chance for the other guilds.</p>
<p>The big guilds discovered that they had never tasted such a victory before.</p>
<p>This result was a lively topic of discussion in the pro player group as well, after Huang Shaotian’s angry spamming, of course. Happy’s elegant victory had earned even their respect. And, from the reports of their guilds, they essentially understood how Happy managed to pull it all off.</p>
<p>Tang Rou, Steamed Bun, and the others still hadn’t joined the pro player group; from Happy, only Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng were in here. Ye Xiu was obviously targeted from all sides. After Huang Shaotian’s spam, everyone directed their spearheads toward Ye Xiu, half-jokingly calling him sneaky, dirty, treacherous.</p>
<p>“Hahaha,” Ye Xiu laughed. “If you’re jealous, then just say it directly!”</p>
<p>They had no words. They were all pro players, after all. They didn’t need this leaderboard to prove themselves, and they didn’t care too much about particular rankings. They did care about the earnings that came with each ranking, but aside from that, it was all for fun. Would they really be jealous over something like this?</p>
<p>“Jealous my ass you fucker you fucker you fucker!!” Huang Shaotian responded instantly, chaining together so many swear words that it seemed like endless echoes.</p>
<p>System: Troubling Rain has been kicked out of [Glory Pro Players] by the group moderator.</p>
<p>Everyone sweatdropped. Several of the rookies in this group didn’t even dare to say a word.</p>
<p>The mighty Sword Saint, Glory’s number one Blade Master, was kicked out of the group just like that. Sure, this senior was very noisy, but if these rookies had been in Ye Xiu’s place, none of them would have the courage to treat a God like that!</p>
<p>Was this the power of Glory’s former king, God Ye Qiu?</p>
<p>This was the first time the rookies had really felt the power of this former king. After all, the retired Ye Xiu had been playing in the Challenger League during this past season, and hadn’t surfaced in this group often. And now, the king made his grand return. In one move, he ruthlessly assassinated the noisy God Huang Shaotian.</p>
<p>How powerful! How tyrannical!</p>
<p>The rookies quietly admired God Ye Xiu and sympathized for God Huang Shaotian.</p>
<p>“Anyone else?!” Ye Xiu called.</p>
<p>“Childish!” In fact, someone did still have the courage to speak out. Everyone saw the name, Desert Dust – it was Han Wenqing, a rare participant in the group chat. Was it that only someone like God Ye Xiu could induce him to speak here? And was it that only he, who had toppled Excellent Era’s dynasty, dared to directly call Ye Xiu out like this?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Some seniors corrected the rookies. The main reason that Han Wenqing dared to confront Ye Xiu was that he, too, was a group moderator.</p>
<p>Moderators had no way of moderating each other, so neither feared the other. The reality was often this ordinary and boring.</p>
<p>“Then, what about the group owner?” one of the rookies asked. Only the group owner was more powerful than a moderator.</p>
<p>“Group owner? After joining this group, have you ever seen the owner?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“The group owner is a long-retired player and left this circle long ago. All we have left is this group.”</p>
<p>“The group owner must have been a really incredible person,” the rookies marveled.</p>
<p>“Eh, he was alright,” was the response of the seniors. Because, in reality, this group-making senior really wasn’t all that special. Of course, this person had made it to the Glory professional scene, one person out of millions of players – from that angle, he could be considered a remarkable person. However, comparing him to other pros, he really was a very ordinary person. He just made this group, that’s all. There were no requirement necessary to do something as simple as that. Once again, the reality was disappointingly ordinary for the rookies.</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu, you bastard!” At this moment, Huang Shaotian crashed back into the group chat. His first sentence after returning was a shout at Ye Xiu. The rookies couldn’t help but feel awe at Huang Shaotian’s fearless spirit.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you off for today,” was Ye Xiu’s indifferent response. After that, despite Huang Shaotian’s provocations, he didn’t say another word, having either muted the chat or gone offline.</p>
<p>The group had to wait a while for Huang Shaotian’s ranting to subside. There was a moment where everyone thought, kicking out Huang Shaotian was actually pretty nice, why was he let back in?</p>
<p>Of course, these were just their thoughts. Kicking members, letting them back in, that was a battle for the moderators, a battle of gods. The rest of the ordinary members, no matter how important they might be in the pro sphere, were just insignificant little monsters in this group.</p>
<p>The group eventually quieted down, and everyone was finally able to discuss some more serious topics.</p>
<p>The pro players joked light-heartedly about Happy’s huge victory today in the event, but in their hearts they were all shocked by the outcome.</p>
<p>They too had participated in this event; they too could direct their guilds to accomplish the tasks they wanted, but why couldn’t they do what Ye Xiu had managed to accomplish?</p>
<p>“This guy, seriously…” One player wanted to talk about this, but couldn’t find the proper words to express what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>“The Glory Textbook…” In the end, it was Xiao Shiqin who brought up Ye Xiu’s long-time title. He then added, “An extremely comprehensive textbook.”</p>
<p>“Xiao Shiqin, you faced off directly with Happy. How is their team, really?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“What do you all think?” Xiao Shiqin asked. Even though these people hadn’t directly fought Happy, he knew that they had all paid close attention to Happy’s players. Happy was really in the spotlight right now!</p>
<p>“Some of the players on that team really do have skill,” said Lin Jingyan.</p>
<p>“Tang Rou?” Someone said. Indeed, Tang Rou, aside from Ye Xiu, was the most attention-grabbing member of Team Happy.</p>
<p>“A hot girl!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, when I saw that picture of her in Esports Home last time, I almost fell right in love!” Someone sent a rather shameless drooling emoji.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve already fallen in love?”</p>
<p>“You know, Happy really has a lot of hot girls!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s not fair!”</p>
<p>“Misty Rain’s two new sisters aren’t too bad looking either!”</p>
<p>“Twin flowers!” Drooling, it was the drooling emoji again.</p>
<p>“Could you all be any more despicable?” Finally, a table-slapping emoji – Chu Yunxiu of Team Misty Rain spoke up.</p>
<p>The group instantly fell dead silent.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the fans, the members of this group were refined, high-minded, all-powerful professionals, but in reality, they were just ordinary people who happened to be a little better at playing Glory. Like anyone else, they had normal thoughts and desires, good ones, bad ones, noble ones, dirty ones… Not to mention, this was a male-dominated world. So when a pretty female player was mentioned, it was inevitable that her gender and appearance would become the topic of discussion. Fortunately, Chu Yunxiu appeared at the right moment and cut short the vulgarity of this group of males.</p>
<p>“Tang Rou is an extremely outstanding player. It seems like lots of teams are interested in her, but in the end Happy was still able to hold on to her.” The discussion quickly turned back on-topic.</p>
<p>“She’s very strange, it’s unclear what she wants…” Wang Jiexi said. He was the first to offer her an invitation, and was also the first to be confused by her desires. Honor? Status? Money? He couldn’t figure out what would move her. These three things were the main motivations for most pro players!</p>
<p>After Wang Jiexi said this, Team Void’s Li Xuan added, “Happy’s Ghostblade is also pretty good! Wasn’t that kid on your Tiny Herb before? Why’d you just let him go?”</p>
<p>“You’re interested in him?” Wang Jiexi didn’t directly answer Li Xuan because he knew Li Xuan wasn’t really asking, it was just a casual comment. Every transfer period would have the transfers of good and even God-level players. Being a good player didn’t guarantee that one would be able to remain a part of the team.</p>
<p>“Us? For now, no,” Li Xuan said. But, he had said “for now.” Void’s Ghostblade Duo was still at their peak, they weren’t yet ready to retire, so they didn’t need another Ghostblade. However, did Li Xuan’s “for now” suggested that Void already had an idea in mind?</p>
<p>“Did anyone pay attention to that Brawler in Happy?” Samsara’s Jiang Botao suddenly spoke up, inserting himself into the conversation.</p>
<p>The group chat wasn’t like a competition onstage. During a competition, everyone could just battle to their fullest without holding back, but communication in the group involved feelings. There was less talk between those that didn’t know each other well, while veteran players who had interacted with each other more were much more familiar with each other, and thus tended to speak more. This was a normal pattern for any human interaction.</p>
<p>So, most of the time, veteran players took the initiative in conversations, while newer members of the group, even God-level players, found it difficult to open conversations in an unfamiliar setting, but this Jiang Botao was an exception to the rule – even though he couldn’t really be considered an old player, he had integrated with the older players early on, and he was able to communicate naturally with all types of people.</p>
<p>“Oh, that guy, you noticed him too? What do you think?” Lin Jingyan asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t know. I can’t understand him.” Jiang Botao said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1106: Event Easter Egg</p>
<p>The Gods certainly wouldn’t overlook Steamed Bun’s strength, but after a close investigation, they all shared the same thoughts as Jiang Botao: incomprehensible.</p>
<p>“His mechanics are pretty solid, but his decision-making is rather fleeting.” Lin Jingyan commented as the most experienced Brawler player in the chat.</p>
<p>“That’s what makes it incomprehensible!” Jiang Botao sighed.</p>
<p>“To quote Zhang Xinjie: an excessively random player.” Lin Jingyan said.</p>
<p>“That sounds like something he would say.” Li Xuan laughed. Zhang Xinjie was known for his strict manner, so randomness was his greatest enemy.</p>
<p>“All these assessments are very good! He is indeed very random, and his movements are very hard to predict. He doesn’t seem to use his experience and fights by relying on some sort of innate instinct.” Jiang Botao said.</p>
<p>“A natural destructor of balance.” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>“Were there any other players like him before?” Jiang Botao asked.</p>
<p>“Look at who typed before you.” Lin Jingyan laughed.</p>
<p>“Uh… the Magician was never this random.” Jiang Botao said.</p>
<p>“Is it because the Magician’s innate instinct is more precise?” Lin Jingyan said.</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty accurate explanation.” Jiang Botao was in a worshipping state.</p>
<p>“But do you still have this kind of instinct now, Wang Jiexi?” Lin Jingyan asked.</p>
<p>“Would you like to see for yourself?” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>“Haha, I wouldn’t dare.” Lin Jingyan laughed.</p>
<p>“What will Steamed Bun Invasion’s future be like?” Jiang Botao sent another thinking emoji.</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi was able to help Tiny Herb win the championships because he had adjusted his playstyle. Steamed Bun didn’t have the same talent as Wang Jiexi though. Could he continue to persist with such a random fighting style?</p>
<p>This kind of problem was difficult to answer, so the pro player chat fell silent. It was unknown what everyone was thinking. Perhaps it was about time for them to go to sleep…</p>
<p>The first day of Ghost Parade came to an end.</p>
<p>On the second day, the ghosts spawned again at the same time. However, some attentive players would notice that the number of ghosts that had spawned on the second day seemed to be greater than the first day.</p>
<p>Kill kill kill!</p>
<p>After gaining experience from day one, everyone no longer stumbled over fear before these weak ghosts. Although the ghosts had strong attacks, they had their own unique weaknesses. Even if the players couldn’t fully grasp their weakness, everyone could just group up and help one another.</p>
<p>As for the big guilds? They no longer hid or stayed on the conservative side. The moment the event started, they publicly announced in the guild for everyone to take note of the existence of any raised monsters.</p>
<p>Raising was no longer a method in this type of environment, so all of the guilds gave up on this thought.</p>
<p>Since they no longer had any strategical confrontations, it was natural for the leaderboards to have rises and drops on a large scale because everyone’s point totals were very close. Of course, the ones in the lead were the pro players. In the end, the ranking was no longer important because it depended on a person’s luck and the number of mobs they were able to find.</p>
<p>Third day, fourth day, fifth day……</p>
<p>The event progressed mundanely. The headstart the characters from Happy had achieved on the first day couldn’t serve as a strong foundation. Their ranks fell in the overall ranking. After all, effort was useless in this case because luck was something that couldn’t be explained.</p>
<p>The guild leaders of the big guilds finally let out a sigh of relief. They had been very worried if Ye Xiu had any demonic tricks up his sleeve. Now that a few days had passed, their hearts were at peace. They saw Lord Grim’s rank fall from first to seventh in the current overall ranking, so all the guild leaders felt an unspeakable happiness from inside.</p>
<p>However, they were still unhappy with the player on the top of the list.</p>
<p>Deception!</p>
<p>Mo Fan’s luck in the event for the past few days was pretty good. He was even able to pull a decent lead over those behind him in the rankings. The event only had two days left. Unless someone had an extraordinary boost in luck, first place seemed to be Happy’s.</p>
<p>The guild leaders were also racking their brains and wanted to use different methods to help their pro players. However, during the few days of peace, they had discovered a truth: in this peaceful environment, Ye Xiu didn’t seem to be so fearful; it was only when they tried to play tricks that they lost everything they invested by encountering Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Maybe they should gamble their luck for the next two days? If they concocted a plan, Ye Xiu might take advantage of it and send all of Happy’s characters into the top ten though.</p>
<p>It would be better to stay cautious!</p>
<p>As they thought, the top guilds decided to not speak or act. On the sixth day of the event, Deception’s place seemed immovable. However, Ye Xiu’s luck seemed to have gotten worse; Lord Grim fell straight out of top ten. This brought happiness to all the big guilds just by looking at it.</p>
<p>Following Lord Grim’s drop from the ranks, Happy only had Deception who was first in the top ten, the rest had fallen out of the top ten.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, it was the first time that all the spawned monsters were completely eliminated. No one would have thought that there was a bonus here. After the mobs had been cleared out, the system didn’t announce the event’s end for the day. Instead, it announced that after the monsters were all cleared, their Ghost Lair had been discovered by five heroic warriors.</p>
<p>These five monster-slaying heroic warriors were Peaceful Hermit, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, Deception, Something to Hide, and Howling Fire.</p>
<p>Everyone saw the names. These five were definitely not picked at random. They were the top five characters who managed to gain the most points today.</p>
<p>The system then announced that the five warriors would each lead a small team of five to enter the Ghost Lair to find the ghost king. The team who killed the ghost king would be awarded with their choice of materials and equipment as rewards.</p>
<p>When the details of this announcement came out, the teams that didn’t make it in today’s top five stamped their feet and beat their chest. The winner had the freedom to choose their rewards! Rewards like this were too too too tempting. All teams had a clear plan of what they needed, so rewards that could freely be chosen could complete their most crucial needs. However, the ones who had this opportunity were only those five characters. This meant that only their respective teams had the chance of getting this reward.</p>
<p>Peaceful Hermit, Team Royal Style.</p>
<p>Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, Team Tyranny.</p>
<p>Deception, Team Happy.</p>
<p>Something to Hide, Team Misty Rain.</p>
<p>Howling Fire, Team Wind Howl.</p>
<p>Every character could bring five people, which meant that this was a standard team. The competition between the five teams would then unfold in the Ghost Lair, which was suspected to be a dungeon.</p>
<p>The people, who didn’t get the chance, were cursing, while the five, who got the chance, were already starting to organize their teams When the system announcement came out, the five each received a teleportation scroll to Ghost Lair. If the scroll wasn’t used in ten minutes, it would self-destruct automatically. This meant that they must create a team within ten minutes.</p>
<p>This was too easy for a team; they only had to bring in the formation of the main force and a five-man team would instantly be ready to go.</p>
<p>However, Something to Hide had a bit of a problem. His player, Lu Yining, was a sub in Team Misty Rain. Especially after Misty Rain had enrolled the beautiful Sharpshooter sisters, as another Sharpshooter player, the chances of him leaving this summer were very high. Players, who were put in this sort of situation, wouldn’t be in the mood to sacrifice their break to get stronger. This was because there was a high possibility that their character would no longer be theirs next season. However, each person would look at each problem differently. Lu Yining figured that the probability of transferring to another team was very high, so he joined the event with vigor. He hoped his professional and vigorous attitude would give his potential bosses good impressions, which was more beneficial for his future development.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in fighting these monsters for any pro player because everyone would have the same efficiency. Lu Yining’s luck was pretty good today since he was ranked fourth and even helped Team Misty Rain get an entrance ticket to the event. When he realized that he was a character about to be abandoned by the team, Lu Yining truly had the heart to throw the scroll away. However, he clearly cared more about the feedback he would receive for his actions, so he could only forcefully raise his spirits to find his teammates from Misty Rain.</p>
<p>Another player who had a problem was Deception.</p>
<p>The system announcement was very clear about the bonus event, but the entrance ticket was a teleportation scroll that was only valid for ten minutes. Only Mo Fan knew this detail.</p>
<p>He was waiting for Ye Xiu and the others to call for him to group up, but no one knew about the time limit, so they were taking their time in handling the tasks they had in hand. Seconds and minutes flew by. Mo Fan looked around, hoping that someone would notice him. No one did. Neither did anyone send him a message in the game.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Nine minutes, eight minutes, seven minutes……</p>
<p>Two minutes!</p>
<p>Mo Fan was so anxious that he stood up. With that, he was finally able to get everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“Two minutes left.” He said.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Everyone was puzzled.</p>
<p>Mo Fan looked at the teleportation scroll, which his mouse was hovering over. It was no longer two minutes, but 1 minute and 45 seconds.</p>
<p>“Form a party for the Ghost Lair.” Mo Fan said.</p>
<p>“Oh oh, let me see who should go!” Ye Xiu looked to the left and right unhurriedly.</p>
<p>“Quick, one minute and half!” Mo Fan said.</p>
<p>“There’s a time limit? Fuck, why did you only tell us this when there’s only a minute and half left!” After Ye Xiu understood, he panicked. “Little Tang, Steamed Bun, Mucheng, let’s go!”</p>
<p>The moment Mo Fan heard Ye Xiu randomly call out the names of the people he picked, he quickly sent team invitations to the characters. It was only when he was about to type their names that he realized he hadn’t even added these people as friends.</p>
<p>The sweat on Mo Fan’s head was about to fall, his hand speed increased explosively while Ye Xiu was hurrying him: “Hurry hurry hurry.” Due to a slip of his hand, he messed up on of the names. Dancing Rain… such a strange name*. Mo Fan even hurried and cursed at it.</p>
<p>At last, the five-man team was formed when the scroll only had ten seconds left. Mo Fan didn’t even dare delay for half a second as he clicked the ‘use’ button with a right click. Happy’s five-man team entered the Ghost Lair.</p>
<p>“Stay alert.” After they were teleported, this was the first thing Ye Xiu said. Only one team could win the prize, but the system didn’t explain how they would get it. Did each team enter different dungeons and compete for the fastest speed? Or did they all enter one dungeon, so they would have to fight the ghost king as well as one another? None of this was known at the moment. Ye Xiu reminded them to stay alert beforehand in order to avoid the second situation. He quickly spun around in a full circle and began observing the situation in the Ghost Lair.</p>
<p>Chapter 1107: Ghost Lair</p>
<p>“Stay quiet for now.” Ye Xiu sent this message to the team. Right now, not only did they have to watch, they had to listen, and perhaps they would hear the voices of other teams talking.</p>
<p>So everyone kept silent. There wasn’t a single sound to be heard.</p>
<p>This Ghost Lair was an underground dungeon, the type where you couldn’t see the sky. Ye Xiu looked around carefully and didn’t hear anything, but he didn’t dare to be overconfident, and sent in the team channel: “We’ll use messages to communicate for now.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” the others answered.</p>
<p>“There are two paths, which should we take?” While Ye Xiu had been examining the surroundings, the others had as well, and Su Mucheng saw that they could take either a left or a right tunnel from their start point.</p>
<p>The situation was entirely unclear and there were no clues, so right or left didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Either’s fine!” Ye Xiu said. His Lord Grim was already headed toward the left tunnel.</p>
<p>“Will there be small monsters?” Tang Rou asked.</p>
<p>“Still not clear, let’s just all be careful!” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the five characters had all entered the left tunnel.</p>
<p>“What’s that sound?” Ye Xiu immediately sensed something.</p>
<p>Everyone listened closely. There was indeed a sound, a sort of rumbling that seemed to be getting closer and closer, and then their cameras began to tremble, as though the ground itself were shaking. At the end of the tunnel, there was a shadowy mass that kept approaching, until they could finally see what it was.</p>
<p>“What, how cliche!” Ye Xiu yelled.</p>
<p>“Run!” Su Mucheng said, already using Aerial Cannon to retreat. The other four also turned their characters and began to sprint back along the path they came. Behind them was an enormous boulder rolling toward them, so large that it filled the entire tunnel.</p>
<p>With this, the issue of which path to take was resolved.</p>
<p>They returned to their start point and charged into the right tunnel, but that boulder was persistent. The system must have helped it move, because it also rolled into the right tunnel, and continued to chase them.</p>
<p>“Watch your rhythm!” Ye Xiu reminded everyone, seeing the boulder’s perseverance. How long would they have to run along until this was over?</p>
<p>So they ran and ran, the boulder behind them. There was still no way for them to get rid of it, and the road ahead didn’t show any new opponents. It was just one tunnel, continuing on.</p>
<p>“What’s that new sound?” At this moment, Su Mucheng heard some new movements.</p>
<p>“Echoes?” Ye Xiu guessed.</p>
<p>“No… ahead… it sounds like the same thing is happening,” Tang Rou said. With her ear training, her ability to distinguish sounds was quite high.</p>
<p>“No way? That shameless?” The five were dumbfounded. They hadn’t even done anything since entering the Ghost Lair! Sending boulders from the left and right tunnels to squish them dead, wasn’t this design just too unreasonable?</p>
<p>When they thought of that, the five couldn’t be bothered to continue running. Their footsteps slowed to a halt, but then they heard very clearly, aside from the sounds of a boulder up ahead, there was also the sound of hurried footsteps.</p>
<p>“Oh hey, another group as unlucky as us?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“There has to be an exit. Let’s continue forward!” said Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>The five once again began their frantic running.</p>
<p>At last, they could clearly see the boulder ahead that was rolling toward them. But more clearly, they could see the five characters running ahead of it, almost like the opening credits of the animation Saint Seiya.</p>
<p>The five now discovered Happy’s five, or perhaps they had heard their sounds earlier, but they didn’t falter in their steps, because the danger of getting flattened by the boulder was much more pressing than the danger posed by Happy. If they hesitated for just a second, the boulder would crush them.</p>
<p>“Yo, it’s the old bros!”</p>
<p>As they neared, Ye Xiu called out. The five that were approaching were none other than Team Tyranny, and the characters were the five on their main roster, including the four Gods.</p>
<p>“Is there no path on your end?” Someone from Tyranny shouted toward them.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>“Is this system actually as shameless as you are?” Zhang Jiale exclaimed.</p>
<p>But right at that moment, the two approaching teams simultaneously discovered a thread of hope. Right between the two teams, there was an indentation on one side of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Did it lead to an exit? They couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>But this was the only choice they had, unless they just waited to be crushed by the two boulders!</p>
<p>Lord Grim dashed forward and was the first to get into this temporary hiding spot.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was the second to enter, and immediately raised his guns toward Lord Grim. He didn’t fire, but kept a close watch on Lord Grim’s movements. Afterwards, the characters of the two teams jumped in one by one. This wasn’t any exit, it was just a nook in the wall. With ten people squeezed inside, it suddenly felt like a crowded elevator.</p>
<p>“Zhang Jiale, what are you so nervous for? Are you claustrophobic?” Ye Xiu ridiculed Zhang Jiale’s distrustful attitude.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale hadn’t relaxed a single bit, and neither had Han Wenqing, Lin Jingyan, or Zhang Xinjie. They all paid close attention to the actions of Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim.</p>
<p>“You ran quite fast, you were the second to enter.” Ye Xiu continued to talk. The word “second” stung Zhang Jiale, and he was absolutely sure that Ye Xiu was doing this on purpose, because that guy added, “What place were you on the leaderboard again? To get the teleportation scroll.”</p>
<p>For today’s leaderboard, Zhang Jiale had gotten second place.</p>
<p>“Fuck you!” As Zhang Jiale swore, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms finally lowered his gun. Not because Ye Xiu’s taunting made him forget his wariness, but because just now, there was a giant crash as the two boulders finally collided, just outside of the nook. Just like that, the two teams, ten people, were shut into a nook that was about as large as an elevator.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Someone said, confused.</p>
<p>“There should be an exit,” Zhang Xinjie said.</p>
<p>“Where’s the exit? There’s not a lot of space here, if I turn around I might hit you with my weapon!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Hey don’t move now, be good for once!” Dazzling Hundred Blossoms raised his gun again.</p>
<p>“Fuck, don’t be so arrogant, you’re not the only one who can do that!” Lord Grim raised his Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, now in gun form. Su Mucheng’s Dancing Rain followed suit in perfect partnership, and her cannon was much more impressive than the small pistol in Dazzling Hundred Blossoms’ hand.</p>
<p>“Everyone, look around, see if you can find anything on the walls near you.” Zhang Xinjie completely ignored this squabble.</p>
<p>And so Zhang Jiale turned his camera to look at the walls near him, when – bang! The sound of a gun. Lord Grim had opened fire!</p>
<p>“My bad my bad, it went off accidentally!” Ye Xiu’s voice came almost as quickly as the sound of the gun.</p>
<p>Would a game have accidents like this? Of course not! Zhang Jiale fumed, and Dazzling Hundred Blossoms reached for a hand grenade.</p>
<p>“Calm down, that can’t go off accidentally.” Ye Xiu hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“It seems like there’s something over here.” Lin Jingyan’s voice finally drew everyone’s attention once and for all.</p>
<p>“Oh, looks like it’s nothing…” Lin Jingyan said.</p>
<p>“How do you know?” asked Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Because I already smashed it.” Lin Jingyan’s Brawler pulled his fist from the wall. His weapons were claws, after all. With one claw, he destroyed his discovery, and also got his hand stuck there…</p>
<p>“It looks like there isn’t any trick here,” said Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>If there was no trick, would they just be stuck in here forever?</p>
<p>“Try blowing apart the two boulders.” Tyranny’s Captain Han Wenqing finally offered this solution.</p>
<p>“How tyrannical.” Ye Xiu sent a thumbs up emoji.</p>
<p>Straight Punch!</p>
<p>Han Wenqing was a man of action. As soon as he finished speaking, his Desert Dust already sent a Straight Punch toward the boulder on the left, in order to try and send it rolling in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>But even with this punch, the boulder didn’t move at all.</p>
<p>Collapsing Fist!</p>
<p>Han Wenqing’s willpower was similarly unmoved. Desert Dust continued with a barrage of attacks, yet the boulder still refused to budge.</p>
<p>Emperor’s Fist!</p>
<p>One of the Striker’s fiercest charged attacks was unleashed. It looked the same as a normal punch, but it would be a big mistake to think that this was only as strong as a normal punch.</p>
<p>The Emperor’s Fist burst forth! At the same time, a silhouette flashed to Desert Dust’s side.</p>
<p>Lord Grim, a Falling Flower Palm struck the boulder at the same time as Desert Dust’s attack.</p>
<p>With that, the boulder finally wobbled a bit, as though it were finally about to separate from its companion.</p>
<p>But it still wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Desert Dust clenched his two fists and his body tensed. Striker Level 75 status skill: One Inch Burst.</p>
<p>A high-end status in which the attack range was shortened to raise the power of the strike. Desert Dust released a chain of punches, the Level 70 skill “Ferocious Tiger Flurry.”</p>
<p>Light flashed. There was the nonstop sound of strikes hitting the boulder, which continued to lurch back and forth, and finally seemed as though it were about to separate from its partner.</p>
<p>“Little Tang!” Ye Xiu called.</p>
<p>“Coming!” Tang Rou answered. Soft Mist twisted her spear, Rising Dragon Soars the Sky!</p>
<p>The Battle Mage’s Rising Dragon Soars the Sky had a high knockback effect, and was now used by Soft Mist from a close range on the boulder. Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim couldn’t contribute this high-level attack, and just used another Falling Flower Palm to increase the pushing force.</p>
<p>Rising Dragon Soars the Sky slammed into the boulder. The boulder wasn’t easily pushed away, but Soft Mist herself was pushed back from the force of the blow.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinjie’s Immovable Rock immediately stood behind her.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan, Zhang Jiale, Su Mucheng… Everyone’s characters immediately clustered together, giving Soft Mist support.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The boulder finally rolled in the opposite direction. Between the two boulders there was finally a gap through which people could pass.</p>
<p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“It knocked away some of my health.” Lin Jingyan looked at his character. Just now, when they had all gone to use their bodies to support Soft Mist, they had suffered some damage.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinjie sent a few heals his way, then glanced at Happy – they hadn’t brought a healer.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and Han Wenqing’s characters had already walked between the boulders to look around and evaluate their next step.</p>
<p>“Are we going to continue pushing them like this?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>“There’s a little bit of space above, we can see if we can squeeze through,” said Ye Xiu, after studying the surroundings.</p>
<p>The boulder didn’t block the tunnel entirely – in order for it to roll along, there had to be some space. At the top, especially at the two sides of the tunnel, it looked as though there were enough space for a character to pass through.</p>
<p>“We’ll go this way.” Ye Xiu pointed to the path from which his team had come.</p>
<p>“We’ll go this way.” Han Wenqing turned to face their own path.</p>
<p>“I hope we don’t meet again.”</p>
<p>“Likewise,” said Han Wenqing.</p>
<p>“Alright everyone let’s go, watch out for these sneaky old foxes attacking us from behind, hurry, hurry.” Ye Xiu directed his team.</p>
<p>Chapter 1108: Shards of the Ghost King’s Chamber</p>
<p>The two teams took a path each and soon made their way through the gap on top. Two large boulders laid between them.</p>
<p>Before they got a good understanding of the Ghost Lair, it was reasonable for the two teams to not have any real conflicts. However, they still secretly hoped that when the other team climbed over, another boulder would immediately come to squish them flat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both sides were disappointed. After they climbed over the boulder, the whole path stayed clear. After they walked through the same path as before, the dungeon finally started to open up more.</p>
<p>“This seems like a tomb.” The five members of Happy reached the tunnel’s end. The room was square and very spacious. It was also e quite tidy. Apart from the chamber… there seemed to be no other constructions in the dungeon.</p>
<p>After he spoke, the center of the room started to move and creak, a stone coffin slowly rose up from the ground.</p>
<p>“Hm? Is the boss about to spawn?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Ghost king?”</p>
<p>“This easy? We gained without spending any effort!” Ye Xiu spoke while the five members of Happy started to stand in formation.</p>
<p>“We should figure out the boss’s attack patterns before we start our attacks. We don’t have a healer, so everyone should be extra careful.” Ye Xiu reminded. Judging from the general event, the ghosts had high attack, but weak defenses. It was easy to handle them after their weakness was found, but before that, they were hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the seaweed monster, the boss should be able to deal damage at that level. That ghost’s attack was strong to the point it could instant kill anyone.</p>
<p>Happy scattered and stood in position. The stone coffin was also finally able to rise up completely from the ground. A a creaking sound came out as the coffin lid was pushed aside.</p>
<p>The five were relatively calm because they had seen too many of these tricks in the game. A player might find it mysterious and terrifying the first time, but they grew insensitive to these long ago.</p>
<p>When the coffin lid was shifted halfway, a pale, slim hand rose up to grab the edge of the coffin. The thing that was previously sleeping in there quickly sat up.</p>
<p>It was a female ghost.</p>
<p>The hair, skin, and clothing. All gave hints about it being a female ghost.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t hesitate and threw a grenade into the stone coffin.</p>
<p>The grenade exploded and the female ghost shrieked, her voice sounded as if she was terrified. Being scared by this type of skill wasn’t something that should happen to a boss.</p>
<p>The female ghost flew out from the stone coffin and rushed towards Lord Grim’s direction with a shrill shriek.</p>
<p>The surrounding area instantly turned piercing cold.</p>
<p>“Ice attack!” Ye Xiu called and Lord Grim had already rolled to the side.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain set up her cannon, and three consecutive shots were let out. The female ghost was very quick and knew how to dodge the attacks. This was indeed the sort of intellect only bosses possessed.</p>
<p>After dodging past the three Anti-Tank Missiles, Tang Rou’s Soft Mist blocked her way. She used series of low-level skills, combined with Chasers. This forced the female ghost to a point she couldn’t fight back.</p>
<p>“Be careful, don’t fight too close together!” Ye Xiu reminded.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Tang Rou’s focus was concentrated. What other unknown attacks did this female ghost have? They didn’t know, but someone had to try. They wouldn’t be able to test her thoroughly if they relied on long-ranged attacks, so they could only try with different methods.</p>
<p>A Fire Chaser flew out. The buff from the Fire Chaser wrapped around Soft Mist’s arms and her strength increased significantly. The female ghost let out another mournful scream.</p>
<p>“She’s afraid of fire, so she’s a pure ice-type!” Ye Xiu recognized firmly.</p>
<p>“Gasoline Bottle!” Ye Xiu shouted at Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun Invasion threw out a Gasoline Bottle, and as expected, the female ghost was suffering and enraged in every way.</p>
<p>“Flame Cut!” Ye Xiu called again.</p>
<p>Deception sprinted ahead.Trails of fire followed behind the ninja blades as they sliced the female ghost’s body.</p>
<p>The female ghost continued to shriek miserably. As the blade pierced her body, it directly left a cutting mark that seemed burnt. It seemed that this was more effective than the previous fire-type attacks.</p>
<p>However, the female ghost’s counterattacks also became incisive. She opened her mouth and blew out a gust of icy whirlwind. It was quick and covered a large area. Deception tried to dodge, but he wasn’t able to dodge it fully, so his left arm, which got caught in the wind, turned into an ice block.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Ye Xiu asked. He wanted to know the effect of this attack.</p>
<p>“It’s frozen.” Mo Fan replied. This was the state the system gave Deception’s left arm at the time.</p>
<p>“Can you still form seals?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Mo Fan said. All his controls that included movements with his left arm were forcibly deactivated. All the seals naturally required both hands, so without his left arm, the seals couldn’t be formed.</p>
<p>“Then it would be like a Silence?” Ye Xiu said. Steamed Bun was a good fellow, when he saw Mo Fan’s Deception was injured, he gave up his safety to help. However, the female ghost was very agile, so after she had injured Deception, she immediately turned around to blow towards Steamed Bun Invasion.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Steamed Bun!” Ye Xiu reminded immediately. Steamed Bun had already dashed behind the female ghost, but he didn’t expect her to suddenly turn around and blow straight onto Steamed Bun Invasion’s head.</p>
<p>Could it be that his head would be sealed? What were the results of that? Would his Intelligence decrease drastically? Because his brain was frozen?</p>
<p>Steamed Bun roared even sharper than the female ghost’s scream. Of course, his roar didn’t deal any damage, because key presses were required for an attack.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun Invasion, who faced the female ghost directly, lifted both his arms with a calm and collected manner.</p>
<p>The female ghost opened her mouth to blow a gust of icy whirlwind, but she was lifted horizontally in midair. Steamed Bun was able to brush straight past her.</p>
<p>Back Throw!</p>
<p>Steamed Bun Invasion threw the female ghost out with a Back Throw, so the icy whirlwind didn’t even manage to brush him.</p>
<p>“This guy…” Ye Xiu was covered in cold sweat head to toe. He managed to use Back Throw’s control to dodge the attack. Ye Xiu wasn’t sure whether Steamed Bun consciously knew what he was doing, but it was a brilliant move nonetheless by replacing defense with offense.</p>
<p>“So close so close!” In the next second, Steamed Bun exclaimed and controlled his character to escape by rolling and crawling. He carefully kept his distance between the female ghost.</p>
<p>They had discovered the female ghost’s weakness and had witnessed her attacks. Ye Xiu quickly adjusted his strategical thoughts, and commanded how everyone should deal with the ghost.</p>
<p>The grave chamber was instantly filled with shrill shrieks of the female ghost. After further inspection, the ice-type attack she activated through her shrieks was the fastest and strongest. Finally, with the cost of Steamed Bun Invasion’s head being frozen, the female ghost was completely taken down within some wave of attacks.</p>
<p>Everyone hurriedly rushed ahead to surround Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>There was a large ice cube on his head. At this moment, Steamed Bun Invasion looked like a bean sprout.</p>
<p>“What’s up, is your Intelligence still normal?” Ye Xiu was concerned about his hypothesis.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with my IQ.” Steamed Bun said.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu noticed that his voice was weak. It was obvious that the sound didn’t come from the game. His voice had reached his ear in the training room, but it had been sealed in the game. This was very realistic because his mouth was one of the parts that were frozen!</p>
<p>“I mean your Intelligence stat.” Ye Xiu spoke while he clicked onto Steamed Bun to check his stats.</p>
<p>His Intelligence was normal.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that a frozen brain meant lower Intelligence proved to be false.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the large, frozen head, Steamed Bun Invasion took a few steps forward. He swayed to and fro, which showed his terrible balance. This was probably due to the destruction dealt by the freeze.</p>
<p>“Look, what’s this!” When everyone surrounded Steamed Bun Invasion, Su Mucheng noticed an item dropped by the female ghost.</p>
<p>Shard for the Ghost King’s Chamber.</p>
<p>“Hm……” Ye Xiu saw it.</p>
<p>If there was one shard, there would definitely be a second one, as well as a third, fourth, or fifth. The female ghost was obviously not the Ghost King, but one of his subordinates. The shards of this chamber was probably a type of key to unlock the hidden chamber. How many shards were there? Were they still on the boss? Since they have already collected it, if someone else wanted it, would they have to kill them in order for the shard to drop? Could the teams cooperate by using the shards together?</p>
<p>He tried to use it by right-clicking it. The system said that they needed the second, third, fourth, and fifth shard.</p>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>Between the five teams, the five shards could only be used when they were put together. Through this type of method, only one team out of the five would have the opportunity to fight the Ghost King in the end.</p>
<p>Countless of thoughts flashed past Ye Xiu’s head. At that moment, the wall facing them started to crumble. In an instant, the wall vanished. The crushed stones left on the ground didn’t seem to match the quantity lost on the wall.</p>
<p>When the wall tumbled down, the chamber became even more spacious. Ye Xiu immediately saw a team before them who also just finished watching the wall tumble. Most importantly, a ghost’s corpse also laid on their side. It wasn’t the fully pale female ghost, but it should have been a ghost on the same level.</p>
<p>The people on both sides were startled at first, then they became aware of something. The pupils of the players on both sides contracted.</p>
<p>Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire!</p>
<p>The opponent’s attacks came quicker and more direct. Young people! They were always rather impatient.</p>
<p>The people who came over from the opposite side of Happy belonged to Team Wind Howl. Zhao Yuzhe immediately launched an attack. He attacked while using the spell’s lights to cover his team. The tomb chamber was wide and spacious, so there were no covers. After going through two years of his career life, Zhao Yuzhe was no longer a fresh rookie. He was one of the excellent players from the new generation, despite not having received a God’s title yet.</p>
<p>The five from Happy dodged hurriedly.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy to dodge such a high-level skill when it was launched straight ahead without any base. Even Steamed Bun Invasion, who still carried the large ice cube on his head managed to sway aside and dodge.</p>
<p>However, Zhao Yuzhe’s aim wasn’t to attack in the first place, his intentions mainly laid in screening.</p>
<p>This was a fairly mature way of fighting for Wind Howl. Under the cover of his spell’s light, Wind Howl’s master of playing dirty, Fang Rui, started to fill the ground with his traps.</p>
<p>“Retreat for now.” Ye Xiu informed. Steamed Bu Invasion’s rhythm was slow and his balance was messed up because his head was still frozen. Happy couldn’t fight at full power at the moment, so they could only keep away from the vanguard temporarily.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Team Wind Howl’s captain and ace, Tang Hao, was the type who wouldn’t let things slip when he had a reason not to.</p>
<p>The more Happy retreated, the fiercer he rushed ahead.</p>
<p>The Brawler was originally a class that was very nimble and could change constantly. But with the class in his hands at this moment, Demon Subduer was brave and fierce like Desert Dust, the King of Fighting.</p>
<p>Tang Hao was extremely annoyed over the fact that his Brawler didn’t have an impressive title.</p>
<p>Just like the Battle God, Great Gunner, Sword Saint, and King of Fighting, Demon Subduer should have an extravagant title too.</p>
<p>Demon Subduer then rushed ahead with a tyranny that his class didn’t originally possess…</p>
<p>Chapter 1109: Two 1v4s</p>
<p>“He’s too arrogant.” Ye Xiu sighed deeply upon seeing the ferocity of Tang Hao’s Demon Subduer. “Old Lin was never so indecent, despite playing a Brawler his whole life.”</p>
<p>“Steamed Bun, why is your head still frozen?” Ye Xiu spoke as he turned around to see Steamed Bun Invasion’s big frozen head.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun shook his big frozen head and expressed helplessness and regret.</p>
<p>Demon Subduer arrived. He was currently the blade of Wind Howl, a dagger that was even sharper than when Lin Jingyan was present.</p>
<p>Poison Needle, Gasoline Bottle, Sand Toss…</p>
<p>Demon Subduer used a series of skills the moment he arrived. Lord Grim opened up his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella into its shield form. Tang Hao was enraged and made Demon Subduer leap up. He stamped directly onto Lord Grim’s head as he flew above the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella.</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella contracted immediately. Behind the umbrella stood Dancing Rain’s cannon, which was already set in place.</p>
<p>Tang Hao’s heart thudded. The ray from Laser Rifle was launched out of the mouth of Dancing Rain’s cannon.</p>
<p>Eagle Stamp!</p>
<p>Demon Subduer forcibly used this technique in midair, which seemed to have allowed him to halt momentarily during the time he stamped. He used the very technique Han Wenqing had used against Sun Xiang in the All Stars Challenge.</p>
<p>However, the AoE that the Laser Rifle covered wasn’t something one could fully dodge just by making small changes such as a temporary halt in midair. Half of Demon Subduer’s body was blasted by the Laser Rifle, and the strong force made him go spiraling through the air. There was a roof because they were in a dungeon. In the end, Demon Subduer didn’t continue to fly in midair, but instead crashed rather tragically into the ceiling…..</p>
<p>“Young people…” Ye Xiu sighed emotionally as he enjoyed the sight of Demon Subduer embedded in the roof.</p>
<p>Tang Hao felt extremely aggravated, such a penetrating charge was instantly defused with the snap of a finger. He was even embedded into the ceiling like some sort of hanging light, how could he endure this?</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t all!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu wouldn’t let things slip when given the opportunity. Such as now, he was sighing with emotion as the muzzle of the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella was aimed at Demon Subduer. With the addition of Dancing Rain, two sets of Gatling Guns were brought out together. The bullets crossed and shot Demon Subduer in sync. The attacks were very satisfying.</p>
<p>Unsightly, it was too unsightly.</p>
<p>Even the teammates of Tang Hao found it difficult to watch. They rushed ahead to save him. As a result of this, it was Happy’s turn to act tyrannically.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!</p>
<p>Tang Rou’s Soft Mist sprinted ahead by using her customary starting skill. The players of Wind Howl, who sprinted ahead and were ready to attack, went past her like a strong gale. Soft Mist didn’t bother with the charging players ahead, but passed through a gap between them to look for the healer standing behind them instead.</p>
<p>The players of Wind Howl were stuck in a difficult situation. They had their captain at the front, and the healer at the back. Who should they save first?</p>
<p>“Save the healer!” Their leader finally gave them a command.</p>
<p>Everyone retreated to save the healer in a hurry. Lord Grim and Dancing Rain’s joint shooting was also finally complete, and Demon Subduer fell down. Tang Hao impatiently wanted to attack.</p>
<p>A shadow suddenly flickered behind him.</p>
<p>Tang Hao was able to notice it, but since he was still adjusting himself in midair, he wasn’t able to make too many movements freely.</p>
<p>It was as if the other team had prepared for it, because they started their attacks immediately.</p>
<p>Countless shadows scattered around Demon Subduer.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Shadow Dance!</p>
<p>Mo Fan was the one who attacked. Deception grabbed onto the chance by giving Demon Subduer a wave of fierce attacks as he dropped from the air.</p>
<p>Tang Hao was on the verge of coughing up blood. He had never been beaten into such a wretched state like this, not even when he was playing in professional matches. He was passive in every way, powerless to fight back.</p>
<p>He longed for reinforcement, but he had just told everyone to save the healer. If he immediately called out for them to help again, wouldn’t it become a joke? Would he have any reputation left?</p>
<p>Tang Hao could only grit his teeth and endure.</p>
<p>Wait until I reach the ground!</p>
<p>He thought to himself.</p>
<p>He finally reached the ground.</p>
<p>What met him were Poison Needles, a Gasoline Bottle, and a Sand Toss!</p>
<p>He used these three skills earlier when he sprinted boldly ahead with the grandeur of annihilating Happy all by himself. As Happy welcomed his landing with joy, they used the same three skills.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun finally attacked. When the ice around his head melted, his condition returned to normal and he became exceptionally nimble.</p>
<p>Tang Hao wanted to avoid it, but couldn’t. He truly longed for reinforcements, so he spun his camera around. He then realized that Happy had Tang Rou take on the four players of Wind Howl by herself.</p>
<p>It’s been so long and you still haven’t taken her down? Tang Hao was truly angry. Honestly speaking, he had never really thought much of Happy, including Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Ever since he had gained fame in the All Stars Weekend by usurping the senior as a junior, he naturally possessed a strong psychological advantage when he fought with the older generation.</p>
<p>For him, Team Happy was just a combination of old farts and rookies. What was there to fear? A bunch of Gods were even seriously analyzing the members of Happy in the pro player chat. Was that necessary?</p>
<p>And now, it seemed that the four from his team weren’t able to swiftly take down Soft Mist like he had expected. After feeling mad, he realized that he needed to face Happy seriously.</p>
<p>Soft Mist was fighting four by herself, and he was currently fighting four as well. Despite fighting the same numbers, they were in completely different situations: she had the initiative, while he didn’t.</p>
<p>Soft Mist was doing what he had originally intended to do! He was able to sprint ahead with daring spirit because he had planned to stall the majority of the opposition’s main force by himself like what Soft Mist was achieving right now. Then, his side would have the numbers advantage. This was the role of an ace.</p>
<p>But now, he was on the back end.</p>
<p>It could be said that the purpose of him as the ace was completely blown off by Happy. He had walked straight into the trap!</p>
<p>However, he didn’t want to lose face. He didn’t want to call for reinforcements because he wanted to take on the burden of the current situation by himself.</p>
<p>After Steamed Bun Invasion had greeted him with three skills after his landing, he dashed ahead with a Strangle.</p>
<p>Tang Hao was naturally incomparably familiar with the Brawler skills. When Steamed Bun Invasion slightly moved his shoulder, he predicted that a Strangle was coming. Tang Hao hastily controlled Demon Subduer to dodge. No matter what happened at this moment, he would not allow himself to be hit by this type of CC skill.</p>
<p>Despite having avoided Steamed Bun Invasion’s Strangle, Demon Subduer was still caught in a Strangle.</p>
<p>Lord Grim’s Strangle.</p>
<p>This was a low level skill under Level 20, so it was natural for the unspecialised Lord Grim to use it.</p>
<p>The Strangle was the starting signal for focusing a target. When he was taken down by the Strangle, the other three immediately launched another wave of targeted attacks. They wouldn’t be able to recover because they didn’t bring any healers, which increased the risk in fighting, but when focusing on a single target, their attacks stirred the soul.</p>
<p>On the other side, Fang Rui’s group of four was dealing with Tang Rou. Even though Fang Rui was an expert, his style of playing dirty was never a quick-paced fighting method. His specialty lay in continuous consumption. However, Tang Rou’s ferocity and boldness made Fang Rui feel uneasy. He most definitely did not disapprove of the players of Happy like Tang Hao. There was no problem in taking Soft Mist down at all, but it definitely was not as easy as taking her down in one go the moment they reached her. More time was needed.</p>
<p>If they needed more time on their side, what about Tang Hao? Could he hold on?</p>
<p>Fang Rui soon recognized this problem. However, the moment he looked at the other side, he witnessed Tang Hao being in a complete mess as he was tortured by the other four. His situation was more miserable than that of Tang Rou’s.</p>
<p>Fang Rui sighed. He knew that Tang Hao’s pride wouldn’t allow him to call for help. But at the moment, he really, really needed reinforcement.</p>
<p>Switch targets!</p>
<p>Under the signal of Fang Rui, Zhao Yuzhe’s group of three sprinted to assist Tang Hao. They left Tang Rou for Fang Rui to fight by himself because they didn’t have any doubts about Fang Rui’s abilities.</p>
<p>When the three switched targets to reinforce the other side, Tang Rou now had a much easier time. After all, Tang Rou wasn’t able to take care of every single one of the four.</p>
<p>However, the moment they left the battle to switch targets, Fang Rui immediately said: “Fuck.”</p>
<p>Soft Mist immediately increased her speed.</p>
<p>By going from a 1v4 to a 1v1, it was natural for her to suddenly release her battle prowess after the pressure dropped. What Fang Rui didn’t expect was Soft Mist’s immediate increase in speed to be so astonishing. What type of acceleration was this? At this moment, Fang Rui felt threatened and nearly lost his composure.</p>
<p>He was the master at playing dirty, after all. Patience and calmness were top qualities that this style required. However, a mere increase in speed but nothing else had frightened Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Then, her hand speed burst forth. A wave of powerful attacks pursued and rumbled its way towards Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon, the only target. Fang Rui realized that Tang Rou’s sudden increase in speed had covered all of the distance between them. He was too busy being shocked that he actually forgot to pull away to a comfortable distance.</p>
<p>Thieves weren’t specialized in close-combat fights. After suddenly having Soft Mist sticking with him, the wave of power smashed Fang Rui’s heart into pieces. What made it worse was that the power didn’t seem to have an end to it. What type of fighting spirit is this? Fang Rui was unable to relate this with the pretty girl in the report, who was beautiful to the point that one’s heart would feel untroubled and pleased.</p>
<p>What a troublesome person!</p>
<p>Fang Rui came up with this complete analysis. However, despite being hard to deal with, he still believed that he could handle her. Doubtful Demon was on the defensive under Soft Mist’s suppression and continued to retreat step by step. However, they were moving straight towards the direction Fang Rui had hoped to reach.</p>
<p>Nearly there!</p>
<p>Fang Rui counted quietly. As a master at playing dirty, it would be impossible for him to forget where he had previously planted his trap. That was alway his strongest weapon.</p>
<p>Young people!</p>
<p>Seeing Tang Rou’s ferocity when she fought closed up, Fang Rui thought to himself.</p>
<p>But it’s over now.</p>
<p>Fang Rui smiled. He was about to succeed in fooling a person. He enjoyed this kind of feeling, the delight when a prey lost it composure the moment it was caught in a trap.</p>
<p>What sort of reaction would this pretty girl make?</p>
<p>Fang Rui looked forward to it.</p>
<p>However, the moment Soft Mist was about to run into his trap, she stopped.</p>
<p>Switch positions!</p>
<p>“I’m here!” Ye Xiu shouted. The spear form of Lord Grim’s Myriad Manifestation Umbrella flew forward and followed after Soft Mist’s previous attack.</p>
<p>“What did you come here for?” Fang Rui fumed. It was as if a good scene was just about to unfold before him, but someone called out “cut”! Itt was too anticlimactic!</p>
<p>“I’m here to teach you how to play dirty!” Ye Xiu yelled. There weren’t many people who dared to say those words to the master.</p>
<p>“Fuck off!” Fang Rui yelled. When facing Ye Xiu, the majority of the pro players would lose their composure…</p>
<p>Chapter 1110: Forcing Demon Subduer</p>
<p>Fang Rui didn’t immediately contend with Ye Xiu. If Ye Xiu was over here, then what was happening on the other side? Fang Rui immediately turned his camera to look.</p>
<p>When he looked, Fang Rui almost cried.</p>
<p>Demon Subduer had always been the symbol of Wind Howl. But the number one Brawler in Glory was currently being ridden by another Brawler, who was using Tyrannical Chain Punch on him.</p>
<p>Fang Rui couldn’t help but turn his head to look at Tang Hao, who was sitting not far away from him.</p>
<p>It was evident that Tang Hao was furious. The veins on his forehead looked as if they would burst into antennas.</p>
<p>What are they doing!</p>
<p>Fang Rui found it hard to believe. Didn’t they all go over to assist him? Why was Tang Hao being bullied to such a state?</p>
<p>When he looked more carefully, he realized that Tang Hao wasn’t the only person who was in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>The three classes that went over to help were an Elementalist, a Knight, and a Cleric.</p>
<p>It was needless to talk about the Cleric. He was a strong shield, but not a strong attacker.</p>
<p>The Knight? Since he moved so slowly in that plate armor of his, he was currently being blown to bits by Su Mucheng’s Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>The Elementalist? It was unknown what had happened, but the Ninja from Happy was able to get close to him through a sneak attack, so Zhao Yuzhe was also in a thorny situation. However, the greater threat was still behind him. After Soft Mist had switched places with Lord Grim, she sprinted straight towards him.</p>
<p>What is happening?</p>
<p>Fang Rui found it unimaginable. He didn’t mean to be contemptuous towards Happy, but to be completely oppressed by Happy like this?</p>
<p>“Retreat retreat retreat!”</p>
<p>Regardless of this, Fang Rui was still a general who could take charge. Although he was shocked at their current state, he wasn’t panicked. It was still too early to determine whether this was a victory or a loss. Wind Howl just needed to reorganize themselves. After all, their team made it to the semifinals last season, so it would be illogical for them to be completely oppressed by a new team like Happy. There was only one explanation: their attacks were too careless. Without having a clear plan behind their attacks, it became very easy for Happy to catch their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Happy was able to catch this point and counterattacked. Every mix-up was aimed at their flaws, forcing them into a passive state, making it difficult for them to establish a steady tempo. Excellent Era was defeated in the same way in the Challenger League.</p>
<p>At least Excellent Era had the advantage in equipment at the time. They had made preparations as well unlike Wind Howl. As a result, it wasn’t surprising that Wind Howl was in an even more embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>In any case, they should fully break away from the fight in order to cut off Happy’s tempo. After that, they could start anew.</p>
<p>Fang Rui thought. Instead of challenging Ye Xiu by himself, he quickly turned away to provide cover for his teammates to retreat.</p>
<p>“In the end, it’s the experienced players who are harder to deal with!” When Ye Xiu saw Fang Rui’s decision, he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. However, he still continued to taunt: “Why are you running, you crude thief? Won’t you listen to my lecture?”</p>
<p>Fang Rui ignored him. He was regretful that the middle finger wasn’t an emoji, otherwise, he would definitely pointing it at Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Doubtful Demon continued to run. He continuously planted traps in order to shrink Happy’s maneuver space. Lord Grim pursued him, but how could Fang Rui give him another chance to close in again? He increased his speed to sprint all over the place.</p>
<p>Thieves weren’t able to directly break through places like certain ferocious classes, but by letting him lay out his pieces in formation, the limitations that he created would affect the battle as a whole. Ye Xiu knew about this, but Fang Rui wasn’t an opponent he could catch just by wanting to. The master of playing dirty wasn’t a joke.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu decided not to waste any more energy and switched targets.</p>
<p>Fuck, this guy wants to kill Tang Hao!</p>
<p>Fang Rui immediately perceived Ye Xiu’s intentions. As expected, it was unrealistic for him to divert Ye Xiu’s attention so easily</p>
<p>In the end, it’s the experienced players who are harder to deal with! Fang Rui came up with the same evaluation.</p>
<p>The oppressed Tang Hao was finally able to find an opportunity to break out. After all, Steamed Bun couldn’t oppress him forever</p>
<p>Uppercut, Knee Attack, Powerful Knee Strike!</p>
<p>Tang Hao delivered a wave of counterattacks after seizing the opportunity. He nailed Steamed Bun Invasion onto the wall in an instant.</p>
<p>He then spun his view around. In the end, he still remembered to take note of their situation first and saw Soft Mist charging forward in a threatening and aggressive manner. Tang Rou originally intended to fight Zhao Yuzhe’s Elementalist with Mo Fan, but when she saw Steamed Bun being knocked over by Tang Hao, she immediately assisted him first.</p>
<p>Tang Hao let out a cold ‘hmph’. He was incomparably confident in a direct confrontation.</p>
<p>Demon Subduer didn’t retreat and sprinted straight towards Soft Mist.</p>
<p>You’re fierce? I’ll be even fiercer!</p>
<p>Tang Hao liked this style.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid, so Tang Rou was even more fearless. When it seemed like the two characters were about to clash, Tang Hao took advantage of a Brawler’s mid-ranged attacks and launched the first attack. As his body flickered, he sneakily threw out a Poison Needle.</p>
<p>If you played a Brawler and couldn’t play dirty, then you couldn’t possibly be qualified to be called a Brawler. This class had many skills that were suited to trick people.</p>
<p>Tang Rou didn’t detect Demon Subduer’s hidden Poison Needle sneak attack, so she was hit by it. Tang Hao seized the opening and used a Powerful Knee Strike. Right when his flying figure was about to crash into Soft Mist, he heard his teammate warn him to watch out.</p>
<p>A sneak attack?</p>
<p>Tang Hao laughed coldly. He knew that Steamed Bun Invasion was currently behind him and that the fellow was very restless.</p>
<p>Tang Hao had been prepared. The Powerful Knee Strike was originally an attack that could fly out at high speed. If he slightly turned his body, how could a sneak attack hit him?</p>
<p>As he turned, Tang Hao shot a glance at Steamed Bun Invasion behind him. The glance showed contempt: Little guy, if you want to play with me, you’re still lacking!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a handful of sand immediately blinded Demon Subduer’s eyes.</p>
<p>Why would you use a Sand Toss when sneaking up on a person from behind??? Steamed Bun Invasion turned out to use it, so when Tang Hao turned his head to look, he happened to be hit by it.</p>
<p>His screen completely blacked out as if the power was cut. Tang Hao was about to go mad.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the opponent from closing up on him, he quickly used a chain of punches and kicks for the sake of self-defense. But then, a Satellite Beam dropped down from the sky and completely engulfed Demon Subduer.</p>
<p>Supporting any spot on the map was one of Su Mucheng’s strengths.</p>
<p>Screen Cannon?</p>
<p>This attack had an air of tactics to it. Fang Rui discovered that Happy’s tempo provided many tactical options. Just a slight change could produce a different tactic.</p>
<p>Tang Hao immediately fell back down after just gaining the upper hand.</p>
<p>His other teammates were finally able to search for ways to retreat under Fang Rui’s commands. The traps that the Doubtful Demon had buried started to reveal its might. The existence of traps was similar to the principle of a skill cooldown. As long as it was there and not set off, then it would be an excellent restriction and limitation. Fang Rui was able to see the awkwardness of Happy’s formation in regards to the traps: They didn’t bring their Cleric, so they definitely wouldn’t dare to use methods like clear them out forcibly with their characters.</p>
<p>Their tempo slowed down immediately, which met Fang Rui’s expectation. The players from Wind Howl slowly started to withdraw.</p>
<p>But their captain…</p>
<p>Demon Subduer was forcefully kept there.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was gloomy. Happy even used such a shameful method like abducting a hostage.</p>
<p>Should they return and launch a total fight with Happy with the help of traps?</p>
<p>It seemed that this was the only way!</p>
<p>The four made slight adjustments before advancing as a whole. This time, they kept a complete a formation.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A Spike Trap suddenly flipped up from the ground and clamped onto the Knight’s ankle. It locked his foot, so he wasn’t able to move.</p>
<p>The Knight’s player looked at Fang Rui with astonishment.</p>
<p>Fang Rui didn’t know whether he should cry or laugh: “Are you stupid, is it even possible for it to be my trap?”</p>
<p>Traps couldn’t be triggered by allies, so there was no doubt that it had been placed there by Happy. Fang Rui knew Lord Grim’s unspecialized possessed three traps. However, Fang Rui wasn’t aware in the least about when this guy secretly planted his own trap among his.</p>
<p>However, there were only three traps, so the threat wouldn’t be too great. But the Spike Trap’s effect in sealing one’s movement was rather worrisome because their offense instantly became strangled.</p>
<p>After that, Fang Rui realized that Ye Xiu did something even more shameful.</p>
<p>He summoned a Goblin……</p>
<p>That’s right, compared to clearing the traps on one’s own, there was one method that was even more grievous for fellow Thieves. That was to… summon creatures to clear out the traps.</p>
<p>Unspecialized characters were too shameless.</p>
<p>Fang Rui wept as he commanded everyone to destroy the goblin as soon as possible. However, under the command Ye Xiu’s control, the goblin was abnormally nimble. It managed to step into three mines before it died a heroic death.</p>
<p>He can remember the location of my traps better than me, Fang Rui thought with a tear-streaked face. If he had these methods earlier on, why did he only just use it? Fang Rui now understood, in fact, he understood too well. It was in order to get an opportunity to kill Demon Subduer.</p>
<p>Although Tang Hao was strong, he still feared being grouped on. People like Fang Rui wanted to rescue him, but they needed a systematic approach in their rescue. Unfortunately, Ye Xiu’s hidden trap was able to detonate Fang Rui’s traps, which immediately messed up their plans. They could definitely continue to charge ahead, but if they did so, what difference would it be from the unplanned attacks they had launched previously? It would probably be oppressed by Happy in two or three moves again.</p>
<p>Happy wasn’t a jack of all trades team that they could forcefully take down by merely relying on their skills. Happy was a pro team, so they had their own strength.</p>
<p>“Cut across to the right!” Fang Rui called. His traps on that side were in good condition and could still be used.</p>
<p>Wind Howl’s players finally came over and met up with Tang Hao. The battle started once more. However, Fang Rui’s original tactical plans were cut into bits and pieces earlier on.</p>
<p>Retreat after rescuing Tang Hao!</p>
<p>Fang Rui already made up his mind. He was resolute in not fighting with Happy and going at their pace.</p>
<p>They wanted to retreat, but Happy wouldn’t allow it. The power of focusing a single target was extremely prominent. They charged towards Demon Subduer, refusing to give up until he died.</p>
<p>When had Tang Hao ever been this type of target? Fury burned in his heart.</p>
<p>Fang Rui didn’t understand. If they attacked forcefully like this, they could indeed take out Demon Subduer, but without a Cleric, they would also take a lot of damage. Even if it was a 4v5, it was very possible for Wind Howl to wear them down to death!</p>
<p>But considering the dungeon’s contents, they would still have to face competition with the other teams. Without their ace player Tang Hao, they couldn’t bear this trade!</p>
<p>However, the current situation didn’t leave them with any choice because Happy was the side attacking.</p>
<p>Either the fish dies or the net splits… Fang Rui couldn’t come up with any ideas. Tang Hao also seemed to have understood the situation, and that it was very possible for his character to die the earliest. However, he could also strive for the team’s victory. Due to his professional attitude, he wasn’t discouraged. In fact, he fought even fiercer than before. If he could exchange the team’s victory by sacrificing himself, then he would have fulfilled his responsibilities as the ace.</p>
<p>Demon Subduer finally fell. As Fang Rui had predicted, Team Happy had paid a great price for this kill.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you’ll keep going! Fang Rui thought.</p>
<p>He then heard Ye Xiu cry out: “Fuck, the shard wasn’t on him? Retreat!”</p>
<p>Fuck, that was their aim? Fang Rui felt like fainting…</p>
<p>Chapter 1111: Wind Howl Internal Strife</p>
<p>Just like this, Tang Hao became the first member of Team Wind Howl to get eliminated, but at this moment, Fang Rui didn’t have time to pay attention to Tang Hao’s expression. After understanding Team Happy’s intentions, a feeling of dizziness washed over him, making him almost fail to hold onto his own mouse.</p>
<p>If this were the competitive stage, Wind Howl might be down a member, but they had the overall advantage right now. Happy had sacrificed a lot of health to take down Demon Subduer. Let alone having no healer, even if Happy did have a healer, in a situation where every team member was at low health, it was very possible for the healing speed to not be able to keep up, resulting in the team being killed off one by one.</p>
<p>But the problem was that this wasn’t on the competitive stage.</p>
<p>As a result, Happy had previously been fighting in disregard for everything else, but now they were running away as fast as possible.</p>
<p>“Where are you running!” Zhao Yuzhe roared. How could he put up with Happy running away? Elementalists had powerful attacks and strong AoE skills, the bane of Happy, whose members were on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Their captain’s sacrifice couldn’t be wasted!</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe was quite confident. His Elementalist charged forward like a Battle Mage.</p>
<p>“Careful!” Fang Rui immediately warned.</p>
<p>He hadn’t seen what exactly Happy had set up, but since their intentions were so obvious, how could Happy not have made any arrangements for their escape? Let Wind Howl chase and kill them? If that was the case, it was no different from seeking their own deaths.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s intention told him that Happy definitely had traps set up during their escape. Rashly chasing after them was dangerous.</p>
<p>But Zhao Yuzhe seemed to not be able to hear him. Even though Fang Rui was his senior in the team and had named a God for a long time, playing dirty was looked down upon by many. Zhao Yuzhe rather liked Tang Hao’s vigor with his “the junior succeeds the senior”. He didn’t admire Fang Rui’s dirty playing from the bottom of his heart. Although he didn’t dare disrespect his senior most of the time, his hot-bloodedness had consumed him. There were a bunch of nearly dead players in front of him, ripe for him to kill. It wasn’t hard to understand why he ignored Fang Rui’s warning.</p>
<p>Teleport!</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe was afraid of letting go of even a single player from Happy. He directly teleported into the enemy ranks in an attempt to kill all five of them at once. When he teleported, he had already activated Mobile Cast. His magic staff glowed with light, ready to release a spell.</p>
<p>Fang Rui saw Zhao Yuzhe’s audaciousness and was stupefied. The opponents were at low health, but they weren’t dead. For him to advance prematurely, did he really think these five were frightened dungeon monsters? Or did he think that his bold move would catch Happy off guard…</p>
<p>Okay, Fang Rui admitted. From a reverse psychology standpoint, such a stupid decision was truly surprising. He only hoped that everyone in Happy was too smart and think that it wasn’t possible for someone to be so stupid! Maybe because Zhao Yuzhe had done it so quickly, the other side wouldn’t be able to react in time?</p>
<p>He looked back. Beautiful Light 1 was already laying on the ground…</p>
<p>Fang Rui felt it was a pity that he couldn’t see the expressions on everyone in Happy. Were they surprised? Were they in admiration of Zhao Yuzhe’s boundless bravery? They didn’t seem to think twice though. After Beautiful Light was smacked to the ground, he was quickly smacked into the air. Then, Lord Grim and Soft Mist both used Falling Flower Palms, sending him back along with an artillery shell from Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>After all, no one in Happy had a lot of heath. They didn’t dare keep fighting. After sending away Beautiful Light, they borrowed his body as their first form of obstruction and then utilized long-ranged attacks to suppress them further. The team’s Knight wanted to rush forward and block the damage, but in the end, he was yelled at by Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you all attacking!!!” Zhao Yuzhe’s Beautiful Light climbed up from the ground after being sent back and shouted thunderously. In this instant, his dissatisfaction towards Fang Rui had reached its peak.</p>
<p>“The other side has made preparations beforehand. They’re just waiting for us to fall into their trap.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“How would you know if you don’t try!” Zhao Yuzhe yelled.</p>
<p>“Did you not just try?” Fang Rui asked back.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe was suddenly at a loss for words. He had tried, but he really wanted to say that Happy’s way of dealing with him didn’t seem to be the result of careful preparation. But why did it turn out the way it did? Because he had been an idiot! In a moment of hot-bloodedness and impulse, he had made a move thinking he was invincible. The other side didn’t need any careful set ups to deal with him. The openings that he showed were too big so much so that they instantly swatted him away. However, Zhao Yuzhe was unwilling to admit that he was stupid to Fang Rui. He felt like if he had just been a bit faster, the ones lying on the ground would Happy.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and chase!” Zhao Yuzhe didn’t reply to Fang Rui’s retort. He just called over the other two members to give chase.</p>
<p>Without captain Tang Hao, there was a clear disagreement to how Wind Howl should fight. The Knight and Cleric weren’t entirely focused on the game. They stole a glance at Fang Rui and Zhao Yuzhe outside of the game. In the end, they didn’t move. Zhao Yuzhe’s was an important part of Wind Howl’s future, but Fang Rui was their team’s most experienced senior. In addition to Fang Rui’s status as vice-captain, the two didn’t move, implying that they recognized Fang Rui’s authority.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe’s Beautiful Light rushed out, but discovered that the other two didn’t go with him. This time, he didn’t dare charge into Happy’s enemy ranks so simply. In the end, he could only have his Beautiful Light stop. Outside of the game, he glared fiercely at those two players. He didn’t dare be too brazen to Fang Rui, but he wasn’t scared of those two at all.</p>
<p>The entire practice room was deathly silent. There were only five players that could form a team to this Ghost Lair. The other five team members, who weren’t participating, hadn’t left. They also wanted to see what this Ghost Lair was all about. Instead, they got an internal conflict between their team’s players.</p>
<p>Most of the people there felt very uneasy, but a certain resolute person watched with interest at everything that was happening.</p>
<p>Liu Hao.</p>
<p>He gave up on Thunderclap and transferred to Wind Howl.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been long since he had joined the team. He didn’t impatiently jump into the team and instead carefully observed this new team. Because this time, he truly wanted a achieve something here unlike with Team Thunderclap. In his eyes, Thunderclap was nothing more than a stepping stone. That type of small team couldn’t contain this senior.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Liu Hao felt like his strength was enough to replace Team Samsara’s Jiang Botao. Unfortunately, Samsara was clearly very satisfied with the synergy between Jiang Botao and Zhou Zekai. They had invited Liu Hao’s former teammate, Sun Xiang and One Autumn Leaf, but they definitely had no intentions of dropping Jiang Botao. In the end, Liu Hao was brought into Team Wind Howl. This rising team had performed outstandingly last season. Liu Hao was very satisfied and decided that he would do well here.</p>
<p>However, in Team Wind Howl, Tang Hao was their core. Zhao Yuzhe was the Best Rookie. His talent and growth would put him as a star in the future. Fang Rui was an All Star and their team’s most experienced member. The team couldn’t lack any healers, so of the five positions, only one spot remained.</p>
<p>Was this spot for Liu Hao?</p>
<p>From what he saw, he didn’t think that Wind Howl valued him that much. They didn’t seem to have determined that Liu Hao was the missing jigsaw piece. They were still searching for the most suitable combination. As for Liu Hao, as someone skilled and someone who free transferred, their thoughts were that they might as well sign him and test him out.</p>
<p>This type of attitude meant that they weren’t particularly fervent about signing Liu Hao. In fact, there were many other teams that were sincerely interested in him such as Team Miracle.</p>
<p>This team had took in three Excellent Era players. They had contacted Liu Hao too and gave him sincere promises. Core, team captain. They had prepared a generous offer and clearly laid it out to Liu Hao, but he rejected it without much thought.</p>
<p>Miracle? In Liu Hao’s eyes, more like joke*. They were a team that had just gotten into the Alliance, and they wanted him to play for them? He might as well have just stayed on Thunderclap then! Core? Team captain? You think I care about being the core or team captain of a team like that?</p>
<p>Liu Hao ignored their sincere offer. When Team Wind Howl expressed their interest towards him, he immediately accepted. This type of powerhouse with hopes of winning the championships was where he hoped to be!</p>
<p>Liu Hao. At the moment, he was just one of Team Wind Howl’s choices. Rather than saying that their sincerity moved Liu Hao, it was more like Liu Hao’s eagerness moved them to just sign him along in the passing.</p>
<p>The team didn’t need to offer any signing bonuses to a free player. The only requirement was to provide a salary. To be champions, no team would find it difficult to try out a player like that. As a result, Team Wind Howl moved quickly and immediately took Liu Hao as soon as the transfer window opened.</p>
<p>Wind Howl hoped that Liu Hao would bring change to the team. However, they didn’t have any clear plans at the moment. They were still studying Liu Hao, so Liu Hao could feel that he didn’t have a stable position in the team right now. As a result, he was careful. As someone who had once been a part of a powerhouse, he obviously knew how to find opportunities in the team.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a conflict had erupted in Team Wind Howl. Liu Hao observed it with interest.</p>
<p>Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe.</p>
<p>It was a common conflict between a rookie and a senior. The rookie felt like the senior was blocking his path forward. The senior felt like the rookie was a threat to his position… This type of conflict didn’t appear only in pro teams. It happened all the time in all levels of society.</p>
<p>Right now, at Wind Howl, the conflict was fully out in the open. However, whether it was Fang Rui or Zhao Yuzhe, they weren’t the players with the most authority in the team! The direction that this conflict would move towards would depend on Team Wind Howl’s captain and core, Tang Hao.</p>
<p>Yes, Tang Hao. The Tang Hao who had become famous with his “junior succeeds the senior”. Liu Hao realized that the resolution to this conflict was very easy to predict.</p>
<p>Chapter 1112: Conflict Between Ideologies</p>
<p>Wind Howl’s captain Tang Hao expressed displeasure at the conflict between Fang Rui and Zhao Yuzhe. His eyes stopped at Fang Rui. It was plain as day who he favored.</p>
<p>No one uttered a word. Team Wind Howl seemed to only be just three people.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe continued to glare at Fang Rui with unwillingness. Tang Hao didn’t show any resentment towards Zhao Yuzhe, but he wasn’t looking at him in a good way either. As for Fang Rui? He was still playing the game.</p>
<p>His Doubtful Demon suddenly rushed out.</p>
<p>What? Is he regretting it now? Zhao Yuzhe, who was also in the game, noticed Doubtful Demon’s movements. He could see that he was chasing after Happy.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too late to start chasing?” Zhao Yuzhe was puzzled.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon suddenly stopped chasing. He just stood there, looking around for something.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe couldn’t bear it anymore. He had his Beautiful Light move over there as well. The other two players followed.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was looking at the passageway that Happy had left through. Zhao Yuzhe had solid fundamentals too. After all, he had accumulated quite a bit of tactical experience throughout his career of two years. When he looked at this passageway, he realized how the entrance could be utilized. At this instant, he noticed: Fang Rui was right.</p>
<p>Happy indeed had made preparations. It would be very easy for Happy to ambush them at this entrance.</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhao Yuzhe refused to admit his mistake, “With their health, so what if they ambush us?”</p>
<p>“In important playoff matches in season two, season four, season five, and season seven, several teams encountered situations like this and lost as a result.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“…” Zhao Yuzhe stared blankly. He didn’t know about these precedents. For a moment, he couldn’t think of which matches Fang Rui was talking about.</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re safe because the opponents don’t have much health left? Throw away such naive thoughts! Glory isn’t as sweet as you think it is.” Fang Rui said</p>
<p>“I…” Zhao Yuzhe was at a loss for words. Fang Rui didn’t say anything more to him. He glanced at captain Tang Hao, “We’ll continue.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Tang Hao nodded his head. He had heard the conversation between the two. Right now, it was very clear who had been in the right and who had been in the wrong.</p>
<p>The four players continued onwards. The other players in the team let out a sigh of relief. Only Liu Hao looked pensive.</p>
<p>The others only saw it as different answers for a question. But Liu Hao saw it as a conflict in ideologies between two players.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s style of playing dirty didn’t synergize well with Tang Hao’s and Zhao Yuzhe’s style of play. And those two were the pillars of Wind Howl’s new generation. After Demon Subduer switched hands from Lin Jingyan to Tang Hao, Fang Rui’s playstyle became more and more lost in this type of team. As Tang Hao’s playstyle matured and as their other main talent Zhao Yuzhe grew, Fang Rui’s playing environment became increasingly difficult. At the same time, his existence itself made Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Wind Howl’s style hadn’t changed completely enough! With Tang Hao as the core, the set of strategies employed during Lin Jingyan’s generation might no longer be suitable.</p>
<p>Wind Howl still had its struggles!</p>
<p>In the game, Happy’s five players quickly retreated. After confirming that there were no pursuers, they stopped to rest. They drank potions and ate food to recover their mana and health. After all, this was the game and not the competitive stage.</p>
<p>Though it wasn’t the competitive stage, the dangers hadn’t passed. When were there ever these sorts of large chaotic fights on the competitive stage?</p>
<p>Happy stopped at a place to recover. It wasn’t just a random place. Ye Xiu saw that it was a wide open space, where they couldn’t be ambushed. After starting to recover, he requested that no one use food that made a lot of noise so as not to let any sound leak.</p>
<p>The five characters sat together on the ground and recovered silently. The tense environment constructed by Ye Xiu made everyone turn and look at their surroundings from time to time.</p>
<p>Happy’s cautiousness wasn’t for naught. Amidst the silence, they could hear the sounds of footsteps coming from the passageway.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the direction Wind Howl would be coming from. Which team was this?</p>
<p>Tyranny and Happy had run in the opposite directions. It was too early to meet up. Thus, it should one of the other two guilds. Was it Royal Style or Misty Rain?</p>
<p>“Withdraw for now.” Ye Xiu typed in the chat.</p>
<p>The five characters stood up. To hide the sounds of their footsteps, they either crouched or rolled and quickly found a hiding spot. Ye Xiu had found these spots as soon as Happy had gotten here.</p>
<p>The footsteps grew closer and closer. Ye Xiu told the others to retreat back, while his Lord Grim was positioned slightly more forward.</p>
<p>The five characters finally revealed themselves.</p>
<p>It was Team Misty Rain!</p>
<p>Windy Rain, Something to Hide, Dark Forest, None Dare Attack, Lower Your Head.</p>
<p>Misty Rain’s character choices were as bold as Happy’s. They also didn’t bring a healer. What’s more, their team had three Sharpshooters. Along with Windy Rain, that made four long-ranged attackers with Dark Forest as a Ninja.</p>
<p>“Get ready to fight.” Ye Xiu called out to the other four.</p>
<p>Their positions were hidden. It wasn’t possible for Misty Rain to directly see them. What followed depended on what Team Misty Rain did. If they decided to investigate this side, Happy had to attack first to catch them off guard.</p>
<p>However, Misty Rain didn’t seem to have any intentions of searching this area. Their team quickly passed by this point and moved ahead.</p>
<p>Happy’s five players slowly went out of hiding.</p>
<p>“Follow them.” Ye Xiu said, “It’d be best if they clashed with Wind Howl.”</p>
<p>Just when Ye Xiu sadi this, sounds of gunfire could be heard ahead.</p>
<p>“How aggressive! They really are pro teams! They’ve already encountered each other!” Ye Xiu praised.</p>
<p>Team Wind Howl didn’t chase after Happy as soon as possible, but in the end, they still headed in this direction. After all, Happy was moving about in this direction. They hadn’t given up and obviously wanted to get all the shards too, but then they encountered Misty Rain.</p>
<p>Wind Howl knew that Happy was ahead, so they had advanced very cautiously. When they heard footsteps, Fang Rui thought that Happy had finished recovering and had come back to kill them. This situation was within his expectations. He quickly set up traps and arranged a formation.</p>
<p>When the first trap was triggered, a battle soon ensued. Fang Rui looked at the enemies and suddenly felt like crying.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t Happy, it was okay. But it just had to be Misty Rain. Misty Rain just had to have so many long-ranged characters too, reducing the threat of his traps. Long-ranged attackers didn’t need to stick close to them to attack. If they didn’t enter the trap zone, how could his traps be of any use?</p>
<p>Today’s been such an unlucky day!</p>
<p>Fang Rui was gloomy. Wind Howl had once again been thrown into disarray. This time, under his arrangements, Zhao Yuzhe felt like he could finally breathe.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu and her Windy Rain!</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe really wanted to fight her. He hoped that he could crush her to prove that he was the number one Elementalist. Even though it was just the game right now, these thoughts were deeply rooted in him. As soon as he saw Windy Rain, his emotions became fervent. He started to think about how he should contend with Windy Rain.</p>
<p>“Retreat!”</p>
<p>But then his spirits were once again dampened. Again by Fang Rui.</p>
<p>As soon as the situation looked slightly unfavorable, they would immediately retreat. If the enemy advances, we retreat. If the enemy retreats, we harass. These were the guidelines on how to play dirty. Fang Rui was commanding the team, so he naturally made decisions depending on his own habits.</p>
<p>But this made Fang Rui very very unhappy. Extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>“Retreat again? When are we going to fight? Didn’t we already set up traps?” Zhao Yuzhe shouted. Even though he could see that these traps would mostly fail because Misty Rain consisted of mostly long-ranged attackers, he had to say it to slap Fang Rui’s face.</p>
<p>“The traps are no good. Retreat for now.” Fang Rui’s style of playing dirty didn’t have the same sort of pride as Zhao Yuzhe’s playstyle. He simply admitted that his traps were ineffective.</p>
<p>Fuck, communicating with this type of person is impossible!</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe felt very bitter. The ideologies that the two sides had for Glory were completely different. But seeing how the other two team members had followed Fang Rui’s orders and started retreating, Zhao Yuzhe didn’t dare challenge Misty Rain alone. He could only retreat as well.</p>
<p>But Misty Rain refused to let them go. The three Sharpshooters shot at them as they chased closely behind.</p>
<p>The sounds of gunfire provided a good cover for Happy. They didn’t need to hide their footsteps to avoid the notice of the others, making their tailing very easy.</p>
<p>Soon, Wind Howl retreated back to where Happy had found the shard after killing the female ghost. When they saw the walls collapsed over there, they wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Another team was coming in this direction, Royal Style!</p>
<p>The poor Wind Howl was suddenly surrounded like a dumpling. No matter how crafty Fang Rui was, it would very difficult for the entire team to escape. Both escape routes were sealed!</p>
<p>Their only choice was to fight!</p>
<p>“You don’t fight when we should fight and fight when we shouldn’t fight!” Zhao Yuzhe shouted in discontent.</p>
<p>Indeed, compared to the previous five players from Misty Rain or the nearly dead Happy, their situation was even more disastrous right now.</p>
<p>However, fighting in an tricky situation was one of the strengths of someone who played dirty.</p>
<p>Team Royal Style was led by Tian Sen’s Exorcist, Peaceful Hermit. Starting last season, he had spent much effort in the game in an attempt to help Royal Style grow. Unfortunately, the effects weren’t good. Royal Style once again failed to enter the playoffs. As for he and his Peaceful Hermit, his ranking in All Stars dropped again to 21st place. If he dropped another three places, he wouldn’t make it into All Stars.</p>
<p>To get chosen into All Stars was an honor for many players and characters. However, Peaceful Hermit was a God-level character that had been equally as famous as One Autumn Leaf and Desert Dust back in the early days! And now, Peaceful Hermit was actually struggling to make it into All Stars? Tian Sen felt that they were incapable of making it into playoffs.</p>
<p>There has to be change!</p>
<p>Tian Sen muttered to himself again and again. This summer, this break, he threw himself into the game even more fervently.</p>
<p>Chapter 1113: Sending a Shard</p>
<p>Royal Style on the left. Misty Rain on the right. Wind Howl in the middle.</p>
<p>In this situation, no communication was necessary. Royal Style and Misty Rain were already thinking the same thing: eliminate Wind Howl first.</p>
<p>Tian Sen’s Peaceful Hermit grabbed with his left hand and pulled out a talisman, crackling with lightning, from the void. He swung his right hand and a scythe flew out along with that lightning talisman towards Wind Howl.</p>
<p>“Lightning Talisman! Dodge!”</p>
<p>Fang Rui shouted. Wind Howl’s four players quickly dispersed. The scythe landed at the center of their original location. The Lightning Talisman exploded and lightning spread from where the scythe had pierced into the ground.</p>
<p>Throwing the weapon was an Exorcist skill called “Spirit Guidance”. Many Exorcist skills could be utilized along with “Spirit Guidance”. A weapon thrown with “Spirit Guidance” wouldn’t be considered as dropping it. Others wouldn’t be able to pick it up. On the other hand, the Exorcist could grab the weapon back from afar. It could be considered as one way for an Exorcist to show off how cool he was.</p>
<p>But for experts, looking cool was secondary. These types of class-specific skills were skills that best displayed a class’s ability. All of these skills needed to be mastered.</p>
<p>As the number one Exorcist in Glory, Tian Sen’s mastery over this skill was needless to say. “Spirit Guidance” brought a Lightning Talisman with it, splitting up Wind Howl’s team.</p>
<p>Misty Rain coordinated very well with them. Chu Yunxiu complemented with a Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire, a Flame Storm, and a Thunder Apocalypse. Three AoE spells completely split apart Wind Howl’s four players.</p>
<p>Behind Winy Rain, Team Misty Rain’s three Sharpshooters focused Wind Howl’s Cleric. Bullets rained down wildly onto Wind Howl’s Cleric.</p>
<p>Tian Sen saw Misty Rain’s actions and directed his team to coordinate with them. Team Royal Style’s players belonged to the strength category. Xu Huiliu was a Striker player. His fame might not be comparable to Han Wenqing’s, but he definitely belonged to the upper ranks among Strikers. Shen Wanhe was a Spitfire. After Zhang Jiale retired, he was even a candidate for Dazzling Hundred Blossom’s successor. His skill wasn’t as high as a God’s though, and in the end, Team Hundred Blossoms chose their own team’s Zou Yuan. Then, there was He Weitang. He even had a slight connection with Zhao Yuzhe. The two had joined the pro scene the same year and were both contenders for Best Rookie that year. Even though Zhao Yuzhe was chosen to be Best Rookie, the lead had been very slight. He Weitang lost, but he was definitely a talented rookie worthy of being nurtured. He Weitang was a Summoner, which was a class that had always been missing among the All Stars cast. The last player was their Paladin, Ren Junchi. He wasn’t particularly outstanding among healers, but for him to be a starter on a pro team, he couldn’t be bad.</p>
<p>The current Team Royal Style was their starting five players. Tian Sen’s Peaceful Hermit initiated with a Lightning Talisman and then directed his team to coordinate with Team Misty Rain to target Wind Howl’s Cleric.</p>
<p>Wind Howl was still within Fang Rui’s trap zone. However, Royal Style had He Weitang, who quickly had his summons lead the way. Shen Wanhe’s Spitfire was also a long-ranged attacker and he quickly formed a crossfire with Misty Rain’s three Sharpshooters.</p>
<p>How could a Cleric defend against so many attacks? His allies had been separated from him by AoE attacks. When Xu Huiliu’s Striker reached him, Wind Howl’s Cleric could no longer persevere and was the first to fall.</p>
<p>Misty Rain only attacked from afar. They coordinated closely with Wind Howl, making sure to avoid any accidental injuries. But the instant Wind Howl’s Cleric fell, Misty Rain’s Liu Hua’s Ninja, Dark Forest, very precisely teleported to the fallen Cleric with a Shadow Clone Technique.</p>
<p>Royal Style was startled, but quickly realized Misty Rain’s intentions. Xu Huiliu’s Striker was just about to punch, when everyone saw that the Cleric hadn’t dropped anything when he died.</p>
<p>Xu Huiliu forcefully canceled his skill. The two sides typed haha and tacitly understood to focus on the next target.</p>
<p>Wind Howl’s Knight became the the next target of the two teams. But this time, Royal Style was prepared. He Weitang’s summons swarmed the Knight. If Li Hua’s Dark Forest tried to use Shadow Clone Technique again, he wouldn’t be able to squeeze in.</p>
<p>Misty Rain saw this and figured that all of their efforts would have been for nothing, so they immediately switched fire to Zhao Yuzhe’s Beautiful Light. They planned on testing their luck with Royal Style to see which player from Wind Howl would have the shard.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe was in a dire situation, but his fighting spirit didn’t dampen. Even though he felt like there was no possibility of him escaping, he still wanted to attack Windy Rain to prove his skill.</p>
<p>When the enemies stopped attacking him, Zhao Yuzhe was able to find an opportunity. He was just about to send a fierce wave of attacks at Windy Rain, when Team Misty Rain suddenly switched targets. Bang bang bang! The three Sharpshooters had shot three Thunder Snipes, striking the frail Elementalist and shattering not just his heart but his body into pieces.</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe, who had been planning on launching a fierce assault, didn’t even have a way out anymore. He could only brace himself for the attacks and continue charging ahead as if he were a Battle Mage.</p>
<p>But midway through, Li Hua’s Dark Forest intercepted him. Along with support fire from the rear, Beautiful Light wasn’t even able to touch Windy Rain’s clothing.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Zhao Yuzhe cursed fiercely. The instant he fell, he saw that their team’s Knight couldn’t hang on any longer either. But what about Fang Rui?</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe immediately checked and was dumbstruck. Their teammate Fang Rui found an opportunity when the other three players died to run away.</p>
<p>“You!” Zhao Yuzhe fumed. Sound could no longer be transmitted in the game. He could only turn his head and shout at Fang Rui outside the game. But Fang Rui was completely focused. His hands were dancing across the keyboard and mouse. He didn’t notice Zhao Yuzhe’s existence at all.</p>
<p>You think you can escape from this kind of encirclement?</p>
<p>Zhao Yuzhe was solely preoccupied with Fang Rui’s dirtiness, but ignored the outcome that resulted from it. Windy Rain and Royal Style, ten pro players, discovered that none of those three in Wind Howl had dropped the shard. At the same time, they also realized with a start: Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon had disappeared!</p>
<p>The Thief’s Stealth allowed the character to move while invisible. But even so, with the two pro teams attacking from two sides, slipping away without them noticing showed Fang Rui’s skill with it.</p>
<p>“Find him!!!” The two teams ordered.</p>
<p>The Stealth effect would be removed at the slightest touch and under Stealth, the character would move at 60% speed. Even if the skill was maxed, the movement speed could only reach at 85%. Any attack or any movement that used stamina would automatically cancel Stealth. The only exception was if the Thief had Trap Proficiency and placed down traps under Stealth.</p>
<p>Pro players obviously understood how the skill worked. They naturally knew how to get a Thief out of stealth, but despite their best efforts, they were unable to dig out Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon.</p>
<p>The two teams continued to do their best, but at the same time, they had gradually started to shift their intentions. Next up was time for the two teams to fight. The teams already understood how this dungeon worked. They knew that they needed to fight for these shards. Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon was gone, so now it was time for them to fight.</p>
<p>Spirit Guidance! Ice Talisman!</p>
<p>Tian Sen’s Peaceful Hermit moved first. He tossed his scythe, which landed on the ground along with an Ice Talisman. A ring of ice was just about to spread out, when a pillar of fire shot up from the same spot! Raging Flames! Team Misty Rain had been prepared. Chu Yunxiu’s Windy Rain had practically casted the spell at the same time.</p>
<p>Ice and fire crossed. The two elements restrained each other, neither attack greater than the other. Raging Flame’s fire pillar didn’t last for even a second before it disappeared. The Ice Talisman’s ice ring failed to spread outwards and disappeared along with the fire pillar.</p>
<p>Following afterwards, the two sides attacked each other fiercely. Team Misty Rain had no healer, so they couldn’t fight head to head with Royal Style. Their long-ranged attackers coordinated with one another, while Liu Hua’s Ninja weaved around. This type of playstyle was Team Misty Rain’s distinguishing style. Only this time, they had no healer and instead had a long-ranged attacker. Their offensive was more powerful, but they needed to be more careful in protecting themselves.</p>
<p>“So they’ve finally started fighting. Time to run!”</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon started moving. This was the brilliant spot he had chosen. He knew that the two pro teams would quickly realize that he had disappeared with Stealth. If he went to look for any hiding places, he would definitely be forced out by the enemies, so he simply stood there in place and gambled on it.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s gamble paid off. The two teams were searching around the exit and failed to find him. The two then started attacking each other. Fang Rui was carefully weaving past the fires of the battle. Even though Wind Howl only had one person remaining, Fang Rui felt like they hadn’t lost yet because the remaining teams would have to fight each other. After the teams killed one another, perhaps there might be an opportunity for him to finish it off?</p>
<p>Doubtful Demon slowly left the battle, but he wasn’t willing to go too far. He wanted to see what the outcome of the battle would be. Perhaps there was an opportunity there. He slowly retreated, looking for a safe place to peep at the battle. As he backed up, he discovered that he had backed up into a group of people.</p>
<p>Fuck!</p>
<p>Fang Rui suddenly fumed. He was just one person playing dirty, but Happy was going too far. All five of them were playing dirty. They were all shamelessly hiding in a corner, waiting to reap the benefiits.</p>
<p>Too shameless!</p>
<p>Fang Rui cursed inwardly, but he didn’t dare challenge Happy’s five players. He took advantage of the fact that Happy hadn’t discovered him yet and tried to leave.</p>
<p>Fang Rui had wanted to quietly move his Doubtful Demon away, when he suddenly heard a click from underneath his feet.</p>
<p>A trap had locked up his foot. Doubtful Demon’s stealth wore off.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Steamed Bun cried out in surprise, seeing a person suddenly appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“Shhh. He’s here to send us his shard.” Ye Xiu said calmly.</p>
<p>Chapter 1114: Dangerous Game</p>
<p>“Shameless!!” Fang Rui immediately shouted, after being caught in the trap.</p>
<p>Was he really angry enough to resort to such an outburst? Of course not. He already knew that there was absolutely no way for him to escape, but he refused to let Happy get away with this so easily. By yelling, he hoped that he could catch the attention of Misty Rain and Royal Style, drawing them over here to impede Happy’s progress.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, go ahead and shout all you want, you can shout until you go hoarse and no one will hear.” Ye Xiu said accompanied by a smirking emoji. Fang Rui turned his camera. It was true, there was no use! They were too far away, not to mention that they were fiercely fighting, with all sorts of sound effects from the skills they used. The sound of his voice had no way of carrying all the way over there.</p>
<p>“Kill him quickly!” Ye Xiu ordered, his Lord Grim acting first. A Back Throw pushed Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon into a dark corner, and the other four members of Happy weren’t as polite as they unleashed a barrage of attacks on him. Fang Rui noticed that these guys were avoiding loud and flashy skills, instead using silent and subtle ones – they intended to smother him here.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was upset, but what could he do? No matter his skill, no matter his status as the master of playing dirty, there was simply no way for him to escape from this corner after being surrounded by five pros.</p>
<p>Doubtful Demon fell. Now, Team Wind Howl was completely wiped out.</p>
<p>The shard that Wind Howl had obtained was held by Doubtful Demon, as expected. Fang Rui had gone through great struggles to protect this shard, using all of his shameless tactics to escape from tight spots, but in the end, Happy snatched it just like that.</p>
<p>Fang Rui shook his head and let out a sigh, then stood up and stretched his arms. He glanced around the room, and saw Zhao Yuzhe still shooting glares at him out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>Fang Rui could only smile bitterly. He was a veteran player, having played for many years now, and the problems that Liu Hao had noticed, he understood even more clearly.</p>
<p>After Tang Hao had joined Wind Howl, it seemed as though Wind Howl’s strength vastly increased, and they had even made it to the semifinals last season. However, Fang Rui’s capabilities in this team had been suppressed. His dirty playstyle was entirely opposed to Tang Hao’s playstyle, as well as that of the newcomer Zhao Yuzhe.</p>
<p>As time went on, he felt like more and more of a stranger to Wind Howl. They’d gotten through last season like this, but the problem was very apparent. Fang Rui felt it. Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe felt too. How could the club managers not have noticed either?</p>
<p>Fang Rui remembered how the club had acted when encouraging Lin Jingyan to retire last year, and he felt lost as to what his own future now looked like. Seeing the dissatisfaction that both Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe displayed toward him, Fang Rui felt that his footsteps toward the exit were only quickening. Tang Hao was the now core of Wind Howl. Zhao Yuzhe had a good future ahead of him and was being looked after heavily. Fang Rui had no chance of winning this battle. Should he just back off? Accept Wind Howl’s new style?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Fang Rui had been playing dirty for so many years. These skills and instincts had been thoroughly ingrained into him. To have him follow Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe, the fierce and direct playstyle of these youths, he simply couldn’t do it. His class wasn’t suited for it either.</p>
<p>It looked like his time was up…</p>
<p>In the training room, Tang Hao stood up, Zhao Yuzhe stood up, and the rest of the players followed, returning to their rooms to rest. Fang Rui tilted his neck back and stared at the ceiling. For these people who spent their lives in the game, this was the sky they saw the most often, the ceiling lights acting as their starlight. After so many years, he was used to this sight. But now, it looked like he would be saying goodbye to this piece of sky.</p>
<p>Let’s take things one step at a time!</p>
<p>Fang Rui shut off his computer. As the last one to leave the practice room, he didn’t forget to turn off all the lights and power.</p>
<p>Wind Howl withdrew from the event, but the battle in the Ghost Lair continued. Happy now had two shards, and they were in a good position as they watched the ongoing battle without either of the two sides knowing. Right now, the most important thing was patience, patience to wait until these two teams beat themselves bloody.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a competition where the goal was to kill the opponent. In this competition, there was only one goal: shards!</p>
<p>A shard could only be held by one character on the opposing team, so in this battle, the strategy of attacking everyone and defending everyone wasn’t used. Instead, both sides directed all of their attacks onto one target at a time. Kill one, see if they held a shard. If obtained, then retreat, if not, then repeat the process.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu hoped that both sides protected their shards well, that way more characters would be killed off one by one as each team tried to find the other’s. At the same time, he was also studying the battle closely, seeing if he could guess from their movements which characters held their respective teams’ shards.</p>
<p>“Did you find anything?” Su Mucheng asked, as she too watched the battle.</p>
<p>“Hm, there’s nothing stand-out about Royal Style. They’re protecting their healer, but that’s to be expected. The healer could have the shard, though, so protecting him would serve two purposes,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So Misty Rain is currently targeting Gentle Angel,” Su Mucheng said. Gentle Angel was the name of Royal Style’s Paladin. As a healer, this sort of sweet and pleasant name was relatively common. This character was also a female character, and its previous owner was female. But now, the owner had changed. Ren Junchi, a manly man, but with an account called Gentle Angel. Just looking at the conflict of these names, it was fairly clear what kind of person this player was.</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. It’s more difficult to judge Misty Rain’s side though. The four long-ranged attackers have the safety of distance, and Li Hua’s Ninja is nimble and evasive, the shard could easily be on any of them. Using what you know about Chu Yunxiu, who do you think she would have assigned the shard to?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Like you said, it could be anyone,” Su Mucheng said.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Ye Xiu was helpless. The current situation couldn’t be considered too good.</p>
<p>“Better pay attention closely. If Royal Style did give it to Gentle Angel, and he’s killed first by Misty Rain and drops it…” Ye Xiu trailed off. That would be the worst outcome for these lurkers. They were hoping for both sides to suffer heavy damage, so if only one person died before the battle finished, they wouldn’t be at as large of an advantage.</p>
<p>“Footsteps!” Tang Rou suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Huh? Where?” Ye Xiu immediately asked. After all, Tang Rou’s ears had been trained professionally and were sharper than those of anyone else here.</p>
<p>“From the way we came!” Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear anything?” Steamed Bun was still confused, controlling his Steamed Bun Invasion to crouch on the ground, turning this way and that as he pressed his ear to the ground.</p>
<p>This seemed to be the legendary “ear to the ground” listening method, Steamed Bun must have have learned it from somewhere. But would Glory have this sort of mechanism? Ye Xiu, the man titled the “Glory Textbook,” made a face at Steamed Bun’s idiocy.</p>
<p>“From the way we came.” Tang Rou confirmed.</p>
<p>“It’s Tyranny!” Ye Xiu said. It couldn’t be anyone else but Tyranny.</p>
<p>With this, Happy was stuck in the middle. On one side, there was the fierce battle between two teams, and on the other side there was the rapidly approaching Tyranny. Happy had no way out. Although their current position hid them from the two fighting teams, there was no way they could evade the notice of Tyranny unless they were completely oblivious or distracted.</p>
<p>“Prepare for battle…” Ye Xiu was helpless. For another team to come from behind, they really were unlucky here.</p>
<p>Right now, should they try to keep their battle with Tyranny separate from the ongoing one, or should they try to group all four teams together into a one big chaotic free-for-all? Ye Xiu thought rapidly, and eventually reached a decision. A huge four-way battle like that would be disadvantageous to the parties without healers, which included Happy. Plus, Happy had three rookies who lacked experience and judgment. In such a chaotic battle, they would certainly fare worse than the more experienced pros.</p>
<p>Better keep the two battles separate!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu led his team out of the corner to advance towards where Tyranny was approaching from, to further separate themselves from Misty Rain and Royal Style so that they wouldn’t discover their battle here.</p>
<p>The footsteps grew closer and closer, until finally, the silhouettes of Tyranny’s five finally appeared in their view.</p>
<p>“Don’t act rashly, follow my lead,” Ye Xiu said in the team channel.</p>
<p>It could be said that there were no secrets between the Ye Xiu and Tyranny’s old veterans. They understood each other extremely well, having fought for so many years, and it would be difficult for either side to surprise the other. With no surprises, then there was only direct confrontation left as an option. But Happy was much weaker than Tyranny. Ye Xiu would have to figure out some sort of tactic if they were to survive this.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s five, upon seeing Happy’s five, came to a stop. The two sides had already identified each other. Ye Xiu heard someone on Tyranny say, exasperated, “How come it’s you guys again?”</p>
<p>“The feeling is mutual,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Right after saying that, Ye Xiu heard the sound of an explosion from behind him.</p>
<p>He knew that there was a fierce battle ongoing back there, and he didn’t want Tyranny to find out, so he arranged their meeting a little farther away. They shouldn’t have been able to hear the battle from here, but that explosion… The battle over there, was it moving?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu heard the sound, so of course Tyranny heard as well.</p>
<p>“Flash Bullet? Who’s over there?” Zhang Jiale immediately recognized the sound effect of one of his Spitfire skills.</p>
<p>“Royal Style it seems.” Zhang Xinjie immediately made this judgment. Flash Bullet, a Spitfire skill. Among the 25 players who entered the Ghost Lair, there were only two Spitfires, Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms and Chen Wanhe’s Flash Save.</p>
<p>“Who are they fighting?” Zhang Jiale asked.</p>
<p>“Misty Rain?” The sound of numerous bullets gave them their answer. Only Misty Rain had brought three Sharpshooters.</p>
<p>How did the fight between those two teams move all the way over here? Ye Xiu was quickly thinking over this question – but in an instant, he understood.</p>
<p>It was Fang Rui!</p>
<p>That guy, harming others even without any benefit to himself! Before he died, he must have sent a message to those two teams telling them that Happy was over here waiting for an opportunity. Since everyone was using their professional accounts this time, they had each other added as friends and it was easy enough to send a message like this to them.</p>
<p>So these two teams pretended to fight, either trying to pull Happy into some kind of trap, or steadily approaching Happy until they could suddenly turn and attack them. In any case, they weren’t going to let Happy just wait for easy pickings.</p>
<p>As expected of the master of playing dirty, he had played a dangerous game that could have backfired.</p>
<p>Messages were very easy to send, but Happy had forgotten this point. Good thing that Tyranny had come and caused a change in plans, otherwise who knew what would have happened?</p>
<p>Chapter 1115: What Kind of Line-up Is This?</p>
<p>Misty Rain and Royal Style’s battle was approaching. It seemed like these two teams were preparing to fake their battle to paralyze Happy, then, once they were close enough, surround Happy and team up to attack them. But now that Ye Xiu saw their plan, the paralysis was broken. He obviously wasn’t just going to wait for them to come.</p>
<p>Except now, Happy was trapped in between three teams and was unable to do anything. If Ye Xiu were on Tyranny and saw Misty Rain and Royal Style’s intent, he wouldn’t hesitate to team up with them right here and ruthlessly destroy Happy in a 3v1 before anything else.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s mind worked rapidly. At the same time, he looked around to observe the situation, and suddenly realized that Tyranny, upon discovering a battle up ahead, looked like they were subtly trying to retreat.</p>
<p>Avoiding the battle first? Then coming back to pick off whoever was left?</p>
<p>That was too naive! They were already exposed to Happy, how could Happy let them peacefully stand to the side and watch? Trying to retreat now would only make them suffer what would have originally been Happy’s fate: being crushed by the other three teams.</p>
<p>Such a simple logic, how would Tyranny’s old foxes be unable to see it?</p>
<p>In that instant, one possibility flashed through Ye Xiu’s mind: had these guys still not discovered what the goal of the Ghost Lair dungeon was?</p>
<p>Because if that were the case, Tyranny still didn’t know what the teams were supposed to be doing in this dungeon. And so they acted the same as when they had first met up with Happy, preferring to be cautious and avoid conflict, because they still had no idea why they should be fighting.</p>
<p>To this, Ye Xiu could only feel regret, even if it was a regret layered with elation. Luck was really a fickle thing. After obtaining a shard, the situation in the Ghost Lair was obvious. Happy, Wind Howl, Royal Style, and Misty Rain were all fighting for their lives, which showed that they all understood the point of this dungeon, and that they had all managed to obtain a shard. But Tyranny… It seemed like they still hadn’t encountered a mini-boss and obtained a shard, so they still had no idea what was going on in this dungeon.</p>
<p>“Why are Misty Rain and Royal Style fighting?” Ye Xiu didn’t waste any time, acting dumb to gauge how much the Tyranny members actually knew. Of course, on their own side, Tang Rou, Steamed Bun, and Mo Fan didn’t have experience in this sort of tactical competition, so they would probably be confused. Ye Xiu immediately sent a reminder in the team channel, so that they wouldn’t expose his act.</p>
<p>“Unclear.” Tyranny’s Zhang Xinjie answered.</p>
<p>“There must be some special reason,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Obviously.” Zhang Jiale said.</p>
<p>“Let’s retreat first, move quickly,” Ye Xiu called.</p>
<p>Tyranny immediately retreated the way they came, which showed that this had been their intent all along. Ye Xiu let out a long breath. They were too lucky! Happy was now, like Tyranny, a team that didn’t know anything, and so together they could temporarily avoid conflict.</p>
<p>Two teams, ten people together they headed down the tunnel, putting some distance between them and the battle between Royal Style and Misty Rain.</p>
<p>“Let them fight first. And then we…” Ye Xiu sent a few laughing emojis.</p>
<p>“Shameless!” Zhang Jiale said.</p>
<p>“Dirty!” Lin Jingyan said.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>Tyranny fell silent, because there wasn’t a good answer to that question. How could they not go? Up until now, they still hadn’t figured out the goal of this dungeon, but Misty Rain and Royal Style’s fight should give them the answer. But if they revealed this now, there would probably be negative consequences for them, so the best plan was to wait for the other teams to destroy each other and then go in.</p>
<p>And so Tyranny avoided directly answering Ye Xiu’s question.</p>
<p>“How come they seem to be getting closer? How are these two teams fighting?” Lin Jingyan said, listening to the sounds of the battle.</p>
<p>“Did they discover us?” Ye Xiu pretended to be shocked.</p>
<p>In reality he was very clear, the situation was like this exactly because those two teams hadn’t discovered them here. Royal Style and Misty Rain received Fang Rui’s message and knew that Happy was waiting somewhere for an opportunity, so they pretended to fight fiercely as they moved in this direction to surprise and block off Happy. But the two teams still hadn’t found any sign of Happy.</p>
<p>Was Fang Rui lying?</p>
<p>Even though this guy liked to play dirty, there was no reason for him to lie to Misty Rain and Royal Style like this. So they were fairly certain that Fang Rui’s information was correct.</p>
<p>Then, there was only one explanation: Happy had figured out their intentions and were avoiding them.</p>
<p>This upset the two teams.</p>
<p>Happy avoided them, but would they stay away forever? Knowing that these two teams would fight sooner or later, would they just hang around to wait for their chance? The two teams couldn’t decide what to do, and there was no further instruction, so they could only continue their pretend fight. When they arrived at where Fang Rui had said Happy was hiding, the two teams saw that there was only one path Happy could have taken from there.</p>
<p>The two teams decided that, without knowing Happy’s whereabouts or status, they had no way of confidently fighting. But since the situation had already gotten to this point, there was no reason to continue the pretense, so the teams stopped their fighting, and began to charge down the path.</p>
<p>“Huh, they stopped?”</p>
<p>The sounds of battle suddenly stopped, coming as a surprise to Tyranny.</p>
<p>“They finished fighting? They shouldn’t have!” Zhang Jiale said. Just then, there had been the sounds of all sorts of skills being used, so clearly there were a good number of players still alive. Was there some giant fire that wiped out all of the characters on one side? That didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>“They must have discovered us and decided to give chase!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Who ran so slowly that they saw us?” Lin Jingyan said. Tyranny was still in the dark!</p>
<p>“Why are you still talking? What do we do? Continue to avoid them, or?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to fight sooner or later,” Tyranny’s Captain Han Wenqing said. They still didn’t know the reason for battle, but seeing how Misty Rain and Royal Style were fighting, it seemed like it was an inevitable outcome. So, if they were going to fight anyway, then retreating certainly wasn’t Tyranny’s style.</p>
<p>“Since it’s come to this, then we’ll go fight together, catch them while they’re disorganized!” Ye Xiu shouted.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the Tyranny members agreed. If they were going to fight, then take this chance and fight quickly!</p>
<p>So the ten characters turned around and began charging back the way they came. At this time, Royal Style and Misty Rain had chased them here, and the two sides met. Happy and Tyranny’s spirits were fierce and bright, but Royal Style and Misty Rain’s spirits were suddenly crushed.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It’s a trap!”</p>
<p>The two teams thought this simultaneously.</p>
<p>They had clearly been chasing only Happy here, where did Tyranny suddenly come from? It was originally supposed to be a 10v5, which the two teams felt would be an easy fight, but now it had unexpectedly become a 10v10. They had also spent quite some energy putting on that show of a battle… but even disregarding that, just look at the opposing side’s roster.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Han Wenqing, Lin Jingyan, Zhang Jiale, Zhang Xinjie…</p>
<p>What kind of line-up was this? It was enough to make anyone cry! Royal Style and Misty Rain’s line-ups weren’t weak among the professional teams, but in front of this intimidating list of names, they suddenly seemed pathetic.</p>
<p>Could they fight this battle?</p>
<p>The two teams were still in a shock because of this line-up, but Happy and Tyranny were already upon them, attacking without even a greeting. Su Mucheng’s Dancing Rain fired a Stinger into the air, which exploded apart and rained down upon the players. To the left, Tang Rou’s Soft Mist burst forward with a Dragon Breaks the Ranks. To the right, Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms covered a path with a display of light and shadows, into which Han Wenqing’s Desert Dust disappeared. When he emerged again, it was with a Ferocious Tiger Flurry sweeping right into the heart of the opponents’ ranks.</p>
<p>Happy and Tyranny’s allied assault was too ferocious, too relentless, too powerful. Royal Style and Misty Rain originally thought they had the initiative when giving chase, but now they couldn’t find their pace at all.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim had also charged into battle, but his eyes, instead of being fixed on his battle target, were continuously moving about, analyzing the field. Ye Xiu was confident that in this situation, where the opponents were on the defensive, it would be easier to see which characters held the shards. These players would be at the center of their teams’ adjustments.</p>
<p>Soon enough, Ye Xiu saw the clues.</p>
<p>Even though they had been caught by surprise, in the end these were professional teams, and there was order to their chaos. Misty Rain, for one, was trying to increase the distance between themselves and the others. The three Sharpshooters and Chu Yunxiu’s Windy Rain were continuously retreating, and the crossfire pattern made by the three Sharpshooters clearly served to protect one character in particular – Windy Rain. As for Royal Style, they didn’t have such a sharp change in their battle pattern, but they continued to focus on protecting their healer Gentle Angel.</p>
<p>The answer was right there. For Ye Xiu, these were crucial clues, but Tyranny… it was a shame that they still didn’t know about the shards. From their perspective, Royal Style’s protection of their healer was a perfectly normal action, and Misty Rain using their Sharpshooters to cover Windy Rain also wasn’t out of the ordinary. The Sharpshooters had much better mobility than an Elementalist, so this sort of retreat would of course involve the Sharpshooters helping out the Elementalist more.</p>
<p>After Ye Xiu determined who held the shards, he immediately informed his team through the team channel, but he didn’t make any adjustments to the battle strategy. They were currently teamed up with Tyranny, whose primary goal was to wipe out every opponent, so for now they could only pay closer attention to these two targets.</p>
<p>Misty Rain, who lacked a healer, was currently in a much worse situation than Royal Style was. Additionally, in a chaotic 20 person battle, their long-range attackers didn’t have enough space to maintain a safe distance and move around easily. Ye Xiu saw that they were trying to escape, and immediately ordered Happy to block their path of retreat, and at the same time loudly shouted at Tyranny, reminding them not to let the fish slip through the net.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Misty Rain and Royal Style became angry.</p>
<p>True, they weren’t in a good situation right now, but up until now none of their characters had fallen. The battle was in a stalemate right now, it was far from the point where victory or defeat was apparent.</p>
<p>Fish slipping through the net? What are you talking about? Who’s the net and who’s the fish?</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction caused by Ye Xiu’s words caused the fighting spirit of Misty Rain and Royal Style to suddenly spike. Multiple players suddenly started playing at a higher, fiercer level than before, suddenly stabilizing their positions.</p>
<p>“Can you shut up!” Seeing this, Tyranny seethed. This trash-talk, instead of crushing the opponents’ spirits, served the opposite purpose! Misty Rain and Royal Style, in a disadvantageous position, had been hesitant with their attacks, but now that Ye Xiu said this, they were like fish fighting to the death to break free of the net. Because these two teams knew that Wind Howl was done for, and all that was left were the four teams right here. Might as well use this one battle to decide a winner once and for all!</p>
<p>With this thought, the two teams began to counterattack, with each player experiencing a small surge in power. And, as the battle rhythm shifted, the protection of their important characters inadvertently slipped, just the tiniest bit.</p>
<p>Cloud Grasping Fist!</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Xiu sinisterly unleashed his ultimate move…</p>
<p>Chapter 1116: Duped</p>
<p>Cloud Grasping Fist!</p>
<p>Lord Grim’s actions were sneaky to the extreme. He had made his way to Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, borrowing the flashiness of his attacks as cover.</p>
<p>Just looking at Ye Xiu’s shameless sneakiness, Zhang Jiale was sorely tempted to toss a grenade to send this guy straight into the midst of Dazzling Hundred Blossom’s attacks. Just kill him and be done with it. But then he remembered that they were supposed to be working together, and so he resisted the temptation.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu notice Royal Style’s shift in tempo shifted and seized it, using the Hundred Blossom cover to launch a sneak attack. Royal Style was completely unprepared. As for Ye Xiu, it was actually quite tricky to accurately attack while under the cover of Hundred Blossom’s light and shadows. This was a detail easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Royal Style’s Ren Junchi understood that the victor of this dungeon could be determined with this one battle, and so he was supporting his teammates with all his strength, assisting their counterattack. But all of a sudden, his character was moving forward out of his control. Ren Junchi was confused, but he suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>“Oh shit!” Ren Junchi only had time to give a shout to warn his teammates, but everyone’s reactions were too slow. They could only watch, wide-eyed, as Ren Junchi’s Gentle Angel was suddenly dragged from their sides, into the midst of Dazzling Hundred Blossom’s attack range.</p>
<p>“Save him!” Tian Sen immediately shouted, already waving the scythe in his hand and sending several Lightning Talismans flying in the direction Gentle Angel had been grabbed. Before he reached the enemy ranks, first use some attacks to disrupt the enemy’s rhythm.</p>
<p>But Ye Xiu was prepared. He directly pulled Gentle Angel out of the Hundred Blossoms Style cover, and with a Fling, Lord Grim sent Gentle Angel farther away.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Zhang Jiale cursed.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu hadn’t even warned him that he was going to do this, after flinging Gentle Angel, Ye Xiu just patted his butt and left. Meanwhile, Royal Style was still furiously trying to rescue their healer, and Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was about to take the brunt of their fury.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you!” Zhang Jiale yelled.</p>
<p>“You can take care of this. I believe in you!” Ye Xiu replied as Lord Grim quickly made his escape.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale was helpless; he couldn’t just retreat. Once Royal Style saw that their healer had been sent somewhere else, he would probably have to stop them. And the other members of Tyranny, upon seeing that Ye Xiu had captured Royal Style’s healer, would of course have to cooperate to take out the healer.</p>
<p>On Happy’s side, Ye Xiu had already prepared for them to receive the healer even before he went to grab him. Once he threw the healer over there, a barrage of attacks fell upon the healer. Under this fierce assault, how long could a healer last? Royal Style’s rescue team couldn’t make it over in time and Misty Rain’s attack strategy relied on distance, so they didn’t have the power to charge in.</p>
<p>In the midst of chaotic battle, Gentle Angel fell. Tyranny’s members were pleased, but none of them noticed that in the crowd of Happy members around the fallen player, someone plucked an item from the ground beside Gentle Angel.</p>
<p>Tyranny was in the dark, but Royal Style was clear on the situation. Right now, they had neither healer nor shard, and they suddenly unleashed the ferocity of a team that had nothing to lose. But Tyranny’s experts were experienced with this sort of sudden shift in tempo, and this change didn’t throw them off. They were temporarily beaten back by Royal Style, but soon enough they stabilized and counterattacked, defeating another Royal Style player, Xu Huiliu’s Striker.</p>
<p>Royal Style was being thoroughly routed, and Misty Rain faltered as well, as the pressure of the attacks on them increased. Their long-ranged attacks simply had no way of countering the explosive power of Happy and Tyranny.</p>
<p>“It’s time, charge!” Ye Xiu ordered. This time, he wasn’t mounting a sneak attack, Lord Grim was playing a direct attacker. Together with Tang Rou’s Soft Mist, they launched an assault that would deal the death blow to Misty Rain.</p>
<p>With Tyranny’s attacks restricting their movements, Misty Rain no longer had enough room to maneuver. The long-range attackers couldn’t do anything as Ye Xiu and Tang Rou’s characters closed the distance. Their formation was instantly broken apart.</p>
<p>“Beautiful. Working with you guys is great! You haven’t let me down!” Ye Xiu praised loudly. When Happy attacked, Tyranny’s coordinated support had been the key to knocking down Misty Rain; without them, it still would have been possible for Misty Rain to defend.</p>
<p>“Shut up, will you!” Tyranny, of course, didn’t need any of Ye Xiu’s praise.</p>
<p>“Keep working hard!” Ye Xiu called. On Happy’s side, their attacks were clearly targeting one character, Chu Yunxiu’s Windy Rain. After they had blown apart Misty Rain’s formation, the other players were seemingly forgotten.</p>
<p>But Chu Yunxiu wouldn’t be going down that easily. With a Teleport, the Elementalist instantly escaped from Happy’s attacks, travelling to a place where it’d be the most difficult for Happy to readjust their formation and continue attacking.</p>
<p>But as soon as Windy Rain reappeared, a Satellite Beam fell from the sky. This was an attack made by correctly predicting the exact location at which Windy Rain would teleport to.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu immediately realized she had fallen for the trap. Happy had known that she would try to teleport to escape, and they had purposely left that opening for her to jump to. And the Launcher’s extremely long range allowed her to instantly cover any corner of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Caught by the Satellite Beam, Windy Rain couldn’t move, and two shadows suddenly appeared by her right and left.</p>
<p>Lord Grim and Deception, two Shadow Clones. Even though they couldn’t travel as far as a Teleport, it was an instant movement technique too, and there was no faster way to close the distance to an opponent.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Windy Rain was grabbed by Lord Grim, and with another Fling, was sent to where Happy wanted. Misty Rain’s three Sharpshooters pounced on them in an attempt to save their captain. Li Hua directly used a Shadow Dance with his Dark Forest, acting like a whole army of troops to try and disrupt Happy.</p>
<p>“Help please!” Ye Xiu shouted, of course not to Happy, but to Tyranny.</p>
<p>“You hold your position, throw Windy Rain over here!” Tyranny answered.</p>
<p>This sentence was really a lucky hit. Tyranny of course didn’t know about the shard held by Windy Rain, but in the current situation, sending Windy Rain over to their side was just one logical option. After all, even though the teams were allied, they could still take damage from each other, so executing a combined attack would require extremely careful coordination. For example, when Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim had stolen away Gentle Angel, he had to hide behind the Hundred Blossoms display, unlike the Tyranny members who could dive directly into the lights and shadows.</p>
<p>As soon as Tyranny proposed this plan, they prepared to receive the target, but when they looked over, they saw that Lord Grim and Steamed Bun invasion were still fiercely engaging in battle with Windy Rain! Besides these two characters, the others didn’t have Fling! It seemed that tossing a character over wasn’t very convenient for Happy.</p>
<p>There was no other option, Tyranny had to change their plans. It was just a small thing, not enough to pose any difficulty for them. To supplement Happy’s attacks without disrupting their rhythm – that was something they could do.</p>
<p>Under Happy and Tyranny’s partnership, the situation stabilized. Windy Rain was caught in between the two teams, and her health bar was plummeting. The three Sharpshooters and the Ninja persevered in their attacks, and Chu Yunxiu coordinated with them as she fought back, but in the end they still were unable to rescue her.</p>
<p>No solution!</p>
<p>After fighting to this extent, both Misty Rain and Royal Style wanted to retreat. If they continued fighting, they would all die here and that would be the end, but if they retreated now and preserved their health, there would still be a bit of hope left.</p>
<p>Both teams wanted to withdraw for now, but now Tyranny was making things difficult. They still didn’t know about the shards, so they just wanted to wipe out the two teams entirely. Although they were currently partnered with Happy to crush their opponents, they were still calculating their chances as they compared the states of their two teams. Tyranny had a healer, while Happy didn’t. Although Tyranny had supported Happy in their attacks, Zhang Xinjie hadn’t let a single heal fall upon any of Happy’s members, even though there was nothing in the system stopping him from doing so.</p>
<p>After fighting Misty Rain and Royal Style, Tyranny and Happy would inevitably turn on each other. But one side had a healer while the other didn’t, which alone was enough to tip the scales. After defeating those two teams, Tyranny was prepared to seize this opportunity to take care of Happy as well.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s ultimate goal was the total annihilation of all three other teams, a much more ambitious goal than the others. Royal Style and Misty Rain wanted to retreat now, but Tyranny wasn’t about to let that happen. They would bite down hard, and not let go.</p>
<p>So they caught Royal Style, but there was a hole in Happy’s trap for Misty Rain. Just as they killed Windy Rain, the other four members chose to retreat.</p>
<p>“Where are you running!” Ye Xiu yelled. “Give chase!” As he spoke, he led Happy to furiously pursue the retreating team.</p>
<p>“This guy did that on purpose, didn’the?” Seeing this, Tyranny’s players began to discuss among themselves.</p>
<p>“It’s clear, he’s defending against us…” Zhang Xinjie sighed. He hadn’t given Happy’s side a single heal. Looking back, that must have made their intent too obvious.</p>
<p>“That guy’s just too sneaky.” Zhang Jiale shook his head.</p>
<p>“I say… Happy’s already gotten away with all of the shards, why are you guys still being so kind to them?” Royal Style’s three players couldn’t last much longer. Once they saw that Misty Rain’s members had run, and Tyranny was still attacking them, they were helpless. Tian Sen had no idea that Tyranny still didn’t know about the shards; he thought that Tyranny was trying to shake a shard out of these three players. But the issue was, their team’s shard had already been dropped by Gentle Angel! Thinking about how Tyranny was wasting their time, but was in such a relaxed mood, Tian Sen couldn’t resist any longer and exposed the truth.</p>
<p>“Shards? What shards?” After Tyranny’s five heard this, they were startled.</p>
<p>“Fuck, no way?” Tian Sen was shocked. These Tyranny brothers still didn’t know what was going on?</p>
<p>Tian Sen quickly explained the situation in the dungeon. Once Tyranny heard this, of course they understood what had happened. They had been duped by Happy.</p>
<p>“Hurry and give chase!” Han Wenqing ordered, and Tyranny turned their fire.</p>
<p>Chapter 1117: Catching Dark Forest</p>
<p>“Hurry and give chase!” Han Wenqing ordered. Royal Style’s three players let out a breath for it seemed like they were saved. They could wait for Tyranny and Happy to fight it out, and maybe it’d be another devastating battle, providing them with an opportunity.</p>
<p>But soon enough, the three realized that they had misunderstood.</p>
<p>The “hurry” in Tyranny’s statement included killing them.</p>
<p>Then again, it made sense. Tian Sen admitted that their shard had already been stolen by Happy, but Tyranny had no way of verifying that this was the truth unless they killed all three of them to see if any of them were still holding a shard. They had already been fighting for so long that it wouldn’t take very long for them to kill three players.</p>
<p>Royal Style thought that they could relax, but ended up being the first victims of Tyranny’s rage at Happy.</p>
<p>Tian Sen was helpless, Chen Wanhe was helpless, He Weitang was helpless. The three players fell, and Royal Style was officially wiped out.</p>
<p>Tian Sen had been telling the truth when he said that they didn’t have a shard. Their shard was indeed on Gentle Angel, who had dropped it to Happy.</p>
<p>To this, Tyranny was somewhat regretful, but they weren’t annoyed. Royal Style had already been beaten down, but letting them go free would definitely have come back to bite them. Killing them now prevented that possibility from happening in the future.</p>
<p>Now, it was time to chase after Happy.</p>
<p>Happy had claimed they were going to kill Misty Rain, but Tyranny now knew that it was just as likely they had just used the opportunity to escape. Although they didn’t know who on Misty Rain held the shard, just from looking at Happy’s attack pattern, they were able to guess that Windy Rain had held it. Now that Happy had their shard as well, would they continue to cause trouble for Misty Rain?</p>
<p>Happy wouldn’t, but on the other hand, Misty Rain probably wouldn’t just let Happy go. Misty Rain couldn’t fight against the Tyranny-Happy alliance, but if it were just Happy, Misty Rain had a better chance. Just because they lost a player didn’t mean that they couldn’t fight. If that were true, then they might as well just withdraw from the game altogether.</p>
<p>Tyranny had been duped, but that was only because they lacked information. Once they understood how the event worked, the logic was as simple as one plus one. After taking care of Royal Style, they would chase in the direction that Happy and Misty Rain had fled. They would hope that these two would fight bitterly, leaving a chance for them to defeat them and take the shards.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s thought process was entirely logical.</p>
<p>Misty Rain ran, Happy pursued. After Misty Rain discovered that Happy was the only team chasing them, they suddenly changed their course of thought. Happy had taken quite a bit of damage when killing Gentle Angel and Windy Rain. It was the same situation as when they had killed Tang Hao’s Demon Subduer.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that Misty Rain didn’t have a healer, so it was very difficult to recover health during battle. Happy didn’t either, but they had Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim, who could serve as a healer in a pinch. It would be more disadvantageous for Misty Rain to drag this out longer.</p>
<p>So Misty Rain suddenly stopped running. They turned and began charging back the way they had come.</p>
<p>But this didn’t catch Happy by surprise. They entered battle mode smoothly.</p>
<p>“Attack Dark Forest.” Ye Xiu had already issued orders in the team channel, so Happy’s five members focused all of their attacks onto Dark Forest without holding back.</p>
<p>“They figured it out?” Seeing how he was clearly singled out as the target of attack, Li Hua’s heart beat faster.</p>
<p>Yes, Ye Xiu had figured it out. On Misty Rain’s side, Chu Yunxiu’s Windy Rain hadn’t been the only player with a shard. Li Hua’s Dark Forest held one as well. Misty Rain had already obtained two shards, which also explained why Tyranny had been unable to find one. There were only five shards, and they were all claimed by four teams. How could there be any left over for Tyranny?</p>
<p>Dark Forest had a shard? Ye Xiu couldn’t be a hundred percent certain, of course, but after careful evaluation of battle, he made this judgment, and now, it was time to test his theory.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!</p>
<p>Soft Mist was the fastest, separating from the others as she launched her attack. Li Hua frantically controlled Dark Forest to dodge, but unexpectedly, the target of Soft Mist’s attack wasn’t himself. She travelled right past him with her attack, landing in the midst of the three Sharpshooters. Happy was focusing their attacks on Dark Forest, but they couldn’t ignore the three Sharpshooters completely. They still had to give them the necessary attention to stop them.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun accompanied Soft Mist on her path of attack.</p>
<p>Although Tang Rou’s forcefulness and Steamed Bun’s strangeness weren’t enough to directly take down the three Sharpshooters, the chaos they caused was definitely too much for the Sharpshooters to quickly break free. While the two Happy players kept the Sharpshooters busy, Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, and Mo Fan surrounded and prepared to take down Dark Forest.</p>
<p>Ninjas specialized in assassinations and sneak attacks, so they were normally relatively difficult to catch. But it was a shame, for Happy also had a Ninja on their side.</p>
<p>Mo Fan’s technique might not be as polished as Li Hua’s, but his scrap-picking experience made him particularly skilled in several areas. For example, when tracking a target, not only was he incredibly patient, he was able to focus all of his attention, make good decisions, and maintain precise control of his actions.</p>
<p>Tracking someone while scrap-picking required picking them out from the midst of a chaotic crowd. Right now, however, it was just one opponent to track, and this was an incredibly simple task for Mo Fan.</p>
<p>Li Hua was the number one Ninja in Glory, so he quickly sensed Mo Fan’s skill, and didn’t underestimate him just because he was a rookie. And then there were the other two opponents, Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng, the most highly-skilled partners in Glory. Li Hua didn’t dare take them lightly; he wanted to withdraw.</p>
<p>This… was perhaps the greatest criticism the Glory world had toward Team Misty Rain: when facing difficult situations, they didn’t have the fierce spirit to keep pushing, they would always reveal a thread of weakness. This had become an iconic characteristic of their team.</p>
<p>Ninjas had many escape techniques, and as the number one Ninja, Li Hua’s skill in this area was unquestionable. Immediately, Dark Forest tossed a Smoke Bomb, releasing a thick cloud of purple smoke everywhere. Dark Forest vanished in its midst, but he wasn’t finished yet. The opponent could no longer direct catch him, but Li Hua didn’t rely on his own movements to change coordinates and escape. Instead, using the smoke cover, he simply used a Shadow Clone Technique, hiding his false body in the smoke, while his real body…</p>
<p>His real body was also in a cloud of purple smoke.</p>
<p>Li Hua wanted to cry. This cloud of purple smoke wasn’t his, this was the smoke from a Smoke Bomb dropped by Deception. Li Hua couldn’t tell where it was dropped, he only knew that he was swallowed within. Originally intended as a technique for escape, this time it was used as a technique to prevent the opponent’s escape. Right now, Li Hua had no idea what his surroundings were, and he didn’t dare to randomly move around. What if he took two steps out and fell right into Lord Grim’s arms?</p>
<p>However, this was also only temporary.</p>
<p>As the number one Ninja, after the Smoke Bomb finished exploding, Li Hua was able to judge from the smoke’s thickness where exactly the bomb had been placed. From that, he knew which direction would be the fastest way to travel out of the cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>But, this could all too easily be a trap. Taking the shortest path, Li Hua felt that he was bound to be caught by Happy.</p>
<p>Walk in the opposite direction, then? But what if it was reverse psychology?</p>
<p>Fine! There were more than two directions, so he would take neither the shortest nor the longest, but instead a direction chosen at random – Happy couldn’t predict randomness, could they?</p>
<p>Indeed, Happy had no way of predicting a randomly chosen path. After Deception tossed the Smoke Bomb, they surrounded the cloud entirely, the five characters forming a circle. No matter where Dark Forest exited, they could immediately attack him. Although it wouldn’t be enough firepower to directly kill him, it would at least prevent his escape.</p>
<p>So when Dark Forest finally emerged from the smoke, a sword was already flashing toward him.</p>
<p>Your defense isn’t enough!</p>
<p>This was Li Hua’s immediate judgment. If he was only being attacked from one angle, even if it were Ye Xiu, he believed that he could escape. Unfortunately, just as the sword was about to land, Li Hua heard an explosion above him. Lifting his head, he saw a Stinger explode in the air, sending countless bits of shrapnel raining down towards him.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng of course was not the only Launcher in the Alliance, but she was absolutely the best at executing this type of supportive attack. Her timing and control were outstanding, resulting in this surprise effect.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng was a true expert of restriction. She restricted not just the actions of one player in particular, but the entire battlefield. Her playstyle took full advantage of the Launcher’s excellent range.</p>
<p>If the player’s skill wasn’t up to par, then even if the playstyle were the same, the demonstrated power and efficacy would of course differ. Su Mucheng was the number one in Glory at this Screen Cannon style.</p>
<p>Excellent Era had been relegated this year, and the Pro Alliance had almost forgotten the power of this Screen Cannon. In fact, shortly after Ye Xiu retired, it seemed as though Su Mucheng had weakened greatly. Those who didn’t understand thought that Ye Xiu’s retirement had affected Su Mucheng’s state of mind, but those who understood knew that this restriction style, meant as a coordination with one’s teammates, also in turn required the teammates to coordinate with the restriction, seizing the opportunity to kill.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng could coordinate with her teammates, but the return coordination she received was lacking. Because of this, it naturally seemed as though her power was lacking.</p>
<p>This sort of perfect partnership and coordination, how long had it been since they’d seen this? Li Hua didn’t have time to consider this question, because he was about to be played to death by this partnership.</p>
<p>The partnership between one close and one far successfully immobilized him, and a second later, Mo Fan’s Deception arrived as well. In a 1v3 situation, Li Hua couldn’t find an escape route, and it wasn’t Misty Rain’s habit to explode with power in the face of struggle. The three Sharpshooters tried to help, but Happy already had Li Hua firmly under their control, and didn’t mind suffering some damage.</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>At this moment, Tang Rou and Steamed Bun both turned their attacks on Dark Forest as well. Misty Rain lacked a healer, and Ninjas weren’t a durable class, and there was no escape route, and there was no way to pull off a sudden explosive turnaround. At last, Dark Forest fell, and, as Ye Xiu predicted, he dropped a shard.</p>
<p>“Retreat!”</p>
<p>Happy had obtained all five shards, so they had no reason to continue fighting with Misty Rain’s three remaining Sharpshooters. Ye Xiu immediately directed his team to withdraw.</p>
<p>Chapter 1118: Split Up</p>
<p>Happy wanted to run. That was their current goal, but Misty Rain still had three players left and they weren’t easy to escape from. Fortunately, there was a bit of internal conflict going on outside the game between the three remaining Misty Rain players.</p>
<p>Lu Yining had been crowned season eight’s Best Sixth Player. He was a very dependable player, but right now, his position in Misty Rain was somewhat awkward. He was likely to leave this summer. And the ones to push him into this situation were Shu Keyi and Shu Kexin, the two sisters.</p>
<p>It wasn’t possible for Lu Yinning to not have any opinions about this matter. Not only were Shu Keyi and She Kexin new rookies, they were also quite arrogant. It could be said that Lu Yining didn’t have any good feelings towards them.</p>
<p>At the moment, Misty Rain was fighting to improve their team’s hardware. Lu Yining was about to leave. His participation in this event had been forced to begin with. He just didn’t want his emotions to ruin his reputation. Misty Rain was in a difficult situation right now, but hoping for Lu Yining to cooperate with Shu Keyi and Shu Kexin to turn this situation around was quite optimistic.</p>
<p>When Happy retreated, Shu Keyi and Shu Kexin tried their best, shooting at them as they chased. For these sisters, a defeat in this dungeon and to Happy at that felt like deja vu. In last year’s Christmas event, the two sisters had planned on using the leaderboards to make a name for themselves. Unfortunately, they were defeated by Ye Xiu multiple times in succession. In the end, even though they had been noticed by the pro scene, the results didn’t meet their expectations.</p>
<p>This time, they had come out to strengthen their team. Misty Rain’s luck was quite good. They encountered two minibosses and obtained two shards, making them the team in the lead. However, they were once again thwarted by Happy.</p>
<p>They only had three players right now. Besides Happy, there was also a powerful opponent like Tyranny glaring at them like a tiger watching its prey. The two sisters had been a part of pro scene for half a year now. They knew how powerful the pro teams were and no longer had the naive confidence in thinking that they could challenge Tyranny by themselves. They didn’t have any confidence in challenging Happy either, but they couldn’t swallow their anger. They had to at least try.</p>
<p>Bullets flew.</p>
<p>The two Sharpshooters fired their guns as they chased after Happy. Lu Yining was in no mood to fight, but he had to at least show a bit of effort. As a result, he also shot at Happy as he ran, but he clearly wasn’t being very diligent about it.</p>
<p>The two sisters quickly noticed his listless attacks.</p>
<p>“Can’t you try harder!” Shu Keyi expressed her dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“Hmph.” Lu Yining replied with his nose. Sure enough, he tried harder. He tried even harder to sandbag.</p>
<p>The two sisters saw this. He was deliberately opposing them! There was nothing they could do though. They had heard the rumors going around in their club and knew Lu Yining definitely didn’t have any favorable opinions towards them. The two were helpless. They hadn’t specifically joined Misty Rain to kick Lu Yining from his position. Everyone played the same class, so it would be hard to avoid competition between them. Someone’s spot had to be taken, so someone would naturally have to leave. The two sisters felt like Lu Yining’s dislike for them was unprofessional.</p>
<p>The two obviously weren’t going to compromise. With their personalities, it would only serve to make them work even harder to let the team know that they had made the correct decision. Shu Keyi complained to Lu Yining, but all it did was make that guy respond even more negatively, so she stopped talking.</p>
<p>Ignore him! We’ll do it ourselves!</p>
<p>The two sisters abandoned Lu Yining and attacked Happy even more fiercely. As for Happy, under Ye Xiu’s lead, they continued to run while constantly harassing Misty Rain’s players.</p>
<p>For them, Misty Rain was no longer a threat. Their only threat was the biggest threat in this dungeon, Team Tyranny, who were probably going after them right now.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s misfortune had been Happy’s fortune. Because of their good luck, they were able to avoid fighting their biggest threat. Their luck was gone now though. Tyranny must have figured it out by now. Even if they didn’t, after beating Royal Style, Tyranny would still chase after them.</p>
<p>So they couldn’t stop. They had to keep running!</p>
<p>As for Misty Rain at the rear, Ye Xiu didn’t care about them at all because they weren’t running from Misty Rain in the first place. Misty Rain just had to have three Sharpshooters though. It was very annoying. The sounds of their gunfire echoed in this underground cavern. If Tyranny wanted to chase after them, they could do so just by following the sound of gunfire.</p>
<p>In the end, Happy had to guard against Tyranny, only Tyranny.</p>
<p>Thus, as Happy ran, Ye Xiu took any opportunities that came up to counterattack. If these three tails could be removed, then it’d be best to remove them.</p>
<p>However, the Shu sisters weren’t stupid. They realized the crux of the issue. The two had a much clearer understanding of their skill now. Trying to steal the shards with just the two of them would be like trying to steal the sky. In this situation, they needed to rely on Tyranny’s help and fish in troubled waters. Happy was running away as fast as possible not because of their fear for the two sisters and that cheerleader, but because of their fear for Tyranny.</p>
<p>The more scared their opponent was of something, the more they needed to help that something. The sisters immediately adjusted their plans. They stopped chasing Happy as closely as before and started being more on the defensive. However, they weren’t going to let Happy escape from them either.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu immediately saw through this change. As a result, he promptly made a decision: “Steamed Bun and I will stay. You three go find the Ghost King. Hurry!”</p>
<p>Team Happy split up.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng led Tang Rou and Mo Fan along with the five shards to figure out how to find the Ghost King. Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun stayed behind to block off the passage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the underground passage was narrow, which made sealing it off that much easier. Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun took the initiative to attack the two sisters.</p>
<p>The two sisters were surprised. They clearly hadn’t expected Happy to split up. Even though their side had three players, this underground passage was narrow, making it very difficult for anyone to circle around them. What’s more, Lu Yininig was still being very uncooperative with them. The two sisters had almost forgotten that their side had three people.</p>
<p>“Steamed Bun, you take the left. I’ll take the right.” Ye Xiu instructed. With his sinister eyes, he had noticed that Lu Yining was intentionally sandbagging. Even if Team Misty Rain frequently dropped the ball in tense situations, it wouldn’t so bad that anyone would sandbag. Ye Xiu thought about it and guessed that it was probably unrelated to in-game matters and rather some sort of conflict in the team. As a result, Ye Xiu didn’t pay much attention to Lu Yining. Their priorities should be the two sisters. The synergy between those two sisters was quite impressive. There were even people in the scene that predicted these two sisters to be Glory’s future Best Partners. Truthfully speaking, Ye Xiu agreed with this view too.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun followed orders. He immediately charged out, while also chatting with Ye Xiu: “Their names seem very familiar.”</p>
<p>“They should feel familiar to you.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Really? Bro, have we met before?” Steamed Bun asked excitedly as he charged towards his opponent — Shu Kexin’s None Dare Attack.</p>
<p>Lower Your Head and None Dare Attack were two male characters. The two sisters had never attempted to hide their genders. Who would have thought that Steamed Bun would forget about them so cleanly. His impression of the two of them were practically zero.</p>
<p>Shu Kexin completely ignored Steamed Bun and attacked him fiercely.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun might be talking, but his playing wasn’t weak. Steamed Bun Invasion twisted and turned. He dodged two shots and suddenly attacked with a Powerful Knee Strike, striking at None Dare Attack.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu wasn’t slow either. Lord Grim had started attacking from afar using his umbrella’s Gun Form. Mid-range and close-range skills poured out endlessly. Shu Keyi’s situation was clearly more difficult than Shu Kexin’s.</p>
<p>In these consecutive intense battles without any healers, potions were Misty Rain’s only way to heal. But better potions had longer cooldowns. In a pro-level confrontation, relying on potions wasn’t reliable. Misty Rain’s three players didn’t have much health left. And Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun were no longer escaping and instead attacking them proactively. Happy had a cheerleader healer Lord Grim, so their situation was slightly better. In this battle, Happy had the advantage. Lu Yining had to face an opponent now and he responded relatively seriously. It was just that their situation wasn’t good. He wasn’t able to turn the situation around. As he fought and fought, he concluded that it was impossible to win, so he turned around and ran. However, he still gave out a warning and shouted “I’m retreating.”</p>
<p>This was clearly a formality. He wasn’t being targeted, so if he wanted to retreat, he could just retreat. But those two sisters had their throats gripped by Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun and were being beaten up! Lu Yining quickly retreated, not even attempting to help protect his teammates.</p>
<p>The two sisters nearly died from anger, but they weren’t the types to blame the gods and accuse others. The two tried hard, struggling to break free from their opponent’s attacks.</p>
<p>In the end, Steamed Bun wasn’t always the most reliable. He messed up and Shu Kexin’s none Dare Attack escaped. But unfortunately for Shu Keyi, trying to escape from Ye Xiu and trying to escape from Steamed Bun were two entirely different matters. Shu Kexin obviously wasn’t Lu Yining, who ran away on his own. After escaping from Steamed Bun’s clutches, she tried to save her sister. But Shu Keyi, who was fighting Lord Grim, knew better how difficult it would be and decisively rejected it: “Forget about me! Run away first and look for an opportunity later!”</p>
<p>Even though the two were sisters, they neatly broke away. There was none of that cheesy drama like “If you’re going to die, I’ll die with you.” After hearing her sister’s opinion, she didn’t hesitate to turn and run. Ye Xiu obviously wasn’t going to let Lower Your Head go and killed her.</p>
<p>“Ya ya ya ya!!” Steamed Bun let None Dare Attack go accidentally. He felt very ashamed and wanted to redeem himself.</p>
<p>“Recover first.” Ye Xiu yelled for him to stop.</p>
<p>Lu Yining escaped. Shu Kexin escaped. But she didn’t go find Lu Yining. She wasn’t placing any hopes on this guy no matter what.</p>
<p>The two characters ran one behind the other. They kept on running around randomly. They turned around and saw that Lord Grim and Steamed Bun Invasion wasn’t chasing after them, but there were people ahead of them. Tyranny’s five had finally arrived. Lu Yining was running at the front. Before he could greet them, he heard someone from Tyranny say with a voice filled with gratitude: “Over here!”</p>
<p>And then he was killed.</p>
<p>Tyranny was a very decisive team!</p>
<p>Chapter 1119: Catch Up</p>
<p>Misty Rain’s two might have ran, but they had been counting on coming back when Tyranny and Happy erupted in conflict so that they could mop up the remains. Unfortunately, they had met Tyranny head on as they turned. There hadn’t even been a greeting before Lu Yining’s Something To Hide was wiped out.</p>
<p>Shu Kexing’s None Dare Attack had been slower, allowing her to live for marginally longer. Seeing the five from Tyranny lunge predatorily, Shu Kexing felt that being over there with Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun was probably better.</p>
<p>“Neither of them have any.” Tyranny lamented. They had killed another two, but the ground was still clear of items. They had already asked Royal Style about how this dungeon worked.</p>
<p>Even though Royal Style had been wiped out by Tyranny, everyone was a pro player. If they couldn’t accept one loss, then everyone in the Alliance would be sworn enemies with each other. Pro players were able to distinguish between on field and off field situations. Thus, after Tyranny wiped out Royal Style and turned to ask them about Ghost Lair’s situation, Royal Style didn’t hide anything and told them all they knew.</p>
<p>The list of online characters made things even clearer. Wind Howl and Royal Style had all been kicked from the competition and had left the dungeon. Misty Rain’s members were still alive, but could they still succeed in this dungeon?</p>
<p>Tyranny had swiftly ran in the direction that Misty Rain and Happy had gone, soon hearing the sounds of gunshots and following them. That was when they saw Something To Hide and None Dare Attack running towards them. Tyranny didn’t show many mercy, crushing them at once. If they let them live, it would just come back to bite them. Tyranny wouldn’t back down at all even if it was Happy in front of them.</p>
<p>Having dealt with the two, Tyranny continued to advance. They hadn’t gone far before they saw Lord Grim and Steamed Bun Invasion sitting in the tunnel ahead eating bread and drinking juice!</p>
<p>“Someone’s here!” Seeing Tyranny, Steamed Bun immediately jumped up off the ground.</p>
<p>“Stay calm, we can recover a little more health and mana!” Ye Xiu was much more nonchalant, allowing Lord Grim to continue eating, his health and mana continuing to rise.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun had always listened to his boss and hastily had Steamed Bun Invasion take out food to continue eating. Seeing the two like this, Tyranny slowed their steps. There was a fork in the road further ahead. Were the other three members of Happy waiting there in ambush?</p>
<p>Tyranny had gone through battle after battle, hurrying over in pursuit after defeating Royal Style. They hadn’t the time to sit down and use food to recover their health and mana like Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun, so they weren’t in an optimal state. Seeing that Happy seemed to be plotting something, they might not be scared, but they kept their guards up as they began to move themselves into more tactical positions.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was a ranged fighter. Seeing how Ye Xiu noticed but ignored their approach, continuing to recover health and mana, he couldn’t let this go on and shot at them.</p>
<p>Lord Grim immediately got up and dodged, and his recovery process was interrupted. Zhang Jiale’s skills continued to fly over, using his Hundred Blossom’s style to pave a way for Tyranny’s charge. Ye Xiu didn’t dawdle either, getting Steamed Bun to follow him as he turned and ran.</p>
<p>Tyranny couldn’t afford to be slow. Regardless of the possibility of an ambush, they had to press forward. But that was when they saw Lord Grim and Steamed Bun Invasion suddenly split up at the fork in the road, one swerving left, the other swerving right.</p>
<p>“This…” Tyranny’s players weren’t sure how to react. They hastily led their characters to the fork in the road and took a look. There was a left path and a right path with one figure running down each. As for the other three members of Happy? Who knows where they were…</p>
<p>Tyranny had already gained an idea of what Happy was planning. They had split up, Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun blocking Misty Rain’s way and getting the other three to go ahead. So, something as important as the shards would definitely be with the other three. However, Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun had split up as well. Left or right, which would lead them to the other three?</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Ye Xiu was the core of their team, so Steamed Bun was more likely to be bait. However, on the other hand, Ye Xiu might have made himself bait because he was the core of the team. But then, thinking from another direction…</p>
<p>Stop. This sort of reverse thinking would never end. With Ye Xiu’s schemes, it could be either. Thus, there was no way to solve this problem with logic. They just had to chance it, it was a fifty percent chance.</p>
<p>“Let’s pursue Ye Xiu!” Zhang Jiale suggested. He had voiced what everyone had been thinking. In that moment, their thoughts had converged.</p>
<p>“Wait…” Zhang Xinjie suddenly spoke up. “If this is what we’re thinking, then Ye Xiu might be using this to lure us away.”</p>
<p>“So we chase Steamed Bun Invasion?” Lin Jingyan asked.</p>
<p>“So we’re going to start guessing how far he’s planned ahead again?” Zhang Jiale said.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinjie paused… True, hadn’t they just decided to not try and guess Ye Xiu’s line of thought? But how come they felt like their thought process would be used upon coming to a decision?</p>
<p>“Let’s go after Ye Xiu.” In this crucial moment, it was Captain Han Wenqing who stepped forth.</p>
<p>“What if we’re wrong?” Lin Jingyan asked.</p>
<p>“Then at least we can vent by beating him up.” Han Wenqing replied.</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone perked up. This reason was a great boost to their morale. Han Wenqing was a truly talented captain, able to boost everyone’s morale with just a single sentence!</p>
<p>The five immediately swerved left in pursuit. Their hesitation had cost them, but it was a good thing that Han Wenqing was able to settle things quickly. The five of them could, at least, still see Lord Grim’s figure. This guy occasionally turned to use Aerial Fire to propel himself backwards as he ran, clearly keeping an eye on what was behind him.</p>
<p>Since Tyranny wanted to catch him, they wouldn’t just race him. They were pro players. If they relied solely on their movement speed to catch someone, then that was just competing with their equipment. A pro level pursuit would involve skills as well, either to increase their movement speed or to use attacks to hinder their target.</p>
<p>In Tyranny’s formation, there were two ranged attackers. Zhang Jiale’s Spirfire and Qin Muyun’s Sharpshooter naturally carried the task of hindering Lord Grim’s movement. The two raised their guns and shot, different skills speeding forth. Lord Grim was forced to continuously dodge as he ran and this naturally impacted his movement speed. After all, he wasn’t faced with normal players anymore, but pro players, including an experienced God like Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>As Zhang Jiale and Qin Muyun’s Gunners shot and ran, Han Wenqing and Lin Jingyan’s two Fighters raised their speed and charged. Lin Jingyan could play dirty, but when it was required and when it was time to go all out, he wouldn’t hesitate either. Brawler Dark Thunder directly activated a Powerful Knee Strike, flying forwards. Skills that involved lunging or jumping forth like this moved much faster than normal sprinting. Han Wenqing’s Desert Dust had also activated Cloud Body, his character bounding forwards rapidly with buffed speed.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu might be a God, but his current opponents weren’t normal players. It didn’t take long for Han Wenqing and Lin Jingyan to catch up under Zhang Jiale and Qin Muyun’s control.</p>
<p>Against this old opponent, Han Wenqing was merciless. He didn’t wait for his character to completely catch up before activating a high-level skill. With a Soaring Tiger, Desert Dust lunged at Lord Grim feet first.</p>
<p>High-level skills like this that came out of the blue were easy to dodge for pro players, but Ye Xiu knew that under Han Wenqing’s control, Soaring Tiger was a move that could vary in many ways. He would have to be extremely careful when dodging. However, there was also Lin Jingyan to consider, and the combination of the two could end up trapping Lord Grim completely with one strike. Thus, against this high-level skill, Ye Xiu didn’t bother dodging.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The sounds of their clash rang out.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu might not have dodged, but he wouldn’t just take the skill head on. Lord Grim brought up a sword horizontally as he was about to be struck, blocking the blow with a Blade Master’s Guard.</p>
<p>The damage had been greatly reduced and Soaring Tiger’s knock-down effect was neutralized. However, Lord Grim was still kicked back. Ye Xiu used this momentum to go into a roll. Meanwhile, Desert Dust had been thrown up even higher by this kick and came crashing back down at Lord Grim with a Thousand Ton Drop.</p>
<p>Thousand Ton Drop was a skill with Super Armor. Even a powerful skill like Dragon Breaks the Ranks wouldn’t be able to knock this attack away. At most, the two sides would neutralize each other and both would take damage. In addition, normal Super Armor was able to neutralize most attack effects, but had a weakness to grabs. Grabs could break Super Armor. However, Thousand Ton Drop was an exception. The Super Armor given by this skill couldn’t even be broken by a grab and grabs would be neutralized. The only kind of skill that could be used to break the Super Armor from this skill were skills that specialized in breaking Super Armor. For example, the Brawler’s Inject Poison.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Lord Grim didn’t know any of these kinds of skills. Even though he had access to all the low level skills of all the classes, low level skills were for beginners that allowed players to experience the style of the class, but they wouldn’t go too deep into things. Most of the contents of that class would be accessible after classing. Thus, Lord Grim had never learned any skills geared towards breaking Super Armor. Faced with Thousand Ton Drop, he didn’t have any way to counter it, so he could only avoid it.</p>
<p>Thus, Lord Grim used Charge!</p>
<p>He dodged and took the initiative to attack at the same time, faced with Tyranny’s entire team while alone, no less.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s choice of action was completely unexpected for all five members of Tyranny. Lin Jingyan wasn’t prepared at all and the Charge had been directed at him, throwing him out at once. However, Lin Jingyan was no punching bag. As he was knocked away, he also used Sand Toss.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu hastily turned his view. Lord Grim’s head turned and dodged the blinding effect of the Sand Toss. However, a Grenade from Dazzling Hundred Blossoms then arrived in front of him. It was quite a ways away, having completely missed. But Ye Xiu knew that this Grenade wasn’t used to deal damage, it was a bloody Flash Bomb that inflicted Blind.</p>
<p>“Have you all no shame?” The Flash Bomb went off under Ye Xiu’s accusing yell. Although being on a team meant that you wouldn’t be inflicted with effects like this, the moment the Flash Bomb went off, the flash filled their screens with white light and they could barely see. But, when their vision returned, they were met with the sight of Lord Grim holding the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella open and blocking his own view with it. Sand Toss from behind and Flash Bomb in front, but he hadn’t been blinded at all.</p>
<p>“Have you no shame!!” Zhang Jiale bellowed in anger.</p>
<p>Chapter 1120: Switching Accounts</p>
<p>Using the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, Ye Xiu dodged this seemingly unbreakable blind, but he was still surrounded. Although Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder had been sent flying by Lord Grim’s Heroic Charge, Han Wenqing’s Desert Dust had already landed heavily on the ground, directly charging toward him with a Ferocious Tiger Flurry.</p>
<p>Another direct powerful attack.</p>
<p>A 1v1 would be a rough battle, but Han Wenqing wasn’t fighting by himself right now. Although he himself hadn’t done any set-up for this powerful attack, he had his teammates. Lin Jingyan and Zhang Jiale’s blinding partnership hadn’t succeeded, but when he used the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella to block the flash, he also blocked his own line of sight. By the time he could close the umbrella again, Desert Dust’s fists were already waving before him.</p>
<p>Ferocious Tiger Flurry, a Level 70 attack, it was a skill that could be controlled after activation. Users of different skill levels could affect the power of this attack. Han Wenqing’s skill as a Striker didn’t need to be mentioned, and the Ferocious Tiger Flurry was exactly the kind of powerful attack he preferred with his playstyle.</p>
<p>Ordinary controls had no way of keeping up with the rapid flurry of punches and kicks from this skill; it was impossible to continuously dodge all of them. The only possibility was to escape out of the attack range, but this was also difficult, because Ferocious Tiger Flurry was simply too fast. Lord Grim closed his umbrella, the fist was in front of him, it seemed that Ye Xiu had no way of countering, Lord Grim was hit!</p>
<p>Lord Grim was instantly sent flying backwards, but Han Wenqing immediately knew that something was wrong. Ferocious Tiger Flurry was a series of attacks in succession; what was the point if the opponent was sent flying after the first punch? Lord Grim was sent so far backwards partly because of Ye Xiu’s own controls – he borrowed the power of this punch to put some distance between himself and his opponents.</p>
<p>It was too naive to think that Ye Xiu had no way of reacting to this attack!</p>
<p>But it was also too naive to think that he could completely dodge Ferocious Tiger Flurry with that!</p>
<p>Desert Dust leapt forward and instantly closed the gap between himself and Lord Grim. The punches and kicks still flew toward his body, ready to kill.</p>
<p>Hit!</p>
<p>In one punch, Lord Grim was blasted to pieces. But was Lord Grim that fragile? Of course not, it was Shadow Clone Technique! In that split second during which he pulled away, Ye Xiu sped through the motions and completed the skill. The false body was left behind, while Lord Grim’s real body flashed away.</p>
<p>Fighting against the entirety of Tyranny by himself? Ye Xiu wasn’t that silly. No matter what, his goal was to run, and he was trying every method he could. He had no chance of winning, not unless the power went out at Tyranny and everyone went offline at once…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, running away wouldn’t be easy. Space was limited in this underground dungeon, unlike the open air spaces where he could run and hide in any direction. Right now, there was rock surrounding him, as though trapping the fleeing Ye Xiu in a cage. It wasn’t long before Tyranny caught up to him again with their long-range coordinated attacking strategy.</p>
<p>“You don’t drop your equipment in this dungeon, right?” Ye Xiu was already thinking about what would come next. Judging from previous battles, aside from shards, players didn’t drop anything else. Given the drop rates in the Heavenly Domain, this outcome was very improbable unless it were true that no items could be dropped in this dungeon.</p>
<p>“You’ll know once you die!” Tyranny wouldn’t be merciful to Ye Xiu just because of this worthy. This time, their encirclement was more complete than before. Even the Cleric Immovable Rock, who didn’t have much battle power, was a blocking presence that limited the paths available to Ye Xiu. Tyranny accounted for all possible locations that Ye Xiu could teleport to with his Shadow Clone Technique.</p>
<p>“Okay okay, I surrender,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“So what?” Zhang Jiale, not pausing in his attacks. This scum had to be dead before they could relax. If they just stopped their attacks when he announced surrender, he would certainly take advantage of that opening.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s old generals were unfazed by Ye Xiu’s trashtalk. “Go die!” As Zhang Jiale shouted, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was just about toss a grenade at Ye Xiu’s feet to deal the final blow, but suddenly, the screen flashed – a QQ chat window popped up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It said: Lord Grim has poked you.</p>
<p>“Shameless!!” Zhang Jiale almost spat out blood. By the time he switched back to the game, Lord Grim was already gone. This poke wasn’t any sort of game-changer, it just interrupted Zhang Jiale’s final attack, but Lord Grim was still taken out by Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Killing Ye Xiu should have been an exciting thing, but Tyranny’s members found that Zhang Jiale was currently wearing a murderous expression. They all turned to ask what happened, only to find that Zhang Jiale had opened QQ chat on his computer and was furiously banging out paragraphs denouncing Ye Xiu’s use of out-of-game interference tactics.</p>
<p>“You didn’t mute?” Tyranny’s members sighed, and at the same time were quietly relieved that they had all muted QQ.</p>
<p>When Lord Grim died, he didn’t drop anything, showing that he really hadn’t been carrying the shards. Tyranny didn’t have time to stand around here and chat. They still had to find the other four members of Happy, and it was possible that they already used the shards to do something.</p>
<p>“Let’s split up and search!” Zhang Xinjie suggested. After killing Ye Xiu, everyone felt a sense of relief. Before, they were wary of splitting up lest they fall into some kind of trap, but they now felt a little braver.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s split up!”</p>
<p>Tyranny divided their members into two groups, each taking one path. One path continued along their current route, while the other turned back to take the path along which Steamed Bun had escaped.</p>
<p>However, Ghost Lair’s tunnels weren’t so simple. After splitting in two, they ran into more forks in the road, and Tyranny still didn’t have a single clue that would lead them to Happy. They could only continue splitting up, until all five were acting alone, increasing the number of paths they were checking at once.</p>
<p>“Found them! They’ve already started killing the Ghost King, hurry and come!” At last, Lin Jingyan was the first to find Happy’s four players, and they were currently engaged in fierce battle with the Ghost King. Once the Ghost King was killed, then everything was over. But Lin Jingyan was alone, he didn’t dare go up alone to attack. He could only sit and anxiously wait for his teammates.</p>
<p>“I’m close by, almost there!” Zhang Jiale answered. After wandering for so long, everyone had gained a sense of the layout of the dungeon, and Zhang Jiale anticipated that he could arrive quickly. Indeed, after less than two minutes, Zhang Jiale could hear the sounds of the boss battle.</p>
<p>“Where are you?” Zhang Jiale sent a message to Lin Jingyan.</p>
<p>“You’ve arrived?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Us two will go first!” Lin Jingyan said.</p>
<p>“You stick to Su Mucheng, I’ll harass the other three.” Zhang Jiale laid out the plan.</p>
<p>“Okay,” agreed Lin Jingyan.</p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>The two characters charged forward, and following the play, Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder headed toward Dancing Rain, while Zhang Jiale took advantage of his attack range and began to harass the other three.</p>
<p>Facing against three rookies, Zhang Jiale was confident in his abilities. Dazzling Hundred Blossoms closed the distance, and his Hundred Blossoms cover enveloped the three at once. This was a high-level playstyle only found at the professional level, and Zhang Jiale knew that these rookies, lacking experience, would have their heads spinning under this interference.</p>
<p>“You came pretty quickly, huh?”</p>
<p>But at this moment, Zhang Jiale suddenly heard someone speak from the lights and shadows.</p>
<p>This voice, it was Ye Xiu, but how was he here? Zhang Jiale was frozen, as though struck by a grenade, but in the next second, he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>How could he not?</p>
<p>After all, this wasn’t an official match, just an in-game event. Lord Grim died, so Ye Xiu calmly switched to another account and continued playing. It was as simple as one plus one.</p>
<p>But such a simple idea had been overlooked by Tyranny. Even the detail-oriented Zhang Xinjie had forgotten this possibility, after growing accustomed to his professional background. For these pro players, the possibility of such a tactic didn’t even exist in their minds.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was still here. Suddenly, the plan of having just the two of them run interference seemed a lot less feasible!</p>
<p>This is bad!</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale was so bold and reckless only because he was confident that the rookies couldn’t handle his Hundred Blossoms style, but now… there was a Ye Xiu!</p>
<p>As soon as he realized something was wrong, a silhouette appeared out of the light and shadow. The rookies were disoriented, but Ye Xiu accurately determined Dazzling Hundred Blossoms’ position from the pattern of attack and instantly attacked in his direction. And Dazzling Hundred Blossoms had indeed been standing a little too close. By the time Zhang Jiale wanted to dodge, Soft Mist was already in front of him.</p>
<p>Of course it’s a Battle Mage…</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale had no tears left, no path of retreat. He was sent flying by Soft Mist’s Dragon Breaks the Ranks, slamming into the wall, and was then battered by several Chasers. And then, that Ghost King sent an attack at Soft Mist. Soft Mist twisted and dodged, and the attack sent by the boss wasn’t some direction-changing Chaser. It landed upon Hundred Blossoms’ body.</p>
<p>Once Lin Jingyan knew Ye Xiu was here, he also knew they were in trouble. The two of them had only dared to attack by themselves because they knew that aside from Su Mucheng, everyone here was a rookie. Although they wouldn’t be able to take them in a fight, they could still cause some chaos without too much difficulty. But Ye Xiu had switched accounts and run over here. Trying to interfere with him would be like kicking a steel board.</p>
<p>I have to run!</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan immediately made this judgment. He detached from Su Mucheng’s side and began to run. Su Mucheng counterattacked instantly, and the powerful blasts landing upon Dark Thunder’s backside truly made him pathetically embarrassed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after Zhang Jiale was slammed into the wall, he didn’t dare land directly. Ye Xiu was still there, eyeing him! This guy, not only could he use his own attacks, he could use his aggro to lure the Ghost King over here. The intelligence of an NPC was incomparable to that of a god. It should have been on Zhang Jiale and Lin Jingyan’s side, three against Happy’s four. But now, under this direction, it was like a summoned monster at Ye Xiu’s command, launching the fiercest attacks at Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>“Can’t hold, retreat for now!” Lin Jingyan shouted.</p>
<p>“What do you think I’m trying to do?” Zhang Jiale was depressed. Of course he wanted to run, but now he was stuck at the corner of a wall, surrounded by enemies.</p>
<p>“How much health is left?” Ye Xiu asked him.</p>
<p>Chapter 1121: The Troubled Lin Jingyan</p>
<p>To save or not to save, that was the question!</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan was uncertain what to do in such a situation.</p>
<p>Currently, Dark Thunder could easily run away, but Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms had been trapped in a corner and was doomed. However, was he alone enough to save Dazzling Hundred Blossoms from the four members of Happy who had Ye Xiu in command? Lin Jingyan doubted it.</p>
<p>“Forget about me! You run first!” In this crucial moment, it was Zhang Jiale who made the decision for him.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Steamed Bun was confused. “How come he’s like Misty Rain’s little girls?”</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale was enraged. How dare they mock his heroic and sacrificial act!</p>
<p>“He really is like them,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Die!” Zhang Jiale didn’t know that some of what he had just said really had been a repeat of what Misty Rain’s sisters had said, taking it as mockery from Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun, and wanted to risk it all in one final wave of attacks. But the four, in addition to the attacks directed over from the Ghost King, instantly suppressed him.</p>
<p>“Rest in peace!” Ye Xiu said as Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was finally defeated.</p>
<p>On the other side, Lin Jingyan had already ran for it with Zhang Jiale’s heroic decision. If they were both wiped up just now, Han Wenqing and the other two probably wouldn’t have an easy time fighting once they came over. Yet now, he had managed to escape and could take this chance to recover a little, By the time the other three arrived, they would be fighting four on four and had a good chance of winning. The current Happy really didn’t have a healer anymore, not even a cheerleader healer.</p>
<p>Dark Thunder hurriedly ran for it, settling down to one side to eat and drink to recover while keeping an eye on the situation.</p>
<p>After killing Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, Happy didn’t seem to have the intention to pursue him, turning back to the Ghost King.</p>
<p>This Ghost King was immense in size, with curled horns protruding from its head and red eyes. It dealt physical damage with a rock-shattering swing of its claws, and magic damage with swift blasts of energy from its mouth. It was clearly a powerful foe. However, Happy clearly wasn’t unfamiliar with this Ghost King anymore. They had figured out the Ghost King’s strategy, to the point where Ye Xiu could use it as a summons.</p>
<p>All the different monsters that the system controlled were nothing to pro players. After all, the online game was immensely popular amongst the general populace and tailored to normal players. No matter how hard it would get, it would be easy to adapt to for pros.</p>
<p>“Will they make it in time?” Lin Jingyan’s original worries returned. This wasn’t a problem of if they could win or not, but if Tyranny’s other players could arrive in time. Han Wenqing and the other three had gone in a completely opposing direction from Zhang Jiale and Lin Jingyan in the very beginning. Then, the three had split up even further as they searched, so they were currently very far from one another.</p>
<p>Looking at the Ghost King’s health and then asking after the other three’s positions, Lin Jingyan found that they really might not make it in time.</p>
<p>He had to do something.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder crept out again. If he faced them head on, then he would lose for sure. However, if he stayed idle, that wouldn’t be good either. He could only cautiously circle over. He had to find a way to do some damage, even if it meant directing a few attacks to himself, that would still help to lower their DPS.</p>
<p>Dark Thunder came closer, and Happy’s four ignored him.</p>
<p>Currently, he was definitely within Dancing Rain’s attack range, at least, but Dancing Rain didn’t even send a single missile towards him. Happy’s four focused on attacking the Ghost King.</p>
<p>Closer, even closer…</p>
<p>He continued to creep closer until, finally, some of his skills were in range.</p>
<p>Happy’s four continued to ignore him.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan didn’t have the time to spare for further consideration. He was already here, so he should at least try.</p>
<p>Thus, Dark Thunder raised his hand and threw a Brick, aiming at the back of Soft Mist’s head.</p>
<p>Soft Mist dodged to the side and the Brick flew past. Lin Jingyan was about to follow up with a second attack to completely mess up Ye Xiu’s rhythm, but then he saw his Brick smash into the Ghost King.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan coughed blood.</p>
<p>Bricks weren’t the strongest skill, but this strike enlightened him to Ye Xiu’s possible intentions.</p>
<p>This guy… First he lured the Ghost King’s attacks and dodged, resulting in the Ghost King’s attacks hitting Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms. Now he was baiting Lin Jingyan’s attacks and then dodging, letting the attacks hit the Ghost King.</p>
<p>Damn you! You think I’m your summon!?</p>
<p>After Lin Jingyan finished coughing blood, he still had to figure something out.</p>
<p>Dark Thunder began to reposition himself as Lin Jingyan tried to find a position where Soft Mist wasn’t directly between him and the Ghost King. Otherwise, if his attacks missed, they’d hit the Ghost King.</p>
<p>However, Ye Xiu didn’t give up either. Soft Mist followed Dark Thunder’s movements, keeping him behind her.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan wanted to cry. He was circling around from some distance away. The radius of his circular path was so long while Soft Mist’s was so short. He had to take several steps, but the other only needed one. He still hadn’t managed to throw the other off after so long.</p>
<p>Of course, Soft Mist wasn’t Lin Jingyan’s only possible target. Happy had four. No matter who he attacked, it would be enough to cause chaos and pull down their DPS. However, the problem was that the only target Dark Thunder could reach right now was Soft Mist.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain didn’t need to close in to attack and stayed far away, sending missile after missile over. If Dark Thunder wanted to attack her, he would have a to walk quite a bit to get there.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun and Deception were currently behind the Ghost King. That meant that those two, the Ghost King, and Soft Mist stood in a straight line. Then, when Ye Xiu repositioned himself, the two would cooperate. With that, they were constantly hidden behind the Ghost King. With Dark Thunder circling around, he didn’t have an angle to attack. Even if he did, a Brawler didn’t have such a long attack range.</p>
<p>“What accurate calculations!” Lin Jingyan felt pretty helpless and could only say something to try and distract them. Then, Dark Thunder came closer. He couldn’t not come closer. At this distance, he was being completely suppressed.</p>
<p>After getting closer, the radius of his path was much smaller. Lin Jingyan didn’t believe that he couldn’t succeed here.</p>
<p>Turn, move!</p>
<p>Dark Thunder’s figure swerved, beginning to move around again. As expected, Soft Mist followed his rhythm, turning.</p>
<p>No matter what, Soft Mist’s circular path had a smaller radius than his, so keeping up was easy. However, could you be certain that this continuous circling wouldn’t impact your DPS?</p>
<p>This was the first problem Lin Jingyan threw at Happy. Logically speaking, at a pro level, maintaining DPS while moving about wasn’t a problem. It wasn’t hard to keep up.</p>
<p>However, there was a second problem.</p>
<p>This time, Dark Thunder didn’t keep a set rhythm to his circling. Sometimes he’d go left, sometimes right, sometimes quickly, sometimes slow. This wasn’t done randomly either. Lin Jingyan was keeping a close eye on Happy’s attack rhythm and picking the most debilitating moments to move.</p>
<p>This problem was much harder to solve. Happy’s members had to keep a good grasp on their rhythm as well.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu could probably do this, but Steamed Bun and Mo Fan couldn’t always keep up under the changing rhythm, occasionally tripping up on their mechanics. Happy’s DPS rhythm was finally being affected. To outsiders, all Lin Jingyan was doing was circling around. He wasn’t attacking at all. Only other pro level players, with their experience, would be able to understand the debilitating effect this had on Happy’s attack rhythm.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’re asking for it!” With a yell, Soft Mist whirled around suddenly.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder hurriedly darted away like a rabbit, but then realized that Soft Mist was still attacking the Ghost King and hadn’t pursued him at all.</p>
<p>Tricked again!</p>
<p>However, Lin Jingyan was in a good mood and wasn’t frustrated at this at all, immediately darting back over. He still kept his distance, cautious. He didn’t dare get too close, if he was really caught by the other, then that wouldn’t spell anything good for him. Though it seemed like he was just circling around, this was quite a pain for Lin Jingyan as well. He had to observe the three’s attack rhythm while keeping an eye on Dancing Rain in the distance. He had to disrupt Happy’s attack rhythm while also carefully protecting himself. He didn’t know how long he would be able to last. This wasn’t an easy task; why else would he wait for Zhang Jiale in the first place? He would deal with this alone if he could. He had waited because he knew that the risk was rather high. Now, he had been forced to this point and carried out his task with 120 percent. Currently, it had some effect, but only a little. Happy’s attack rhythm was only being weakened, but not completely disrupted. Under this sort of harassment, their DPS wouldn’t be affected all that much. Lin Jingyan didn’t know if it was enough. He was currently rapidly trying to come up with more ideas.</p>
<p>“You again!!” As he was deep in contemplation, a loud yell sounded beside his ear. Lin Jingyan, startled, darted away again sunconsciously. But it turned out that Ye Xiu was just bluffing. Soft Mist hadn’t moved at all.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan didn’t know if he should cry or laugh. Even he wasn’t used to this sort of bluff. This was because pro matches didn’t have voice, so there wouldn’t be this sort of jump-scare of a distraction. The effect of the same words sent into the chat was incomparable with a yell on voice. If it was just a message sent to the chat, Lin Jingyan would focus more on Soft Mist’s movements instead of acting with what he heard and subconsciously running.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan, feeling rather helpless, once again had Dark Thunder run back over. Yet he hadn’t even began circling when he saw Soft Mist’s figure swerve to the side.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan was stunned for a moment. They weren’t in line anymore; he could attack!</p>
<p>He hadn’t even gotten the chance to attack when a black shadow sped in front of him. Some sort of skill from the Ghost King had arrived.</p>
<p>He hastily had Dark Thunder dodge and when he raised his head again, another black fireball was heading his way.</p>
<p>Was this a counterattack against him?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Lin Jingyan once again dodged the fireball. When he looked up again, Soft Mist’s spear had arrived.</p>
<p>When he wasn’t launching an attack, Ye Xiu had erupted into meaningless yelling again and again, but when he was actually charging over, he was completely silent.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan didn’t dare to face the other head on and hurriedly retreated. This time, however, Soft Mist gave chase. As for the Ghost King, it changed targets and lumbered towards Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>“The aggro target switched!” Lin Jingyan was shocked, only just realizing that Happy had been doing something more during their quiet DPSing.</p>
<p>Chapter 1122: One Man Can Hold the Pass</p>
<p>Without an aggro-establishing skill like the Knight’s Provoke, it was impossible to suddenly switch the target of the aggro. Even OT required that certain conditions be met. Otherwise, if it were as simple as your damage surpassed mine so the aggro immediately transferred, then two characters could simply take turns attacking and ping-pong the boss back and forth until it died.</p>
<p>The aggro system wasn’t designed so foolishly. To cause OT, the aggro had to surpass a certain percentage. Because of this, the fact that Dancing Rain had managed to suddenly pull away the aggro meant that they had prepared for this long in advance.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain was leading the boss away just like this, closely followed by Steamed Bun Invasion and Deception. Yet Lin Jingyan couldn’t do a thing to stop them, because Ye Xiu was right in front him.</p>
<p>In Ye Xiu’s hands, Battle Mage Soft Mist definitely wasn’t an opponent that Lin Jingyan could just easily blow past. In the blink of an eye, Ghost King and Happy’s three players vanished into one of the tunnels, while Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder continued to be beaten down by Soft Mist’s chained attacks.</p>
<p>For him, the important thing was to track where the Ghost King was being taken, but now, in order to accomplish that, he first had to defeat Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>For Lin Jingyan, this wasn’t an entirely impossible task. After so many years in the professional scene, the two had met on the battlefield multiple times, and Lin Jingyan did have some victories. But every battle was extremely difficult. Although it was possible that he could defeat Ye Xiu, he definitely couldn’t just quickly kill him with a chaotic flurry of slashes.</p>
<p>What’s worse was that Ye Xiu had the initiative right now, and Lin Jingyan was on the defensive. Lin Jingyan didn’t think he had the ability to defeat Ye Xiu in this current situation – just continuing to defend would be difficult enough.</p>
<p>No good would come from continuing this fight.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan understood this clearly. So the only thing he could do was to recklessly charge through Ye Xiu’s blockade, to see where Ghost King went.</p>
<p>Just as he thought this, Ye Xiu suddenly stopped attacking.</p>
<p>Soft Mist jumped back several times, retreating away.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan was surprised. As he watched, Ye Xiu controlled Soft Mist to stop right in the tunnel.</p>
<p>The area where they had been fighting the Ghost King was a relatively wide and open space, like an underground tomb chamber. But this tunnel at the end of the chamber wasn’t so wide. Seeing Soft Mist stand right at the entrance of the tunnel and completely blocking the way forward, one proverb flashed to the front of Lin Jingyan’s mind: One man can hold the pass against a thousand enemies.</p>
<p>“Hehehe. What now? Guess you can’t pass.” Ye Xiu said gleefully.</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu you shameless bastard!!” From Dark Thunder’s side came a somewhat distant shout. Ye Xiu, with all his experience, immediately knew that this was the sound of someone sitting next to the player yelling into the player’s headset.</p>
<p>“Which pro player is such a sore loser?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>He could even distinguish the owner of the voice. It was Zhang Jiale!</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale was already eliminated from this dungeon, but he still watched closely from Lin Jingyan’s screen. Seeing this situation, he immediately knew that things were bad. Even if they waited for Han Wenqing and the others to arrive and they were able to kill Ye Xiu with the advantage of numbers, after that, they had no idea where the Ghost King went and they’d have to start their search all over again. Happy would probably have enough time to kill the Ghost King before they found them again.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale this time really became the screenwriter.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan tried to rush Ye Xiu a few times. Ye Xiu didn’t try to compete with him, he just parked himself right in the tunnel and prevented him from passing. Every time, the effort was fruitless, and Lin Jingyan’s own health was almost depleted.</p>
<p>Then, Han Wenqing, Zhang Xinjie, and Qin Muyun arrived. In a 4v1, the outcome was as expected. This time, Ye Xiu didn’t continue to run. He blocked the tunnel with all of his life, but was eventually pushed over.</p>
<p>But now, where was the Ghost King?</p>
<p>The four continued to run forward, but they very quickly arrived at another fork in the road, shattering their hearts.</p>
<p>“Give up!” Ye Xiu sent a message to them in the global channel.</p>
<p>As long as it wasn’t over, Tyranny would never give up. They split up to search, but in the end, all they found was a system announcement.</p>
<p>Team Deception successfully killed the Ghost King.</p>
<p>The announcement was broadcast to the whole world. The players who were still online, after seeing this announcement, were in an uproar.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t earn the ability to participate in this bonus event, they at least knew that all of the participants were professional teams and players, including the Four Heavenly Kings of Tyranny.</p>
<p>They also didn’t know what had happened in Ghost Lair. But in the end, the team that successfully killed the Ghost King was Deception’s? Team Deception, wasn’t that just Team Happy?</p>
<p>Was Happy really this strong?</p>
<p>Everyone was discussing this outcome.</p>
<p>Of course, in the eyes of the ordinary players, a grassroots team like Happy was relatively weak. The fact that they had managed to vanquish Excellent Era was, after all, deemed a miracle.</p>
<p>But after defeating Excellent Era, Happy was able to get another victory in this competition, beating even Tyranny… A miracle was called a miracle because it was extraordinary. Something that happened often couldn’t be called a miracle.</p>
<p>Happy defeated Excellent Era, and now defeated Tyranny in this competition?</p>
<p>And not just Tyranny, but also Wind Howl, and Misty Rain, and Royal Style… These teams couldn’t be dismissed either.</p>
<p>Everyone was mulling over the implications of this; even the media reported on it.</p>
<p>Over the summer break, there were no battles to be written about, so there were much fewer topics of interest. Weekly esports newspapers that relied primarily on news about the Glory professional scene would shrink their publications during this time. But even now, everyone was still looking for stories to report on.</p>
<p>The biggest news during the summer was news of transfers – reporters would jump on this treasured news, reporting on completed transfers as well as the barest hints of rumors. But this sort of news wasn’t enough to support the paper. After all, unlike the ten-per-week regularity of professional matches, news of transfers was spontaneous and sporadic.</p>
<p>So the media looked to other places for news, and the in-game world of Glory was a natural choice. The weekly esports newspapers would often have a section about the in-game gossip, and during a time where there weren’t matches to report on, nor other interesting news, the in-game section expanded.</p>
<p>The eleventh server, and the Heavenly Domain. With a few million players, there were countless topics of gossip springing up every day. As long as you had the patience, there was enough to report on – even if the weekly newspaper was changed to daily, there was enough material.</p>
<p>However, as a professional esports media outlet, Esports Home still hoped to find some high-end material.</p>
<p>Pro players spending the summer break working or training in-game certainly counted as high-end material. In past summers, there were plenty of pro players who had been discovered in game, and the papers were as diligent in their reports as ever.</p>
<p>And this year was even more exciting, especially with this summer’s event. The pro players of the various teams all picked up their accounts and entered the game, which was a rare sight to be seen.</p>
<p>Thus, this week’s esports weekly papers of course focused on the performance of the pro players during the Ghost Parade event. The reporters swiped their account cards and entered Glory, contacting the guilds, or directly contacting the pro players, and tracking their progress.</p>
<p>And tonight, there was even an easter egg unlocked. Suddenly five teams were thrust into direct competition, and the reporters anxiously waited outside for the outcome and to ask what happened.</p>
<p>The one who finally killed Ghost King was Happy? The reporters’ professional intuition told them that there was a story behind this full of twists and turns, and they all grew excited.</p>
<p>They paid attention to the five teams in the dungeon, and those that had the pro players added as friends could track the progress of the teams by seeing when these players went offline.</p>
<p>Because the pro players immediately logged off upon exiting Ghost Lair, the reporters had no way of interviewing them in-game. Outside of the game, the most convenient was to use a chat method like QQ. All of these teams had dedicated reporters that followed them, and these reporters all had the QQ’s of the various players on the team. However, it was one thing to send a message on QQ, and it was another to see if the player was actually available and would reply.</p>
<p>In the end, this was just an in-game event, not some explosive news, and there was still plenty of time before publication, so the reporters weren’t anxious in waiting. If they could contact the player directly then great, if not, they would find other avenues to get news.</p>
<p>So very quickly, reporters discovered that Fang Rui had just made a new post on Weibo.</p>
<p>This Weibo was sent from his phone, timestamped after he had logged off from the Ghost Lair.</p>
<p>Just four words in the post: The weather has changed. And then, a sighing emoji.</p>
<p>Below the post, a whole crowd of fans had gathered in the replies, but they weren’t able to find too much to discuss, just some comments like “Fang Rui make sure not to leave your clothes out in the rain” and such.</p>
<p>But reporters were perceptive, and would certainly ponder over what they saw. Especially the reporters following Wind Howl, they lived in the same city as Fang Rui. Seeing this Weibo, those reporters quickly pulled up weather reports, only to find that the weather was stable, with clear skies and bright sunshine forecasted for the next several days.</p>
<p>Even if it was some prediction made from analyzing the night sky… The reporters looked out their windows into the darkness, but there wasn’t anything out of the ordinary!</p>
<p>Then, looking at the sighing emoji, the reporters began to have a faint feeling of the meaning behind this post.</p>
<p>The reporters patiently flipped through the comments on the post. There was a lot to look through; after all, Fang Rui was a star of a pro player and had many fans. Not long after it was posted, the comments and replies were already in the hundreds. This actually wasn’t even as many as it could have been – given the obscurity of this post, many people didn’t know what to say and just didn’t reply.</p>
<p>The reporters patiently flipped through. Since Fang Rui was a god of playing dirty, his fans were naturally fans of dirty playing as well. In the numerous strange replies, there were more than a few dirty and vulgar comments, which wasn’t unexpected.</p>
<p>But after flipping through several pages of comments, the reporters soon found another clue.</p>
<p>One fan also seemed to have perceived that Fang Rui’s mood was different from normal, and posted an ordinary, “Fang Rui, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>In the end, it was this comment that earned Fang Rui’s reply.</p>
<p>Five words: My love has been exhausted.</p>
<p>Chapter 1123: Brawler and Thief</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan, Esports Home’s reporter in City N, was the team reporter for Team Wind Howl in the Glory scene.</p>
<p>After seeing the comment “my love has been exhausted,” Cheng Siyan felt even more shocked. She immediately checked several pages of comments and saw many puzzled reactions from fans. However, Fang Rui didn’t further explain his comment.</p>
<p>If his comment was related to Glory, could he be planning on retiring?</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan jumped up in fright at this conjecture.</p>
<p>Fang Rui had joined the Alliance in season five. Many outstanding players had appeared that year, but because it happened to be after the influx of players from the Golden Generation in season four, season five seemed weak in comparison.</p>
<p>Among the pros that had been chosen for All Stars, apart from Fang Rui, there was one half to Void’s famed Ghostblade duo, Wu Yuce, and the current number one Glory player, Zhou Zekai.</p>
<p>These three had become famous during their early years too. They, along with the Golden Generation, were at the height of their careers. No matter what had happened with Fang Rui, he shouldn’t be having any thoughts of retiring, no?</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan shook his head ferociously, getting rid of such a crazy thought.</p>
<p>My love has been exhausted. If this comment wasn’t directed towards Glory, could it be towards his team? Or his personal life?</p>
<p>Glory’s pro players were all at the prime of their youths. Encountering love troubles wasn’t anything too unexpected. Cheng Siyan was familiar with Team Wind Howl, though. She had never heard of Fang Rui setting foot into a relationship. After getting rid of this thought, the only other possibility was the team.</p>
<p>Fang Rui no longer loved his team?</p>
<p>Was this… a sign of his departure?</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan was surprised.</p>
<p>As Wind Howl’s team reporter, she knew more about the changes happening in the team than anyone else. Tang Hao’s addition to the team and Zhao Yuzhe’s rise gave the team vitality and drive. However, as a professional, she could also see that Fang Rui’s position had been weakened because of the changes to the team’s strategies as a result of those two’s playstyles. She had pointed this out in an article and had hoped for Wind Howl to make adjustments. But Wind Howl had started the season explosively and also collapsed explosively. This issue hadn’t been properly taken care of.</p>
<p>In the new season, Wind Howl had signed on new players. People paying attention to this issue were waiting to see what changes Wind Howl would make to their style next season. They most likely hadn’t thought that the resolution to this problem would actually be to let go of Fang Rui.</p>
<p>If Fang Rui truly was unable to assimilate into the team, he could only accept this decision. But the problem was that as Wind Howl’s team reporter, Cheng Siyan hadn’t seen Wind Howl try to do this though. All she saw was Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe showing off their playstyles without restraint, while Fang Rui worked tirelessly to chase after them.</p>
<p>He failed to catch up, so he was being let go?</p>
<p>If that was the case, Cheng Siyan could completely sympathize with Fang Rui’s “my love has been exhausted.”</p>
<p>Transfers were undoubtedly the highlights of the summer for reporters. A transfer for an All Star like Fang Rui was a highlight among highlights, so as soon as she realized this possibility, she definitely wasn’t going to stay idle. But basing her news off of a few words on Weibo wasn’t reliable. She needed to find more data.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan tried sending Fang Rui a text but didn’t get a response. After hesitating a bit, she took out her phone and gave a call. However, Fang Rui had turned his phone off.</p>
<p>She couldn’t get in touch with the person directly involved. Since relying on a few Weibo words to contact Wind Howl for an official response would be somewhat excessive, Cheng Siyan continued to read the replies on Fang Rui’s Weibo and pondered over what she should do.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she realized that Fang Rui’s Weibo had been posted after the Ghost Parade Easter Egg event. This shouldn’t be a coincidence. Perhaps something had happened during the course of this event that had affected him to the extent that he would post “my love has been exhausted.” If she could understand what had happened in this event, maybe she would be able to get some clues?</p>
<p>Who to ask?</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan looked at her friends list on QQ. She was friends with practically everyone on Team Wind Howl, but asking someone on Wind Howl might end up being a situation where the person on the spot is baffled, while the spectator sees more clearly. What about the other teams? Cheng Siyan thought to herself. Chu Yunxiu? Su Mucheng?</p>
<p>Female pro players were in the minority, and it wasn’t too different for Glory news reporters either. As rare species, she had a pretty good relationship with these two Gods. These two just happened to participate in the Easter Egg event too. Cheng Siyan immediately messaged them.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu seemed to be offline already though. As for Su Mucheng, she replied back promptly and explained what had happened in the Easter Egg event.</p>
<p>Because of their good relationship with each other, whenever Cheng Siyan asked a question for more details, Su Mucheng didn’t decline. When she heard about the direct confrontation between Happy and Wind Howl, Cheng Siyan became excited. This time, she had indeed asked the right person.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan didn’t want to miss any of the details of this battle. Su Mucheng also knew that Cheng Siyan was Wind Howl’s team reporter, so she wasn’t surprised. After Tang Hao’s Demon Subduer was killed in the skirmish, they quickly retreated and then hid as they watched Misty Rain and Royal Style trap Wind Howl. The conflict between Zhao Yuzhe and Fang Rui had taken place after Demon Subduer died, after Happy had already retreated. As a result, Su Mucheng didn’t know about it. But Su Mucheng still remembered Zhao Yuzhe charging at them solo during their retreat as well as Fang Rui’s Doubtful Demon being the only remaining member left, so Su Mucheng obviously talked about those.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan hadn’t directly heard what she had wanted to hear, but she was familiar with Team Wind Howl. The series of events, from Zhao Yuzhe pursuing Happy alone to Wind Howl stopping their pursuit to Fang Rui being the only survivor from the encirclement by Misty Rain and Royal Style, gave her a lot of clues.</p>
<p>She was certain that something had happened between Fang Rui and Zhao Yuzhe.</p>
<p>Because she understood Wind Howl’s players. If she had to comment on Zhao Yuzhe, to put it nicely, he showed a lot of initiative; to put it negatively, he was short sighted. In that situation, he would choose to pursue the enemy, but Fang Rui, who was the master at playing dirty, would definitely err on the side of caution. Fang Rui also had a better understanding of Ye Xiu’s skill. In that situation, he definitely wouldn’t chase after the enemy rashly.</p>
<p>Their captain, Tang Hao, wasn’t there. Even though Fang Rui was Wind Howl’s vice-captain, the number two, because of his difference in idealogy, Zhao Yuzhe, who aligned with Tang Hao’s playstyle, didn’t recognize Fang Rui’s methods at all. Zhao Yuzhe disagreed with most of Fang Rui’s orders and did as he pleased. Thus, it would be hard to avoid a conflict. And in this conflict, Tang Hao would most definitely favor Zhao Yuzhe. After all, their ideologies were similar. The long-time veteran Fang Rui was almost like an alien to them.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>She understood what Fang Rui meant by “my love has been exhausted.”</p>
<p>Fang Rui had probably been trying to establish a connection with Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe the entire time, but he was never able to get a response. It was just like that phrase: I treat you well, but you treat me with indifference.</p>
<p>He hadn’t only attempted it once or twice. Fang Rui was unable to synergize with Tang Hao or Zhao Yuzhe over the entire last season. Even after their defeat in the playoffs, Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe still refused to make any changes.</p>
<p>Maybe this was a form of perseverance, a form of confidence in their playstyles. However, Fang Rui had been hurt because of their persistence. Discouraged and downhearted, besides leaving, what other choice did he have?</p>
<p>Club Wind Howl didn’t seem to have any opinion on this matter. They remained indifferent. But in reality, in the clubs, the captain had authority on these issues. Tang Hao’s position on this problem was equivalent to the club’s positoin. Unfortunately, this was the outcome for Fang Rui. Tang Hao insisted on his intrinsic playstyle and didn’t try to fit it with Fang Rui’s playing dirty. Only Fang Rui tried his hardest to fit in with the team. However, the results were poor. His value could not be utilized optimally.</p>
<p>“The weather… really has changed..” Cheng Siyan murmured to herself. Brawler and Thief. Demon Subduer and Doubtful Demon. After Fang Rui entered the team, Wind Howl had established this duo nicknamed the Criminal Partners, which had received quite a lot of attention. Even though they failed to make it into the finals, Wind Howl frequently made it to the playoffs. Their strength was not that of a bottom team.</p>
<p>But now, it was all over. Lin Jingyan had left. Fang Rui was about to leave. The Thief class didn’t seem to appeal to Tang Hao’s tastes. Wind Howl probably wouldn’t introduce a new Thief player. Brawler and Thief, the Criminal Partners, were going to fade away wordlessly just like this?</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan also didn’t know. She didn’t have first-hand knowledge from the people directly involved, but she was already saddened. Even though she knew that this choice would be favorable for Team Wind Howl’s growth, the invested fans wouldn’t react to this resolution rationally. The Criminal Partners were the symbol of Team Wind Howl’s core. And now, this partnership would be breaking off. It was as if Hundred Blossoms no longer had Blood and Blossoms, or Void no longer had their dual Ghostblades, or Blue Rain no longer their Sword and Curse. It would always feel strange.</p>
<p>“Why did it turn out like this?” Cheng Siyan didn’t make any more inquiries about what else happened in Ghost Lair. She was already too lazy to write about this content. She believed that there would be many others who would write about that. Right now, she was only concerned about Team Wind Howl. She was already preparing to personally pay a visit and ask tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the next morning, before Cheng Siyan could even leave the door, she received a phone call about the huge news. Cheng Siyan was stunned. She thought that Fang Rui leaving the team had happened overnight, but it turned out that it was news of Team Seaside’s Zhao Yang retiring.</p>
<p>Chapter 1124: Weibo War</p>
<p>Zhao Yang was a pro player who had debuted in the third season. He had been highly regarded upon his debut, but had lost to Wang Jiexi for the season’s title of Best Rookie. But, he had still managed to be voted into the All Stars for seven years in succession, starting from the year of his debut. He was, unarguably, the number one Qi Master in Glory.</p>
<p>This glory belonged to Zhao Yang, but what stood out most about him was that he had managed to be voted into the All Stars for seven years, yet hadn’t played in a single playoffs match in seven years.</p>
<p>Out of all the All Stars, the only player that had never made it to the playoffs was Zhao Yang. Seven consecutive years of making it into All Stars spoke lengths of Zhao Yang’s strength. Seven consecutive years of not making it into the playoffs spoke lengths about Team Seaside’s strength.</p>
<p>People weren’t willing to give them the label of ‘weak team’ because of their All Star player. In truth, Seaside was quite far from those teams that drifted about the relegation zone. They were solidly mid-tier, always just steps away from the playoffs.</p>
<p>Because of this awkward situation, plenty of people tried to entice Zhao Yang to other teams, but he stayed, leading Seaside over and over again in an attempt to charge into the playoffs. Seven years of hard work, seven years of disappointment, results that were beyond average, Zhao Yang had been suspended in such a situation for seven whole years, and now he was finally exhausted. He hadn’t switched teams to try again, bur instead gave in to defeat and announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang’s career as a pro player hadn’t been short of mockery. There was little need to talk about Wang Jiexi, who had debuted in season three with him and was considered the most successful pro player second to Ye Xiu. To most people, there was nothing to compare, what with Zhao Yang having never even experienced a single playoffs.</p>
<p>Most people were more willing to compare him to Yang Cong.</p>
<p>Captain of 301 Degrees, the number one Assassin of the Alliance and also a third season debutant. Yang Cong was different from Wang Jiexi and Zhao Yang though. At first, Yang Cong hadn’t stood out at all, but as he grew and developed, he slowly gained acknowledgement, and with him, 301 Degrees also grew as a team.</p>
<p>This team was full of players who, like Yang Cong, weren’t eye-catching, but had a great grasp of the basics and trained themselves up step by step. They lacked natural talent, but made up for it with their diligence. They weren’t a powerhouse, and didn’t really have any sort of solid identity as a strong team, but they often managed to slip into the playoffs and could cause quite some trouble for any powerhouse.</p>
<p>In comparison, Zhao Yang, who held everyone’s expectations, had never drawn any doubt about his skill, but he had never managed to bring his team up to a breakthrough. And Seaside also had terrible management as a club, having managed to experience all the problems a club could experience: financial troubles, workplace politics, etc. It was impressive that they had managed to hold on for so long. However, Zhao Yang was leaving now and no one would expect anything more from this team. Even though they had an All Star level account, Boundless Sea, that they had put all their resources into making, Seaside’s chaotic management meant that even an All Star account wouldn’t be enough to attract any talents.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang’s retirement press conference was very peaceful, and his career had been one entire awkward situation without anything worth commemorating. In the end, even Zhao Yang himself could only use “at least I got here and tried my best,” to comment on his seven years as a pro. After that, it was just the necessities like Seaside thanking him for all his hard work and what not.</p>
<p>Another talented player left, but like his career, his departure didn’t have much of an effect on the Alliance as a whole. What people cared about most would always be the fight for the championship, and Seaside had never been a part of that. Their weakening would only let those in danger of relegation sigh in relief.</p>
<p>Since there weren’t any significant repercussions, Cheng Siyan ignored it after looking over the gist. It wasn’t like she would be doing any of the interviewing regarding Zhao Yang’s retirement. Cheng Siyan prepared to contact Fang Rui, but opened up Weibo beforehand, only to stare in shock at what she saw. The Weibo post by Fang Rui had exploded.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan had analyzed and guessed, coming to the conclusion that Fang Rui might want to leave. But she needed more resources before she could act on this because she was a news reporter. No normal person would need to show this form of integrity. After making their guess, they could just announce it freely, and then gossip.</p>
<p>What was different though, was that many pro players were also participating in this irresponsible gossiping.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” This sort of sincere and plain inquiry came from Fang Rui’s once teammate, Lin Jingyan. As old partners, they had quite a close relationship, and would naturally show more worry for the other at times like this.</p>
<p>However, most of the comments were full of mockery, just to rile things up for entertainment.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, shameless Fang? Has your shamelessness reached the point where Wind Howl can no longer endure it and has to get rid of you?” Void’s Wu Yuce, a player who had debuted the same season as Fang Rui, sent a not-so-sincere and caring question.</p>
<p>“Senior Fang Rui’s style really doesn’t quite align with Wind Howl’s current style!” Samsara’s Jiang Botao used Wu Yuce’s question to formulate his own comment. Though he had only debuted a year after Fang Rui, he still politely called the other senior.</p>
<p>“Wind Howl’s high paced and efficient fighting style has placed constraints on the effectiveness of dirty play.” The opinion from Tyranny’s Zhang Xinjie was professional and concise, and after that, he didn’t say a single extra word.</p>
<p>“Tch, what’s with all the useless chatter!” Huang Shaotian expressed, but his comment didn’t end there. To avoid the 140 character word limit that was contraining him, Huang Shaotian had only used that as a title for his lengthy article that he attached to the comment.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan subconsciously clicked into the article and was hit with exclamation marks that took up a third of the article. Cheng Siyan skimmed a few lines before calmly closing the article. There was no need to read pure trash talk, and that “tch, what’s with all the useless chatter” of Huang Shaotian’s was the most irritating thing in sight.</p>
<p>From Gods to rookies, there were many pro players who joined in with the discussion. After commenting, they also reposted and commented on each other’s comments. Cheng Siyan had naturally followed all the pro players with Weibo and ended up getting her screen flooded by said pro players. The number of posts were still increasing by the minute. It was clear that these guys had gotten stirred up upon seeing Fang Rui’s post in the morning. Just think of the hand speed they had; with every passing second, several new Weibo posts would appear. Cheng Siyan couldn’t keep up at all.</p>
<p>However, she refused to give up.</p>
<p>The pure trash talk that most pro players sent were worthless. Cheng Siyan wanted to see if any members of Wind Howl were joining in with the discussion. For a while, she had completely forgotten that she had planned to contact Fang Rui, the one who had started all this. But, as she continuously refreshed the screen, a Weibo post suddenly jumped out at her.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a future there. Why don’t you pack up and come to Happy?”</p>
<p>Weibo poster: Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan was stunned. As for the reason, it was clear upon looking at Ye Xiu’s Weibo account. Ye Xiu’s Weibo account had been verified with his ID and had been created for a long time now. After so many years, his followers had rose to tens of millions. However, Follow: 0. Weibo: 0.*</p>
<p>That meant, Ye Xiu hadn’t used his Weibo at all since its creation. He had maintained his air of mystery and didn’t appear in public in any form or manner.</p>
<p>However, after establishing Happy and winning the Challenger League, Ye Xiu began to tread into this territory. He accepted interviews and attended press conferences. In the past, he would’ve never done any of these. Now, was he even using Weibo?</p>
<p>For a moment, Cheng Siyan didn’t even care about the contents of Ye Xiu’s post, immediately heading for the comments section where everyone was dumbstruck, half of them asking if his account had been hacked…</p>
<p>However, the pro players had already begun rapidly reposting and trash talking Ye Xiu’s post. The discussion surrounding Fang Rui had cooled down drastically. This reminded Cheng Siyan of a boss spawning. Only a boss spawning would immediately draw all aggro, no?</p>
<p>“Holy crap, who on earth is this? Let me take a look!” Void’s Li Xuan managed to get the first kill in trash talking.</p>
<p>“Old Ye knows how to use Weibo? How long have you been learning? This is actually Mucheng, right? Mucheng, I see you!” Chu Yunxiu was the second.</p>
<p>But she soon got a response back, Su Mucheng having reposted and commented on her Weibo: “I’m over here!”</p>
<p>“The great Ye Xiu has given his Weibo virginity that he’s been protecting for all these years to Fang Rui. True love needs no explanation.” Team Thunderclap’s Dai Yanqi courageously came up to tease Ye Xiu and immediately gained a wave of attention.</p>
<p>“The truth…”</p>
<p>“Exposed…”</p>
<p>“Repost ten thousand times and your true love will become a reality, come on, everyone…”</p>
<p>“Holy shit, if true love comes, then will Happy get yet another All Star?”</p>
<p>The topic suddenly swerved back to the main road and everyone suddenly realized that this was an important question. Everyone had always looked at Happy as a grassroots team, a new team, a weak team. But now, they had Ye Xiu, they had Su Mucheng. That was already two All Stars. If Fang Rui really went, then that would be a three All Star player team. How many teams like this were there in the Alliance? Even if their characters weren’t the strongest, how many would dare leble them as a weak team?</p>
<p>“Compared to Happy, Tiny Herb is the real best option.” Wang Jiexi, who hadn’t been seen at all during the trash talking, suddenly popped up then.</p>
<p>“Are there even any spaces left in Tiny Herb? Why not come to our Thunderclap?” Xiao Shiqin suggested.</p>
<p>“Come to Void, Void needs more shamelessness,” Li Xuan added, but his comment came with mockery. It was clear that he was just here for fun and not really here to recruit. Fang Rui was a good player, but they couldn’t just try and take home every talent that seemed good. If you were going to take someone home, he or she had to be useful. If you were doing it for ornamental purposes, you might be willing, but Fang Rui might not!</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan was completely dumbstruck. By now, the only words that were actually relevant to Fang Rui were the nine words, “The weather has changed, my love has been exhausted.” However, under this Weibo post, a recruitment war had erupted. Of course, there were plenty that were just there to trash talk or just for fun, but some teams truly could give Fang Rui a stable place on their team.</p>
<p>Chapter 1125: Confirmation</p>
<p>Everything on Weibo was pure nonsense…</p>
<p>Cheng Siyan zoned out for a while before she came back to her senses. Everyone was just playing around, how could she possibly find what she wanted? This gave her a good reason though. If she had only relied on the nine words that Fang Rui posted on Weibo, then it would be inappropriate for her to ask for confirmation from Wind Howl. But because of the disturbances caused by the pro players, this matter had developed to the point that tens of thousands of Glory fans were talking about this topic. If she didn’t seek any information from Wind Howl, she wouldn’t have the nosiness a qualified reporter should have.</p>
<p>As a result, Cheng Siyan directly called Club Wind Howl. However, they denied knowing anything about Fang Rui’s Weibo and asked her to wait for them to talk with Fang Rui.</p>
<p>This seemed like a response to evade the problem, but that was the actual situation at Club Wind Howl.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s Weibo had been posted late in the night, so the ensuing chaos had taken place in the morning. Wind Howl had only found out then too.</p>
<p>Wind Howl progressed very quickly with their investigation. First, they asked Fang Rui about the situation. His current situation in the team wasn’t a secret, so they understood.</p>
<p>After that, they consulted team captain Tang Hao for his opinion, who didn’t compromise at all. He didn’t have any intentions of forcing Fang Rui away, but he would definitely not give up on his playstyle. Fang Rui hoped he could bring out more of his abilities, but so did Tang Hao. According to Tang Hao, catering to Fang Rui’s style wouldn’t allow him to perform to the best of his abilities, which was why he wasn’t willing to back down.</p>
<p>The club realized that things wouldn’t be working out. Since Tang Hao and Fang Rui weren’t compatible, they had to sacrifice one of them. Wind Howl made their decision instantly. Tang Hao was their ace they would be relying on for the future, so it was obvious that he couldn’t leave. Although Fang Rui had been in the team for several years and was at the peak of his his career, he still had to operate around Tang Hao as the ace. If he couldn’t bring out his worth then they could only say sorry to him.</p>
<p>In the end, the boss of Wind Howl personally went to chat with Fang Rui and told him he was allowed to leave. As the number two in the team for the past five years, Wind Howl gave him the respect he deserved.</p>
<p>Fang Rui wasn’t surprised about the outcome. After all, this problem hadn’t just been a one-time issue, but one that had lasted throughout the entire last season. Neither of them were able to work it out during that entire time. This was probably the final hammer.</p>
<p>“I understand, I completely understand. You don’t need to say any more.” Fang Rui smiled and didn’t listen to the boss’ explanation any further. He knew that the club was without a choice as well.</p>
<p>“Alright!” The boss of Wind Howl didn’t insist on explaining. “Wherever you want to go, we’ll try to make things as convenient as possible for you.”</p>
<p>“Hm… let me think about it!” Fang Rui spoke.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, we have time.” The boss of Wind Howl said.</p>
<p>Indeed, they had time. The transfer window had only opened for half a month. Apart from Excellent Era’s large clean-out so far, there were no heavyweight transfers.</p>
<p>Where should I go?</p>
<p>After coming out from the boss’s office, Fang Rui was depressed.</p>
<p>He had expected this outcome, but that didn’t mean he was ready for it. He actually had to leave Wind Howl, the team he had played on for five years.</p>
<p>Perhaps, five years was only a small part of a person’s life, but for many pro players, it might very well be all of it.</p>
<p>Fang Rui believed his situation wasn’t bad because the five years that had passed were only a phase in his career. He only needed to find somewhere else and start a new chapter. But where should he go?</p>
<p>Fang Rui thought to himself as he grabbed out his phone. He didn’t check his phone since last night, so when he turned it on, someone happened to give a call. He checked his phone and realised it was Cheng Siyan, the team’s reporter from Esports Home. Fang Rui predicted what she would ask, but there was no point in hiding from a forthcoming reality. He picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Are you really leaving?” Cheng Siyan finally waited for Fang Rui to power on his phone, and ended up hearing the exact news.</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m leaving…” Fang Rui said. His eyes started to look around again.</p>
<p>“Where are you planning to go?” Cheng Siyan asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t decided yet…” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of teams inviting you on Weibo!” Cheng Siyan half-joked. The trash talk on Weibo shouldn’t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>“Weibo?” Fang Rui was at loss.</p>
<p>“What, you haven’t checked it yet?” Cheng Siyan asked.</p>
<p>“Nope!” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Go have a look, it’s very… interesting.” Cheng Siyan could only come up with this word. “Even Ye Xiu commented on your Weibo.”</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu?” Fang Rui was shocked.</p>
<p>“He invited you to Happy!” Cheng Siyan said.</p>
<p>“Happy?” Fang Rui started to ponder.</p>
<p>“Go have a look!” Cheng Siyan said.</p>
<p>Team Happy was scrolling through Weibo instead of playing the game in the morning, which was a rarity for them. But in reality, Ye Xiu left after casually leaving the playful message. Guan Rongfei, who hadn’t slept for the whole night, had something important to discuss with him!</p>
<p>Happy still needed to collect their reward for killing the Ghost King from Ghost Lair!</p>
<p>Since they could pick their own materials as their reward, it was obvious that they would ask for the opinion of Guan Rongfei, the senior in charge of Happy’s logistics. Since Guan Rongfei was most interested and passionate about the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, he was resolute in selecting materials to upgrade the umbrella. However, in order to upgrade Myriad Manifestation Umbrella to Level 75, Guan Rongfei’s plan needed him to only use rare materials. The consumption was excessive, so he was hesitating on which materials to pick and prioritize.</p>
<p>They didn’t immediately log out last night because they were waiting for Guan Rongfei to reach a conclusion before collecting the prize. After they had waited for half an hour, they couldn’t help but return to their rooms to rest. But after they had returned in the morning, they found Guan Rongfei in front of the computer in the exact same position as last night. His screen was filled with documents and the ground was covered in drafts. This guy didn’t know which method he should use to treasure this rare prize of self-selected materials, so he even went as far as to stay up the whole night.</p>
<p>What was even more tragic was that he still couldn’t come up with a conclusion after staying up all night.</p>
<p>“Rest for now, we’re not in a hurry.” Ye Xiu said. They still had a lot of time left to collect their reward.</p>
<p>“Shush shush, I’m about to have an idea.” Guan Rongfei stared at the screen and ignored Ye Xiu’s suggestion.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu could only leave. After that, Su Mucheng happened to find some gossip as she casually scrolled through her Weibo. Ye Xiu went to have a look and also wrote something.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu posting on his Weibo immediately became an even hotter topic than Fang Rui’s transfer. In comparison, the news about Zhao Yang’s retirement became even colder. After many of the pro players shared the news along with a few lines of blessings, nothing else was said.</p>
<p>After all, retiring was an emotional event. What made it worse was that Zhao Yang’s career was quite tragic. Even if a person was extremely dirty, shameless, or inhuman, they wouldn’t have the energy to ridicule Zhao Yang.</p>
<p>Although they were opponents onstage, they were still friends outside of the match. It didn’t matter whether one was close or distant, when he retired, it meant a permanent departure. They would never see this person on stage again in the future. During this time, everyone shared the same emotions.</p>
<p>Goodbye!</p>
<p>You’ll be missed!</p>
<p>Blessings!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Apart from these words, what else could be said?</p>
<p>That was why Fang Rui’s four-word post and five-word reply on his Weibo were able to stir up such a big reaction between the professional players. Even if he were going to transfer, who hadn’t witnessed this before? When had something like this ever caused so much excitement on Weibo?</p>
<p>This situation was in fact an excuse that allowed them to shift their attention as well as let out their emotions. Perhaps retiring was even more saddening for them than death. None of them wanted to retire, nor would they want to see anyone else retire. Unfortunately, this was a point in life in which each of them had to face. It would happen sooner or later, just like how everyone’s life would eventually wither away.</p>
<p>As a result, everyone messed around with Fang Rui. When they discovered Ye Xiu had posted, they also started to mess with him too. However, Ye Xiu was called over by Guan Rongfei, who said he had an idea and wanted Ye Xiu to give advice.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” Ye Xiu said after he came over.</p>
<p>“These.” Guan Rongfei handed a piece of scratch paper to Ye Xiu, which had his requirements written illegibly and spaced out. The reward for this extra event was to have each of the five members select five materials, as well as a piece of Orange equipment. In total, that would be 25 materials and five pieces of Orange equipments. What Guan Rongfei had been trying so hard to plan was obviously the materials. What surprised Ye Xiu was that he even spent a whole night thinking about it. If it were up to him, he would have picked materials with higher priority. It shouldn’t be this hard to pick, right? But when Ye Xiu received and looked over the messy list written by Guan Rongfei, he couldn’t understand his reasoning.</p>
<p>“I think these should be enough,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“Enough? What’s enough?” Ye Xiu couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“I want to do an experiment,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“Experiment?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Hm… an important experiment that will determine my plan for the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. Only if this works can the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella continue with the established plan. If not, I’m afraid I will need to make adjustments,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“What experiment? You’ve never mentioned it before.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“Then what am I supposed to look at?” Ye Xiu asked, holding up the ragged piece of scratch paper.</p>
<p>“Look? Who told you to look? Take the list of items and bring me the materials!” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s face darkened. After all this time, this master hadn’t called him over for advice, but rather for him to go over and get the materials.</p>
<p>“Right, I’ll collect the rewards. Are you about to start?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“No no, I have to rest for a while. Collect it and leave it there for now, I’ll deal with it at night. This must not go wrong.” Guan Rongfei ended up talking to himself when he reached the end of his sentence. He then left without looking at Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first day that Ye Xiu had met him, so he wasn’t surprised by his attitude. He took out the list of items and collected five materials for each of the five characters who participated in yesterday’s battle. After he collected them according to the list, he transferred them all to Lord Grim’s account for safekeeping. They were upgrading the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, so it was obvious that they would be using Lord Grim’s account.</p>
<p>After that, new information about Fang Rui came out. After Club Wind Howl had finished sorting out the internal problems, they officially announced and confirmed that Fang Rui would be leaving the team this summer.</p>
<p>Chapter 1126: Boundless Sea</p>
<p>The news was released on Team Wind Howl’s official Weibo, so the pro players who were currently active on Weibo were the first to know.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was really going to transfer?</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. They were just joking around earlier, who would have thought that the news was actually true?</p>
<p>Transfers were a different kind of departure. Even though it wasn’t a permanent farewell like retirement was, but to be teammates one day and opponents the next wasn’t a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Professional spirit, professionalism. It sounded simple, but everyone was human, and what kind of human didn’t have emotions? The so-called professionalism was, at its core, simply the ability to control and control one’s emotions.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people might enjoy leaving their original team and leap towards the future. But Fang Rui, everyone believed, was not that kind of person. Everyone saw and understood the problems between Fang Rui and Wind Howl. He only left out of helplessness. He personally felt wronged, and the team also felt that it was a pity too.</p>
<p>So as soon as the news was revealed to be true, people couldn’t joke any longer.</p>
<p>After seeing that this news was confirmed, Chen Guo suddenly became nervous.</p>
<p>“Can we get him to our team?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “You can’t just toss a good vegetable into our basket as soon as you see it! You have to see if it fits in or not. After all, we’re not a recycling station.”</p>
<p>Recycling station… A recycling station is for trash, okay? This is an All Star we’re talking about here! Chen Guo resisted the urge to complain aloud.</p>
<p>“We don’t need his dirty playing?” But as soon as the words left her mouth, Chen Guo stopped. She looked at Ye Xiu. And then she looked over at Wei Chen, who was casually dangling a slipper from one foot as he sat in front of his computer, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>Happy might lack many things, but dirty play certainly wasn’t one of them.</p>
<p>What was the point in getting Fang Rui over here? Compete to see who could be the most shameless? Make a team that had shamelessness as its core playstyle, once and for all?</p>
<p>Just thinking about organizing a team like that, Chen Guo couldn’t help but shiver. Let’s just pass on him, she thought.</p>
<p>But after Ye Xiu finished, he immediately went back to join in on the fun.</p>
<p>Because the news was confirmed, the Weibo war that had entertained countless fans had suddenly quieted down. But in this calm, Ye Xiu, theat man with ten million followers, zero following, and one post, suddenly made his second post.</p>
<p>“So you’re really transferring? Happy is absolutely your best choice. Team of champions, master of kings!”</p>
<p>Fuck!</p>
<p>You just couldn’t resist?</p>
<p>A team that just emerged from the Challenger League was a “team of champions, master of kings”? Then what did that make everyone else?</p>
<p>“Tiny Herb, winner of two championships.” Wang Jiexi wrote in an entirely neutral tone. Now that Excellent Era was no longer in the Alliance, two-time champion was an extremely impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>“Samsara, winner of two championships in a row.” Jiang Botao’s follow-up was immediate. Repeating Wang Jiexi’s words but adding “in a row” immediately made this accomplishment seem that much greater.</p>
<p>“Tiny Herb wasn’t able to defend their title because they lost to the number one team in the universe, Blue Rain!” As expected of the master opportunist Huang Shaotian, he seized the chance to interject with his extraordinary hand speed. Blue Rain’s sole championship, originally seemingly weaker than the others, was suddenly lifted in importance.</p>
<p>“Tyranny has your oldest and most familiar partner.” Zhang Jiale also joined in on the fun, playing the emotion card because of Lin Jingyan’s presence in the team.</p>
<p>“Yup, really quite old…” Then someone below immediately came out of nowhere and made this reply. Zhang Jiale was so mad he wanted to spit blood, but it was just an ordinary player, how could he get into an argument with someone like that?</p>
<p>In an instant, Weibo was suddenly lively again. But it was still unclear as to which, if any, of these teams were serious in their comments.</p>
<p>Because of Fang Rui’s skill and status, if he transferred to another team, there was no way he would just be a substitute. He himself wouldn’t be willing, and it would be a waste for the team.</p>
<p>His arrival would require his new team to undergo a huge readjustment, and this wasn’t something that could be clarified in just a few words. When a team invited a new player, they would first perform thorough analysis and observation of the player. As Ye Xiu said, it wasn’t a matter of tossing all the good vegetables into the basket, you had to see if you could use this vegetable to create a suitable taste.</p>
<p>After Fang Rui’s confirmed transfer, there were immediately people pulling him this way and that, but it was impossible to gauge their sincerity.</p>
<p>Those that were actually interested in Fang Rui were likely gathered in intense discussion among the entire team. This was no small matter.</p>
<p>After people chattered on Weibo for a while longer, it finally quieted down once and for all. To make a deal right here right now was obviously impossible.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was going to transfer, but where he would end up wasn’t something that could be decided in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>However, as Chen Guo watched Ye Xiu rile up the other pros, she suddenly started wondering again. Other teams had managers and bosses and many departments, all of which would need to be consulted for a matter like this. But Happy wasn’t so complex and didn’t have so many workers. She, the boss, was the “tossing good vegetables into basket” type of person as Ye Xiu put it, and the others like Tang Rou and Steamed Bun were just rookies and didn’t have much to contribute on this end. So for issues like this, Ye Xiu was essentially the sole decision-maker, with Wei Chen occasionally giving his opinions from the side.</p>
<p>The other pro players were just playing around; their words didn’t have any weight. But Ye Xiu wasn’t the same, because in practice, he held the same power in Happy as Lou Guanning did in Heavenly Swords. They were each a pro player, but also the decision-making boss.</p>
<p>“This Fang Rui, do we want him or not?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“We don’t,” Ye Xiu said, smiling as he shook his head.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t he raise the ability of our team?” Chen Guo asked. All this time, she was trying to learn more. Although her ability at playing Glory probably wouldn’t improve, she wanted to increase her knowledge and analytic ability to be a competent leader of Team Happy.</p>
<p>“He would,” Ye Xiu said. “For a player with his skill, as long as you give him enough freedom, he would raise the ability of any team. But for us, his relative value is too low. An All Star player, and we’d have to get him an All Star account, how much investment would that take? And there’s the price of his contract, too. If we did this, we’d be putting all of our eggs in one basket. There’s no need for us to be stuck on this one tree for so long.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Chen Guo understood. In the end, it came down to the fact that Happy didn’t have enough funds. The 5 million award from winning the Challenger League was already split among all the players, and as for the other funds from broadcasting and sponsorship deals and such, Happy currently had around 12 million in usable funds. Wei Chen also had 18 million himself, and he had said that this was his investment in the team and available to use. But neither Chen Guo nor Ye Xiu wanted to use Wei Chen’s personal money.</p>
<p>12 million…</p>
<p>Since Fang Rui was already confirmed to be leaving Wind Howl, then even though he was an All Star, the price wouldn’t be too high. But if Fang Rui were to come, he would have to have a suitable account. If they also wanted to get the All Star character Doubtful Demon, then 12 million might be barely enough, if that. And there was no way that Fang Rui would be like Ye Xiu and the others, who played without caring about income. He would definitely want a competitive contract. Fang Rui currently had an annual salary of 650,000 with Wind Howl, since he was still in his prime. He wasn’t being transferred because of declining skill, so there was no reason for him to shrink his contract. With all of that, even if Happy were to tap into Wei Chen’s 18 million, getting Fang Rui over would really put Happy into a predicament. Happy also had daily expenses, and all of its existing members still had to sign competitive contracts. Wu Chen needed a salary for managing the guild too. And there was still the issue of a lack of a stadium, which Happy had yet to resolve.</p>
<p>“Then what are you still causing this ruckus here for?” After thinking over all of that, Chen Guo knew they wouldn’t be able to get Fang Rui. But she also didn’t believe that Ye Xiu was just doing this all for fun – this guy always did things with a purpose.</p>
<p>“Haha. Let everyone have some fun together!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“And then?” Chen Guo wasn’t discouraged. Ye Xiu definitely had an ulterior motive.</p>
<p>Indeed, on Ye Xiu’s screen was a page displaying news of Zhao Yang’s retirement. “We can think about getting the character Boundless Sea.”</p>
<p>“Boundless Sea, Qi Master? Do we need it?” Chen Guo was surprised.</p>
<p>“It’s at least more reliable than trying to get Fang Rui,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Would Seaside let the account go just like that?” Chen Guo asked. Boundless Sea had special significance to Seaside. It was like One Autumn Leaf and Excellent Era, or Vaccaria and Tiny Herb. The value of such a character wasn’t just in the power of the character or its equipment – this was a team’s soul and core. One would have to buy the other party’s feelings and memories with this account as well, and the price for that would only ever be high, never low.</p>
<p>“I think there should be a chance,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“If Seaside still had strong aspirations, I think that they wouldn’t have had Zhao Yang retire just like this,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>After all, Wang Jiexi and Yang Cong, who had debuted the same year as Zhao Yang, were both still fighting. But a team without aspiration would let their core player retire; a team without aspiration, similarly, wouldn’t needlessly cling to their core character.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu understood this. While others were still discussing as to which Qi Master player Seaside would recruit to replace Zhao Yang, he was pondering as to how to obtain Seaside’s core character for Happy.</p>
<p>“Mm… what if other teams think the same thing and try to compete for it?” Chen Guo asked. Transferring accounts wasn’t as complex a process as transferring players, since there were no personal preferences involved. Accounts weren’t alive, the clubs could sell them wherever they wanted. So if there was competition, the price would just go up. This was therefore a difficult issue for Happy.</p>
<p>“Haha, think about it,” Ye Xiu laughed. “Among the current powerhouse teams, which ones have Qi Masters on their main roster?”</p>
<p>Chen Guo blinked. With this question, the first team that popped into her mind was actually Excellent Era.</p>
<p>Player Guo Yang, character Qi Breaker, a first-string member of Excellent Era. Chen Guo had been a fan of Excellent Era, so she was of course familiar with him. But then…</p>
<p>“Wind Howl and Blue Rain.” Ye Xiu answered for Chen Guo. “Last season, of the eight playoff teams, only these two teams had Qi Masters in their rosters. Wind Howl’s Qi Master was from Excellent Era, this wasn’t a class they originally had. He didn’t integrate well over the past season, he often couldn’t contribute much, so it’s more likely that Wind Howl would give up on their Qi Master. As for Blue Rain, their Qi Master Receding Tides is fairly strong, so they might want to buy some equipment that they don’t already have off Boundless Sea. But they probably wouldn’t directly incorporate Boundless Sea into their team, that sort of base level change isn’t their style.”</p>
<p>“So that’s to say, we don’t have any big competitors when it comes to Boundless Sea?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1127: Guan Rongfei’s Experiment</p>
<p>The news about the two All Stars meant that this day was fated to be no ordinary day. However, for many, business had to continue as usual. Today was the seventh and last day of the Ghost Parade.</p>
<p>Since luck was crucial in the Ghost Parade, everyone’s ranking fluctuated. However, due to the immense difference in the skill level between pro players and normal players, the effects of luck between the two were eliminated. The daily and overall rankings were dominated by pro players.</p>
<p>The last day.</p>
<p>On the overall rankings, Deception still held the first place. Those who managed to rank at the top of the overall rankings had great luck over all six days of the event. Out of over a hundred pro players, the only two who had continuous good luck was Mo Fan at first place and Zhang Jiale at second. As for the pro accounts after them, they had two or three days of bad luck, resulting in a large gap between their scores.</p>
<p>It seemed that the first place overall would be one of these two. However, the current situation had Zhang Jiale almost crying.</p>
<p>Second! Second again! He was second even in an online event; what kind of fate was this? Zhang Jiale was close to vomiting. Why did this world taunt him like this?</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale clenched his fist, sat in front of his computer and waiting for the last day of the event to start. But, something like luck couldn’t be changed just by being diligent!</p>
<p>At exactly seven PM, the event began. On the last day, the number of ghosts had reached an unprecedented peak, and the players were immediately thrown into anxious hurrying.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale wanted to get first place, so Tyrannical Ambition would naturally provide him with support. For example, from the very beginning, they had arranged for helpers around Dazzling Hundred Blossoms who would help him find ghosts.</p>
<p>With help, Zhang Jiale had gotten off to a good start. However, after that wave, the effects of his helpers had weakened, because they also relied on luck to find ghosts. Having more people didn’t mean having better luck. Though spreading out would increase their chances, as they spread out further and further, it became impossible for Dazzling Hundred Blossoms to run between them.</p>
<p>In the end, he still had to rely on himself. Zhang Jiale had Dazzling Hundred Blossoms dart about before slowly coming to a realization that he had been overtaken with bad luck.</p>
<p>His search for ghosts was extremely unsuccessful. Zhang Jiale could only hope that Deception was having an equally difficult time, but when he took a look at the ranking, Deception was still above him and had gained an even larger lead.</p>
<p>Apart from raising a monster, there was no other way to turn the tides.</p>
<p>Tyranny had a monster-feeding team, carefully and quietly preparing to raise one. They didn’t need it to be anything amazing, just enough to send Dazzling Hundred Blossoms to first place. However, the guilds all knew to be aware of this sort of thing, so it was very hard to hide one. In the end, Zhang Jiale received a message saying that their monster had been found and they had been forced to kill it. It was better than feeding it to their opponents.</p>
<p>There was nothing more he could do.</p>
<p>Looking at the rankings, Zhang Jiale sighed. His luck was really quite abysmal today. In the daily rankings, he hadn’t even managed to squeeze into the top five. On the other hand, Deception was sitting comfortably at third place, fortune still in his favor.</p>
<p>There was really no helping with something like luck.</p>
<p>The number of ghosts was continuously decreasing. After the easter egg had been triggered yesterday, the guilds all hoped they would get another chance. Thus, the competition for ghosts was even more intense. What mattered first and foremost wasn’t if they could find all the ghosts, but maintaining a spot in the top five, or else they wouldn’t even have a chance.</p>
<p>At ten that night, the number of ghosts fell to a two digit number and by then, the top five positions were stable already. Deception was still third, and everyone could tell that this was a guy whose luck had persisted for all seven days, much to their envy. Apart from him, the first, second, fourth and fifth were Blossoming Chaos, Angelica, Firebird Messenger, and Combat Form respectively.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos was Yu Feng and Angelica was Xu Bin, two All Star level players.</p>
<p>Firebird Messenger was Thunderclap’s Dai Yanqi, the runner up for Best Rookie of the eighth season, and an Elementalist like the one who had ended up with the award, Zhao Yuzhe.</p>
<p>As for Combat Form… this character had appeared in the top five for the first time, but had been noticed long ago by everyone. After all, the skill difference between normal players and pro players was very apparent. This person was definitely pro level.</p>
<p>Not many were familiar with this character, but everyone knew that this was a young man from the old Excellent Era called Qiu Fei.</p>
<p>Excellent Era had already fallen, so why was he still here?</p>
<p>No one would hold in this curiosity for a full seven days. They had gone to check when they first started wondering. It was then that they had found out that Excellent Era was still there.</p>
<p>Excellent Era had survived, but it no longer held any of its previous splendor. The new owner clearly didn’t have all that many funds, and the Excellent Era he had bought was basically just a skeleton. However, there were two very clear points to this. Of the original players of Excellent Era, he had managed to keep the young man called Qiu Fei as well as his Battle Mage Combat Form. In addition, he had managed to retain Excellent Dynasty.</p>
<p>This Excellent Era was clearly not a powerhouse anymore, but they didn’t seem to be nearly as weak as a grassroots team. Just what Excellent Dynasty could accomplish alone was impressive. The players remaining in Excellent Era were extremely united and loyal, especially after the dire situation they had gone through. They would work hard to bring Excellent Era back off the ground.</p>
<p>Maybe it wouldn’t be long before they would face Excellent Era on the battlefield again. That was what many people thought, but no one voiced it.</p>
<p>The number of ghosts continued to decrease at a slower and slower rate. In the past, pro players would have logged off by now. What little was remaining wouldn’t be able to do much to their score. However, now that they knew of the existence of the easter egg, the top five pro players would stay for longer, until the event ended.</p>
<p>By 11:23, the number of ghosts paused at three.</p>
<p>There was three left, thirty-seven minutes left! The top five had already started forming parties, yet as time ticked by, the number three never changed. Even until the end, when midnight struck and the event ended, the easter egg quest had never been triggered.</p>
<p>On the final overall rankings, Deception stood at first place, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms at second. However, the halo of second place clearly overpowered first place. This was because Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was Zhang Jiale, the guy who had gotten who knew how many second places. Although everyone knew that Zhang Jiale would be upset at this result, many people still came to lament over it. However, Zhang Jiale had already logged off by then.</p>
<p>Everyone had claimed their daily ranking prizes daily. The overall ranking prizes on the last day were, naturally, the best. The number one Deception had obtained three pieces of level 75 Orange equipment, fifteen rare materials, thirty Fuji Heaven Stones that could be used to repair the durability of level 75 weapons, a fifty point skill book, and a significant amount of gold.</p>
<p>The other characters also gained rewards proportional to their final rankings.</p>
<p>However, currently, at Team Happy, Ye Xiu didn’t have the time to spare for these rewards, because after sleeping a whole day, Guan Rongfei had finally come back. Ye Xiu hadn’t forgotten that this guy had said he needed to conduct an extremely important experiment.</p>
<p>“Have you gathered all the materials?” As expected, that was the first thing Guan Rongfei asked.</p>
<p>“Everything’s been prepared.” Ye Xiu followed him to the R&amp;D room. Guan Rongfei didn’t stop him. The others were curious but had the clarity of mind to not follow them inside, whispering to each other outside.</p>
<p>“What sort of experiment is it?” Seeing Guan Rongfei sit and turn on the laptop, Ye Xiu couldn’t help but ask this.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to create a bonus effect,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“What effect?” Ye Xiu was stunned. The effects on a piece of equipment would naturally determine what use the equipment had. In creating Silver weaponry, usually, the players themselves would ask for the effect they wanted and then the R&amp;D team would go about trying to create it. Of course, rookies probably wouldn’t have this sort of treatment and could only do their best to adapt to the current equipment and accounts in the club. However, Ye Xiu, no matter what, had the right to dictate what sort of equipment he had. Thus, the current situation was rather strange. Guan Rongfei was dead set on creating an effect, but Ye Xiu didn’t know what it was. None of the effects he had suggested before required so much.</p>
<p>Twenty-five pieces of rare materials!</p>
<p>“Lowering the level requirement.” Guan Rongfei didn’t bother to act mysterious and gave Ye Xiu the information he wanted.</p>
<p>“Lower the level requirement?” Ye Xiu naturally understood what this effect was, but, “Why would we want…”</p>
<p>“I’m going to upgrade the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella directly to level 80!” Before Ye Xiu finished his question, Guan Rongfei gave him his answer.</p>
<p>“Upgrade to level 80?” Ye Xiu was dumbstruck. Apart from someone like Guan Rongfei, very rarely did people manage to surprise him so.</p>
<p>Currently, characters only went up to level 75. If the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was upgraded to level 80, then it would be impossible to equip. Thus, it needed the effect of lowering the level requirement. This effect was rather common on usual equipment, but the pro circle had probably never looked into creating such an effect. This was because this was an effect used while still levelling up. For characters that were at max level, it was useless.</p>
<p>However, Guan Rongfei said that he could create level 80 equipment when the level limit was still 75. Then that effect would naturally be key.</p>
<p>“You’re crazy, how is that possible?” Ye Xiu was simply surprised, but he had no doubt that it was possible because he believed in Guan Rongfei’s ability. If the other brought it up, then there was a possibility.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for other equipment, but not for the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella,” Guan Rongfei said.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“This is something I’ve researched for a long time, but I haven’t managed to find a way to realize it on any piece of equipment. I’ve realized that what was preventing any breakthrough was the fact that there were too few materials used to make the equipment, so it doesn’t have the ability to create such a powerful effect. However, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, this extremely complex piece of equipment can’t be compared to normal equipment. After careful study of the materials, I believe that the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella can breakthrough to level 80. However, before that, I have to test out creating the effect of ‘lowering the level requirement by 5’ with level 75 materials.”</p>
<p>“Alright! Go ahead!” Ye Xiu handed over Lord Grim’s account card. Guan Rongfei logged in and went directly for the equipment editor. He was much more familiar with the operation of the equipment editor than Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“I’m going to start now.” After that last sentence, Guan Rongfei focused on operating the editor.</p>
<p>Chapter 1128: Former Teammate</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and Guan Rongfei shut themselves in the R&amp;D room. Although no one else went to watch, they were all very curious as to what the result would be. So, even though Ghost Parade had ended, everyone lingered in the training room.</p>
<p>After tossing around some random guesses without much success, everyone quickly started talking about what had happened today.</p>
<p>“Seeing him stirring up all that ruckus, I thought he wanted to try and get Fang Rui over here. But in the end, it turned out he was after Boundless Sea,” Chen Guo said, with a bit of resentment at Ye Xiu’s sneakiness.</p>
<p>“Boundless Sea? The Qi Master?” That caught Wei Chen’s attention, and he glanced over at Su Mucheng. After hearing Chen Guo speak, Su Mucheng also lifted her head, and it looked like there was something on her mind.</p>
<p>“Yeah! He said that the current strong teams wouldn’t be interested in Boundless Sea, so it’d be easier for us to compete.” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Is that the only reason?” Wei Chen smiled.</p>
<p>“Is it not?” Chen Guo was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you an Excellent Era fan in the past?” Wei Chen asked.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Chen Guo was thrown off by this seemingly unrelated question.</p>
<p>“A fan of Ye Qiu?” Wei Chen continued to ask.</p>
<p>“Um…” Chen Guo’s reply was vague. Now that she was familiar with Ye Xiu, if she admitted this, wouldn’t that boost his ego? Chen Guo didn’t want to make him even more arrogant! But she had no way of denying the reality of her past.</p>
<p>“Then when Excellent Era won three championships in a row, don’t you know who the partner standing by Ye Xiu’s side was?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Chen Guo had to think. In reality, by the time she had become a fan of Excellent Era, their dynasty had already ended. And the first player she had liked wasn’t Ye Xiu, but Su Mucheng. Her support for Ye Xiu and Excellent Era didn’t come until after she had become a fan of Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>Of course, as a fan of Excellent Era, she couldn’t completely forget about Excellent Era’s golden age of three championships. With Wei Chen’s reminder, she suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>When Excellent Era won three championships in a row, Team Excellent Era did not yet have Su Mucheng. They didn’t have Dancing Rain, nor did they have a Launcher.</p>
<p>However, One Autumn Leaf didn’t fight alone. In that era, standing by his side were his reliable teammates, and the one that was mentioned the most was a player named Wu Xuefeng. And this player’s class was Qi Master, account Qi Breaker.</p>
<p>All of this suddenly surfaced in Chen Guo’s mind.</p>
<p>One Autumn Leaf, Qi Breaker, the partnership that had dominated the Alliance for three years. Launcher? That only came after. The first character who had stood beside the Battle God was a Qi Master!</p>
<p>Wu Xuefeng retired after Excellent Era’s three championships. Chen Guo, who had only become a fan afterwards, had only heard mention of his name. But even just hearing about this was enough to get one fired up. Ye Xiu intended to get a Qi Master, and Chen Guo now felt the significance behind that.</p>
<p>“Is Wu Xuefeng returning?” Chen Guo was excited. The partnership that had swept the Alliance for three years, if it could be recreated, then how thrilling would that be? But Chen Guo had forgotten, the character that Ye Xiu now controlled was no longer the Battle Mage One Autumn Leaf.</p>
<p>“Him? Probably not!” As a first-generation player, Wei Chen of course knew Wu Xuefeng personally.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Not long after retiring, he went abroad. Never heard any news about him again,” said Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“Maybe Ye Xiu contacted him?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Even if he did, you shouldn’t be too excited. That guy’s even older than me! Otherwise why else would he retire? Although he was very lucky, he had Ye Xiu beside him. His slipping condition was completely hidden by Ye Xiu’s continual improvement. Damn, if I’d been in Excellent Era then, maybe I also could have stumbled upon three championships.” There was a trace of envy and indignance in Wei Chen’s words.</p>
<p>Chen Guo processed this information. She didn’t say anything at first, but instead searched up Wu Xuefeng’s name on the Internet. Chen Guo realized that she knew very little about this former Excellent Era player. When speaking of Excellent Era’s championship days, people generally only talked about Ye Xiu and his One Autumn Leaf, and Chen Guo was like everyone else, only paying attention to the Battle God.</p>
<p>There wasn’t too much information online about Wu Xuefeng. After all, the Alliance was still being established during that period and hadn’t reached the level of influence it had now. Back then, the Glory pro scene was very small. However, the development of the Glory Alliance was incredibly rapid, which was evident from the increasing amount of news from each season as the years progressed.</p>
<p>Season 3, another championship, establishing a dynasty, there was much discussion about these topics. But as for topics about Wu Xuefeng, Chen Guo didn’t see the respect given to a hero. More people discussed his luck, the luck of becoming Ye Xiu’s helper.</p>
<p>“If I’d been in Excellent Era, maybe I also could have stumbled upon three championships.”</p>
<p>Chen Guo discovered that Wei Chen’s statement just now was a popular sentiment back then. Even an ordinary player dared say this. This was a great compliment to Ye Xiu’s strength, but it was disrespectful toward Wu Xuefeng and the other members of Excellent Era. Sadly, Chen Guo searched for quite a while, but couldn’t find an honest and reliable analysis.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like that.” At this moment, Su Mucheng’s voice came from right next to her. Chen Guo turned her head, and saw that Su Mucheng was also looking at the archived news on the screen.</p>
<p>“Wu Xuefeng was an outstanding player,” Su Mucheng said. “Without him, Excellent Era wouldn’t have won its three championships.”</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu said this?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng nodded.</p>
<p>“Then would he come back?” Chen Guo asked, pointing at Wu Xuefeng’s name on her screen.</p>
<p>“Don’t know.” Su Mucheng shook her head.</p>
<p>No one knew. And the one who had the most direct interactions with Wu Xuefeng, aside from Ye Xiu, was of course Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“That guy…” After being asked, Wei Chen began to search through his memories. “He was truly a guy who relied on his brain and not his hands to fight matches. That might be the reason why he maintained his condition better than I did, even though he was clearly older than me!” Wei Chen gave his serious opinion, which showed that his “if I’d been in Excellent Era” statement was just his automatic trash talk. He didn’t disregard Wu Xuefeng’s personal contributions to Excellent Era’s success.</p>
<p>“He used his brain?”</p>
<p>“Experience. Awareness. Accurate judgment. Precise technique,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“Then why did he retire?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“Please, his condition was only a little better than mine! His age was hanging right there. To be able to play those three years was already his limit,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>After he said that, Wei Chen crouched in front of the computer. “There should still be some old match videos of him online!”</p>
<p>There really weren’t many recordings from matches that had occurred years and years ago. But Excellent Era was at the peak back then, so their matches were more likely to be recorded and thus comparably easier to find now. Wei Chen soon found one, and Chen Guo realized that it was actually a video she had watched before. But just looking at the title of the video, it was obvious that this video wasn’t saved to remember Wu Xuefeng.</p>
<p>Ye Qiu, One Autumn Leaf. It seemed as though the Excellent Era of that time period had left behind only these two names. And Chen Guo had been the same, only paying attention to the Battle God’s playing and completely forgetting about the Battle God’s teammates. Was there some stand-out performance in this match? Chen Guo had no recollection.</p>
<p>The video quickly began playing. Although the quality wasn’t very good, Chen Guo still immediately found One Autumn Leaf. But what about Wu Xuefeng’s Qi Breaker?</p>
<p>“Hm, seems like he’s not in view right now…” Wei Chen said, regretful.</p>
<p>Soon, the two teams in the video began launching attacks. Excellent Era’s opponent in this match was a team formerly at the summit, Royal Style.</p>
<p>Peaceful Hermit!</p>
<p>Chen Guo quickly discovered another God-level character. The scythe in his hand flashed with the light and fire of vanquishing demons. A Spirit Guidance was used, and a twisting arc flew into the midst of Excellent Era’s formation.</p>
<p>Open battle!</p>
<p>Chen Guo became entirely engrossed in the God-level faceoff between One Autumn Leaf and Peaceful Hermit, until Wei Chen suddenly pointed at the screen and shouted, “He appeared! Right there!”</p>
<p>“Ah?” Chen Guo shook herself as though awakening from a dream, and remembered why she was watching this video in the first place.</p>
<p>Qi Breaker finally appeared on screen. He was currently moving around constantly, his body occasionally vanishing from view. Because the video was entirely focused on Ye Xiu and One Autumn Leaf, the camera didn’t move to follow anyone else.</p>
<p>“How sneaky!” This was Wei Chen’s appraisal of Qi Breaker’s changing position.</p>
<p>“Did he also play dirty?” asked Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Not exactly.” said Wei Chen. “His playstyle was whatever suited the situation best.”</p>
<p>The screen still showed the fight between One Autumn Leaf and Peaceful Hermit. But suddenly, Peaceful Hermit flew horizontally, out of view.</p>
<p>The camera immediately swiveled to follow, and so Chen Guo saw that Qi Breaker had used a Cloud Grasping Fist to abruptly pull Peaceful Hermit away from the middle of his fierce battle with One Autumn Leaf.</p>
<p>“Fuck, what a pig of a teammate!!!” A scrolling comment** suddenly appeared onscreen.</p>
<p>“He interrupted One Autumn Leaf’s attack rhythm, how overbearing!”</p>
<p>“His brain must be underwater.”</p>
<p>Before the fourth comment could appear, Wei Chen turned off the scrolling comments. “A bunch of idiots,” he scoffed. “Just now, if Qi Breaker hadn’t pulled Peaceful Hermit away, One Autumn Leaf would have been in trouble. Did you see it?”</p>
<p>Chen Guo felt her face redden, because she hadn’t seen anything at all. In that moment, her thought process reflected the sentiments of the scrolling comments. She also thought that Qi Breaker’s sudden Cloud Grasping Fist had interrupted Ye Xiu’s rhythm. If you wanted to coordinate then just directly attack, why pull Peaceful Hermit out of One Autumn Leaf’s attack range?</p>
<p>“So you see, he always appeared when he was most needed. Truly a reliable helper.” Wei Chen continued to give his analysis.</p>
<p>“To get Boundless Sea, I think… Wu Xuefeng wouldn’t come back, Ye Xiu’s probably thinking of finding another helper!” said Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“Oh, then who?” Chen Guo asked. Ye Xiu must have given some thought as to who to ask!</p>
<p>As she was thinking, she suddenly heard two loud shouts from the R&amp;D room.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Neither Ye Xiu nor Guan Rongfei were the type to lose control easily. What happened? Everyone immediately crowded around to look.</p>
<p>In the R&amp;D room, Ye Xiu and Guan Rongfei were staring at the computer screen, wordless.</p>
<p>On the screen, Lord Grim’s Myriad Manifestation Umbrella was flashing through its various forms, but the lowest line on its list of stats didn’t change.</p>
<p>Equipment Required Level -4…</p>
<p>Chapter 1129: Many Monks But Not Much Gruel</p>
<p>Glory equipment was separated every 5 levels. Characters weren’t though, so lowering the equipment required level didn’t necessarily have to be by 5. From the effect bonuses on current equipment, lowering the equipment required level between 1 to 5 levels was possible.</p>
<p>But Guan Rongfei was upgrading the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. Apart from lowering the equipment required level by 5, any other effect was useless. It meant that this upgrade was a failure.</p>
<p>“What exactly went wrong?” Guan Rongfei muttered to himself. He had checked all of the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella’s forms. Every single form had this effect, and all of them lowered the equipment required level by 4.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Guo and the others had gathered here, asking what had happened.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu explained. No one cared about the experiment’s failure. All of them were shocked. Level 75 was the level cap, but Guan Rongfei had wanted to produce a Level 80 equipment. What sort of imagination did this guy have?</p>
<p>“Look at my Death’s Hand!” This was the first thing Wei Chen said after recovering from his shock.</p>
<p>“No. Apart from the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, it isn’t possible.” Guan Rongfei shook his head. He didn’t seem to care about the discussion that everyone else was having. He had already buried his head back into research again.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and everyone else quietly left the room. After regaining their composure, they began expressing their regret towards this failed experiment.</p>
<p>“The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella isn’t ruined, is it?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Ye Xiu said. It could be considered as a fortune among misfortune. The experiment failed, but the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella’s intrinsic functions hadn’t been ruined. There was just an extra useless effect.</p>
<p>“How reckless! Why’d you directly start with the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella? Experiment with other equipment first before trying to do something like lower the required level!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“That step had been completed long ago. The current focus is to get all of the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella’s forms to have this stat. This step has been completed too actually. It’s just that a problem occurred with the stat effect itself.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Then it’ll definitely be possible at Level 80?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“This… before we can ascertain that we can get this stat bonus, it’s not convenient to test. If not, if we get it to Level 80 but there was only a reduction of 4 levels, how am I supposed to use it?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>The experiment had failed.</p>
<p>When Ye Xiu and Guan Rongfei saw that the equipment required level had only been lowered by 5, they also felt grieved and frustrated. But the two quickly regained their calm. After all, there were many positives gained from this failure.</p>
<p>They couldn’t help with this matter, so they quickly shifted the topic to the Qi Master.</p>
<p>“Wu Xuefeng? We haven’t stayed in touch after he retired. I don’t know!” Ye Xiu dispelled Chen Guo’s guess. Sure enough, he had no intentions of looking for this old general to return.</p>
<p>“Then after we get Boundless Sea, who are we going to find to use it?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“We have to choose very carefully. Do you guys have any suggestions?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>Chen Guo coughed blood: “Don’t you already have an idea?”</p>
<p>“Did I say that?” Ye Xiu was puzzled.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make things up!” Ye Xiu said to Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Let’s analyze the current Qi Masters in the pro scene.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chen Guo understood. This transfer would be a transfer starting from scratch, from character to player.</p>
<p>“We have to get Boundless Sea first though.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What if we get Boundless Sea but can’t find anyone?” Chen Guo couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t happen.” Ye Xiu said, “An All Star character should be very attractive to pro players. Seeing the current circumstances in the pro scene, I don’t think it will be too difficult to snatch an outstanding Qi Master player.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by circumstances?” Chen Guo didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Many monks but not much gruel.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chen Guo stared blankly. She didn’t continue asking about it. She was also trying to consciously train herself to be a better boss.</p>
<p>Many monks but not much gruel?</p>
<p>Chen Guo pondered over this phrase. Soon, she started to understand what Ye Xiu meant.</p>
<p>Among last season’s top eight teams, there were only two Qi Masters. What’s more, Team Wind Howl’s Guo Yang wasn’t in an important position on the team either. In the playoffs, the only active Qi Master was Team Blue Rain’s Song Xiao.</p>
<p>Getting into the playoffs and fighting for the championship title was the dream of every pro player. But for Qi Masters, the current circumstances weren’t good for them. Including the retiring All Star, Zhao Yang, the Qi Masters were on weak teams without any hopes for the playoffs. And in the powerhouses, none of them had any open positions for Qi Masters.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang had been fighting with Seaside for seven years. Admittedly, a part of that was because of his stubbornness, but a part of that was also because he didn’t have many good choices.</p>
<p>This was the current situation for all Qi Masters. Even if they were outstanding players, they were being held back by weak teams. They may want to join a top team, but the top teams didn’t have Qi Masters, so there was no opening for them.</p>
<p>Most pro players might not look too highly upon a new team like Team Happy, who lacked resources. However, Qi Masters didn’t have any better choices. And perhaps Happy might truly have a bright future.</p>
<p>Thinking of all of this, Chen Guo felt like she had improved greatly. She at least understood that transfers weren’t like buying vegetables at the supermarket. It was a lot more complex than that.</p>
<p>Three days later, while everyone was still focused on Fang Rui, the All Star character Boundless Sea was bought by Team Happy for 5.5 million. Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>They weren’t surprised that Happy could take out this sum of money. After all, winning the Challenger League earned them a good amount of money. A price of 5.5 million was relatively cheap for an All Star character, but when considering the current circumstances for Qi Masters as well as Team Seaside’s current situation, it was a reasonable price.</p>
<p>After Zhao Yang retired, news related to Team Seaside quickly came out.</p>
<p>Fans would always be proud because of their All Star player or character in their team, but they would never think that sometimes their All Stars would be the burden of their team.</p>
<p>Team Seaside was in this situation. They were a small team. Whether it was a contract for an All Star player or creating an All Star character, it was a huge investment for them. And ever since their start in season three, they had always been doing their utmost to keep up this investment.</p>
<p>They had once been proud because of their All Star player and character, but they gradually realized that as they maintained this pride, the growth of the team became more and more unbalanced. A single skilled player and character wasn’t enough to help them win more. When they tried improving their other players and characters, they discovered that because of Zhao Yang and Boundless Sea, they no longer had the resources to invest in anything else.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Team Seaside was a small team with a big team’s mindset. They had insisted on this unsuitable management style for seven years. They had hesitated and paced back and forth. It wasn’t until this summer, when a new manager took office in Team Seaside, was a decision finally made. Seaside had decided to free themselves of this burden and take the path that a small team should be taking.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang had been let go, so he decisively chose to retire.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea had been sold. Seaside had invested too much into this character, and they didn’t plan on continuing. If they weren’t going to continue investing into Boundless Sea, there wasn’t much point in keeping it. It would be better to sell it to strengthen the rest of the team.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang’s retirement, Boundless Sea’s sale. Behind those were changes to Team Seaside’s management. Ye Xiu didn’t know about all of this, but he had at least gotten a general sense of Seaside’s position from Zhao Yang’s retirement. As a result, he immediately acted and happily took in Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>Seaside obviously wanted to sell Boundless Sea for the highest price possible. However, the top teams in the Alliance weren’t interested in a Qi Master, and the small teams were uncertain. The unwavering Happy suddenly stood above the crowd. After some negotiation, an agreement was quickly reached.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea transferred to Happy!</p>
<p>As soon as Happy acted, they grabbed an All Star character. For fans, it was very exciting news. But soon afterwards, doubts about Happy’s management style sprouted up, questioning whether Happy would become the next Seaside.</p>
<p>Two All Stars and a bunch of characters to upgrade. Happy was a grassroots team. Their burden had been very heavy to begin with. Even so, in this situation, Happy actually bought an All Star character. Did they have the resources to maintain such a top-tier character? Would Team Happy become like Team Seaside? Would they become a grassroots team that walked the path of a powerhouse until their demise?</p>
<p>However, the day after Boundless Sea joined Happy, Happy announced that Boundless Sea’s Silver weapon, Mirror Moon, had been upgraded to Level 75.</p>
<p>Everyone was once again shocked!</p>
<p>Team Seaside hadn’t been able to do it after half a season, yet Happy had done it in just a single day.</p>
<p>The people doubting Happy clearly hadn’t done a thorough investigation. For example, the club guild leaders definitely wouldn’t have given such naive evaluations because no one knew better than them that even though Happy’s resources as a whole were certainly lacking, in terms of high-end resources like materials, Happy was quite rich. Ever since the Level 75 update, Happy had obtained the most wild bosses among the guilds.</p>
<p>Happy’s situation was completely different from Seaside’s. It could even be said that taking this path to the peak was the most suitable for them. Boundless Sea allowed Happy to avoid the initial stages of character creation, which was exactly where their deficiencies lay. On the other hand, directly upgrading a good character to the top was exactly where their resources lay.</p>
<p>However, upgrading a Level 70 Silver weapon to Level 75 in a single day wasn’t just an issue of ample resources. It seemed like Team Happy had someone very capable at creating Silver equipment.</p>
<p>Was it Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>Just when everyone made this guess, another report came out. Excellent Era’s R&amp;D God had been taken in by Happy after Excellent Era disbanded.</p>
<p>Everything was clear now.</p>
<p>Excellent Era’s R&amp;D team was obviously very proficient with Qi Master equipment. Qi Masters had been a part of their main roster. At Happy, Boundless Sea seemed to be blessed by the heavens. The only thing the character lacked was an outstanding player. Suddenly, the entire Glory scene started helping Happy look for a Qi Master.</p>
<p>Chapter 1130: Candidates</p>
<p>“DId he decline?” Su Mucheng asked, after seeing Ye Xiu sigh and close his QQ chat window.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Ye Xiu nodded his head. His tone was filled with regret.</p>
<p>Among the current Qi Master pros, the first person Ye Xiu looked for was Guo Yang, who was originally part of Excellent Era. After Excellent Era had been relegated from the Alliance, Guo Yang had joined Team Wind Howl.</p>
<p>There was no need to question the skill of a player that had been part of Excellent Era’s main roster. Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng used to be his teammates. They already had good synergy with each other, so Guo Yang would have a much easier time assimilating into Happy compared to any other candidate. As a result, even though Chen Guo wasn’t too pleased with it, she had to admit that in theory, Guo Yang was their best choice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Guo Yang very resolutely declined Ye Xiu’s invitation. Compared to Happy, he looked more favorably upon Wind Howl’s future. Although he wasn’t in an important position at Wind Howl right now, Fang Rui’s departure had been confirmed. When his old Excellent Era teammate Liu Hao joined the team, Guo Yang felt like the day he had been waiting for had finally come.</p>
<p>“Happy? No thanks!” Guo Yang wasn’t interested in Ye Xiu’s invitation. Even though Boundless Sea was certainly very enticing, Guo Yang felt like that alone wasn’t enough to convince him. He had once been part of a powerhouse. The character that he had used previously, Qi Breaker, had been top-tier too, so his standards and ambitions were high. He didn’t just want a good character. He wanted a team of powerful teammates and a team of powerful characters. Wind Howl suited him. As for Happy, he didn’t feel like he needed to run away to a new team. So what if you had Boundless Sea? I’m not some small fry who hasn’t seen the world.</p>
<p>“Why not try Song Xiao?” Guo Yang said to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu could only close his chat window after seeing this recommendation. He could obviously tell that Guo Yang was being sarcastic. Song Xiao’s position in Team Blue Rain was solid. He had a powerful character and his future at Team Blue Rain was bright. There was no reason for him to try out Team Happy. As a result, Ye Xiu hadn’t put Song Xiao as a candidate.</p>
<p>But with this recommendation, it was clear that Guo Yang felt like his situation was the same as Song Xiao’s. To him, Happy was being delusional asking him to join. Thus, there was nothing more to say. Wind Howl had made it to last season’s semifinals. Their momentum was going strong. Transferring from this type of team to a new team didn’t make any sense. Ye Xiu had thought that he had a chance because Guo Yang didn’t have too important of a position in Wind Howl, but Guo Yang seemed to be optimistic about his future at Wind Howl, so there was no point wasting any more time with him.</p>
<p>Zhao Yang had retired. Song Xiao wasn’t an option. Guo Yang had confidently declined. There were only three more Qi Masters in the Alliance: Team Heavenly Sword’s Ning Yuan, Team Parade’s Zhao Bin, Team Radiant’s Sun Haowen.</p>
<p>These three guilds had superb relationships with Happy in the game. However, the team was an entirely different matter. Team Heavenly Swords was an exception. Lou Guanning was very kind to them. If they really asked Heavenly Swords for a trade, it wouldn’t be too difficult, relatively speaking. But the problem was that Team Heavenly Swords was a team made up of friends. Lou Guanning’s group of friends firmly occupied their spots on the main roster. Even if Zhou Zekai, Huang Shaotian, Wang Jiexi, etc. came to Team Heavenly Swords, the only spot for them would be as the sixth player.</p>
<p>As for Ning Yuan? Ye Xiu had no idea where Lou Guanning found him. He had most likely been invited to meet the minimum requirements to form a team. An entire season had passed, and he had never appeared on stage. Unless Lou Guanning’s friend group had all their hands broken, he would probably never go on stage. If Happy actually asked, Ye Xiu reckoned that Lou Guanning would probably just gift him to them. Lou Guanning didn’t care. After all, the chances of all five friends breaking their hands were very low.</p>
<p>How could Happy dare to use this type of player though? This person was a substitute with no future at Team Heavenly Swords, yet this person was still calm and composed. It looked like he knew very well that he was just there as a stopgap. He didn’t have any excessive thoughts. Just from this middling ambition alone, no one would want to place their team’s hopes on him.</p>
<p>Team Parade’s Zhao Bin and Team Radiant’s Sun Haowen were from bottom-tier to middle-tier teams. It was hard not to overlook them. These two didn’t have anything that would make people’s eyes light up. They were still better choices than Ning Yuan though.</p>
<p>However, if Happy wanted to be the champions, getting a player “better than Ning Yuan” was far from enough!</p>
<p>Chen Guo looked at Ye Xiu. She didn’t know what other plans he had. Going from their theory of many monks but not much gruel, the outstanding Qi Master players were probably buried by others. But from the looks of it, they were buried so deeply that there weren’t any suitable candidates in the pro scene. Maybe the outstanding Qi Masters were buried in the game because no team needed them?</p>
<p>Or there was an outstanding seedling at some club’s training camp?</p>
<p>Like Excellent Era?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu should be very familiar with Excellent Era’s training camp. Excellent Era had a Qi Master as part of the main roster, so if an outstanding Qi Master seedling was found, it was very likely for Excellent Era to keep him or her. Excellent Era may have disbanded, but it wasn’t like these outstanding seedlings disappeared. This should be another possible solution.</p>
<p>Chen Guo trusted that Ye Xiu hadn’t just started coming up with plans after buying Boundless Sea. When he decided to get Boundless Sea, he probably had ideas in mind. Guo Yang was their first choice. He had declined unfortunately, but it wasn’t likely that Ye Xiu put all his eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>What next? Chen Guo didn’t ask. She quietly walked to Ye Xiu’s side. Chen Guo was able to maintain her composure better than in the past. She wouldn’t panic before she got a clear understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was scrolling through his QQ friends list, but after scrolling for awhile, Chen Guo was finally starting to get nervous.</p>
<p>No way… we’ve reached a dead end? There are no more choices?</p>
<p>Just when she was worrying, she saw Ye Xiu turn his head to the side and ask Su Mucheng: “Do you have Song Xiao as a friend?”</p>
<p>“Song Xiao? Isn’t he pretty unlikely?” Su Mucheng said. Cheng Guo was dumbstruck. Hadn’t they already crossed out Song Xiao as a candidate? Did Ye Xiu have a way?</p>
<p>Even though Su Mucheng was puzzled, she still told Ye Xiu: “I don’t have him, but he’s in the chat group.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.” Ye Xiu mumbled. He found Team Blue Rain’s Receding Tides in the pro player chat group and messaged him, but he didn’t get any response back. Then, Chen Guo saw as Ye Xiu scrolled through his friends list and found Troubling Rain.</p>
<p>Huang Shaotian. Song Xiao’s teammate in Team Blue Rain.</p>
<p>Chen Guo was feeling dizzy. Then, she saw Ye Xiu type: “Is Song Xiao there? Have him check his QQ.”</p>
<p>“Song Xiao? Why are you looking for him? If you’re looking for him, why are you asking me? Fuck! No way! What are you doing? What do you want? Are you trying to get Song Xiao to join? Are you drunk? Why would Song Xiao be interested. You should ask Guo Yang. You guys know each other. He’s at Wind Howl, and he’s not doing too well either.” Huang Shaotian replied promptly. Chatting with him was very fast-paced. As for whether asking him would save time, only a wise man knew. For example, take his recommendation. Let alone Ye Xiu already trying, in reality, the pro circle had already discussed it and felt like Guo Yang was very suitable for Happy.</p>
<p>“Let’s cut the nonsense. Is he there?” Ye Xiu didn’t act like someone asking for a favor.</p>
<p>“Tch, it looks like you’re dead set on him. Hold on.” Huang Shaotian typed. Not long afterwards, he sent Ye Xiu an invite. He had formed a group and added Song Xiao into it. However, he was also there, watching on the side.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu cut to the chase and happily stated: “What do you think, Song Xiao? Are you interested in coming over and becoming a champion with us?”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, champion? This probably isn’t even your biggest selling point, right? Song Xiao, keep listening.” Huang Shaotian said.</p>
<p>“Happy has a great environment. It’s very quiet.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Fuck off Fuck off Fuck off!” Huang Shaotian spoke first.</p>
<p>“Haha, I was almost tempted!” This time, Song Xiao replied too. Of course, “I was almost tempted” meant he hadn’t been tempted. It was another rejection. His words still stabbed at Huang Shaotian’s heart though. Huang Shaotian was quiet at the moment. Ye Xiu was wondering whether those two were fighting right now.</p>
<p>Of course, Ye Xiu hadn’t looked for Song Xiao for fun. He had wanted to give it a try. The discussion in the chat group wasn’t a very serious one. In reality, in his private chat window with Song Xiao, he was still trying to persuade him.</p>
<p>“Think of Happy’s chances of winning the championships. Maybe you’ll feel interested afterwards.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>In terms of pure resources, Happy indeed couldn’t compete with Blue Rain. But what they did have was the possibility of shocking the world. Maybe he was the type who sought novelties and was willing to give it a try?</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m kinda looking forward to it, but I still think Team Blue Rain has better chances!” Reality proved that Song Xiao was rather practical and wise. He didn’t seek novelties.</p>
<p>“You’re not interested in creating history?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“History?”</p>
<p>“Just think, a new team winning the championships! Wouldn’t that be exciting?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Uh, I think I’ll pass!”</p>
<p>“Young people have no drive these days! They’re so depressing!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling quite good where I’m at, really…” Song Xiao said.</p>
<p>“Think about it carefully. If you’re interested, contact me any time.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Honestly, there’s a tiny part of me that’s tempted, but I’m still more afraid that I’ll regret it.” Song Xiao was a nice person. He didn’t hide his real thoughts, but because he made it clear, he didn’t drag on his refusal. He was a person who was confident in his decisions.</p>
<p>“What a pity…” Ye Xiu expressed his regret, but he didn’t pursue it any further.</p>
<p>“Another refusal.” Ye Xiu shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>“That shouldn’t be surprising though, no?” Chen Guo said. She had to admit that when Ye Xiu talked about the possibility of creating history, she thought it might have been possible. Words like that were truly moving.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Ye Xiu said. His mindset had been that he might as well try.</p>
<p>“What now?” Chen Guo finally asked.</p>
<p>“Hm….” Ye Xiu replied. He clicked on the chat group that he hadn’t closed yet and clicked on someone.</p>
<p>“Dirty Fang, have you ever thought about changing classes? What do you think about Qi Masters? There’s one waiting just for you!” Ye Xiu typed into the new chat window.</p>
<p>Chapter 1131: Persuasion</p>
<p>“Are you joking?” Fang Rui was also online, so he quickly replied back to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“I’m not joking. I’m serious. Think about it.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Change my class?”</p>
<p>“Yup!”</p>
<p>“Qi Master?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You’re not joking?”</p>
<p>“Of course not!”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Fang Rui sent about 20 emojis to express his confusion and bafflement. It wasn’t like no pro had never changed classes before. Quite a few pros had even made breakthroughs after changing classes. However, Fang Rui was an All Star, who had already proven his abilities. He didn’t need to make some kind of breakthrough. In fact, he would bear greater risks if he changed his class. The risk would be for both himself and the team he joined, so Fang Rui could only interpret this as a joke from Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“You’re not that unfamiliar with Qi Masters, right?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t be unfamiliar with any of the classes!” Fang Rui said. Indeed, this was because they had to know themselves and their enemies well. As a pro player, he couldn’t be unfamiliar with any of the 24 classes. In fact, one could say that a pro player could choose a random class and still be more skilled than a normal player. In the eyes of a normal player, every one of the pros was proficient at every class. Of course, Ye Xiu was a grandmaster at an even higher level, who no one else in the league could compare with. That was how he had earned the title “Glory Textbook”.</p>
<p>Not being unfamiliar with any class was definitely not a reason for one to change classes.</p>
<p>“You’re different. I remember when you started off at Blue Rain’s training camp, you were a Qi Master, no?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Damn, you even know that?” Fang Rui was shocked.</p>
<p>“Excellent Era always paid a considerable amount of attention toward Qi Masters.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“I know. I saw a lot of comments that said if you had managed to recruit Zhao Yang, the rookie who joined season three, things might have turned out differently in season four.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Of course, but our monopolization would have destroyed the greatest charm of competition – suspense. In order to let the Glory League develop further, we could only restrain ourselves a little and not upgrade our potential to the limit. What a pity.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Fuck fuck fuck. Are you serious?” Fang Rui was astonished.</p>
<p>“You’re so easy to trick! And you call yourself the master of playing dirty? Looks like I’ll have to reconsider if Happy should offer you a position,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui sent two lines of speechless emojis before replying: “Hurry and reconsider then, stop bothering me…”</p>
<p>“Seems like you have a lot of faith in your future?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“It’s alright…” Fang Rui wasn’t being arrogant. After he confirmed he would be transferring, all sorts of analysis flooded his way. Fang Rui’s transferring options seemed numerous. Every strong team in the league, apart from Wind Howl who didn’t want him, could offer him a position.</p>
<p>“You want to go to Samsara to form a five All Stars galacticos?” Ye Xiu asked. That would be the most amusing possibility. After Samsara took in Sun Xiang and One Autumn Leaf, they had four All Star players who were all capable of playing at the frontlines. If they could take in Fang Rui and Doubtful Demon, then the team would have been extravagant enough to make one suffocate. As a team who had the ambition of starting another dynasty, everyone was wondering if Samsara would be so tyrannical.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Samsara can’t endlessly, no? It’s very difficult to support five All Star players. On top of that, Zhou Zekai’s contract would be due next summer, so Samsara would pay any price to keep him. Would you compete with Zhou Zekai?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare.” Fang Rui appeared to be calm, this was because Samsara had already expressed that they weren’t interested in him. He liked how amusing a five All Star player team would be. Plus, they were a champion team. If he could get in, then it would have definitely been his top choice. Unfortunately, Samsara’s response was very straightforward, which might be because of what Ye Xiu had analyzed.</p>
<p>“Team Tyranny has your old partner, Old Lin, and those few are not far from retiring, which would stabilize your position in the future. It seems like a good choice!” Ye Xiu said, but continued. “But even if your position is stable, without those old guys, who would be around you? Would Tyranny still have the ability to compete for the championship title? They are currently gambling with all they have, but their future isn’t clear.”</p>
<p>Fang Rui didn’t rebut, because this was indeed what Tyranny was criticized for the most. Their aging problem was fatal. They lacked an structure that could help them stably transition. Once the few old players retired, then they would have to re-establish themselves. The risks were fairly great because it was possible for the team to not recover from the fall. Ye Xiu was only stating a possibility when he said Fang Rui might have a stable position after the old players retired. It was obvious that Fang Rui would be thinking deeper for his future. He considered that when Tyranny needed to reconstruct themselves from ground zero, they might not need him anymore. Then, he would be stuck in choosing where to transfer to again.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a good thing for players to constantly drift around if they aimed for something great. Although there was the saying that if a tree moves, it dies, while if people move, they grow. However, those who move constantly are nomadic, which sounded depressing.</p>
<p>“Moving onto Tiny Herb. After underwent the large adjustments last summer, their player lineup is quite good and they’re getting along very well. If they add a new member, they would have to readjust their strategies. I think they would be hesitant to recruit you.”</p>
<p>“Then we have Blue Rain. Their ace is stable and their rookie has a bright future, but the departure of a player like Yu Feng also made a clear impact on them. Blue Rain indeed needs a strong player, and it can’t be replenished by some new rookie. Unfortunately, this person can’t be you. Blue Rain’s tactic is giving Huang Shaotian enough freedom. If they add someone dirty like you, by the time the team matches start, two out of five players would disappear. That would leave them with a healer, a handicapped player, and someone random. Unless Team Blue Rain are masochists, they probably won’t consider recruiting you.”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu finished analyzing the four teams which were undoubtedly, the current mainstream powerhouses. In many people’s eyes, the other top eight teams like Misty Rain, Void, and Hundred Blossoms from last season were still a step lower. Wind Howl was currently shifting away from this group, but this was the team that Fang Rui was leaving from.</p>
<p>After Ye Xiu finished his analysis, Fang Rui stayed silent for a long time. A few days had passed since he made his mind to transfer. The conditions Ye Xiu had analyzed were proven in reality. Samsara firmly refused. Fang Rui was personally hesitant with Tyranny, while on the other hand, Tiny Herb was the side who expressed their hesitation. As for Blue Rain, they had a discussion with Wind Howl but gave a vague reply. Apparently, they were contacting another team so they could bring together a large-scale transfer which involved a few other teams. It seemed that Blue Rain wasn’t interested in Fang Rui, but wanted to use the marketing effect of Fang Rui’s transfer to gain what they needed. No wonder that team revolved around opportunism. They even acted that way in a transfer.</p>
<p>“From what I see now, teams that are not top tier would be a better choice. Team Misty Rain’s tactics are pretty unusual. They have long-ranged classes as their main forces, while also relying on skills to weave around to create chaos. Li Hua is currently taking this responsibility. I think you’d be a good candidate because you’d provide more variations and options for them. Moving onto Void, I think Li Xuan mentioned that they needed more shamelessness in Weibo? He wasn’t entirely joking, the Ghostblade Duo need another capable helper. Then there’s Hundred Blossoms, they are remaking their old path, but they also have a new style. If you join them, you might give them new ideas and help them make a breakthrough. These three were the top eight teams from last season, but apart from them, there is another team that I strongly recommend.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“It’s Happy, right?” Fang Rui thought about Ye Xiu’s shamelessness.</p>
<p>“Nope, it’s Thunderclap.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Thunderclap?” Fang Rui was surprised.</p>
<p>“That’s right, with Xiao Shiqin there, you won’t have to worry about not being able to develop your skills. He is someone who can use his tactics to maximize everyone’s abilities. Especially with his year in Excellent Era, he improved a lot. Thunderclap currently seems to be no different from before, but I am optimistic about their future.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What… you’re not going to mention Happy?” Fang Rui was confused.</p>
<p>“What? You’re interested? See, I knew you would be interested in Happy the most, right?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Interested my ass!” Fang Rui’s words were rather disrespectful towards the team, but it was obvious that he was extremely annoyed.</p>
<p>“Firstly, Happy will let you show off your rich experience in changing classes.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Fuck off, who are you saying is experienced in changing classes?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“You started off as a Qi Master, then Wind Howl recruited you. They originally wanted to train you as a Brawler to succeed Old Lin, but for some reason, you ended up changing into a Thief to partner with him. You’ve changed classes three times, and you’re telling me you are not experienced?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t count!” Fang Rui yelled. The experience Ye Xiu mentioned was true, but the problem was that he was in the training camp at the time. For a player, the training camp was like a school where everything wasn’t set in stone yet, so it was natural for him to make changes. However, when he became an official pro player, he had stayed as a Thief. Fang Rui was only testing out what his best options were when he changed classes at the training camp. It was only when one’s class was set and then changed, could it be counted as “changing classes”.</p>
<p>“Frankly speaking, Happy is not as weak as you think. Our goal is not low-key at all – we are aiming to be champions! Look at our formation: there’s Su Mucheng and me. With your addition, wouldn’t we have three All Stars at the frontlines?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“What about the others?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“The rookies are all rising stars. All the big teams kneeled and begged for us to sell them, but they were kicked away.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Yeah right!” Fang Rui spoke with disdain, but knew that this wasn’t a baseless claim. Many teams thought highly of Happy’s Tang Rou, but apparently this girl wasn’t interested in any other team. A team even threw out a large contract that contained the price completely unfit for a rookie, but she denied the offer without even taking a look.</p>
<p>“I’m not bragging. Even though Happy currently has weak characters, we are gradually improving. As long as we get through the early stages smoothly, we will gain an advantage in our high-end upgrades. We proved this by upgrading Boundless Sea’s weapon to Level 75 within a day!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1132: Change Classes and Synchronize Your Rhythm to Our Growth!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and Fang Rui casually discussed. Although it was impossible to know what Fang Rui was thinking, Chen Guo, standing beside Ye Xiu, had been petrified for a while now. It was only after Ye Xiu made this statement, and Fang Rui didn’t reply for a while, did she finally come back to her senses.</p>
<p>“What’s this all about? Fang Rui?” Chen Guo immediately asked. “Didn’t you say earlier that getting Fang Rui would be impossible?”</p>
<p>“Fang Rui as a Thief would be impossible, but if he changed classes to Qi Master, that could be possible,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Why?” Chen Guo didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Because Thieves are more expensive than Qi Masters,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“That’s it?” Chen Guo was slightly confused. Happy obtained Boundless Sea for 5.5 million, which was an extremely low price for an All Star account. But Doubtful Demon hadn’t fallen that far in status, its price would likely be at least 10 million – the difference was obviously large. But aside from this, Fang Rui’s transfer fee and salary would put great pressure on Happy. They would definitely need to use some of Wei Chen’s 18 million.</p>
<p>“Don’t think so much for now. Right now, the important thing is to convince him.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Fang Rui switching classes to Qi Master, can he actually do it?” asked Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hundred percent sure either. But Guo Yang and Song Xiao both rejected us, so we have to go for the next best thing and take a slightly riskier route,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Aside from Fang Rui, what are our other risky options?” asked Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Those who don’t fit us very well, or who aren’t as skilled, would be our other riskier options,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“He replied!” The chat window suddenly flashed with a notification, and Chen Guo immediately pointed it out.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu took a look. Fang Rui had typed two words: Go on.</p>
<p>“Dirty!” Ye Xiu first sent this contemptuous reply. This guy didn’t bother with engaging in a dialogue with Ye Xiu, he just wanted to hear all that Ye Xiu had to say. But this could be considered a good sign. He was willing to listen, which meant that he wasn’t completely resistant to the idea. He didn’t think that this was inconceivable. What he needed now was more convincing evidence.</p>
<p>“What else is there to say. Don’t you want to be a champion?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s be real, who would believe that your Team Happy can win the championships?” Fang Rui asked. After considering Ye Xiu’s personality, he hurriedly added, “Aside from Happy yourselves.”</p>
<p>“Does belief matter? Then, do you believe you can get the championship?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Of course I believe I can!” Fang Rui, Master of Playing Dirty, responded unusually quickly to this question. But after doing so, he realized that this question could have been a linguistic trap, so he quickly added, “But I still have no way of believing that I can do so at Happy.”</p>
<p>“You believe you can win a championship, but as of now you still haven’t; I also believe that I can win a championship, and I’ve won three. Just by looking at this, it seems that my belief is more convincing than yours! And right now I believe in Happy, what about you?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui spat blood. What linguistic trap, how low-end! He used his solid, but very much real, three championship cups to smash Fang Rui’s baseless confident belief. But this sort of argument was meaningless, it didn’t say anything about Happy’s actual strength. He really shouldn’t get wrapped up in such an argument with this person.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ye Xiu responded with a question of his own. “You know, I’ve always wondered, why is it, exactly, that no one believes that Happy can win the championship?”</p>
<p>“Because…” Fang Rui typed this word, and then he discovered he didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Because of what?</p>
<p>A team’s strength primarily came from two components: the players and the characters.</p>
<p>Players? Happy had Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng, and if they gained Fang Rui as well, in addition to the talented rookies who had earned the world’s attention, there was no reason for their roster to be considered weak.</p>
<p>Then, the characters? Their characters were currently relatively weak, but as Ye Xiu already said, as long as they got through the early stages, then once they reached the higher-level upgrades, they actually had an advantage. Fang Rui understood to what he was referring to. The pro players had participated in the fight for wild bosses in the Heavenly Domain after the Level 75 update, so he knew how Happy had dominated all of the other guilds, and therefore the other pro teams. This meant that Happy was rich in the rare materials needed to upgrade Level 75 equipment.</p>
<p>But a character’s strength couldn’t simply be measured with how many materials were available. The skill of the R&amp;D department and the characters’ skill points played a role too. And even if Happy was rich in higher level rare materials, that only meant that later upgrades would be easier. They would still struggle during the early stages.</p>
<p>On this end, Happy was in a rather confusing situation. At first glance, it seemed like their character strength wouldn’t be a problem, but this appearance couldn’t withstand a detailed examination.</p>
<p>After thinking over this carefully for a while, Fang Rui finally replied to Ye Xiu’s question.</p>
<p>“Right now, in terms of players, aside from you and Su Mucheng, they’re all rookies, and their instability is evident.”</p>
<p>“Rookies can be unstable, but don’t underestimate the value of a rookie’s ability to grow, especially talented rookies.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“In terms of characters, you’ve definitely gotten a lot of high-level materials over this past year, but do you have enough low-level ones?”</p>
<p>“It’s comparably easier to obtain low-level materials. We’ve already established guilds in various areas to build up our reserves. Even if we lack some things, it wouldn’t be difficult to obtain them. We could easily get them from the market.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Once or twice, maybe, but does Happy have the funds for frequent transactions?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Only frequent equipment production failures will use up too many materials. But Happy invited the core of Excellent Era’s R&amp;D, and his skill and experience will allow us to minimize waste,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>With that, Fang Rui realized that even the issue of the R&amp;D department had been addressed by this guy.</p>
<p>“What about skill points? How are the skill points on your characters?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Number one in the universe!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fucking hell! Straight to the universe! Even if Fang Rui wanted to retort with a “and I’m number one in xx”, he couldn’t, because there was no bigger environment than the universe. But he’d have to believe those words! But before Fang Rui even had a chance to figure out how to mock that statement, Ye Xiu had already sent an image to him.</p>
<p>“You photoshopped this, didn’t you!” Fang Rui cried out in shock.</p>
<p>The image was of a character’s skill tree. Where the number of skill points used was displayed, there flashed a domineering “5500.”</p>
<p>5500 points. At Level 75, that meant maxed skill points. Wasn’t that even scarier than Team Samsara?</p>
<p>“Tch, would I use such low methods?” Ye Xiu scoffed.</p>
<p>“Are there other characters like that?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Sign a contract with us, then I’ll show you all our secrets.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Then just tell me in general, around how many skill points the others are at?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“They’re pretty much all like this. 5400 is the lowest, belonging to a character that can’t even raise its head in Happy.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui continued to be shocked. 5400… His Doubtful Demon in Wind Howl was only at 5355, and that was after he’d lucked out with a 20 point skill point from Ghost Parade! Even with that, at Happy that’d be a character that couldn’t even lift its head?</p>
<p>“Now do you see how powerful our Happy is? These are all secrets, I shouldn’t have told you,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“…” Fang Rui was still recovering from the shock of the skill points.</p>
<p>“Okay… then if Happy has so much potential in all these areas, then I think it’s strange, why not also get Doubtful Demon for me to use?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Good question,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“I hope that didn’t stump you.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. If that were a difficult question, then there’d be no reason for me to do all of this,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So the reason is?”</p>
<p>“No money,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Aside from a spitting blood emoji, what else could Fang Rui say?</p>
<p>“No money is just one of the reasons. If we had a lot of funds, we would consider getting both you and Doubtful Demon, but we would only consider it. In the end, Happy doesn’t need a dirty Thief, we need more tactical analysis and research. However, if the option of a Qi Master is there, I would absolutely take it. So we got Boundless Sea, and now we shoulder the risk of having you switch classes,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Because all of the other Qi Master players rejected you?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Yup! Choosing them would be the safe option. But if it’s you, you might have something they don’t. “Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Such as?”</p>
<p>“The ability to grow.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You want to use me like a rookie?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“During this season, Happy will continue to grow throughout, whether the players or the characters. This is a factor of instability, but it will also be our weapon. And your change of class will allow you to synchronize with this rhythm of growth. We will constantly develop new content, bringing surprises to everyone again and again. Unexpected – don’t you like that word?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui of course liked this word, very much in fact. Because “unexpected” truly encapsulated the style of playing dirty.</p>
<p>“Through our unexpected playing, we’ll obtain an unexpected victory. And you? Do you want to unexpectedly change classes? That definitely has the sneakiness of your dirty playing!” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“I…” Fang Rui seemed as though he were reaching the end of his deliberation.</p>
<p>“I’ll come visit Happy and then decide,” was his final decision.</p>
<p>“Welcome.” Ye Xiu wasn’t too disappointed. A transfer was a player’s investment in his future, and that wasn’t even considering the risk of changing classes. If the class change was successful, that was a breakthrough. But if it wasn’t successful, then not only was it unfortunate, it was possible that when the player tried to change back, he wouldn’t be able to discover the old feeling again, and the player’s skill would be ruined for good.</p>
<p>For such an important matter, Ye Xiu didn’t expect that a decision could be reached with a chat window. Steamed Bun was probably the only person who could make such a life-changing decision so casually, and of course Ye Xiu didn’t want everyone to be like Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>“You really convinced him.” This result shocked Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Not just him, I even convinced myself. “Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I suddenly feel that having Fang Rui change classes is really an exceptionally wonderful decision.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You only like the sneakiness of this plan, don’t you?” Chen Guo looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>“No, no. Our team is still lacking in many areas, so if we want to obtain unbelievable results, then we need unconventional moves. Later, we’ll move slowly, but this time, we’ll take this leap!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1133: Fang Rui’s First Day at Happy</p>
<p>“Great Fang Rui, welcome! Please go up the stairs through here.”</p>
<p>Chen Guo furtively greeted the person, who had just arrived outside of Happy Internet Cafe. She looked back cautiously to detect any signs of movement from the customers in the cafe.</p>
<p>Living up to his reputation as the master of playing dirty, Fang Rui immediately understood and followed Chen Guo nimbly after a quick nod. He was here to watch Happy, he wouldn’t want to be watched by others upon arrival.</p>
<p>However, before he headed upstairs, Fang Rui couldn’t help but look back. What he saw across the road was completely different from his memory.</p>
<p>Fang Rui wasn’t a stranger to this street. He used to come here for the away-games against Excellent Era.</p>
<p>By the time he came again, Excellent Era was no longer there. But across the street, a new team was born in an internet cafe. The thought that this team might become his new home made him emotional over the changes that took place over time.</p>
<p>Fang Rui followed Chen Guo to the second floor of the Internet cafe. He walked past small, individual rooms, the R&amp;D department, the guild department…</p>
<p>Compared to Club Wind Howl, Happy was obviously pitifully tiny. Chen Guo, who was walking in front, felt nervous. She didn’t know what sort of thoughts this God would have about the simplicity of Happy. Chen Guo only hoped that this wouldn’t influence his first impression that Happy’s skills were also simple.</p>
<p>They didn’t walk for long before they reached the training room. Chen Guo took note of Fang Rui’s expression when she invited him in, but failed to pick out anything.</p>
<p>When Fang Rui entered the training room, he saw familiar faces like Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng. They soon finished introducing the unknown rookies of Happy individually.</p>
<p>“So many hot girls.”</p>
<p>This was the first thought that came across Fang Rui;s mind upon his visit to Happy.</p>
<p>“So…” Chen Guo forcibly swallowed the word ‘dirty’ from travelling out. Although it was rather dirty of Fang Rui to only mention the girls, his gaze didn’t dwell on them. His opinion remained an opinion; he had come here for actual business.</p>
<p>“Would you like to try the account for Boundless Sea?” Ye Xiu was a lot more direct. He was already walking over with Boundless Sea’s account card.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too soon!” Frankly speaking, it was still too much for Fang Rui to change classes. Although he had come over, he was still very hesitant.</p>
<p>“What else is there to do? You’ve basically finished the tour around Happy.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chen Guo’s face reddened. Happy was truly tiny. It only took them one minute to finish touring the place.</p>
<p>Fang Rui ended up being a bit unprepared due to how quick the tour ended. Everything had happened too quickly.</p>
<p>“Drop the formalities and hurry up. We actually need to assess you to see if you have any future with your Qi Master’s skills. If you don’t, you might as well go back to your Thief!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>This was way too direct. It meant that whether Fang Rui could get in Happy wasn’t solely based on himself. Happy also needed to see if he could play the Qi Master well enough. Chen Guo immediately panicked when she heard this. Fang Rui was already a top tier Thief player, so changing classes was completely unnecessary. Now that Ye Xiu spoke with such attitude, would Fang Rui just leave?</p>
<p>“Fuck!” In the end, Fang Rui didn’t have such a bad temper. He accepted the account card for Boundless Sea from Ye Xiu after swearing.</p>
<p>He swiped the card and logged in.</p>
<p>“At the same time, you can also experience Happy’s strength!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Fang Rui did have such intentions. He looked around at the rookies of Happy with interest. Who would be his first opponent? Then he saw Ye Xiu sitting down across from him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Rookie Ye Xiu would like to experience the Great Fang Rui’s Qi Master.” Ye Xiu spoke deeply.</p>
<p>“Fuck off!” Fang Rui almost flipped the table.</p>
<p>“An unspecialized. Don’t you want to experience it?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Uh… then let’s play a round!” Fang Rui accepted after a short moment of thought.</p>
<p>The two entered the arena in game. When Boundless Sea logged on, it naturally attracted a lot of attention, but since there was a password set for the room, people could only see where they headed to without being able to enter.</p>
<p>It was obvious that everyone from Happy would be watching, so they all came rushing over. Just when they were about to settle down and enjoy with a comfortable pose, the match finished.</p>
<p>“Mm, not bad.” Fang Rui spoke with a calm expression.</p>
<p>“To last for 1 minute and 38 seconds is not bad indeed.” Ye Xiu was also calm.</p>
<p>“I haven’t played as a Qi Master in five years,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“You’re lying. You haven’t touched it even once in private? Are you that heartless?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was at a loss for words. It was impossible for him to not touch the class at all. Putting Fang Rui aside, any pro player would occasionally play the other classes for fun. If they needed to study a certain class in depth, then they would play that class more often.</p>
<p>“Shall I give you another chance?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Can I fight someone else?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Sure!” Ye Xiu stood up and left, but Su Mucheng took his place. Fang Rui nearly swore again.</p>
<p>Then he battled with Dancing Rain. Fang Rui lost again, but this time within two minutes.</p>
<p>Although it was true that a pro player would still be a lot stronger than normal players even when playing another class, that was because the pros relied on their mechanics and experience. If they had to fight another pro player with the same mechanics and experience, then the unfamiliarity with an unspecialized class would be magnified. Fang Rui knew very clearly that he had no chance of winning against Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng, so he didn’t dwell on his loss too much. He only thought that Ye Xiu was too shameless in setting him up to fight strong opponents he could never beat.</p>
<p>Luckily, Su Mucheng retreated after this match and was replaced by Tang Rou. Fang Rui was trembling with excitement and prepared to teach the rookies just how scary top tier players in the league could be, but in the end, the match finished in 1 minute and 20 seconds. The time was even shorter than the match with Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>The speed that a match finished in was closely tied to the player’s playstyle and character, so it was insufficient to judge a player’s skill according to the amount of time they took to win. Tang Rou obviously wasn’t as skilled as Ye Xiu, but her straightforward and bold playstyle made Fang Rui even more flustered. He made Thief moves subconsciously, and only realized he was using a Qi Master when the character made no reactions.</p>
<p>“Hey, this pretty girl is good…” This time, Fang Rui lost the match rather unnaturally. He was a top tier God after all. Even if he was using the Qi Master, he believed he could fight a rookie, but he ended up losing so directly. The rookies from Happy were a lot more fearsome than he had imagined.</p>
<p>After that, it was Qiao Yifan’s turn. Ghostblades weren’t specialized in fighting 1v1, and adding on the fact that Qiao Yifan was cautious and careful, this round wasn’t as violent as the previous three rounds. Under the slow pace, Fang Rui was finally able to reveal some of his fundamentals as a Qi Master. However, the match still ended with his loss after a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Uh…” After losing against a class that wasn’t strong in 1v1s, Fang Rui felt even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>After that, it was Steamed Bun’s turn. After a chaotic battle, Fang Rui lost in utter confusion.</p>
<p>Fang Rui attempted to say something to liven up the atmosphere, so he cracked a joke with the next person who came to fight. However, this person’s face stayed emotionless as he sat on his seat and started the fight.</p>
<p>When Mo Fan came up, he fought silently and killed Fang Rui’s Qi Master without saying a single word.</p>
<p>“…” Fang Rui no longer had the energy to say anything. At this time, the person sitting across from him was eagerly chatting with him.</p>
<p>“Can you even win one round?” Wei Chen asked as he sat down.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was gloomy. If he had been playing as a Thief, then he would have the confidence to fight with anyone, but since he was playing as a Qi Master, it felt as if his hands and feet were tied. He had already grown used to a Thief’s decision-making habits after many years, so how was it possible to change all of these instantly with ease? He wasn’t a textbook like Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>In the new round, Fang Rui was slowly tortured to death by a Warlock with an abnormally long casting range. Who was he? He was a top tier player in Glory! How long has it been since he had been toyed with like that? This loss was nauseating enough for Fang Rui to puke.</p>
<p>Then he looked at the players from Happy, and saw that every one of them was trembling with excitement. Were they there to gain experience from him? And what’s up with that four-eyes over there? He was the Cleric, right? Was he going to join in and bully him, too?</p>
<p>Fang Rui was furious. Although the style of playing dirty required one to abandon their pride, the master of playing dirty currently found it difficult to keep his face.</p>
<p>“Who’s next?” Fang Rui grumbled.</p>
<p>Luo Ji lifted his hand on the other side and sat down timidly. He glanced uneasily at the companions around him.</p>
<p>“What are you afraid of? He’s easy to beat, hurry and fight!” Steamed Bun cheered his apprentice Luo Ji on.</p>
<p>Easy to beat!</p>
<p>Fang Rui glared at Steamed Bun, this guy only won the previous match out of pure luck! It would be hard to determine who would be the victor if they fought for a few more rounds. This rookie was so arrogant to the point that he didn’t know how vast the sky was.</p>
<p>Fang Rui thought to himself as he let out all his resentment in this match. Unfortunately, Luo Ji had the lowest skill in Happy, so even if he was considered skilled among normal players, there was a significant gap between him and pro players. It was obvious that he couldn’t resist Fang Rui’s Qi Master.</p>
<p>“Oh my, I have a chance! This opponent sucks!” Fang Rui thought with high spirits. Then he started crying on second thought. What was wrong with him? Had he fallen to the point where he could only win when the opponent was bad? This was so embarrassing, so shameful!</p>
<p>Fang Rui was able to finish Luo Ji off cleanly, and finally achieved his first victory in Happy.</p>
<p>“Who else is there!” Fang Rui desperately needed to prove himself.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu thought for a while, and then said, “Should we call Ah Ning up to give it a go?”</p>
<p>“Who?” Fang Rui suddenly fell silent with awe, he thought Happy was finally about to reveal their hidden pro.</p>
<p>“The cashier for our Internet cafe. Ah Ning also plays Glory?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“I think so.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You, fight me! Yes you, come on, I challenge you to three hundred matches!” Fang Rui yelled at Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu sat down once again. Fang Rui spent his first day in Happy duelling with the Qi Master account, a class he hadn’t touched for many years. He strove to find a breakthrough, but he ended up being slaughtered by Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim every single time.</p>
<p>Chapter 1134: Fang Rui’s Worry</p>
<p>Fang Rui himself never would have imagined that as soon as he arrived, he would be thrust into a rotating battle session against Happy’s entire roster.</p>
<p>At first, Fang Rui was truly and thoroughly beaten up. He was unable to immediately change his longtime habits and decision-making, which led to flaws in his Qi Master playing and resulted in defeat after defeat.</p>
<p>However, as time passed, he gradually adjusted to the class, and his win rate steadily increased. Facing the rookies, he was no longer defeated so soundly.</p>
<p>“As expected of the class-changing expert!” Ye Xiu said, standing up. This round, Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim lost to Fang Rui’s Qi Master Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>“Class-changing expert my ass!” Fang Rui maintained that his earlier classes weren’t changing classes, but rather choosing a class in the first place.</p>
<p>With this victory against Ye Xiu, Fang Rui felt as though he had just successfully achieved a major accomplishment. He stretched, and casually glanced at the clock. What he saw made him jump in shock.</p>
<p>Three hours. It had already been three hours.</p>
<p>Fang Rui had completely forgotten the time. His entire heart had been immersed in Glory, his mind had been filled only with thoughts of how to play with the Qi Master in his hands and defeat this whole crowd of Happy players. And during these three hours, Happy had been rotating its members, while he hadn’t had any rest aside from the time it took for them to switch.</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s ability to adapt to the Qi Master, as well as his energy and focus, were all worthy of admiration. After Ye Xiu stood up, no one went to take his place. Fang Rui looked around, and it seemed like no one else was going to come, so he began to give his commentary on the match that had just ended.</p>
<p>“You made too many mistakes in this match,” Fang Rui said to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“You’re right. After seeing you play so hard, I truly couldn’t bear it anymore, so I went a little easy on you,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Fuck, if you’re not satisfied then let’s go again!” Fang Rui yelled. This “going easy” wasn’t considerate at all, at least pretend to hide it! And it was one thing to throw a match so obviously, but to just directly admit it like that after it was over? Just because he was the master of playing dirty didn’t mean he had no dignity.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that, let’s eat first and then go again!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui stared blankly. Only now did he realize that he really was a little hungry now, it was about time for dinner.</p>
<p>Chen Guo had already made dinner plans for all of them, making a reservation at a nearby, relatively nice restaurant. All of Happy headed over, as well as Fang Rui.</p>
<p>At the table, Fang Rui didn’t say much. His appetite seemed fairly normal. After quickly eating his fill, he played around with the straw in his drink.</p>
<p>“You played the Qi Master pretty well, you have a lot of potential!” At this moment, Ye Xiu gave him a high degree of recognition.</p>
<p>Fang Rui rolled his eyes and didn’t bother to answer. In reality, Fang Rui knew better than anyone else whether he could play a Qi Master. After all, he wasn’t some newbie, and he had played Qi Master very early on. He was very clear on whether or not he could manage it, and the fact that he hadn’t immediately turned down Ye Xiu’s offer showed that he knew the possibility existed. And he also knew that Ye Xiu could see this as well; there was no way he had pulled him over here just to test him and see how things went from there.</p>
<p>This afternoon of battling was, in theory, to test Fang Rui’s ability to change classes to Qi Master. But in reality, it was a way for Fang Rui to see Happy’s strength.</p>
<p>Happy’s strength surpassed Fang Rui’s expectations. Each of the rookies had their own styles, and as Ye Xiu had said, they all had plenty of room to grow. Once they completely matured as players, what kind of power would this team possess?</p>
<p>And over the course of this afternoon, not only did he see Happy’s players, he was also able to see their characters. Dancing Rain and Boundless Sea were All-Star characters that didn’t need to be mentioned, as they’d be a strong addition to any team. But Happy’s other characters were plenty strong as well, each with Silver equipment. Although they couldn’t compare to a powerhouse team, they were extremely well-off for a new team.</p>
<p>“How about it, after seeing everything in person, how do you feel about Happy?” Ye Xiu now asked him.</p>
<p>“Mm… not bad,” Fang Rui said. He didn’t directly say that Happy was approaching powerhouse levels, but from what he had seen, whether the players or the characters, they had all surpassed his predictions.</p>
<p>“Good, then let’s talk about your compensation. You saw us, our conditions right now are rather poor, a whole bunch of people crowded in an Internet cafe to train. Ten people at a meal and we only have eight dishes, and no soup. What’s your current salary? 6.5 million? Is that before or after tax?”</p>
<p>“Before tax,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“It’s already that much before tax. Do you have no shame?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was speechless. What was there to be ashamed about? If you’re trying to bargain down my salary, then just directly say it! But the problem was, he clearly still hadn’t agreed to join Happy! Why were they already talking about his contract? And also, what was this about eight dishes and no soup? Wasn’t that just because the rest of dishes hadn’t been brought out yet?</p>
<p>The door of the private room was suddenly pushed open. The server entered with a large tray and placed two more dishes on the table.</p>
<p>“This was really bad timing…” Ye Xiu complained. The rest of the table was silent. To use that as an argument, are you treating Fang Rui as someone who can’t count? He was clearly right here with all of us when the dishes were being ordered!</p>
<p>But no matter what, Happy still hoped that Fang Rui would concede a little bit when it came to the contract. This point, at least, Ye Xiu made clear to Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“If you have any thoughts, just say them directly! Don’t sit there being sneaky.” After seeing Fang Rui playing with his drink without saying anything for a while, Ye Xiu spoke up again.</p>
<p>“Damn!” Fang Rui was gloomy. He was just taking some sips of his drink, what was so sneaky about that? Besides, what thoughts could he have? Happy was really not bad, better than he had expected, but something about this still didn’t sit well in his heart. He still feared this drastic change, and this fear caused his hesitation. Even if what he saw at Happy surpassed his expectations, his worry still had yet to be eliminated completely.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…”</p>
<p>I don’t know, that was that. If only he knew, then Fang Rui would have a way of getting rid of the worry in his heart. Happy was clearly better off than he had imagined, and he had even begun to anticipate Happy’s future, so why was he still so uneasy?</p>
<p>Was there something about Happy that still nagged at him? The simple accommodations? Fang Rui was never one to care about that. A contract where he’d have to make some compromises? Fang Rui also wasn’t one to care too much about money. The identity of being new to the Alliance? To be honest, Fang Rui rather liked this identity, it allowed them to bring more surprises.</p>
<p>He thought and he thought, but he was still at a loss. He didn’t know what he was worried about, but he was worried.</p>
<p>The room was quiet. No one even moved to touch the dishes that had just been brought up, and the overall atmosphere was rather cold. Fang Rui, lacking something to say but not wanting the silence to drag on, tossed out a very ordinary question: “How did you all come together anyway?”</p>
<p>“Us?” Ye Xiu blinked, and then casually went around the room, describing all of their backstories to Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Fang Rui had only wanted to lighten the atmosphere, and so he asked a question that could be discussed for a while. To be honest, he didn’t really care about the answer. But as he listened, Fang Rui suddenly jolted. He realized what was worrying him about Happy. After Ye Xiu finished his introductions, Fang Rui immediately asked a question that was important to him.</p>
<p>“How many more years do you plan on playing?”</p>
<p>“Me?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you!” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“I hope that I can continue to play forever!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“But we both know that that’s impossible,” Fang Rui said. “Especially for you, playing an unspecialized, that’s a heavy burden on you, and it will definitely shorten the lifespan of your career. The fact that you’ve been able to maintain this condition up until now is already a miracle in my eyes. But, how much longer can you maintain it? One year? Two years?”</p>
<p>“This… who can say for sure?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Then, after you retire, what about Team Happy?” At last, Fang Rui asked the question that had been worrying him all this time.</p>
<p>Every team had its motivation in being established, and this motivation would be the most fundamental force pulling together the members of a team. Just looking at the current Alliance, every team’s existence was undoubtedly based on profit. All of the bosses of the teams were trying to maximize their profits, so they concentrated on the expansion and development of their teams. But what about this Team Happy?</p>
<p>This team was pulled together by Ye Xiu after his retirement. It didn’t have any major financial backing, and the so-called boss was just the boss of an Internet cafe who was severely limited in power. Fang Rui could sense that the authority of this supposed boss was ultimately less than that of Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Then what was Ye Xiu’s motivation in establishing this team?</p>
<p>It could be anything, but Fang Rui was certain that it wasn’t for profit.</p>
<p>Relying on profit to sustain oneself was an uncomfortable feeling. But unfortunately, this was the cruel reality of the world. Only profit was eternal. Aside from that, things like the players’ love of Glory, or their pursuit of the championship title, would always fade with the passage of time. And, with their declining condition, the players would ultimately have no way of continuing.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was unquestionably the foundation upon this team could exist, and Fang Rui would never doubt his support and passion for this game. But even with such a heart, Ye Xiu would leave one day, and this day could come very soon. When that time came, what would happen to Team Happy? Would they have the cohesion that they showed today? Just considering Happy’s boss and her financial power, it was uncertain if she could even hold onto all of these talented players. The better Happy performed, the more tragic the scene would be when that day arrived.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Happy’s rookies were already exceptional, and Fang Rui was rather surprised that none of them had been pulled away so far. Happy’s financial power couldn’t compete with any of the other teams. Was Ye Xiu’s presence alone enough to keep them here? Was this guy’s personal charisma really that great?</p>
<p>Fang Rui had his doubts. But regardless of his charisma or lack thereof, if this team had completely relied on Ye Xiu to come together, then that only increased the worry in his heart. In this sort of situation, it was truly difficult to predict what Happy’s future would look like. If Fang Rui came to Happy, he would be switching classes. He couldn’t take such a large gamble on a team that would disperse after Ye Xiu’s departure.</p>
<p>“You want to know about Team Happy after my departure?” Ye Xiu said. “Then you’d better ask my boss!”</p>
<p>Chapter 1135: An Entirely New Future</p>
<p>“Huh? Me?”</p>
<p>When such a critical question was suddenly sent her way, Chen Guo couldn’t help but panic. True, it wasn’t like she’d never thought about this question before. She was always working hard to learn and improve, both in order to lighten Ye Xiu’s burden, and so that when Ye Xiu was no longer around, she could still look after this team. But to suddenly have to answer this question right here and right now, she was completely unprepared.</p>
<p>But now, she had no more time.</p>
<p>She sensed the significance of this question, that this was Fang Rui asking about Happy’s future. And Happy’s future would be the deciding factor as to whether or not he would throw his lot in with this team.</p>
<p>If she, the boss, didn’t have an unshakable resolve, then how could the players be at ease?</p>
<p>Chen Guo took a deep breath. It was time to muster her resolve.</p>
<p>“Even after Ye Xiu leaves, Happy will continue forward,” she began.</p>
<p>“Oh? How so?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“If he’s willing, we of course will retain him as a coach, or for any position he’s interested in.” Chen Guo first made plans for Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“As for the others, I believe that they will have completely matured by then, enough to carry our team,” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Oh? Then how can you guarantee that they won’t all just leave?” Fang Rui’s gaze suddenly sharpened, and became calculating. “There are many temptations in the professional scene. I know that you’ve already received a few invitations from other teams and declined all of them. But right now, you’re still just newbies in the Alliance. In a year or two, if you became All-Stars, champions, your value will reach a peak. At that time, the temptations you’ll face will be unimaginable. Money, status, and countless other things, are you sure that you won’t be swayed by any of it?”</p>
<p>Fang Rui felt that his speech would pierce straight into the soul, that no one would dare retort. But at that moment, someone at the table said, with utter conviction, “I’m sure.”</p>
<p>It was Tang Rou.</p>
<p>What a pretty girl, but right now, in Fang Rui’s eyes, she only seemed hypocritical or naive. She didn’t even think before opening her mouth and saying “I’m sure.” She seemed to have much too high of an opinion of herself.</p>
<p>“The pretty girl sure has confidence, huh?” Fang Rui snickered, and his skepticism was clear in his every word. He was about to teach this arrogant girl something about the real world. “Don’t you know…”</p>
<p>“That’s nothing!”</p>
<p>But just as Fang Rui was about to give an example, he was interrupted by Chen Guo. Chen Guo of course knew that Fang Rui wanted to give her a slap in the face, but at the same time she knew that he would fail, and that it would be his own face receiving the slap. To prevent Fang Rui from suffering that awkwardness, it was better to explain first.</p>
<p>“She really won’t be swayed, really,” said Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Her dad is Tang Shulin. If you don’t know him, then look him up online.” Chen Guo, sitting next to Fang Rui, patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>This sort of business tycoon wouldn’t be a household name, so Fang Rui truly did not know. However, he at least could tell that this was likely a remarkable background, so he didn’t argue, immediately searching up on his phone under the table. Not much longer, he sat up straight again and lifted his head. His facial expression didn’t change at all, but he lifted his chopsticks. “Come on everyone, let’s eat, how come no one’s touched these two dishes that were just brought out?”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed, but they didn’t call him out.</p>
<p>To talk about money and status in front of Tang Rou, that was like talking about Glory skill in front of Ye Xiu. Wasn’t it just throwing yourself against a rock? It was impressive enough that Fang Rui remained this calm in the face of that, so let him restabilize!</p>
<p>Everyone ate quietly and didn’t say much. Fang Rui, who had earlier expressed that he had eaten his fill, was clearly eating the most right now. It was as though he wanted to use this food to erase what had just happened. While he was searching online, he already sensed that this pretty girl had an extraordinary background, but when he finally got his answer, his eyes still almost flew out of his head.</p>
<p>“Eat, eat.”</p>
<p>When Fang Rui said this, he really wanted to eat the plate itself as well.</p>
<p>Thus, after that, Fang Rui couldn’t bring himself to mention anything else about temptation. What if this Miss Tang just waved her hand and bought out the entire Glory Alliance? Then she’d be the one distributing prize money to the various teams! And he had wanted to talk to her about temptation, temptation his ass!</p>
<p>“Ah, Happy is really… too full of potential, ha…” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>When Chen Guo heard this, she knew that he had misunderstood, treating Tang Rou’s background as Happy’s background. In reality, these were two completely separate things. Tang Rou was like the rest of them ordinary players, signing a contract to earn her salary. She didn’t exercise any power outside of that.</p>
<p>But still, this sort of feeling, the fox pretending to have the power of the tiger, it wasn’t a bad feeling at all!</p>
<p>Chen Guo glanced at Tang Rou and saw that she was making a face at her right now! Chen Guo laughed. This was something she very much liked about Tang Rou. When Happy found out that she came from such a high background, it seemed like there was some new distance between her and the rest of them. Even Chen Guo, who had known her the best, hadn’t adjusted immediately after finding out.</p>
<p>But Tang Rou faced this unusual treatment directly. She wasn’t arrogant about her background, but she didn’t try to avoid it either. She wasn’t like the many hypocritical ladies who would want the people around her to treat her like an ordinary person. She was herself, the same Tang Rou she always was, who would never run from anything. And so, the barrier caused by her background gradually faded, and everyone saw that Tang Rou was still Tang Rou, nothing had changed! The barrier only came from each person’s imagination, and so when everyone saw reality, everything returned to the way it always was.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was funny and entertaining for these guys around her to watch people be terrified after learning about her background. Such as Fang Rui, who was currently burying himself in his food. There was a long period of time where he didn’t say anything, and everyone thought it was just too great.</p>
<p>But Chen Guo was, in the end, a responsible person, so she clarified for Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“Here, Little Tang is just an ordinary player, no different from anyone else,” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Mm.” Fang Rui nodded. This time, he didn’t say anything directly, he hid his true thoughts. Tang Rou was just an ordinary player? That was impossible. It looked like this Boss Chen hadn’t truly understood. Her background meant that she was a wildcard, a player that couldn’t be controlled by any team, including Happy.</p>
<p>Money, status, and so on had no way of tempting her, which also meant they had no way of controlling her. She belonged to herself and herself alone. As long as she wanted to play, she could keep playing with Happy. But if one day she decided she no longer wanted to play, then who would be able to keep her? What would stop her from leaving? The contract? To forcibly break the contract only required money, and would that be a problem for her?</p>
<p>Her powerful background placed her above the spirit of the contracts upon which society was built. This was somewhat unfair, but it couldn’t be helped. For Tang Rou, they could only rely on her personal character, so Fang Rui didn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu chose this moment to open his mouth.</p>
<p>“Happy’s future will be shaped by its players. You only want to be a spectator, taking a ride and reaping the profits? That’s just too dirty, too shameless! Do you dare come with us to build the future together? Do you dare come with us to face your so-called unimaginable temptations of money and status?”</p>
<p>That’s right. He was worried about whether or not Happy could keep its players, but what about himself? If he also became a member of Happy, then when that day came, would he also be swayed? Before doubting others, shouldn’t he first strengthen his own resolve? If everyone worked together and created a unified team, there was no need to worry this much. If people left, then more would come to replace them.</p>
<p>That’s right. That’s how it should be.</p>
<p>Fang Rui slammed his hand on the table. “I’ll join Happy!”</p>
<p>“Excellent, welcome!” Chen Guo exclaimed.</p>
<p>“With me here, the championship has nowhere to run!” This dirty player had a face swelled with confidence.</p>
<p>“Good. Then let’s talk about the issue of your contract,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Damnit, can’t you let everyone be excited together for three or five minutes?” Fang Rui was depressed. The atmosphere was wonderful, but with talk of money, the feeling was somewhat ruined.</p>
<p>“Excited about what? Are you a rookie or something?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So what do you think about my contract,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“You see, we’re very poor right now, only ten dishes for ten people, and no soup…”</p>
<p>Just as he said this, there was a knock at the door again. “Excuse me, but could you open the door please? The soup is here!”</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan, who was sitting closest to the door, immediately pushed it open, and the server entered with the soup, his forehead coated in sweat. “The door was locked, I hope I didn’t interrupt?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s fine,” Chen Guo said, and the server placed down the soup and quickly left.</p>
<p>“Shameless!” Fang Rui said to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“In any case, we don’t have any money!” Ye Xiu slapped the table. “6.5 million is impossible. How about 650,000!”</p>
<p>“Fuck, don’t be too rude! I’m an All Star player, after all! If that contract got released to the public, how could I show my face?”</p>
<p>“To everyone else, you can say 65 million!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Do you think everyone else is an idiot?”</p>
<p>“Then how much do you want?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you reduce it a bit, but at least 5 million, don’t you think?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“5 million, do you have no shame? Being an All-Star is impressive, sure, I’ll toss all my All-Star nominations in front of you like a pile of bones! I could bury you in all the honors I’ve won! And yet despite my achievements, I have to kneel in front of the boss’s door every day and beg to get my pay here at Happy! Who do you think you are, asking for 5 million in front of me?”</p>
<p>Fang Rui was speechless, and then started half crying. “That’s not what I meant!”</p>
<p>“You youngsters, always thinking about money money money. Why don’t you think about how much glory you’ll obtain by joining Happy? That’s something that no amount of money can buy,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was once again speechless. How was this guy so shameless? He made winning a championship seem as easy as buying a red bean bun. If it were truly a hundred percent guaranteed that they’d win a championship, Fang Rui would be willing to join for no money at all, but of course that could never be the case in competition.</p>
<p>Chen Guo had enough of this nonsense, and finally interjected with her voice of reason. “Right now, we really are tight on money. Aside from your contract, we also still have the transfer fee with Wind Howl, and we don’t know what price they’ll ask for. This first year, what do you think about 3 million?”</p>
<p>“Compared to that guy, you really are a good person… but this…”</p>
<p>“This is really too low, I know, but after lasting through the first year, we can discuss again next year if we’re in a good position. If you’re worried, you can write it in the contract, that’s fine too.”</p>
<p>“Hm… Alright!” Fang Rui finally nodded. After all, he didn’t come to Happy to get a high-paying contract, so he had been prepared.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he was here because he wanted an entirely new future.</p>
<p>Chapter 1136: Significant Transfer</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly seemed to gain an appetite, so they ordered a few more dishes and ate with a lively atmosphere. Fang Rui left the next day, and all that was left were the contract negotiations with Club Wind Howl.</p>
<p>When the player had a preference as to where they were going, it generally wasn’t difficult to reach a deal. Wind Howl was truly shocked at Fang Rui’s final choice, but in the end they respected his wishes. However, they were disappointed when Happy said that they weren’t going to buy Doubtful Demon as well.</p>
<p>They had originally planned to sell off Fang Rui and Doubtful Demon together, permanently making the rookies Tang Hao and Zhao Yuzhe the core of their style, and abandoning the dirty playstyle once and for all. Who would have thought that Fang Rui would leave without his character? He actually wanted to change classes to Qi Master?</p>
<p>“You… Are you sure?” There were still feelings between Wind Howl and Fang Rui after so many years. For someone who’d already become an All-Star player, it seemed like there was no reason for him to change classes. It was illogical. Seeing that Fang Rui wanted to do this, Wind Howl had to say something, whether it was for Fang Rui’s own interests, or their plan to sell the player and character together.</p>
<p>“I’m sure.” Since returning from Happy, Fang Rui was completely certain of his decision.</p>
<p>What kind of poison did Happy brainwash this guy with, to convince him to accept these conditions? Wind Howl, after having their plan messed up, was at a loss as to what to do. But for the sake of the team’s image, they had to respect the wishes of the player, especially for an important player like Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Wind Howl then planned to negotiate with Happy, but Happy completely rejected their attempts to sell Doubtful Demon, so in the end, Wind Howl could only start putting up a price. In terms of price, this sort of voluntary transfer sale would never go too high. Additionally, Fang Rui was mediating, so Wind Howl didn’t expect to make much money from this. After they talked back and forth, they soon decided on a transfer fee of 4 million.</p>
<p>After news of the transfer was released, the entire Alliance wondered if they had read incorrectly. Fang Rui chose Happy? This was as shocking as when Xiao Shiqin chose to transfer to the relegated Excellent Era last season! Were all the All-Stars taking unconventional routes now?</p>
<p>But no matter what, the transfer satisfied the rules, so Fang Rui’s transfer was quickly approved. Now, Fang Rui was officially a member of Happy.</p>
<p>Because there weren’t too many issues to be worked out, the transfer was swiftly completed. The media was still in the middle of figuring out which teams were more interested in Fang Rui when the contract was already signed. When the media caught wind of this, Happy was already holding a news conference!</p>
<p>Happy didn’t yet have a specialized PR department, so the conference was arranged by a PR company they had found to help. After the news released, the various esports media all came without even being invited. It was a full house, and there were endless requests for private interviews.</p>
<p>Chen Guo, Ye Xiu, and Fang Rui were the three participants in the press conference, and it was completed as planned. Meanwhile, the rights to an exclusive interview were of course given to the reporter Chang Xian of City H’s Esports Home.</p>
<p>Chang Xian was ecstatic!</p>
<p>When he had first noticed Happy, he hadn’t been thinking about gambling on their growth as a team. He was just a newbie in the industry, how would he have such foresight? He was just doing the ordinary thing, reporting on this grassroots team that had gained some attention. Who would have thought that with this gamble, he had won big? After Happy won the Challenger League championship, Chang Xian felt how fortunate he was. He could sense his status at Esports Home rising, and the editor-in-chief spoke with him in person much more often.</p>
<p>And now, Fang Rui was transferring to Happy! In the summer transfer window, he had obtained the first major exclusive interview since Excellent Era disbanded. Undoubtedly, this interview would be on the front page of next week’s edition of Esports Home.</p>
<p>Facing Fang Rui, Chang Xian was slightly apprehensive. He had been with Happy’s members for a while now and was familiar with all of them, but that was partly because of their humble beginnings as a team. Chang Xian had never felt too much of a professional atmosphere from them. But Fang Rui was different. Facing an interview, he had the aura of a God. Chang Xian was reminded of when he was just starting out in the industry, and the pressure he felt when he was tagging along with senior reporters to carry their bags. And now, he was facing this aura by himself.</p>
<p>“God Fang Rui, may we begin?” Fang Rui steadied his emotions. He knew, after today, he would be facing countless interviews like this.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was transferring. This was the first big news.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was switching classes. This was the second big news.</p>
<p>At the press conference, when they learned that Fang Rui would be playing with Boundless Sea, the entire pro circle went wild.</p>
<p>What was the reason?</p>
<p>During the press conference, Fang Rui grinned and said, “Because Happy’s broke. They can’t afford Doubtful Demon, so I could only switch to using Boundless Sea.”</p>
<p>Who would believe that?</p>
<p>The number one Thief, an All-Star player, was treated like this after being bought? Even if Happy was willing to waste talent like that, how could Fang Rui agree to such treatment?</p>
<p>Compared to Fang Rui’s transfer, his change to Qi Master suddenly became a much more exciting topic of discussion.</p>
<p>“This is truly an unprecedented decision. If I recall correctly, before you, there’s never been a top player who chose to change classes like this?” one reporter said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Ye Xiu suddenly interjected, dissatisfied. “Didn’t I do that too?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>This, how to put it? Even if an unspecialized wasn’t a real class, it certainly wasn’t the Battle Mage class that Ye Xiu had always played. This was indeed a class-changing player, and he was sitting right in front of all of them. How had they missed it? The reporter who had spoken was filled with shame, while the others asked themselves, why hadn’t they realized that Ye Xiu was also a class-changing player?</p>
<p>And the more attentive reporters now realized another point. “I remember, Happy’s Qiao Yifan, when he was in Tiny Herb, he was using an Assassin, but now he’s changed classes to a Ghostblade.”</p>
<p>“You’re correct.” Ye Xiu nodded.</p>
<p>The reporters glanced at each other. Team Happy actually had three class-changing players. Was this Happy’s style, some hidden attribute?</p>
<p>The purpose of the press conference was primarily to deliver news, so the reporters didn’t have much time to ask questions. There was simply no opportunity for them to get to the bottom of this situation. And the one who had obtained the opportunity to do so was Chang Xian, with the exclusive interview. He was now rather smug as he asked about the details.</p>
<p>“Why did you decide to change classes to Qi Master?”</p>
<p>“Because of Happy’s invitation.”</p>
<p>“What kind of invitation was it, that could cause you to make such an important decision?”</p>
<p>“An extremely sincere invitation.”</p>
<p>“Um… how sincere?”</p>
<p>“Very very sincere. Look at my eyes,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>Chang Xian felt like crying. It was no use, he was still too young, too inexperienced! He had no control over this master of playing dirty!</p>
<p>Chapter 1137: Happy the Dark Horse</p>
<p>Having accepted an exclusive interview, Fang Rui naturally wouldn’t call the reporters over and just mess with them. After making his jokes, he answered the questions seriously, from personal to team, and explained his reasons for changing classes.</p>
<p>In the following issue of the Esports Home, Chang Xian’s exclusive interview naturally made the headlines. This exclusive interview with Fang Rui took the chance to introduce Team Happy’s team structure and future plans after the actual interview. This thorough analysis even caught the attention of the pro scene. After reading it, many of the pros suddenly realized that Team Happy’s current class combination had many possibilities to it.</p>
<p>Just considering Fang Rui’s shocking addition, what class was Fang Rui’s most familiar partner? A Brawler! Coincidentally, there happened to be a Brawler in Happy’s line up as well. Even though Fang Rui had switched classes to a Qi Master, this didn’t mean his familiarity with working with a Brawler would vanish.</p>
<p>Then, consider Fang Rui’s class switch. The Qi Master had been Ye Xiu’s most reliable ally when he had built Excellent Era’s dynasty. After that, the Qi Master had consistently been a core class in Excellent Era’s line up. Ye Xiu was very familiar with working with Qi Masters, and Su Mucheng wouldn’t be alien to it either.</p>
<p>In addition, Team Excellent Era’s ace had been a Battle Mage. Coincidentally, Happy also had one. It wasn’t hard to imagine that Excellent Era’s traditional strategies would all be realized once more in Happy.</p>
<p>After this analysis, everyone finally realized how agreeable Fang Rui’s arrangement to transfer to Happy was, as well as how the arrival of a Qi Master would unite Happy. Now, Fang Rui and his Qi Master seemed like Happy’s tactical core, connecting all the pro characters.</p>
<p>But even if he achieved such an effect, he still wasn’t the core of Happy. Who was the core? Even an idiot would know it was Ye Xiu. And what class was Ye Xiu? Unspecialized! There was very little high end research done on this class, so no one was certain what role it played in the team competition. This was the foundation on which Happy was built, but it was also the most mysterious. Though Ye Xiu and Lord Grim had appeared quite early on, the people in the pro scene were simply curious. Who would have thought to start researching an unspecialized so soon?</p>
<p>But now, Ye Xiu really did return, bringing his unspecialized and a team that didn’t seem weak at all.</p>
<p>If there was anyone that still looked down on Happy before, then they had to change their minds after Fang Rui’s transfer. Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Fang Rui. This was a team with three All-Star level players. If this wasn’t worthy of careful consideration, then what kind of team was?</p>
<p>Naturally, Happy’s characters would be a little weaker, their facilities wouldn’t be as well established, and their finances would also be a little tighter. However, no one dared underestimate them in a match. With three top players, no one would disregard them as a threat.</p>
<p>Grassroots?</p>
<p>A grassroots team with three All-Star level players? No one could continue calling them such. Were they a dark horse? Would Happy be a dark horse in this season? Just like last season’s Heavenly Swords?</p>
<p>No… Not even Heavenly Swords was so dark. That was mostly blown out of proportion on purpose. The discussion that arose around them had garnered them more attention from the people. With more attention, there were also higher expectations. Their darkness had been from public opinion.</p>
<p>As for Happy? With three All-Stars, no one dared to say that they weren’t a dark horse!</p>
<p>All the Glory-related forums, all the experts and noobs in the scene, even the pro scene, were discussing what sort of impact Happy might have on this season. Happy had suddenly become much more imposing in comparison to when they had fought in the Challenger League. All this came from Fang Rui’s arrival, from Happy’s daring in completing such a significant transfer.</p>
<p>This was an attitude, an attitude of the players and of the team.</p>
<p>An All-Star player held Happy in high regard and joined Happy.</p>
<p>Happy dared to spend this money on an All-Star character, an All-Star player.</p>
<p>Happy’s goal was the championship title?</p>
<p>There weren’t many people laughing now. A team with three All-Stars was a strong team in the eyes of normal players, a team that had a right to fight for the championships. Those who were rational were still considering Happy’s flaws from different perspectives, but most people had gotten carried away by their excitement over Fang Rui’s transfer.</p>
<p>Happy, champions!</p>
<p>There were people who really did dare yell this sort of slogan. Before now, even Seven Fields and the others, who had been loyal since they had met Ye Xiu in the tenth server, had been too embarrassed to face Happy’s goal of winning the championships.</p>
<p>But now, any random Glory player could methodically explain how powerful Happy was to you.</p>
<p>With this transfer, Happy gained the spotlight once more. That was when the Glory game company and the Pro Alliance came knocking. They wanted to begin issuing Team Happy merchandise such as character models, Happy style accounts, etc.. The rights to the creation and sale of these products would given to a third party upon joining the Alliance, so they didn’t have to worry about finding someone to work with. As for the profit, all teams would gain the same percentage of the revenue generated. There was little that the team actually had to do. They just had to provide their appearance and then do well in competitions, gain popularity and promote the sales of their merchandise.</p>
<p>In the preliminary plans of the Alliance and the game company, someone as popular as Su Mucheng wouldn’t be missing. Even last season, when she had gone to the Challenger League with the rest of Excellent Era, merchandise regarding her and her Dancing Rain were still popular. Now that Dancing Rain had come to Happy with Su Mucheng, the two coming together as a package was a good thing for the merchandise company. For example, the hottest merchandise were character models with Dancing Rain’s equipment as a Launcher and Su Mucheng’s actual figure and appearance.</p>
<p>In comparison, Chu Yunxiu and Misty Rain were in an awkward situation. The player was a lady but the character was a guy, so they couldn’t merge the two together. Thus, in the end, they could only sell Misty Rain’s character model. As for the player model, those weren’t as popular. Everyone preferred the epic appearance of the character model.</p>
<p>No one had noticed this situation at first, but by the time they did, teams like Team Misty Rain were rather depressed. With the high status gained by being in the pro scene and the mutual benefits gained along with the game company, asking to get the character’s sex and appearance changed wouldn’t do anything to the balance of the game. However, Misty Rain had been a guy for so long. Everyone was used to it already. If they suddenly changed his sex, then their fans probably wouldn’t be able to accept that, so Misty Rain could only endure it. But this time, after acknowledging the strength of the twin sisters that Misty Rain had contracted, they decided that they would make sure to not make the same mistake and contacted the game company to change the sex of the two characters while they still had a little influence.</p>
<p>Since this change wasn’t a gamechanger, the normal players didn’t mind the pro scene having this special benefit. In their eyes, it was a good thing for them to align the sex of the character with the player, especially with two beautiful ladies playing two guys.</p>
<p>For Happy, Su Mucheng and Dancing Rain were good to go, then there was Tang Rou and Soft Mist. With her beauty and grace, she was perfect and the Alliance. The game company viewed her as a treasure, finding a talented team to create a model of Soft Mist with Tang Rou’s appearance. Then, they just had to hope that Tang Rou would be able to play well and gain fame. After all, this was a competitive scene.</p>
<p>For Happy, they had wanted to create three different models and account cards. Su Mucheng and Tang Rou were good, now there was Ye Xiu, who was an entirely different problem.</p>
<p>Originally, their hopes for Ye Xiu were even higher than Su Mucheng and Tang Rou. This was a top tier expert that had hidden himself away for all these years. Now that he was willing to show himself, the Alliance and game company wanted to take this chance. But when it came to collecting the materials, the game company was close to crying.</p>
<p>Glory had been designed by them. This, naturally, included the equipment available, and Lord Grim’s mix and match equipment could even cause the game company to be lost in wonder. What sort of talent did you have to have to manage to find such an ugly combination of equips! When designing the game, they naturally wouldn’t make ugly equipment. The equipment would be perfect and beautiful or have some sort of uniqueness to it that left a lasting impression. However, why was Lord Grim’s set so uncomfortable to look at? In that moment, the game company had a thought to cheat and modify Lord Grim’s equipment design and make this mix and match a better sight to look at. But it was only a thought. This sort of change would have too big of an effect. Although the design didn’t affect the stats and technically wasn’t a game changer, if they made the equipment look good on Lord Grim, what would they do if the equipment looked terrible when someone else wore it?</p>
<p>In the end, it was Lord Grim’s abnormal class choice that made his equipment diverge from the beauty of the game.</p>
<p>Experts had observed Lord Grim’s current design for a long time, discussed it for a long time, but they all shook their heads in the end and admitted defeat.</p>
<p>The Alliance was depressed, the game company was depressed, but they refused to give up on thinking of a way to profit, coming up with another idea. They were going to make a commemorative version of One Autumn Leaf. Yes, that One Autumn Leaf, one with Ye Xiu’s appearance. That would probably make up for many people’s disappointment, right?</p>
<p>Would it really? Soon enough, someone voiced this doubt.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be hard to make this combination right now. Although One Autumn Leaf already belonged to Samsara, they just had to split some of the profits with Samsara and Happy. The problem was that One Autumn Leaf simply didn’t have Ye Xiu’s appearance, but the model was already very popular. The commemorative version would be simply adding in Ye Xiu’s face.</p>
<p>Models were based primarily on the impressive designs of the characters. Adding in the player’s appearance was just to show their love. The Excellent Era One Autumn Leaf had garnered a lot of buyers already and was just lacking Ye Xiu’s face. Would adding his face really make any difference? After careful consideration, they hesitated. After all, as players of this competitive scene, their value never lay in their faces.</p>
<p>Why was this Ye Xiu always so troublesome!</p>
<p>The Pro Alliance and Glory game company felt like they were going to cry.</p>
<p>Chapter 1138: Keep Our Spots and Become the Champions</p>
<p>Happy was becoming more and more prosperous by the day. The season hadn’t started yet, but the transfers, both accounts and players, were eye-catching enough already. The Pro Alliance and the Glory game company were even more worried than Happy. Let alone new rising teams in the Alliance, most teams didn’t get such treatment!</p>
<p>No team was willing to lag behind Happy. Everyone was doing their best to find ways to improve. Team Wind Howl, who had been the backdrop behind Fang Rui’s transfer, was currently having a headache about what to do with Doubtful Demon. Team Wind Howl displayed quite the benevolence towards Fang Rui’s transfer. Even though they would rather offer him as a package with Doubtful Demon, in the end, they didn’t make things difficult for Fang Rui if he wanted to leave alone and let it pass. But as a result, dealing with Doubtful Demon became much more complicated.</p>
<p>They no longer had a Thief player. Doubtful Demon clearly needed to be sold. If not, leaving him there in the team but not using him was just waiting for it to depreciate. Understanding this point, the crafty teams in the Alliance wouldn’t be impatient to act. They were planning on patiently waiting. When the time came, they would go and negotiate with a lower price.</p>
<p>For a moment, it was as if no one wanted Doubtful Demon.</p>
<p>Just when the teams were patiently waiting for the right moment, the sudden news of another transfer disrupted their plan.</p>
<p>Team Blue Rain’s Lin Feng had been transferred to Team Wind Howl for 3.2 million.</p>
<p>The Glory circle was completely stunned.</p>
<p>From the price of 3.2 million, it could be seen that Lin Feng wasn’t a top-tier player, but he was a Thief player.</p>
<p>Team Wind Howl sent away Fang Rui and decided to abandon the Thief’s dirty playing style. Suddenly, they invited Lin Feng? What were they doing? Could it be that they wanted to raise Doubtul Demon’s price, so they intentionally mystified the situation?</p>
<p>Quite a few people thought of this possibility, but they also felt it was too ridiculous to believe. But not long afterwards, several skillful people analyzed the background behind this transfer.</p>
<p>It was true that Thieves were very suitable for playing dirty, but that didn’t mean that was the only style they could play. As for Wind Howl, they may have given up on dirty play, but that didn’t mean that they had given up on Thieves.</p>
<p>As a result, the master of playing dirty, Fang Rui, may have left, but it was ambiguous if the Thief, Doubtful Demon, would leave.</p>
<p>When Wind Howl saw that selling Doubtful Demon wasn’t going well, they gave their answer: Doubtful Demon would not be leaving.</p>
<p>Because of Lin Feng.</p>
<p>Lin Feng was a substitute on Team Blue Rain. He had a few opportunities to appear on stage, but his position wasn’t as stable as the core members. Even so, he had his own style. His Thief didn’t play dirty. Team Blue Rain wasn’t suited for playing dirty.</p>
<p>As a result, he grabbed the attention of Team Wind Howl. The dirty Doubtful Demon was gone. A new Doubtful Demon had risen. In the press conference for Lin Feng’s addition to the team, it wasn’t hard to see Team Wind Howl’s hopes for the new Doubtful Demon.</p>
<p>Up until now, Team Wind Howl’s lineup for the new season seemed to have surfaced. After two summers, this team had replaced their Criminal Partners. Their Brawler and Thief were still there, but their players were different. It would be hard to say if the old criminal air around the team would appear again.</p>
<p>After Lin Feng transferred, another mid-level transfer came out.</p>
<p>Lu Yining, Team Misty Rain’s Sharpshooter, the Best Sixth Player. The sixth player was oftentimes the main sub in the team competition. The sixth player would sometimes be the person that would turn the situation around. However, at other times, the sixth player wouldn’t appear on stage because their team’s main five players smoothly defeated the opponents without the need for a sixth player.</p>
<p>In any case, he was a skilled player. Lu Yining’s transfer price of 4.6 million proved this point.</p>
<p>In the end, Lu Yining transferred to Team Thunderclap. It was hard not to pay attention to this team.</p>
<p>Team Thunderclap had been hard-pressed money for many years. Over their many years of existence, their biggest transfer was to get back their former core character, Life Extinguisher, from Excellent Era. It truly made people speechless.</p>
<p>A 4.6 million transfer might not mean too much to some of the powerhouses, but for Team Thunderclap, it was no small sum of money. It looked like this team had quite the ambition this new season. Was it because of Xiao Shiqin’s and Life Extinguisher’s return? Had Xiao Shiqin found new growth from Excellent Era’s defeat?</p>
<p>Misty Rain sold their Sharpshooter player entirely for the beautiful sisters Shu Keyi and Shu Kexin to take position. They obviously didn’t need to find any replacements. Adjustments had been made to the beautiful sisters’ characters, which had been displayed last season. It looked like the new season would be their time to shine.</p>
<p>Apart from that, various teams had a few transfers to fix up some minor patches. There were a few retirements and a few rookies selected for promotion. Overall, besides the huge changes from Excellent Era’s disbandment, Fang Rui was the only core player to transfer. The other teams followed their usual path and firmly walked along it. Doubt? Wavering? Each year had two transfer windows. In reality, these windows were for teams to patch these up. Perhaps an issue popped up during the course of the season, but by the time the transfer window ended, the majority of teams would fix these and start walking again. They might be going at different paces, but every team was advancing forward.</p>
<p>Two months passed by in a flash. On 9/1, the transfer window closed. It also happened to be Monday, so the Esports Home gave a summary of this summer’s transfers. There wasn’t anything extremely shocking, but every team was moving towards a more steady direction. The transfer window had closed and the new season was about to begin. Each team began announcing their goals.</p>
<p>The powerhouses naturally talked about winning the championships. They had the confidence and the strength to back their words. The vast majority of teams could only aim for the playoffs as their goal. They felt too embarrassed to claim that they would become the champions. As for the bottom-tier teams, their goal was to keep their spots. Even though not much attention was paid to them, they definitely had to achieve it.</p>
<p>As for Happy?</p>
<p>Keep our spot and become the champions! Ye Xiu posted on his Weibo.</p>
<p>The following two comments were two orderly pair of ellipses! For a moment, everyone was speechless. They had heard of the saying: “With second secured, strive for first”, but keep our spot and become the champions? The two goals spoken were like the difference between heaven and earth. How could you say that?</p>
<p>As soon as Ye Xiu posted this Weibo, the players on the weak teams started livening up.</p>
<p>“Haha, then our goal will also be to keep our spots and become the champions!” Team Heavenly Sword’s Lou Guanning was the team’s boss, captain, and core player. Even if he didn’t have any spectacular achievements, he was already destined to be a legend in the history of Glory. He suddenly changed his Team Heavenly Sword’s goal.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Parade and Radiant also changed their goals for fun.</p>
<p>Seconded!</p>
<p>Seconded +1!</p>
<p>Keep our spots and become the champions. This slogan suddenly became the most popular slogan this new season. The powerhouses wanted to cry. Striving to become the champions was supposed to be a grandiose and magnificent goal! With all these people inappropriately making a mess out of things, their goals no longer gave off the same feeling.</p>
<p>In reality, the teams truly aiming to keep their spots didn’t have the heart to joke around.</p>
<p>Parade and Radiant shouldn’t have much trouble keeping their spots, but they also didn’t have much hope for making it to the playoffs. They were the kind that lacked pressure but also lacked motivation, so they could happily joke around.</p>
<p>But according to one person, while these later teams might just be joking, was Happy joking? Placing the two extremely disparate goals of keeping their spots and being the champions together might be a sign of the uneasiness in the depths of their heart.</p>
<p>“Yeah, even I can’t tell if Happy is strong or weak. It’s too scary.” Ye Xiu unexpectedly replied to this person.</p>
<p>“Ah… God Ye Qiu has noticed me! He replied back. Ah ah ah ah…” This person suddenly dissolved. He was a Ye Xiu fan in the end.</p>
<p>“Fuck, this Weibo commenter is pathetic!”</p>
<p>“Commenter, stand up!”</p>
<p>“Commenter, what happened!”</p>
<p>There were a few who cared about the question of Happy’s strength.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll know the answer soon!” The Pro Alliance’s official Weibo actually gave a reply. At the same time, the official Weibo released the new season’s schedule for the first match. The Samsara vs Happy match was highlighted.</p>
<p>Team Samsara, last season’s champions. As per convention, the reigning champions would be arranged to play a newly joined team to show the disparity between them. And this newly joined team would be the one invited into the Alliance. However, that was just an unwritten tradition, not an established rule. As a result, this season, the reigning champions would be facing Happy, the team that had advanced their way through the Challenger League.</p>
<p>Team Miracle felt like crying!</p>
<p>Truthfully speaking, the invited teams would usually be favored more than the Challenger League team because the teams that came from the Challenger League were usually the ones relegated from the previous seasons and then revived. Those teams weren’t fresh at all. Only these invited teams would be truly new teams. However, Happy was an exception this time. They became the first truly new team that had successfully made their way through the Challenger League. Thus, it was a tragedy for the invited team this time. How could the attention towards them be higher than the attention towards Happy? In the end, the opportunity to have the first match with the reigning champions was given to Happy.</p>
<p>Team Miracle wasn’t so delusional to think that they could make a name for themselves by beating the reigning champions. However, it had always been a form of care from the Alliance towards the new team. It looked like the love was being given to Happy though. It was as if Team Miracle was stuck in their stepmother’s home. Even more unfortunate for them was that Team Miracle mainly consisted of Team Excellent Era’s old players. Being reduced to a new team and being beaten by Happy were not without a relationship. How could they not be having complicated feelings towards them.</p>
<p>Samsara versus Happy might be the Alliance’s most hyped welcoming match for a new team. How would this match turn out? From the pro circle to the player circle to the media to the masses, the discussion lasted for days up until 9/5 when the first match took place. The result: Team Samsara swept Team Happy with a clean 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Chapter 1139: Feeling A Little Rusty</p>
<p>10 to 0. A clean sweep. There was no outcome more tragic than this.</p>
<p>The ones who disliked Happy were overjoyed. The ones who supported Happy felt worried. The harsher ones had already started trashing Happy: keep our spot and become the champions? Haha, good luck on the first half of that.</p>
<p>In reality, the newly joined team getting swept by the reigning champions was a common occurrence. Last season, Team Heavenly Swords had also been hyped up, but they returned with big zero as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the hype towards Team Heavenly Swords and Team Happy were very different. In countless people’s eyes, Happy wasn’t a weak team. A team with three All Stars was enough to qualify them to compete against any team in the Alliance. However, they were swept clean just like any other new team. It was truly too surprising.</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, the reporters had gathered, but the main guests hadn’t arrived yet. The reporters had been quietly discussing this topic for quite a while now. This opening match usually wasn’t given much attention. After all, it was a match between a strong team and a weak team. But this time, because of Happy, everyone thought it would be a match worth seeing. No one would have imagined that it would be no different than the opening matches of the past.</p>
<p>Finally, Happy’s players arrived at the press conference under the guidance of the staff. According to the Alliance’s rules, at least three players needed to attend the post-match press conference. They could come together or separately. It didn’t matter. Four players from Happy came out: Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>The three All-Stars had appeared. The reporters felt pleased but not satisfied. Everyone in Happy was a huge topic for discussion. The reporters hated how they couldn’t have every member of Happy reply to their questions. Where’s Team Blue Rain’s former captain, a grandpa nearly 30, Wei Chen? Where’s the beautiful rookie, Tang Rou? Where’s the player who came from a champion team and changed classes, Qiao Yifan? Where’s the punk who wasn’t all that skilled yet dared to play the number one most difficult class, a Summoner? Where was that infamous scrap picker from the Heavenly Domain? Where was that Cleric, who held an important position but was somewhat lacking? Get over here! Only then would their cravings be satisfied!</p>
<p>There was no hope now though.</p>
<p>When the four appeared, the reporters carefully read their expressions. They wanted to see how they were affected by this disastrous loss. However, all they saw were four calm and composed faces. Even Steamed Bun, this new rookie, was unperturbed. Speaking of which, this person had only participated for a brief moment in the final Challenger League press conference, no? He had cultivated such a professional aura that fast?</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Happy’s four players took their seats. The press conference began. Numerous reporters raised their hands. Ye Xiu picked a random one. The person picked asked what everyone wanted to know.</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on being swept in your opening match?” The reporter asked.</p>
<p>“I’m very calm, but you guys don’t seem to be. It’s a commonly seen outcome. What’s there to panic about?” Ye Xiu asked back.</p>
<p>Panic? We’re not panicking. We’re just excited about this subject, okay? The reporters silently criticized. The reporter that had been picked was stumped by this response though. The others could ridicule Ye Xiu in their minds all they wanted, but it wasn’t convenient for him to say: “We were just excited because you guys got swept.” He could only open his mouth and reply with an “Ah?”</p>
<p>“In the past, new teams being swept by the reigning champions was a common occurrence, no? Our Happy has always stayed low-profile, so of course it turned out the same as everyone else,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t think there’s ever been a new team that claimed that they would become the champions, you call that… low-profile?” In the end, someone wasn’t able to resist and stood up to fire back.</p>
<p>“You guys don’t understand!” Ye Xiu said, “When Team Heavenly Swords joined the Alliance, they had originally wanted to become the champions too, but it was because of my advice that they stayed low-profile! In the end, they didn’t claim they would become the champions.”</p>
<p>This reply could be considered a mini scoop. The reporters at the scene quickly passed this news onto their colleagues on the other side. Coincidentally, the other side was the post-match press conference for Heavenly Sword’s match. Team Heavenly Swords just happened to be sitting on stage too. The reporters, who received this information, were jumping with joy. Nothing noteworthy had happened and this press conference was about to end. Suddenly, everyone raised their hands in unison and waved it towards the front.</p>
<p>This sudden commotion frightened Lou Guanning. Did he say something wrong? For a moment, Lou Guanning didn’t dare call on a reporter and immediately recalled what he had just said. But after confirming several times that he had said nothing wrong, he very carefully picked a reporter at the front.</p>
<p>This reporter was excited. He was talking before he even stood up: “In Team Happy’s press conference, God Ye Xiu revealed that Team Heavenly Swords’ goal last season had been to become the champions too. It was only because of his advice that you didn’t… um… um… is this true?” This reporter was even having trouble finding the right words.</p>
<p>Lou Guanning suddenly started to sweat. It got exposed! Become the champions? Heavenly Swords could only say it was a joke. If they actually said it was real, wouldn’t they become the jokes?</p>
<p>“It’s just a joke. That was only a joke,” Lou Guanning immediately said.</p>
<p>“Really? Then, when Heavenly Swords claimed that their goal would be to keep their spot and become the champions, could this be your ambitions showing?” The reporter asked.</p>
<p>“Every pro player has this kind of ambition, no?” Lou Guanning regained his composure and started speaking confidently. It was just a small leak. How could he be stumped by something like this?</p>
<p>At Happy’s press conference, Ye Xiu was currently talking: “Speaking of which, hasn’t the Alliance always arranged the other new team to challenge the champions? Why did they suddenly arrange for us to challenge the champions? This sudden change really caught us off guard! We thought we’d be playing against those old devils, Tyranny!”</p>
<p>Old devils! Aren’t you one too!!!</p>
<p>The reporters were sullen. They really wanted to fire back! However, what they wanted to say wasn’t suitable for a place like a press conference! For the first time, the reporters felt like they were the disadvantaged group and could only watch as Ye Xiu rambled on freely. They really wanted to interrupt, but it wouldn’t be good to, so they could only stifle their frustration.</p>
<p>“So you’re saying it’s the Alliance’s arrangements that led to Happy not performing ideally this round?” The reporters could only word it in this way.</p>
<p>“I never said that.” Ye Xiu continued to evade the question.</p>
<p>“Then, what are your thoughts on your own individual performance this match?” A reporter asked.</p>
<p>In the previous match, Ye Xiu first came out in the group arena as their third player. He went up against Samsara’s third player, Zhou Zekai, but lost. Afterwards, in the team competition, Samsara attacked even more ferociously. Happy wasn’t able to hang on for very long. If you only took a look at Ye Xiu’s performance, it wasn’t too bad. He didn’t make any terrible mistakes, but there also weren’t any particularly bright spots either.</p>
<p>“Mm, it’s been too long since I’ve played a pro match. I was feeling a bit rusty,” Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>This… what were they supposed to say! It was true that not competing in high-level league would have an impact on his condition, but he seemed quite fierce when he fought against Excellent Era! Was that a good reason?</p>
<p>The reporters were doubtful. Their gazes shifted to Su Mucheng. Just when they were about to ask, she took the initiative to speak up: “It’s been too long since I’ve played a pro match. I was feeling a bit rusty.”</p>
<p>Su Mucheng had faced Samsara’s vice-captain, Jiang Botao, but lost.</p>
<p>A copy and paste! The reporters fumed. But the problem was that Su Mucheng had been relegated along with Excellent Era for a year. She hadn’t played in a high-level league either. After serious consideration, Happy’s reasoning… held up?</p>
<p>Their gazes shifted again.</p>
<p>“I haven’t played a Qi Master in a long time. I was feeling a bit rusty,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>Okay, even though it was another copy paste answer, it was definitely a legitimate reason. He transferred in the last third of June and switched to a Qi Master. It had only been a month since then. It was normal for him to not do too well in his first match with a new class. Fang Rui was the second player for the group arena. Samsara’s Sun Xiang had been the first to come out. After Sun Xiang beat Happy’s Tang Rou, he nearly completed a 1v2 and almost beat Fang Rui too. In the end, even though Fang Rui won, it didn’t take long for him to lose the second round. He practically left two players for Ye Xiu, and one of those was Zhou Zekai.</p>
<p>“Good joke. On the other hand, look at how sincere I am,” Fang Rui said to Ye Xiu after leaving the stage, and was met with a kick.</p>
<p>The reporters received three “I was feeling a bit rusty.” Afterwards, they looked towards Happy’s fourth player, Steamed Bun. He came out in the individual competition, but lost to Samsara’s All-Star Grappler, Lu Boyuan. Steamed Bun had given quite a few frights to the enemy. For a new player, this loss could be considered as an honorable one. He could completely feel satisfied with his performance today.</p>
<p>However, Steamed Bun looked at everyone and then immediately copied the previous three’s responses: “I’ve never played in a pro match before. I was feeling a bit rusty.”</p>
<p>Fuck! What was that supposed to mean? Are you saying that if you weren’t feeling rusty, you would have beaten Lu Boyuan? The others might have been away from the pro scene for too long or switched classes, so “feeling rusty” was possible, but you’re a genuine rookie. What do you mean “rusty”? You can’t be rusty in the first place!</p>
<p>Fuck! The reporters could only restrain their desire to curse at them. What an uncomfortable feeling! A few people had even left the venue with their hands against their hips. Those guys had probably left out of anger!</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on Happy’s future this season?” A reporter was determined to keep asking questions.</p>
<p>“Keep our spot and become the champions,” Ye Xiu said earnestly.</p>
<p>“Become the champions,” Su Mucheng said.</p>
<p>“What else did I come here for?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“What happened to keeping our spot? We don’t need it anymore?” Steamed Bun saw that his two seniors had gotten rid of the “keep our spot” part and felt discontent.</p>
<p>“Becoming the champions implies that we’ll have kept our spot,” Fang Rui lectured Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>“Oh, that makes sense!” Steamed Bun sighed.</p>
<p>They couldn’t… take it any longer. The reporters felt defeated. They had at least found two things from this interview though. This sweep hadn’t damaged Happy’s morale. What’s more, Fang Rui seemed to be meshing together well with Happy! At least personality wise.</p>
<p>Chapter 1140: First Round</p>
<p>Happy may have been swept by Samsara, but they won versus the press conference reporters. After routing the reporters, the four left the stage in high spirits. When they left through the passageway for the players, they just happened to bump into Samsara, who would be participating in the next part of the press conference.</p>
<p>Zhou Zekai, Jiang Botao, Sun Xiang.</p>
<p>For the opening round and a good beginning, Samsara hadn’t held back and had sent out their three All-Stars. Even though Sun Xiang’s year at Excellent Era had been a devastating failure, he was still young and people still looked highly upon his future. From this match, it could be seen that Sun Xiang was meshing well with Samsara. There was no point talking about the individual competition, but in the team competition, he had done a great job assuming the responsibilities of an attacker. One Autumn Leaf in the front. Cloud Piercer in the back. The duo tore apart Happy’s formation as if everyone in Happy was a dead branch. It was easy to foresee that this wouldn’t be the only time the duo would go on a rampage. This duo would certainly become a nightmare in the entire Alliance for a long time. Many reporters were already describing them in this way.</p>
<p>“Senior!” After bumping into Happy in the passageway, Samsara’s Jiang Botao gave a polite greeting to Ye Xiu. The winners would often console the losers. It seemed like Jiang Botao wanted to do the same.</p>
<p>“Mm, I’m glad to see how outstanding the younger generation is!” Ye Xiu sighed.</p>
<p>Sun Xiang rolled his eyes. Because of this person, he had been put into a difficult situation. However, he had gained a lot of experience from these failures. But if it had to be said that he felt gratitude for Ye Xiu beating him, Sun Xiang wasn’t so sweet. He still wanted to ruthlessly crush him. In today’s match, he had gone all out, and Samsara had achieved a perfect victory. However, in his heart, he didn’t feel like he had beaten Ye Xiu. Was it because it wasn’t a direct confrontation? Sun Xiang was somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>Before anyone in Samsara could reply, Fang Rui nodded his head: “Yes, I’m glad too.”</p>
<p>Zhou Zekai stared at Fang Rui but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Haha, aren’t you and Little Zhou both from the same generation?” Jiang Botao laughed.</p>
<p>“Really? Who told him to always be so quiet. I forgot.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Pro players should speak with their play!” Jiang Botao said.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll give a good talk with you guys next time.” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“See you next time.”</p>
<p>“See you next time.”</p>
<p>The two sides departed after a brief exchange. Samsara’s press conference went more like how an opening round press conference should go. Most of the discussion was focused on their goals for the new season. Their new player Sun Xiang was given a lot of attention and was asked about his thoughts on Samsara and how he was fitting in with the team.</p>
<p>The four passed through the player passageway and returned to the guest team’s lounge at Samsara’s stadium. They didn’t take a moment to sit down and take a break. They pushed open the door and called out to the others inside: “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Happy left Samsara’s stadium and returned to City H with their zero points. Saying that they didn’t care at all about their zero points obviously wasn’t possible. On the plane, Chen Guo was just sitting and she wasn’t feeling comfortable. She looked at Su Mucheng, who was seated next to her, and wanted to chat, but then she saw that Su Mucheng was looking at the tablet in Ye Xiu’s hands.</p>
<p>“What’s he watching?” Chen Guo asked curiously.</p>
<p>“The VOD for the match that just ended.” Su Mucheng said.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Chen Guo didn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>Happy wasn’t the only one playing their first match. Happy was already on their way back home; the matches going on in the other stadiums had already ended as well.</p>
<p>Team Miracle, the other new team alongside Team Happy, hadn’t received the champion sweep. Instead, they had been swept by Team Tyranny. Truthfully speaking, Team Miracle wasn’t that bad. They had joined when Team Excellent Era disbanded. Seizing this opportunity, they had fished up quite a few things including three of Team Excellent Era’s players. In terms of their players, Team Miracle was actually superior to last season’s Team Heavenly Swords. Unfortunately, apart from some leftovers from Team Excellent Era, Team Miracle didn’t bring anything fresh to the Alliance, so the attention received was less than that of last year’s Team Heavenly Swords.</p>
<p>Speaking of Team Heavenly Swords, their announcement that Sun Zheping would be returning and joining their team had led to a heated discussion. After all, the last time they checked, Sun Zheping had been with Happy in the Challenger League. Everyone thought that he would return along with Happy. Who would have thought that he would turn around and run to Team Heavenly Swords?</p>
<p>For Heavenly Sword’s opening match, they happened to be matched with Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>First, it was Zhang Jiale. Then, it was Sun Zheping. Hundred Blossom’s two kings had retired then returned, but neither of them chose to go back to their team.</p>
<p>When Zhang Jiale returned, the fans cried and cursed, unable to understand and accept it. As for Sun Zheping? When he had fought with Happy in the Challenger League, people had foreseen this development. However, Sun Zheping had been away from the scene for a long time now. The sentiment towards him had lessened drastically. What’s more, when he returned, he had been in the Challenger League, so everyone felt like he wasn’t being too serious about it and was just having some fun. On the other hand, Zhang Jiale had returned and joined Tyranny. It was obvious that he had gone over because of their fame. In comparison, Sun Zheping’s return truly didn’t set off any big waves. There was still some noise though. The reporters also knew that this could be considered a noteworthy topic. As a result, in the press conference, someone tossed out this question.</p>
<p>Sun Zheping’s return didn’t unfold as magnificently as Zhang Jiale’s, but Sun Zheping himself was a lot fiercer than Zhang Jiale. When he was asked “Why did you choose Heavenly Swords and not Hundred Blossoms,” his reply was just three words: I wanted to.</p>
<p>Everything there was to know about Sun Zheping’s situation had pretty much been uncovered when he had been with Happy. Everyone already knew that his hand injury wasn’t fully healed. He could play, but he couldn’t play for long. He was incapable of becoming a pro team’s main force.</p>
<p>Thus, many smart people had already guessed why Sun Zheping chose to go to Heavenly Swords.</p>
<p>He clearly had an appropriate reason that everyone could understand, but instead, he gave this three-word reply.</p>
<p>“I wanted to” indicated that he wasn’t going to give an explanation.</p>
<p>This was just how Sun Zheping was. His hand injury meant that he could never become a true pro player again, but he himself hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>In the match between Hundred Blossoms and Heavenly Swords, Hundred Blossoms won 8 to 2. Heavenly Swords had won two points in the individual competition, one of which had been gotten by Sun Zheping. Many people felt it was regrettable. It had been many years since he had left the pro scene, yet even with an injury, he could still perform to such a level. If he hadn’t gotten his injury, what status would Sun Zheping have in the current pro scene?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no ifs in this world….</p>
<p>Apart from that, the opening round had seven other matches. There weren’t too many particularly noteworthy confrontations. This was also how the Pro Alliance always arranged the league schedule. It was the opening round! Satisfying the fans’ curiosity towards the teams’ adjustments during the summer was enough. They didn’t need to set up anything special.</p>
<p>Seven matches.</p>
<p>Team Blue Rain beat Team Bright Green 9 to 1.</p>
<p>Team Tiny Herb swept Team Lightly 10 to 1.</p>
<p>Team Wind Howl beat Team Conquering Clouds 9 to 1.</p>
<p>Team Misty Rain beat Team Seaside 8 to 2.</p>
<p>Team Void barely beat Team 301 6 to 4.</p>
<p>Team Thunderclap beat Team Parade 7 to 3.</p>
<p>Team Royal Style beat Team Radiant 7 to 3.</p>
<p>There were no surprises. The teams that should have won won. The teams that should have lost lost. Although, in regards to the competitive format, with everyone vying for points, there wasn’t technically a win or lose. However, out of habit, everyone still considered the team with more points as the winner and the other team as the loser for every match.</p>
<p>From this first round, the placings were currently Tyranny, Samsara, and Tiny Herb tied for first with 10 points. Wind Howl and Blue Rain tied for fourth with 9 points. Misty Rain at sixth with 8 points. Royal Style and Thunderclap tied for seventh with 7 points… in last were obviously the three teams that hadn’t won a single point: Happy, Miracle, and Lightly.</p>
<p>Team Lightly was a mid-tier team in the Alliance, neither good nor bad and rather invisible. (Author’s Note: Yes, very invisible. It wasn’t until I officially started writing about the Pro League did I realize that there was still 1 team missing out of 20. And thus, Team Lightly was born!) If they matched against a powerhouse, losing badly was nothing surprising.</p>
<p>As for Happy and Miracle, the Alliance’s tradition continued. Who had these two face against the finalists last season?</p>
<p>These three teams all had 0 points, but Happy was thrown to the bottom. Unfortunately, placings were done by points and then by reverse alphabetical order. Happy started with the letter H, which came before Miracle’s M and Lightly’s L*.</p>
<p>Season ten’s opening round ended with these results. It was hard to predict how this season would go based on these results though. It was just that Happy, the team that had been hyped, was swept by Samsara, so Happy was once again an unfathomable mystery.</p>
<p>Was Happy a good team or a bad team?</p>
<p>The media was discussing this question. The players were discussing this question. But all of them were simply outsiders in the scene. The ones with the headache were the Alliance’s teams. They were the ones who needed to rack their brains to figure out how they should be looking at Happy.</p>
<p>Each team found something from the VOD of Happy versus Samsara. This information was too precious. In general, there were practically no recordings of Happy against high-skill level. Only last year’s match versus Happy could be considered as one.</p>
<p>As soon as they started studying Happy, all of the teams realized that there were many things needed to be studied.</p>
<p>Not only did Happy have a bunch of rookies, even among the three old veterans, they were only sort of familiar with Su Mucheng. The other two had switched classes! Since they had started again from scratch, it meant that the teams needed to start up their research on them from scratch too. It was a bit better for Fang Rui. There were footsteps to follow. However, Ye xiu made them feel nauseated.</p>
<p>Unspecialized? Everyone knew what an unspecialized was. They knew the theory behind one and could train one too. But the problem was that they didn’t have a Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. An unspecialized without the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was completely different from an unspecialized with one. They had no way of testing an unspecialized themselves nor could they imitate one. Their only source of information was from match VODs. There were really only two matches significant enough to watch though, so they could only watch these over and over again.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was clearly someone that everyone was incomparably familiar with, but he was a completely mystery right now. This sort of feeling didn’t feel good at all.</p>
<p>You bastard! You’ve already retired, so why’d you have to return? If you’re going to return, why’d you switch classes? If you’re going to switch classes, why’d you have to choose an unspecialized? If you’re going to choose an unspecialized, why’d you have to have an exclusive weapon?</p>
<p>Chapter 1141: Which Match to Watch?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the pro teams, Happy was a troublesome existence. In the past, when had they ever needed to spend so much effort studying a new Alliance team? Those teams on the border of relegations were no different than cheerleader teams in the eyes of the powerhouses. However, for Happy, they felt uneasy not taking them seriously. Fortunately, matches were played one by one. Over the entire season, each team would at most bump into Happy twice. The teams scheduled far from Happy weren’t in a rush. On the other hand, the teams scheduled closer to Happy were rather worried such as Team Hundred Blossoms, who would be playing Happy next.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms had made it to the playoffs last season and even gave quite the trouble to Team Tyranny. After waving goodbye to Blood and Blossoms, their team became better and better. Yu Feng, the new generation’s number one Berserker stood firm in Team Hundred Blossoms. His strength had erased Sun Zheping’s influence to some extent. Along with the passing of time, Team Hundred Blossoms had been rather indifferent about encountering Sun Zheping, at least, they hadn’t been as nervous as facing Happy.</p>
<p>Because Hundred Blossoms was a team on the fringe of the playoff level, it was very possible that a slight slip would lead to their playoff spot being taken, so in their view, Happy was an especially worrisome opponent. The difference in points this round might determine which of the two teams would be making into the playoffs.</p>
<p>However, no matter how diligent they might be, there were only two real matches of Happy to look at. In their match against Excellent Era, Happy had displayed closely interlinked and masterful strategic planning, but against Samsara, before Happy could even get their tactics going, Samsara had scattered them.</p>
<p>“Samsara is even stronger this season!” Team Hundred Blossom’s Cleric, Mo Chuchen, said.</p>
<p>But soon afterwards, under the gazes of everyone else in the team, Mo Chuchen shifted topics in a fluster: “Focus on Happy, focus on Happy.”</p>
<p>Yes, he had mistaken what was important here. But the problem was that there really wasn’t much to see from Happy this match. Happy hadn’t been able to display any of their tactics before collapsing.</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, Happy threw the word “rustiness” left and right, leading to a complete collapse of the reporters. But from Team Hundred Blossom’s careful analysis, they felt like this rustiness might really be the truth?</p>
<p>Samsara had won two consecutive championships. Their strength didn’t need to be questioned. Their team was an aggressive team, especially after the addition of Sun Xiang and One Autumn Leaf. With such strong attackers, their tempo only quickened. As a result, when Happy ran into Samsara, from their performance in the team competition, they indeed had been overwhelmed by Samsara’s fast pace. Happy’s decisions were always a half beat too slow. Even though they tried hard to make adjustments to their tactical rhythm, by the time they finished adjusting, Samsara was already on the next beat.</p>
<p>After all, Samsara was different than Excellent Era. Excellent Era was a team that Ye Xiu understood all too well. When fighting against Excellent Era, his tactics were clearly targeted towards them. Excellent Era had also been crushing noobs in the Challenger League for an entire year, so they had somewhat fallen from the pace of the pro scene. How could they compare to the reigning champions?</p>
<p>Happy needed to adapt to the pace of the pro matches. For Hundred Blossoms, this was undoubtedly good news. Thus, the general direction of this upcoming match was more or less confirmed now.</p>
<p>Fight fast!</p>
<p>Hundred Blossom’s players reached a consensus. As for the specifics, each team had their own class compositions and styles. For the following week, they would be undergoing targeted practice for utilizing this playstyle. This was the pro scene. This was a pro match. How each battle played out depended on the opponents.</p>
<p>The week passed quickly. The second round of the league had begun.</p>
<p>In this round, there were two important matches. The first was between Team Happy and Team Hundred Blossoms. Everyone had been discussing how strong Happy was exactly over the course of the week.</p>
<p>The other match was between Team Thunderclap and Team Void. After Xiao Shiqin returned to Thunderclap, there had been a few more adjustments made during the summer transfer window, revealing the team’s newfound ambition. As for Void, their dual Ghostblades were legendary, but this duo always gave people a feeling that these two weren’t able to support the general picture. However, people saw room for growth from Void, not from transfers but from the interior.</p>
<p>Last season, Blue Rain’s rookie Lu Hanwen shined. In his first year in the Alliance, he had been chosen as an All-Star. Another star was rising. In the end, the Best Rookie went unsurprisingly to Lu Hanwen. However, was this decision truly without controversy? For Team Void’s fans, that was absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>Last season, a formidable rookie had appeared in their team too. An Exorcist: Ge Caijie.</p>
<p>Ge Caijie was 19 this year. No matter how it was looked at, he was at an age brimming with youth. However, placed among pro players in an competitive scene getting younger and younger, compared to the 15 year old Lu Hanwen, the 19 year old Ge Caijie was immediately labelled with traits such as mature and staid, words that didn’t suit youths.</p>
<p>Ge Caijie was indeed a serious person with an air of a great general. Alongside Glory’s famous Ghostblade duo, he displayed a terror never before seen in a rookie. His performance was always consistent. Even though the Ghostblade duo was still the core of Team Void, the air of a leading role appeared around him. This wasn’t him trying to overtake his seniors. It was simply his playstyle. He was someone with the potential to become the core of a team, a person that could carry the team’s banner.</p>
<p>Everyone had always been waiting for a good helper to the Ghostblade duo, but right now, a youth, who sometimes made the Ghostblade duo change from leads to support, had appeared. The two seniors seemed to have no disagreements towards him. And whenever team Void’s Ge Caijie performed spectacularly, they always obtained good results.</p>
<p>For this type of player, even if he didn’t grow to become the core of a team, he would still be a great general in a team. It was just a pity that his seriousness made him different than Lu Hanwen, who was brimming with energy and passion. The attention towards him was far less. Team Void had always been lamenting at this injustice. In the selection for Best Rookie, Lu Hanwen snatched away the majority of the votes, leaving a huge gap between the second place Ge Caijie.</p>
<p>This didn’t affect Ge Caijie though. Another summer had passed and he became even more mature. Last season, he had been the new rookie of the team and now he had already come a player that Team Void couldn’t lack. The opening round of the league further proved this point.</p>
<p>In the opening round, Team Void fought against Team 301 in a bitter battle. In this round, Ge Caijie had been crucial to the points won by Team Void. He had won a point in the individual competition. In the team copetition, Team 301 took the initiative, but he stood firm and led the team for a counterattack, resulting in a huge victory..</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, Team 301’s captain, Yang Cong, praised Ge Caijie. He even said that Ge Caijie reminded him of Wang Jiexi despite their playstyles being entirely different. Afterwards, Team 301’s All-Star Grappler Li Yihui, who had once been a part of Team Tiny Herb but had been traded for Team 301’s Xu Bin, also expressed his approval towards his captain’s praise for Ge Caijie.</p>
<p>Team Thunderclap versus Team Void was the match chosen to be broadcast. Even though everyone’s curiosity towards Happy hadn’t been erased, the broadcast could only choose a single match. They couldn’t only broadcast Happy’s matches this season, no?</p>
<p>On 9/12, the second round of the Glory Professional League’s tenth season started. The viewers tuning into watch saw Team Void’s stadium as scheduled. But the commentator Pan Lin seemed to be even more uneasy than anyone else.</p>
<p>“Hello friends, this is the second round of the Glory Professional League’s tenth season, Thunderclap versus Void. The players on both sides have entered the stadium. First up will be the individual competition, of course. And at the same time, there’s another important match between Hundred Blossoms and Happy, which is taking place in City H. I’m sure everyone knows that after Excellent Era was defeated in the Challenger League last season, their boss Tao Xuan sold practically all of Excellent Era’s assets. Many people probably thought that Excellent Era’s competitive stadium was a part of these assets, but in reality, Excellent Era’s stadium used to be called Xiaoshan Gymnasium, a public gymnasium in City H. When the Glory Professional League was established, the competition soon needed this type of venue, so Excellent Era rented it for long-term use. Later on, the name was changed to the Excellent Era Stadium. The lease was suspended ahead of time and the stadium has returned to the original Xiaoshan Gymnasium. Right now, Happy is temporarily leasing it for their stadium. In truth, this isn’t surprising! This is the only venue in City H with the conditions to display Glory’s projection technology!”</p>
<p>“Ahem!” A cough interrupted Pan Lin’s introduction. After a pause, Pan Lin realized that he was currently commentating the match between Thunderclap and Void, but after only a short introduction, he had suddenly shifted focus to Happy. The director had told him to give updates on the situation between Happy and Hundred Blossoms. It would be enough to just say a few words when a result came out. He wasn’t supposed to go too far though!</p>
<p>“Let’s get back to the scene.” Pan Lin immediately pulled the subject back from Xiaoshan Gymnasium. His old partner Li Yibo gave a loud laugh: “It looks like our Little Pan has quite the interest in the match between Hundred Blossom and Happy!”</p>
<p>“Uh, we’ll be giving updates on that match from time to time.” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“Okay, the match between Thunderclap and Void will be starting soon. First up is the individual competition. The first two players to come up will be… Thunderclap’s Dai Yanqi and Void’s Li Xun!” Pan Lin started focusing on the present match.</p>
<p>And at the same time, standing inside the venue renamed to “Xiaoshan Gymnasium”, Ye Xiu let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Even though the name had changed, the venue itself hadn’t. The only addition to it was equipment for the projection technology.</p>
<p>I’m back. A year and eight months to stand back here. My name has changed. My character has changed. But my will to compete will never change.</p>
<p>“I’ll be going.” Ye Xiu called out to his teammates and stepped towards the stage.</p>
<p>“Dai Yanqi has open fired! For now, Li Xun is unable to approach and is moving around. A beautiful Air Jump! He jumped backwards in midair to dodge the magic coming at him! Ah! Happy sent out Ye Xiu as their first player!!”</p>
<p>The viewers tuning into the match were listening to Pan Lin commentating the intense battle between Elemenalist and Assassin, when a piece of news about Happy suddenly popped up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Chapter 1142: A Nervous Rookie</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was the first one to walk onto the stage for Happy. Pan Lin was not the only one who was shocked. Everyone in the stadium, including the players from Team Hundred Blossoms, were astonished.</p>
<p>According to the usual practices, the ace player would appear in the group arena to fight for the two points. The ace player rarely appeared in the individual competition. With Happy’s arrangements, was Happy giving up on the group arena, targeting the three points in the individual competition?</p>
<p>There was no need to dwell on this thought. The list of names for the matches were set before the game. Zeng Xinran from Team Hundred Blossoms went on stage for this away-game.</p>
<p>Who was Zeng Xinran?</p>
<p>Before this match, no one knew.</p>
<p>He was a rookie promoted from the Hundred Blossom’s training camp this season. When his name was submitted to the league in the new season’s players list, it could be considered as his first public appearance in the circle. After that, he appeared Esport Home’s September 1st edition, introducing the team rosters for the Alliance’s twenty teams. All officially registered appeared in this list. Important transfers would have short introductions, but Zeng Xinran only had his name listed and popped up on Hundred Blossom’s team roster just like this. No press conference had been convened for him, so no reporters thought about interviewing him.</p>
<p>He was not a rookie who had gained the adoration of millions, but the team gave him a chance because of his skill. He became an official player and waited for the chance to appear on stage. Then, he would use his play to earn a name for himself in the league.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossom didn’t send him up for the opening match, so he sat idly on the bench. However, he wasn’t annoyed. Unless he was one of those so-called heavenly talents, this was something almost all rookies had to experience, even more so in Team Hundred Blossoms. They had watched as player came out of their training camp, sign a contract with them, and sit on the bench. He found opportunities here and there. He gradually became a part of the main roster, then the core of the team, then a God in the Alliance.</p>
<p>Tang Hao!</p>
<p>For every rookie sitting on the benches, there was nothing more encouraging than Tang Hao’s story.</p>
<p>Zeng Xinran inherited Delillo, the Brawler account Tang Hao left behind when he left Hundred Blossoms. He promised himself that he would be like Tang Hao and conquer the world, starting from the bench. He was able to get a chance to fight in their second round. For someone who knew Tang Hao’s story very well, he knew that he had gained an opportunity even earlier than Tang Hao. This fact raised his spirits.</p>
<p>He was moved and excited and didn’t even sleep well last night. He could finally step onto the stage. Unfortunately, his opponent just had to be Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Who didn’t know of Ye Xiu’s accomplishments in the early days? New rookies didn’t feel too pressured facing him though. This was because that era of glory was too far in the past. Only players who had played Glory for over ten years had the chance to personally witness that era. Zeng Xinyan obviously hadn’t played Glory for that long. By the time he started playing Glory and entered Hundred Blossoms’ training camp, Ye Xiu had already been labelled as outdated. Not long afterwards, he retired. When he returned, Excellent Era disbanded. Zeng Xinran indeed admired the amount of commotion this God could make, but he only started to learn about Ye Xiu’s skill when his team was preparing to fight Happy. Like everyone else, he only knew about the unspecialized and the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella in theory, but not much in actual practice.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms had been distressed for this very reason. However, Zeng Xinran was relatively at ease because he didn’t think he would have the opportunity to fight Ye Xiu. He would be appearing in the individual competition, so the team competition was irrelevant. He didn’t expect to meet Happy’s core and God in the individual competition.</p>
<p>However, what he didn’t think would happen happened. He was a rookie who would playing in his first competitive match in his professional career. Unfortunately, he just had to face a God who had fought hundreds of battles.</p>
<p>The thunderous applause given to Ye Xiu in the stadium caused half of Zeng Xinran’s body to go numb. He realized that competition wasn’t as simple as he had imagined. Why did he feel so suffocated in such a big stadium? Happy was a new team that had only recently entered the league, yet they already had so many fans. So noisy……</p>
<p>Zeng Xinran entered the player booth. The player booth was completely cut-off from the outside world. However, his brain was still in a mess. The amount of noise and the feeling of suffocation lingered in his mind, and he was unable to wipe it away.</p>
<p>One minute had passed. Ye Xiu pressed ready after logging on with Lord Grim and joining the arena room. However, there was no sign of activity from Zeng Xinran.</p>
<p>What happened? The crowd became restless, so the referee immediately took action to see what was up with Zeng Xinran. Then, he saw a player whose body was completely rigid and tense.</p>
<p>It was pressure.</p>
<p>The referee was experienced and this wasn’t the first time he had encountered such a situation. He only needed to glance at the player to tell that he was too nervous.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” The referee sighed and knew the player was definitely not prepared, but the match couldn’t give him liimitless time to prepare. He could only confirm with this method: if he was ready, then the match would start at once, if not, then he would forfeit.</p>
<p>Zeng Xinran obviously knew the rules, so he immediately nodded. Under the guidance of the referee, he logged on, entered the room with his character, and pressed ready……</p>
<p>They soon reached the end of the countdown. Both Lord Grim and Delillo loaded into the map.</p>
<p>Delillo was the character Tang Hao had previously used. When he had been present, Hundred Blossoms made an effort to upgrade it. But after his departure, Hundred Blossom went back to their old Berserker and Spitfire combo. Delillo was no longer an account the club focused on. After the Level 75 update, Delillo naturally wasn’t a priority. Now that the account had been handed down to a rookie, the majority of the equipment was still as Tang Hao had left it. Upgrades in the equipment were made through upgraded Level 75 Orange equipment instead of upgraded Level 75 Silver equipment.</p>
<p>In comparison, Happy’s character weakness wasn’t so obvious before Delillo. Lord Grim’s Myriad Manifestation Umbrella was at Level 70. Even though he didn’t have any other Silver equipment, a full set of Level 75 Orange equipment was enough to compare with Silver equipment at Level 70. As for character-player suitability, in reality, only the powerhouses had the resources to be so picky.</p>
<p>The moment Ye Xiu entered the room, he had Lord Grim sprint ahead. As for Zeng Xinran, he was still in a daze. He didn’t do anything and was still trying to sort out his emotions.</p>
<p>The audience didn’t know about Zeng Xinran’s situation. All they saw was that the old general was charging forward impatiently, while the rookie calmy stood his ground. Had those two switched accounts?</p>
<p>The audience didn’t know about Zeng Xinran’s situation, neither did Ye Xiu. Ye Xiu didn’t have any way to learn about such a new rookie, so he could only learn as the match progressed.</p>
<p>However, when Lord Grim reached the center of the map, he didn’t see his opponent.</p>
<p>Is he moving strategically?</p>
<p>For any pro player, this observation was instinctive. Ye Xiu immediately looked over the terrain. This was a home game for Happy, so they picked the map themselves. Even if he closed his eyes, he wouldn’t walk the wrong way on this map. He immediately took note of any locations that were possible for a sneak attack, but he couldn’t sense any movement from the opponent.</p>
<p>Is he playing dirty?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu wondered. The Brawler was a class that could play dirty, so Ye Xiu took caution and carefully looked around. He had Lord Grim move ahead while deliberately making mistakes. No response.</p>
<p>Zeng Xinran from Hundred Blossom was still trying to regain his composure at the spawn point, so he hadn’t moved. Even if the audience watched from a bird’s eye view, none of them knew what was happening. Those who had watched Happy’s matches in the Challenger League sent glaces towards Wei Chen at Happy’s bench. Playing dirty by standing at the spawn point was similar to this old player! Happy had once used this tactic against their opponents. Was this retribution for Happy?</p>
<p>If this was the Challenger League, the audience might have been a bit excited, but this was different! This was an official league match, as well as a home game for Happy. Even though their popularity couldn’t be compared with the early years of Excellent Era, it was definitely enough for the bottom-tier and mid-tier teams be jealous of! Having a large audience meant that lot of people bought tickets. This was probably where teams earned most of their day to day income from.</p>
<p>At this home game, Happy’s fans started to feel a little worried. They were afraid of the strange moves this foreign rookie from Hundred Blossoms would make.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the stadium started to grow heavy. Everyone watched Lord Grim gradually get closer to Delillo while the latter was calm as always.</p>
<p>At last, the two characters appeared in each other’s view. Ye Xiu saw Delillo, and Zeng Xinran saw Lord Grim.</p>
<p>After that, Delillo charged forward!</p>
<p>He sprinted straight without showing any signs of turning. There was no touch of tactics as he advanced straight ahead as if this was the deciding point.</p>
<p>He must be scheming something!</p>
<p>The audience thought to themselves. If this were really the deciding point in the match, what was he doing earlier? Was he just standing there to nurture his strength while exhausting the enemy? Franking speaking, that wasn’t possible in Glory. Many players would do random ineffective actions before they encountered their opponent as warm up. There must be some sort of scheme within all this for Zeng Xinran to just wait there doing nothing. It was just like what Wei Chen had done at Happy……</p>
<p>The audience didn’t have time to think any further because the two had started fighting already. Hundred Blossoms’ Zeng Xinran, a schemer in everyone’s minds, was sent flying backgrounds in the first exchange.</p>
<p>The audience was stunned, and Ye Xiu was also a bit astonished. He had been 120% careful, and had numerous variations and follow-ups prepared after Falling Flower Palm, but it turned out that Falling Flower Palm was all it took to send him flying away?</p>
<p>As for his follow-up……</p>
<p>Lord Grim missed when he struck with his spear. This was a rare mistake for veterans like Ye Xiu. It was simply because that palm hitting was too surprising.</p>
<p>The moment Delillo was about to reach the ground after being blown away, his body twitched and he lay flat on the ground.</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was dumbstruck. To even fail to Quick Recover, was he… really a pro player?</p>
<p>Even Ye Xiu was slightly dazed. He was playing in a pro match, right? He wasn’t in the Arena or the Challenger League, torturing scrubs, right?</p>
<p>Is it a trap? Ye Xiu didn’t move forward and instead used long-ranged skills. After a chain of ferocious attacks, his heart finally steadied.</p>
<p>It was impossible for this to be a trap. If it was, then this was way overboard. The player before him was simply playing really bad for some reason. Lord Grim rushed forward without any hesitation. He dispatched his opponent cleanly and won.</p>
<p>The audience was dumbstruck. They even forgot to applause and cheer for their team. What happened? This victory was too simple. Was Hundred Blossoms deliberately playing badly?</p>
<p>Chapter 1143: An Ordinary Veteran</p>
<p>Zeng Xinran wasn’t the first to rookie to lose a battle because of nerves, nor would he be the last. But no rookie would ever want their very first battle to have such an embarrassing ending.</p>
<p>This was the very first point obtained by Happy in the pro league, a memorable point won by Ye Xiu. The story stopped there, though, since there was nothing memorable about the process of winning the point. This wasn’t a match to be proud of.</p>
<p>Somehow, Happy won the point just like that. Aside from the judge, who had seen with his own eyes how nervous Zeng Xinran was, the only others who could really understand what had happened were his Hundred Blossom teammates.</p>
<p>Others didn’t know anything about Zeng Xinran, but his teammates understood his skill very well. After all, he was sent out for this official match because he had the skill necessary to possibly achieve a win. But in the end, his performance didn’t suit his actual abilities at all. The Hundred Blossoms players thought, and immediately knew that he had been too nervous.</p>
<p>It was common to be nervous, but strange to be nervous to this extent. But they couldn’t put more pressure on Zeng Xinran after this. When he came off stage, his teammates spoke words of comfort and encouragement to him, until the judge called for the second individual competitor to go onstage.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei.</p>
<p>An ordinary name that couldn’t get any more ordinary, just like his professional career.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei was a veteran player. After debuting in Season 3, he had played continuously for Team Hundred Blossoms. He wasn’t particularly talented, nor did he show any sort of breakthrough growth. Through the years, he was just another ordinary member of Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>He had seen Blood and Blossoms wreak havoc upon the Alliance. He had seen Sun Zheping’s tragic injury and untimely retirement. He had seen Zhang Jiale alone but still persevering in the fight. He had seen Tang Hao’s rapid rise from a benchwarmer to a God at the peak of the Alliance. All of this took place right beside him, and he experienced it all, yet hadn’t changed afterwards. In the end, he was just a very ordinary member of Hundred Blossoms. There were actually many pro players like this. They weren’t very eye-catching, and they wouldn’t often come up in the media or in conversations between ordinary gamers. However, they were still a very important component of the Alliance. It was just like how in real life, the majority of people were just ordinary people. Pro players were an extraordinary subset of Glory players, and Zhang Wei and the others were the most ordinary of this subset.</p>
<p>The second player in the individual competition for Hundred Blossoms’ away match at Happy was this ordinary player, Zhang Wei.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei went onstage, entered the player booth, swiped his account card, logged into the game, and joined the match room. He had repeated this process many times over the years and so didn’t need any sort of preparation. To him, it was as simple as eating a meal. Soon after entering the room, he saw his opponent enter: Steamed Bun Invasion.</p>
<p>Oh, it’s that confusing player.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei thought back to the research they had done prior to this match. This player named Bao Rongxing had earned that evaluation. This guy! He had good technical skill for sure, but his performance in matches was sometimes good and sometimes bad. If that were his only problem, they could just treat him as a player whose condition was unstable. But this guy… Sometimes his good would become bad, and sometimes his bad would miraculously produce good. His play followed no rules, and so it was impossible to devise any tactics to counter him. In the end, the plan was just four words: play it by ear.</p>
<p>And now the task of playing by ear had fallen upon Zhang Wei’s head.</p>
<p>Countdown. Loading match.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei’s character was a Witch called Endless Forest. Although he was an ordinary player, he had played in Hundred Blossoms for many years now, and his position was relatively stable, so his character Endless Forest was fairly good. Of course, it couldn’t compare to Vaccaria. Zhang Wei had debuted the same year as Wang Jiexi and played the same class, but his name was never mentioned with Wang Jiexi’s, because in people’s eyes there was nothing to compare.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei used this decent Witch, Endless Forest. The strategy of this match was to play by ear, so Zhang Wei’s original plan was to open with strategic change of position. But the map that Happy had chosen was simple and flat. With no cover, there was no way to surprise the opponent, so he had no choice but to directly charge forward.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun didn’t hesitate at all. As soon as the match started, he brazenly charged out, at the same time sending a message: “Let’s decide the winner!”</p>
<p>“Alright.” Upon seeing the opponent’s message, Zhang Wei sent a reply.</p>
<p>Soon enough, without dodging, or rather with nowhere to dodge, the two players met at the center of the map.</p>
<p>Both Brawler and Witch were close to mid-range fighters, but the Witch’s range of control was a bit larger. As a Mage, a Witch absolutely had to have some sort of AoE.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei’s actions were extremely simple. Endless Forest tossed a Lava Flask, which was the most common opening move for Witches in PvP. Throw a Lava Flask, it didn’t matter if you burned the opponent, just limit their movements. If they didn’t want to suffer damage from the lava, they could only go around…</p>
<p>Okay, he’s jumping over here!</p>
<p>The Lava Flask had instantly turned the area into a field of lava, but Steamed Bun Invasion leapt into the air. With a powerful Knee Attack, half jumping half attacking, he continued straight towards Endless Forest.</p>
<p>He managed to avoid the Lava Flask this way, but this kind of attack was just too reckless!</p>
<p>Endless Forest stepped to the side, and with a wave of his sleeve, a dark purple shadow flew out. It was the Witch skill Night Cloak, which could grab, and because it had a higher priority than Knee Attack, the grab could not be avoided with this skill.</p>
<p>The midair Steamed Bun Invasion looked like he crashed right into the Night Cloak, and he was immediately bound by the shadows and fell into the lava. But Zhang Wei wouldn’t let him get away with just that amount of damage. Endless Forest raised his broom and prepared to launch further attacks, only to see something small flying toward him and steadily growing larger. In an instant it filled his field of view, and he was hit by the Brick.</p>
<p>When was this Brick thrown?</p>
<p>Zhang Wei didn’t know, but he was sure that it was before his Night Cloak, otherwise it would have been interrupted by the Night Cloak’s grab. And now, the Brick had hit him and interrupted his attack, while the binding effect of Night Cloak had worn off already. Steamed Bun Invasion was in the lava, and although he was taking damage, it didn’t affect his movements.</p>
<p>Tyrannical Chain Punch!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei immediately wanted to have Endless Forest to dodge, but it was already too late. Steamed Bun Invasion was right in front of him. He got up and turned over, ignoring the lava’s damage and coming with a ruthless hammering blow. Zhang Wei would suffer in this exchange. But he didn’t really understand Steamed Bun Invasion’s usage of Tyrannical Chain Punch right now. Although this was a fierce attack, there were no good follow-up skills. It would make more sense to first use some smaller attacks to pave the way, then finish the combo with a Tyrannical Chain Punch. But Steamed Bun Invasion was decisive, directly using the final step and leaving it at that.</p>
<p>Right, leaving it at that.</p>
<p>After the Tyrannical Chain Punch, Steamed Bun Invasion rolled backward and retreated. This was the motion prescribed by the system at the end of this skill and was unavoidable. Of course, Endless Forest, who had just been battered by the Tyrannical Chain Punch wouldn’t be able to counterattack in such a short period of time. Otherwise, this attack would just become a skill where after it was used the player would be forced to suffer an attack.</p>
<p>So after this, the two characters stood up at almost the same time, and tossed out items at the same time.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun Invasion used Sand Toss, while Endless Forest used a Disperse Powder. If the opponent had any buffs, the Disperse Powder would get rid of them, and if they didn’t, then the Disperse Powder would reduce their speed.</p>
<p>The two scattered materials intersected in midair and continued toward their targets, neither affecting the other. Because they were close to each other and were both attacking, neither had time to dodge, and they were both struck at the same time. Steamed Bun Invasion’s movements instantly became slower, and Endless Forest had been a little late in turning his camera, so the Sand Toss reached his face. His field of view turned black.</p>
<p>Being Blind didn’t mean that you couldn’t move, so Zhang Wei immediately had Endless Forest to jump backward. The Blind effect from Sand Toss didn’t last very long, while the effects of Disperse Powder would last a solid 10 seconds. After the Blind wore off, he would still have plenty of time to counterattack.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei hopped backwards in darkness, but while doing so suddenly felt like his character had been hit by something. After seeing the status effect appear, he was startled. This… wasn’t this the lowered speed effect caused by Disperse Powder?</p>
<p>Tooth for Tooth!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei immediately knew that Steamed Bun had used this skill before his Disperse Powder, which allowed him to secretly learn the Disperse Powder skill. But as to why Steamed Bun activated Tooth for Tooth, Zhang Wei couldn’t understand at all. Even though the events had already passed and Disperse Powder had been stealthily learned, Zhang Wei still couldn’t understand why he would make such a move. Using such a powerful attack and then a Disperse Powder just pulled their speeds to the same level, he hadn’t established any sort of advantage!</p>
<p>While he was confused, the Blind wore off and his vision recovered, only for him to see Steamed Bun Invasion charging toward him..</p>
<p>This… there was still a large distance between them! How would Zhang Wei let himself be attacked so easily? He saw Steamed Bun Invasion raise his hand in preparation to throw something, and he was prepared to dodge, but he quickly saw that the direction in which he had raised his hand was simply too far off-target.</p>
<p>What direction is that?</p>
<p>Zhang Wei turned his camera to see where Steamed Bun Invasion had thrown that missed Poison Needle, and then suddenly, there was a clunk at the back of his head. He was hit by a Brick, knocked Dizzy!</p>
<p>Brick! Where’d it come from?</p>
<p>Zhang Wei didn’t know, but he had been Blind for a moment, so Steamed Bun Invasion must have used that time to find the right angle to pull it out. But Steamed Bun Invasion of course wouldn’t run around behind him to throw the Brick. After all, he couldn’t Teleport.</p>
<p>This Brick had originally been thrown at him almost head-on. The blind on Zhang Wei had worn off, but while he had still been fuzzy, Steamed Bun had come up with a diversion. That missed Poison Needle caused Zhang Wei to turn his camera, so he didn’t see the Brick and left the back of his head wide open.</p>
<p>This this this…</p>
<p>What kind of strategy was this? He’d never heard of such a thing before! Zhang Wei was utterly baffled. And in that Tooth for Tooth exchange, what was with that Disperse Powder? He understood that even less…</p>
<p>Chapter 1144: A Hurried Core</p>
<p>Zhang Wei couldn’t grasp Steamed Bun’s train of thought. At this moment, his Endless Forest was in a Dizzy state. No Glory player would miss this kind of opportunity to attack. Steamed Bun Invasion stepped forward. He gripped Endless Forest’s neck with a Strangle and let loose punches and kicks.</p>
<p>Witches had far better close combat capabilities compared to Elementalists. Enhancing the broom with magic dust had once been a popular playstyle. However, for defense, besides Battle Mages, who could activate Magic Shield to forcefully take a burst of damage, Mages were quite frail. After a Strangle combo along with the previous Tyrannical Chain Punch, Endless Forest’s health had dropped by 20%.</p>
<p>The opening wasn’t going well!</p>
<p>Endless Forest was able to escape from the combo and fly away with his broom. He hadn’t been able to find an opening to launch a counterattack, so he planned on resetting back to neutral and starting over.</p>
<p>However, this map had a vast empty horizon. Endless Forest could only pull a bit of distance between them. He wasn’t able to actually hide anywhere. While in the air, Zhang Wei had his character look back and saw Steamed Bun Invasion chasing closely after him. He could see all sorts of openings to attack and felt an unbearable urge to act.</p>
<p>“Could it be some sort of weird trick again?”</p>
<p>Zhang Wei carefully analyzed the situation and repeatedly reassured himself. Endless Forest leaped in the air and swept with his broom, using a Witch’s unique way of attacking to strike Steamed Bun Invasion.</p>
<p>Then, he saw Steamed Bun Invasion turn around and immediately run away.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei was puzzled. He was truly at a loss.</p>
<p>What is going on? As soon as I turned around to attack, he ran away. What is he thinking? He can’t be thinking of chasing me from behind and hoping that I stand still for him to attack me, right?</p>
<p>While still in a daze, he suddenly noticed an object flying towards him in his field of vision!</p>
<p>Another one!</p>
<p>This time, Zhang Wei was prepared. Endless Forest swept his broom in the air and twisted his body to dodge the Brick.</p>
<p>How dangerous!</p>
<p>It was a very normal attack, but Zhang Wei could feel cold sweat running down his back. He had lost focus for just an instant again. A little bit closer and that Brick would have hit. When fighting against this Steamed Bun, it’s really hard to concentrate!</p>
<p>During this time, Steamed Bun raised his hand again.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei didn’t even think about what Steamed Bun might be doing. He immediately had Endless Forest sweep his broom again to dodge.</p>
<p>A Poison Needle flitted by. Brawlers had quite a few mid-range attacks. After this Poison Needle, Steamed Bun Invasion raised his hand once more.</p>
<p>You’re going to keep going? What’s the point!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He had his Endless Forest sweep his broom in the air another time.</p>
<p>Huh? I didn’t move!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei blanked out. He immediately realized what had happened and wanted to cry. Trying to react now was too late. A Molotov Cocktail smashed into Endless Forest, setting him ablaze. Endless Forest turned into a giant fireball and crashed towards the ground.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, Witches can only sweep their brooms six times. You don’t even understand that? What a noob!” Steamed Bun even typed some trash talk in the chat. Zhang Wei was so angry that his lungs were about to explode. Pro players made mistakes. Sometimes, those mistakes were low-level ones. For example, he had forgotten to count how many sweeps he had left, which was indeed a beginner mistake. As the saying goes “A man is prone to stumbling when walking, and a horse is prone to stumbling when galloping.” In any case, the word “noob” shouldn’t be used to describe a pro player, let alone one that had fought in the pro scene for eight years. He was undoubtedly a veteran that had stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei was furious. Unfortunately, Endless Forest’s current fireball appearance was truly a manifestation of his mistake. On the ground, Steamed Bun was already waiting for him with a Sand Toss ready in his hands.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei didn’t even need to think to dodge. Endless Forest twisted his body, turning his head at the same time. Suddenly, a Brick hit him.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei was about to go crazy. A Sand Toss to force him to turn his head and then a Brick? What a shallow and outdated move… who does that anymore? But the guy in front of him was happily using it with gusto. That previous Poison Needle had been the same principle. Was this guy treating this pro match like the in-game Arena? Zhang Wei would occasionally go there to have some fun, and quite a few outdated moves in the pro scene were used a lot among normal players like Steamed Bun’s previous move…</p>
<p>But the important part was that this shallow and outdated move had actually worked.</p>
<p>After being put into a Dizzy state, Endless Forest was given a fierce beating. His health dropped a large chunk again. And this time, Zhang Wei was bent on revenge. He wasn’t going to retreat and wait for an opportunity like before. He was planning on directly finding an opening and attack the other side. Even ordinary old-timers could be angry.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun obviously wasn’t able to execute a perfect combo. Not long afterwards, Zhang Wei found an opening. Endless Forest swept his broom at Steamed Bun Invasion and fiercely attacked him. Steamed Bun Invasion went on the defensive and soon found an opportunity too. He seized it and gave Endless Forest a blow or two. Bang bang bang. The two got into a messy scuffle. In the end, Zhang Wei was experienced. There was order to his randomness. He was constantly calculating the costs to each trade. However, like before, Zhang Wei was unable to figure out Steamed Bun. In this scuffle, he clearly had the advantage. He had almost caught up; their health bars were nearly even now. But Steamed Bun didn’t seem to have any intentions of trying anything different. He seemed as if he were content with continuing this fight in this way.</p>
<p>What is he planning?</p>
<p>Zhang Wei couldn’t help think to himself, but he was unable to make heads or tails out of it.</p>
<p>Their team had analyzed that when fighting Steamed Bun, he should play it by ear and act whenever he saw an opportunity, but the problem was that he couldn’t find any “opportunities”, so how could he act on them?</p>
<p>Whatever, let’s just keep going!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei threw caution to the wind, and he kept fighting Steamed Bun in this way. And then he won, just like that.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty good.”</p>
<p>When Endless Forest cleaned up the last of Steamed Bun Invasion’s health, Steamed Bun left these “dying words”.</p>
<p>During the entire match, the two hadn’t really talked with each other. Only Steamed Bun Invasion had said a few words. The first time he talked, he called Zhang Wei a noob. The second time he talked, he said Zhang Wei was good. His two remarks were polar opposites. There hadn’t been any set-up for this sudden turnaround.</p>
<p>I won?</p>
<p>The word Glory jumped onto his screen. Steamed Bun Invasion had turned into a corpse on the ground. Zhang Wei was still in a daze.</p>
<p>I won, just like that?</p>
<p>What type of match was that? Had there been any crazy technical moves? Had there been any meaningful interactions? Had there been anything noteworthy enough to reflect upon? Zhang Wei came out from his player booth. When he came down, his brows were furrowed the entire time as if he had been the loser. He couldn’t help but look towards Happy. He looked at that guy, Bao Rongxing, who returned to Happy’s player bench in high spirits, walking confidently and freely as if he had been the winner.</p>
<p>“What a pity. I almost won.” Zhang Wei could hear Steamed Bun say to his teammates. Zhang Wei nearly tripped. What do you mean almost won? It wasn’t even close! With your inability to adapt, any knowledgeable person could have foreseen that you would lose. Could it be that you couldn’t see it? Even if you couldn’t, the others in Happy should be able to! What about Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>“Mm, it was a pity. Better luck next time.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Fuck! Ye Xiu was agreeing? What the heck? Had he really been in danger just before? I had narrowly escaped from the gates of hell by just a fluke? Zhang Wei was a veteran that had joined the scene in Season 3. He had witnessed the pinnacle of Ye Xiu’s career and didn’t doubt this God’s capabilities. With even Ye Xiu agreeing with Steamed Bun’s remark, Zhang Wei suddenly started to doubt himself.</p>
<p>“Nice job.” A teammate said to him at this moment. It was a common encouragement from a teammate.</p>
<p>“What a close call!” Zhang Wei subconsciously blurted out.</p>
<p>“Ah? How was that close?” His teammate looked weirdly at him.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Zhang Wei also looked weirdly at his teammate. It wasn’t close? He couldn’t help but look at Happy’s side. Steamed Bun had already sat back down, chatting exuberantly with the person next to him. Zhang Wei couldn’t hear him clearly, but it sounded like he was very proud of himself. How come the listener looked like he wanted to cry out SOS though?</p>
<p>What exactly went wrong? Zhang Wei went into deep thought.</p>
<p>At this moment, the individual competition’s third round began. Hundred Blossom’s Zou Yuan versus Happy’s Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>It was a confrontation between two Gunners. However, Su Mucheng had become famous far earlier than Zou Yuan. Zou Yuan was also very famous right now, but this fame had always made him feel uneasy. He had originally been a normal second-year player, ready to stand up from the bench. He would do his best whenever the team needed him and strive for more opportunities. After the team dragged him from the bench, they refused to let him sit back down and even gave him the team’s symbol, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Such treatment should be the dream of any pro player. Zou Yuan had dreamt of this before too, but he would have never imagined this dream would come true. When Zhang Jiale suddenly retired, the team wasn’t able to find a suitable Spitfire player, so they pushed him forward to take on the role.</p>
<p>In the span of a single night, he became everyone’s hope. He became the future of Team Hundred Blossoms. He became the successor to Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>Before that day, no one had every said these words to him. After that day, Zou Yuan didn’t feel happiness and joy, but fear and panic. He felt like he had been tossed into a maelstrom without anyone to guide him out of it.</p>
<p>That season, Zou Yuan didn’t perform too well, but because of the fan’s love for Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, he had been pushed into All-Stars…</p>
<p>All-Star, team core, ace player…</p>
<p>Zou Yuan obtained what many strived for without any difficulties to the extent that he couldn’t escape from these responsibilities even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>However, Zou Yuan knew very well that nothing here was real. That season, he had risen along with Tang Hao, who shined endlessly. Tang Hao had been Team Hundred Blossom’s true pillar. And him? He had probably been seen as a burden who occupied a toilet but didn’t shit.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan bitterly hung on for an entire season, persevering with something he simply couldn’t do. When that season ended, Zou Yuan was at a loss for his future. He had been the core of a team for a season, but he didn’t feel confident in himself in the slightest.</p>
<p>Then, Zhang Jiale returned and joined Team Tyranny, who purchased Dazzling Hundred Blossoms. Having lost this character, Zou Yuan thought he would be kicked out. Who would have thought that the team would immediately look for him and discuss creating a new Spitfire for him. They would also find him a suitable partner to rebuild the team’s core.</p>
<p>This time, he wouldn’t be pushed to do something beyond his abilities like last season. This time, the team truly wanted to nurture him.</p>
<p>After a season of struggle and confusion as the core, the team still wanted him as the core? Zou Yuan truly felt like a dream had come true. Then, Team Blue Rain’s Yu Feng joined and together they formed the new Hundred Blossoms. The team didn’t break their promise and created a new Spitfire, Blooming Blossoms, according to his habits and strengths.</p>
<p>He was capable. He shouldn’t be considered Zhang Jiale’s substitute. Team Hundred Blossoms introduced him as such.</p>
<p>Chapter 1145: Launcher versus Spitfire (1)</p>
<p>The five second countdown passed quickly. This match was undoubtedly the first highlight of today’s battle. Two All-Star players, two All-Star characters. Although Zou Yuan’s status as an All-Star was partly fueled by the emotions of Hundred Blossoms fans, after one season, his ability was beginning to gain attention and recognition, and he himself steadily gained confidence.</p>
<p>The match began, and Zou Yuan had his Spitfire Bright Blossoms rush towards the center of the map.</p>
<p>Blood and Blossoms.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms had wanted to recreate this duo. But it was a shame, for this world had only one Zhang Jiale, and only one Sun Zheping, and therefore only one Blood and Blossoms.</p>
<p>Recreating this pairing was Hundred Blossoms’ dream, or at least the blueprint that they drew out for their fans. But in reality, Zou Yuan had his own style, and Yu Feng wasn’t very much like Sun Zheping. No matter what, it would be impossible for these two to completely mimic the partnership between Zhang Jiale and Sun Zheping. But, so what? The inimitable wasn’t necessarily the strongest. From the start, Yu Feng hadn’t been very interested in recreating their style anyway. He had come from Blue Rain, a team aiming for the championship win, because he wanted to build an era that was entirely his. He certainly wasn’t here to be a copy of anyone else.</p>
<p>During the first half of last season, they had attempted to recreate Blood and Blossoms, but Hundred Blossoms’ performance hadn’t been very good. Afterwards, Yu Feng and Zou Yuan made adjustments. They coordinated with one another in a more comfortable way based off their personal habits and personal styles. Hundred Blossoms’ immediately performance went up.</p>
<p>Now, neither of them would become confused. They would use their own style to surpass their seniors and establish a partnership that was entirely their own. Even though the outside world still called them Blood and Blossoms, they believed that they would eventually earn a name that was entirely their own.</p>
<p>Carrying this belief, Zou Yuan and Hundred Blossoms greeted the new season together.</p>
<p>In the first round, they encountered Heavenly Swords, and with them one of the previous creators of Blood and Blossoms, Sun Zheping. In that match, Sun Zheping won one point in the individual round, and although his opponent was neither Zou Yuan nor Yu Feng, the world still made the comparison between junior and senior. Heavenly Swords lost overall, but Sun Zheping’s one point stood out, and later discussions painted him as if he were the victor.</p>
<p>These sort of irresponsible remarks left Zou Yuan feeling helpless. All he could do was focus and battle well.</p>
<p>I must win this point beautifully. This was the goal that Zou Yuan set for himself. He knew that the opponent he was about to face was no pushover, but the greater the difficulty, the greater the value of this point.</p>
<p>Bright Blossoms quickly reached the center of the map, and Zou Yuan saw Dancing Rain rapidly approaching from the other side of the map.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain was absolutely an All-Star character, but after her return to the league, everyone discovered that Dancing Rain hadn’t grown as much as expected of such an All-Star character. For most teams, their All-Star characters were the focus of their upgrades after the level cap was raised. After Happy upgraded Boundless Sea’s Silver weapon Mirror Moon to level 75, every All-Star character’s weapon was level 75. As for their other Silver equipment, that varied between teams and depended on their conditions.</p>
<p>But although Dancing Rain was an extremely qualified character, an All-Star Launcher, her current equipment was somewhat lacking. Her weapon Devouring Sun was the only Silver equipment she had. It was clear that while she was in Excellent Era, after the Level 75 update, Dancing Rain hadn’t had an important place in their upgrading plans. Of course, another reason was that Excellent Era’s materials gathering hadn’t progressed very smoothly during that time.</p>
<p>Now, comparing these All-Stars just by their equipment, Bright Blossoms was in much better shape. This account was wearing five Level 75 equipment, which was considered very good.</p>
<p>In terms of characters, Hundred Blossoms had the upper hand.</p>
<p>What about player condition? Su Mucheng had gone a whole year without playing any pro matches, while Zou Yuan had improved his technique, awareness, and temperament over the course of the past year. In terms of condition, it seemed that Hundred Blossoms held the upper hand here as well.</p>
<p>This was the analysis conducted by Hundred Blossoms on Su Mucheng and Dancing Rain. Now in this confrontation, Zou Yuan was completely confident. He didn’t make any move to avoid her, and prepared to meet her head on.</p>
<p>He might not have moved strategically, but when Su Mucheng saw Bright Blossoms, she was the one to change direction.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan was confident, but not arrogant. Seeing Su Mucheng’s careful avoidance, he didn’t rush forward. The map for this battle consisted of narrow streets, and in theory it didn’t really suit long-ranged classes, because there were simply too many ways to find cover from an attack. But both players were Gunners here, so there wasn’t any advantage to be had here. It couldn’t be forgotten that this was Happy’s home game, they were the ones to choose the map, and Su Mucheng was no rookie, having more experience than even Zou Yuan. She chose this map, so she must have some plan. Her current maneuvering must be to take advantage of the special characteristics of this map. So, Zou Yuan didn’t rush forward. He studied his surroundings, and after studying the paths he could take, he chose to circle around to intercept her.</p>
<p>But right when Bright Blossoms changed directions, quote a commotion arose from the audience. From their omniscient view, the audience saw the full picture of what was going on. Su Mucheng’s Dancing Rain, after changing paths, wasn’t trying to move around in a roundabout way, but instead chose to stand and wait in that position. After Bright Blossoms decided to circle around, Dancing Rain emerged again, and came around behind Bright Blossoms.</p>
<p>Glory wasn’t Counterstrike, there was no chance of a one-hit knockout. But in a battle between experts, the first to attack had a high chance of seizing the initiative for the entire battle. In the current situation, Su Mucheng undoubtedly had the advantage. Dancing Rain quietly crept around behind Bright Blossoms, and began to launch an attack at his exposed back.</p>
<p>But who would have thought, at this moment Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms suddenly stopped moving, and just stood there in that narrow street, as though in deep thought. The audience couldn’t see anything from the projection, but onscreen, where they were displaying Bright Blossoms’ camera view, everyone suddenly saw that from Bright Blossom’s currently slightly-diagonal position, he could see both in front and behind him. Zou Yuan hadn’t neglected his back, he had made preparations for two possibilities.</p>
<p>With this method, he hadn’t really seized any opportunities, but at least he wouldn’t let his opponent have an easy time. He wanted to pull this battle back to a face-to-face confrontation, which, in a way, reflected Zou Yuan’s confidence.</p>
<p>Of course, Su Mucheng had no way of predicting all of Zou Yuan’s plans. She circled around, and as soon as she appeared, Zou Yuan saw her out of the edge of his vision. Su Mucheng saw that Bright Blossoms was just standing there as though he had gone offline, so she didn’t move to dodge or hide, and immediately fired an attack.</p>
<p>The sneak attack didn’t work, and the two were now directly throwing attacks at each other. The battle was progressing the way Zou Yuan had hoped it would. He readjusted this focus and prepared for a good direct fight. But Bright Blossoms had barely managed to take two steps forward. He hadn’t even fired his first shot, when Dancing Rain’s powerful smothering attack arrived. Zou Yuan had no choice but to first evade the attack, but with this evasion, he immediately lost the initiative.</p>
<p>Even a Launcher’s normal attacks carried an AoE effect, not a single one was a point attack, and so all their attacks were AoE, the only difference was the extent of the area of effect. .</p>
<p>As a result, Zou Yuan discovered that he had made a mistake. He had picked this position so that Bright Blossoms could see both sides, but it was too narrow here. When the Launcher attack here, Zou Yuan suddenly found that he had no way of dodging.</p>
<p>This position…</p>
<p>Zou Yuan finally realized how disadvantageous this position was for him. For the Launcher, it was like shooting fish in a barrel.</p>
<p>It was impossible to go forward, so his only choice was to control Bright Blossoms to retreat backward, which would be a difficult task. Of the 24 classes in Glory, the Launcher had the largest attack range, and Dancing Rain was an All-Star character. In Excellent Era, she would often have to use a Screen Cannon strategy to coordinate, and so her equipment boosted her attack range even further. And now he wanted to try to increase the distance and escape her range, but how could it be that easy?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan of course couldn’t rely just on movement to escape. Under the rain of bullets, Bright Blossoms ate the damage and tossed out two grenades.</p>
<p>One of the grenades instantly exploded. The screens displaying the match to the audience turned a flashing white.</p>
<p>It was a Flash Bullet, and Dancing Rain was clearly affected. That flashing white screen was her current camera view.</p>
<p>But, the attacks didn’t stop…</p>
<p>In these conditions, Dancing Rain was still using her heavy cannon, spitting out dense blasts in front of her. Bright Blossoms’ other grenade was a Smoke Bullet, and the smoke was already roiling in the air. But not even the Flash Bullet was enough to stop Su Mucheng’s attacks, would the reduced vision caused by the smoke be an obstacle for her?</p>
<p>It didn’t seem so…</p>
<p>Dancing Rain was engulfed in the smoke, but her footsteps didn’t stop, nor did her attacks. To attack here, she didn’t even need to see. Flash Bullet, Smoke Bullet, these things became meaningless.</p>
<p>The audience was stunned. What kind of skill did it take to be able to fight blind like this?</p>
<p>Immediately, sound of applause rose from the audience. Of course, Zou Yuan obviously couldn’t hear. He had come into the match filled with confidence, but now he was already a little planicked. From the audience’s perspective, neither of his grenades had affected Dancing Rain’s attacks at all. But Zou Yuan, in game, could see more clearly, and he knew that Su Mucheng’s attacks had changed. The instant her vision was blocked, her attacks became even stronger, even fiercer. The area affected by her attacks instantly became even larger. In such a condition, she actually gained an even greater initiative.</p>
<p>But Zou Yuan wasn’t prepared to lose just like this. Ever since he had built up his confidence, his playstyle had became tougher. Flash Bullet, Smoke Bullet, these skills could be used to create a turning point, and Zou Yuan wasn’t about to let them go to waste. Su Mucheng wasn’t affected by her loss of vision, so he could add some more attacks to cause trouble for her.</p>
<p>Bright Blossoms didn’t retreat and counterattacked.</p>
<p>Chapter 1146: Launcher versus Spitfire (2)</p>
<p>Under the pressure of Dancing Rain’s relentless attacks, Zou Yuan pushed forward instead of retreating. He had Bright Blossoms steadily advance, so he could get into a range from which he could attack her.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Zou Yuan’s current strategy would certainly lead to Bright Blossoms taking a lot of damage, and there was the possibility that he wouldn’t even be able to break through Dancing Rain’s attacks at all. But now, the Flash Bullet and Smoke Bullet were serving their purpose. Dancing Rain didn’t stop attacking because Su Mucheng was relying on her technical skill to continue, but Zou Yuan knew that she had no way of aiming accurately when she couldn’t see.</p>
<p>Bright Blossoms fiercely charged forward, and as expected, there were no changes in Dancing Rain’s attack patterns. Su Mucheng had just increased her firepower, but since she couldn’t see anything, she had no way of adjusting to Bright Blossoms’ change in movements.</p>
<p>This unchanging attack pattern posed no difficulty to Zou Yuan, for he was now a confident core player. Bright Blossoms endured the damage, and Dancing Rain finally entered his attack range.</p>
<p>He lifted his gun and prepared to fire a Freezing Bullet, but just as he was about to shoot, he heard three sounds of cannon fire. Three Anti-Tank Missiles, spitting fire, had flown in front of him.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan was shocked. The effects of the Flash Bullet on Dancing Rain still hadn’t faded, so how did Su Mucheng know his movements?</p>
<p>Bright Blossoms could obviously take the damage from the Anti-Tank Missiles, but the problem was the impact caused by the explosions would shake his character and prevent him from attacking. This was a special characteristic of Gunner classes. Even for normal attacks, as long as the target was accurately hit, there would be a Stun effect to the part hit. And the Launcher had heavy firepower compared to the other Gunner classes, so this characteristic was the most apparent out of all of them.</p>
<p>As a result, Zou Yuan had Bright Blossoms duck to the side. But then he heard a series of bangs, Dancing Rain had fired an artillery shell in a low arc which exploded, sending Stingers flying in all directions.</p>
<p>Seeing this attack, Zou Yuan suddenly understood. In reality, Su Mucheng hadn’t seen Bright Blossoms’ movements, but she understood what kind of attack she was most vulnerable to at the moment. So, she kept track of the time and took preventative measures. As it turned out, Zou Yuan had done what she was guarding against, allowing Su Mucheng stop him with her eyes closed. You want to continue? The effects of the Flash Bullet had faded, and Su Mucheng could see Bright Blossoms closing in ahead, so she used Aerial Fire. Her character flew backwards and pulled away, and in an instant he was smothered under her attacks again.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan despised this narrow little road. If the map weren’t like this, he wouldn’t be suffering so badly right now. If the map weren’t like this, Su Mucheng couldn’t have crushed him with her eyes closed like that. If the map weren’t like this, he wouldn’t have once again fallen under Dancing Rain’s suppression.</p>
<p>In reality, a Spitfire could also similarly render an opponent helpless with their firepower, but unfortunately for him, Su Mucheng was taking full advantage of the Launcher’s superior range. Despite facing a Spitfire, another long range-attacker, she could still use distance to suppress him.</p>
<p>If he charged forward, Dancing Rain would retreat back; if he tried to retreat, Dancing Rain would approach. The precision of her attacks and technique left Zou Yuan stunned.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng… One year without playing any pro matches. Even though she might not be able to immediately adjust to the tempo of high-level battles so quickly, but her personal skill had unexpectedly advanced over this past year. As a result of her skilled usage of the map, Bright Blossoms was beautifully trapped in this narrow alley, and Zou Yuan couldn’t find any opening to escape.</p>
<p>Was this Su Mucheng?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan, beaten down, was puzzled.</p>
<p>Personally, he didn’t really understand Su Mucheng. He had debuted as a pro in Season 7, becoming a rookie in Team Hundred Blossoms alongside Tang Hao. But because he played the same class as Zhang Jiale, he had pitifully few chances to play during that season, and he wasn’t much different from an audience member. In Season 8, he was suddenly thrust into the role of the main character, and he stumbled through that season in a trance. He wasn’t able to find his own bearings, how could he pay attention to anyone else? Then, by Season 9, when he became a truly stable main player, Su Mucheng wasn’t among his list of opponents, so he had no reason to investigate her.</p>
<p>What kind of player was Su Mucheng?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan’s understanding only came from gossip. He knew that although Su Mucheng was extremely popular, many people didn’t think much of her. They would say that she relied on her physical appearance, that her strength was overrated. Some people directly called her a flower vase, and some radical Excellent Era fans blamed on her the team’s decline after its three consecutive championship victories. After all, she joined Excellent Era in Season 4, and after then, Excellent Era had never managed to win another championship.</p>
<p>To the public, Su Mucheng was a controversial player, but what about in the pro circle? Zou Yuan knew that, aside from some rookies who didn’t know anything, no one viewed her like that.</p>
<p>Then what about Zou Yuan himself?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan was forced to admit that he was biased against Su Mucheng. And this bias didn’t come from his own analysis, but was influenced by surrounding opinion.</p>
<p>Rookies within the same team always tended to have good relationships with each other. And the year Zou Yuan debuted, his fellow rookie was a player named Tang Hao.</p>
<p>Given Tang Hao’s personality, it wasn’t hard to guess that he would have an opinion about such a controversial player. And because Zou Yuan had the most interactions with this fellow rookie Tang Hao, his opinion of Su Mucheng was influenced by Tang Hao, so he tended not to think much of her.</p>
<p>But at that time, they were just two gossiping rookies. Neither he nor Tang Hao had the status to treat Su Mucheng as an opponent!</p>
<p>By the time the two of them had that status and position, Su Mucheng had run off to the Challenger League.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan didn’t remember much of the gossip of his rookie days, but that impression from back then lingered in his heart. On the battlefield, Zou Yuan didn’t carry that mentality with him. No matter the opponent, he wouldn’t underestimate them. But Su Mucheng’s demonstrated skill still truly shocked him – it far surpassed his expectations of the Su Mucheng he thought he knew. Because of his bias, the Su Mucheng he thought he knew didn’t have all that much skill.</p>
<p>But now, he was thoroughly suppressed by Su Mucheng. Zou Yuan wasn’t as arrogant as Tang Hao, so he quickly recognized this reality.</p>
<p>But so what?</p>
<p>This realization came too late. At the end of this battle, Zou Yuan was defeated.</p>
<p>In the individual round, Happy gained an early lead of 2 to 1. As this was Happy’s home game, there were of course cheers and applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>In the midst of the cheers, Su Mucheng walked out of the player booth and offstage.</p>
<p>She was calm when facing victory, just like when facing criticism. She would always smile and not reply.</p>
<p>Because she didn’t care about that.</p>
<p>She walked offstage and returned to Happy’s player area, where Ye Xiu stood and clapped to welcome her.</p>
<p>“Heehee,” Su Mucheng giggled, making a victory sign with her hands.</p>
<p>“Impressive,” Ye Xiu praised. “You suppressed him without leaving a single opening, you played really well.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think?” Su Mucheng was still smiling as she sat beside Ye Xiu. She would always strive for victory, but beside this person, she felt that her hard work had greater meaning.</p>
<p>“Alright, next is the group round, those who are going…” Ye Xiu turned to call for those who were playing in the next round. Of course, Su Mucheng couldn’t go on again, so she simply sat to the side and watched. Her smile was even brighter than it was when she had obtained victory.</p>
<p>Happy was bright, but Hundred Blossoms was lost.</p>
<p>They had lost two points in the individual round, and the one point they had won was under strange circumstances, the opponent clearly wasn’t in good condition.</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng already went in the individual round. No matter what, we can’t lose the group round,” Yu Feng said to the two players who would be playing with him in the group round. The two of them nodded determinedly, and then they looked over at Happy.</p>
<p>In their eyes, Happy’s strongest players were Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng. Although Fang Rui was also an All-Star, he was in the midst of changing classes, and he couldn’t completely adjust so quickly. If he were still a Thief, Hundred Blossoms would also treat him as a dangerous opponent, but as a Qi Master, he was a little weaker.</p>
<p>There was a short break between the individual and group rounds, but Hundred Blossoms’ three players were already walking toward the player booths. The large screens at the stadium displayed to the audience the players of both teams who would be playing in the group round.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms: Zhou Guangyi, Yu Feng, Zhu Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Team Happy: Fang Rui, Mo Fan, Tang Rou.</p>
<p>The first matchup was Fang Rui against Zhou Guangyi. Both characters had already logged on, and it was now the pre-match display segment. In their player booths, the players could see this on their screens as well. Fang Rui, this number one Thief in Glory, suddenly becoming a Qi Master… to be honest, Zhou Guangyi respected his courage.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was familiar with Fang Rui, as they had both debuted in Season 5. He had better opportunities at the beginning than Fang Rui did, because he had been in Tyranny, and at that time, Tyranny had just toppled Excellent Era’s dynasty to win the Season 4 championships and officially stand at the summit. Zhou Guangyi began in a championship team, and his future was nothing but bright.</p>
<p>The next few seasons, Zhou Guangyi’s development was smooth. Although he didn’t become a star, he was continually improving, and he became a very strong player.</p>
<p>However, while Zhou Guangyi was improving, Tyranny was declining. After Season 4, they didn’t managed to fight their way to the finals again.</p>
<p>Last season, Tyranny made huge adjustments, inviting two top experts Lin Jingyan and Zhang Jiale. Tyranny’s plan was clear, they wanted to let these veterans at the end of their careers shine brilliantly one last time. Lin Jingyan and Zhang Jiale shone brilliantly, exciting the players, but at such a time, it was inevitable that there would be grief for some members of Tyranny. There were only so many spaces on a roster, and if a player came, that meant that another one had to go.</p>
<p>Every player longed for a chance to play onstage, so that season, Zhou Guangyi left Tyranny sadly, the team where he had fought for four years. He had originally thought he could play on that team until he retired…</p>
<p>Chapter 1147: Qi Master versus Assassin (1)</p>
<p>The first round of the group arena between Happy and Hundred Blossoms:</p>
<p>Fang Rui, Qi Master Boundless Sea</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi, Assassin Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>The two had debuted the same season, so they were quite familiar with each other. It was a long-standing tradition for the rookies of each season to make a chat group and share experiences and tips with one another. As long as a player wasn’t too antisocial, then they’d be able to make friends during this time. Even if they ended up in different places and positions, the days they had spent messing around together weren’t forgotten easily. Fang Rui and Zhou Guangyi were by no means unfamiliar with each other, and they got along fairly well. When these players matched up with each other, it was natural for them to chat.</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, admit your defeat. I know your Assassin very well, but have you ever witnessed my Qi Master?” Fang Rui started to provoke him.</p>
<p>“Witness your unfamiliarity with the class?” Zhou Guangyi responded.</p>
<p>“That was last week,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“How about this week?”</p>
<p>“A bit rusty in the right hand, but my left hand is very adept,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Then I hope your right hand won’t be a burden for your left,” Zhou Guangyi said.</p>
<p>“Impossible. With the title of Golden Right Hand, even if my right hand is a little rusty, it far surpasses your imagination,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope so!” Zhou Guangyi laughed.</p>
<p>In Glory, the left hand used the keyboard while the right controlled the mouse. The mouse was mainly used to control an attack’s trajectory and positioning. Fang Rui had the title of the Golden Right Hand due to his right hand’s godly speed and precision, but unfortunately, his right hand was outstanding to the extent that his left hand couldn’t keep up with the right hand’s pace. All in all, playing required coordination between both hands, so without the assistance of a Golden Left Hand to support his Golden Right Hand, Fang Rui couldn’t display his full potential.</p>
<p>As a result, Fang Rui’s left hand was always dragged his right hand back. Zhou Guangyi obviously knew about this, so “I hope your right hand won’t be a burden for your left” was a fairly fierce slap to the face.</p>
<p>The two friends continued to talk trash to each other. Soon afterwards, Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin reached the center of the map, but Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea was nowhere to be seen. Zhou Guangyi wasn’t surprised, because even if Fang Rui had changed to a Qi Master, he probably wouldn’t drop his dirty playing. A direct confrontation was never his style.</p>
<p>As an Assassin, it was more effective to launch a sudden ambush. The passive skill that Assassins received after advancing classes at Level 20 was Assassination. Its use was to increase the attack damage struck at the back of characters by 20%. Players already had a bonus of a 20% increase in damage for attacks hit on the back, an addition of another 20% would make it reach a shocking 40%. This was why when players were in a dungeon, regardless whether they were fighting a mob or boss, that strike on the back was always reserved for Assassins.</p>
<p>On top of this, Assassin’s Level 50 active Awakening skill Vitals Strike was an active skill. When it was activated, the Assassin could pinpoint a vital point on the target, and when an attack accurately struck that vital point, the damage could reach as high as 200%.</p>
<p>Assassination, Vital Attack, and Life-Risking Strike. Among the 24 classes, the Assassin was the only class who could truly instant kill. As long as those skills were fully combined, even classes with high health like the Knight or Paladin might not be able to resist an Assassin’s strike.</p>
<p>Instant killing was probably the boldest and most hot-blooded attack in Glory, but it was rare to see it in professional matches. This was because everyone would naturally watch out when they knew the Assassin had such skills. In addition, Life-Risking Strike was a skill in which both sides would suffer, so it might not give their team a chance to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>However, throughout the course of Glory’s competitive history, it wasn’t as if no Assassin had made such a heroic move. There was a time when such a move became extremely well-known, and that one time was made through the character Zhou Guangyi was currently using.</p>
<p>That one assassination was completely worth it, whether judging by the target killed or the result it achieved. That attack was enough to cement Cold Season’s place in the annals of Glory. When Zhou Guangyi and Cold Seasons transferred to Hundred Blossoms together, the fans of Tyranny even got quite emotional.</p>
<p>In the final match of the Season 4 finals, Cold Season’s Life-Risking Strike assassinated One Autumn Leaf.</p>
<p>With this strike, Tyranny was able to win the championships and end Excellent Era’s dynasty.</p>
<p>With this strike, the MVP of the final match was neither Han Wenqing nor Zhang Xinjie, but the user of Cold Seasons, who was called… Ji Leng. In reality, he wasn’t an extremely outstanding or special player, but such a breathtaking strike made everyone remember his name.</p>
<p>Cold Season retired after that season and Zhou Guangyi joined Tyranny, taking over Cold Season the Assassin. Because of how exciting the finals were, whenever people saw Cold Season, they all hoped to see another stunning Life-Risking Strike. However, things weren’t so simple in real life. Everyone’s attention towards him gradually died down as they realized that the miracle wouldn’t happen again. Most Assassins wouldn’t really use such a suicidal method as their main playstyle. In recent years, only Li Xun from Team Void would pull off such a move, but that was because Team Void was able to provide him with the right conditions. As a team who possessed the strongest Phantom Demon, they could control their targets well, while also providing buffs for Li Xun’s Assassin. This was why when Li Xun launched Life-Risking Strike, his chance of succeeding was greater, and the damage he took to himself was lower. This was why he was able to utilize this move more often than others in team matches.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Guangyi? Although he had inherited the Assassin who made the most stunning instant kill in the league, he wasn’t someone who enjoyed pulling off an instant kill. His fighting style was similar to that of Yang Cong from Team 301 Degrees, who fought in a dominant and direct manner. In reality, it was the same for Ji Leng because it was Team Tyranny’s style. For whatever reason, the conditions just happened to give him the opportunity to execute this surprise Life-Rising Strike. But because of how astonishing this trike was, the impressions towards his original style had been erased. Ji Leng had originally been like Zhou Guangyi. Both of them had the same style as Team Tyranny, straightforward and direct.</p>
<p>Cold Season rushed to the center, and as expected, Fang Rui was nowhere to be seen. If this was before, he would have been able to predict and guess Fang Rui’s train of thought. However, Fang Rui had changed to a Qi Master, so Zhou Guangyi had no idea how he would fight.</p>
<p>However, considering Fang Rui’s playstyle, it was too risky to wait for him to appear. Who knew how many tricks Fang Rui would set up to dupe you. Zhou Guangyi thought to himself. He decided to take the initiative. He couldn’t just sit there doing nothing and wait for Fang Rui to find the perfect opening.</p>
<p>The group arena’s map size was the same as the individual competition’s. The map wouldn’t change from the start to the end of the match, so it would even leave behind the marks created by the players who had fought previously. The map that Happy picked this time was called “Life-Seeking Path.”</p>
<p>One would only need to hear the name to know that it was a disgusting, maze-like map which was suitable for dirty playing. As a result, it wouldn’t be a surprise for Fang Rui to sneakily hide somewhere as soon as the battle began. After Zhou Guangyi had Cold Season enter the tangled and complicated maze from the vast, open land, he still couldn’t find any signs of Boundless Sea. Instead, he saw Fang Rui roar in the channel: “What’s going on? I’ve arrived, why did you run away? Where did you run off to?”</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi ignored him. He wouldn’t fall for such a childish trap.</p>
<p>However, maps like Life-Seeking Path tended to make him lose his temper. It was obvious that Tyranny, the team he had been in, would never use such a disgusting map. As for Hundred Blossoms, their ace was a long-ranged Spitfire, so they also wouldn’t prefer maps with too many crisscrosses.</p>
<p>A shadow suddenly flashed before him!</p>
<p>Only two people existed in this match, so there was no doubt that the shadow must be Boundless Sea. Zhou Guangyi trusted his eyes and was resolute about sprinting ahead. However, considering Fang Rui’s dirtiness, it would be too risky if he tailed directly behind. He had to change directions to catch him off guard.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was still scouting out another direction when the shadow from before appeared again.</p>
<p>“Fuck, there you are, making me go to so much effort to find you. Why’d you start playing dirty after transferring to Hundred Blossoms?” As Fang Rui spoke, he rushed straight ahead, much to everyone’s surprise.</p>
<p>Qi Bullet!</p>
<p>Boundless Sea shot out the Qi Master’s lowest-level skill with a lift of his hands. It was obvious that such a skill wouldn’t cause Zhou Guangyi too much trouble. He dodged it easily, but he felt like there was something fishy about Boundless Sea charging straight towards him. Was there some sort of trap lying around?</p>
<p>The match with Zou Yuan was a lesson to learn from!</p>
<p>One could say that he was completely oppressed by a single wave after being lured into an extremely advantageous terrain for the opponent. What about now? This place wasn’t spacious. Although Qi Masters didn’t have the Launcher’s extremely long shooting distance or strong fire power, they had reduced versions of such abilities. Was Fang Rui planning to repeat the same scene?</p>
<p>Sky Piercing Strike!</p>
<p>As he thought, Boundless Sea leapt up while pushing his hands down in midair. An airwave shot towards Cold Season. Zhou Guangyi immediately had Cold Season dodge by jumping back. The Sky Piercing Strike hit the ground and shockwaves spread from the ground. One jump wasn’t enough for Cold Season, so he jumped again. If he followed his usual habits and style in a match, he would have charged forward and made a counterattack before Boundless Sea had a chance to reach the ground. However, his opponent was Fang Rui! How could he possibly fight head on? There must be other reasons.</p>
<p>“Don’t think too much! We know each other so well, let’s just fight it out!” Fang Rui yelled.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? It’s too narrow here, shall we pick another place?” Zhou Guangyi said.</p>
<p>“Sure, lead the way.” Fang Rui was very generous.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi grew suspicious. Glory’s matches had a lot of freedom. Players could chat as they fought and it wouldn’t count as cheating. This was because there could be traps and tactics hidden within the conversations. For example, Zhou Guangyi believed that there must be something fishy with Fang Rui’s suggestion. Although he was leading the way, he did it by jumping backwards. He would never turn his back on someone who was titled the master of playing dirty and the Golden Right Hand…</p>
<p>Chapter 1148: Qi Master versus Assassin (2)</p>
<p>“Old Zhou, your distrust wounds me right in the heart!” Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea casually followed the other player, and he even found time to send a message in chat.</p>
<p>With this message, not just Zhou Guangyi but every single person who had any understanding of the Glory pro circle was shouting in their hearts: Glory’s master of playing dirty, if even you could be trusted, then nothing would be impossible in this world!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi, of course, was unmoved. He didn’t see any clear signs, but he had a gut feeling that Fang Rui’s trickery was about to unfold. If this were in the past, Zhou Guangyi absolutely could have guessed that this guy had traps over there to lure him into, but a Qi Master couldn’t lay traps, so what kind of danger would be waiting for him to discover? Zhou Guangyi didn’t dare slow down, so of course he didn’t want to type a reply. He scrutinized the grass and trees and rocks around him as he moved.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Cold Seasons retreated all the way to the center of the map, Boundless Sea following him along all the while.</p>
<p>“As former partners, let’s have a clean and dignified fight to determine who wins!” Fang Rui called out in the chat.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was speechless. What do you mean, “former partners”? For one, they had never been teammates before. Besides, in their personal relationship, they had always been friends and had never had any sort of conflict. They were on opposing teams, but that never affected their relationship. So what was with that “former”?</p>
<p>But Zhou Guangyi was in no mood to chatter with Fang Rui. Tyranny’s players might have a word or two with you in a match, but it was never their style to talk on and on.</p>
<p>“Watch my attack, Sky Piercing Strike!”</p>
<p>Another message was sent to the chat. And then Boundless Sea waved his hands, but he released a fast Qi Bullet.</p>
<p>How dirty!</p>
<p>The audience all thought this, but would Zhou Guangyi be tricked? Of course not, he had known Fang Rui for many years now and had lots of experience facing him in battle. He wouldn’t believe a single thing Fang Rui said in his messages and just pretended he didn’t see them.</p>
<p>A Qi Bullet of course couldn’t instantly kill an opponent. But Boundless Sea directly used a Qi Flowing Cloud, which was a skill that caused Qi to surround the user and increase the user’s speed in all aspects. Next, he directly charged toward Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>The Qi Master was a Fighter subclass, so of course this class was very good at close combat, and many explosive skills were better at close range. But the problem was, Qi Masters wore cloth armor with very low physical defense, and most close-range classes were physical attackers. So, if Qi Masters wanted to stay close to an opponent and fight explosively, they needed to find a good opportunity. It was very rare to see a Qi Master shoot a Qi Bullet and then just directly rush an opponent like this.</p>
<p>Especially since he was facing an Assassin right now, who possessed extremely high physical attack and numerous skills that could deal explosive damage. And this Assassin was in the hands of a former Tyranny player. Players from Tyranny excelled at this sort of direct fighting. Anyone who had some analytical understanding of Glory all thought that Fang Rui’s actions right now were illogical.</p>
<p>An All-Star level player should never be making such illogical actions.</p>
<p>But, this person was Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Thus, the illogical immediately smelled of something suspicious.</p>
<p>There must be some trickery here – this thought crossed the minds of everyone watching this match. They were using their advantage of being able to see the entire battlefield to try and discover the truth that was hidden behind the deceit.</p>
<p>Everyone thought this way, and Zhou Guangyi was no exception. He was 180% sure that Fang Rui was not planning to have a face-to-face confrontation with him.</p>
<p>So, when Boundless Sea activated Qi Flowing Cloud, he immediately had Cold Seasons activate Swift Movements. An Assassin sprinting with this buff would move the fastest out of all 24 classes. Even with Qi Flowing Cloud, Boundless Sea couldn’t catch up. As a result, a close combat specialist Assassin was increasing his distance from the mid-range Qi Master. It seemed extremely illogical and counterintuitive.</p>
<p>But no one thought this way. Everyone felt that Zhou Guangyi acted completely correctly, as expected of an experienced player. At this time, how could he let himself fall into Fang Rui’s a? Better to first spar with him a bit.</p>
<p>In a footrace, Boundless Sea wasn’t Cold Seasons’s opponent, but he had attacking skills. As they ran, he launched Qi Bullet after Qi Bullet, occasionally interspersed with other skills. Many of a Qi Master’s skills required a cast time. It was like the Mages’ spellcasting, but here they called it chants. The biggest difference between this and spellcasting was that when spellcasting, a Mage had to focus, so they couldn’t move or make any other actions. Qi Masters were different, their chants could be done at the same time as other actions. This characteristic was similar to a Ninja’s seals.</p>
<p>They chased and fought for a while, but no trickery was revealed. But the Assassin was a class that focused on explosive bursts of power, including buffs. They were powerful when used, but their effects were short-lasting. The duration of Fleet Foot was much shorter than Qi Flowing Cloud, so after the effect wore off, Boundless Sea steadily caught up to Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also partly because Zhou Guangyi didn’t want to run completely away in the first place. He just wanted to try and figure out what Fang Rui was up to. But after using up this Fleet Foot, he truly didn’t discover any kind of hidden mystery.</p>
<p>Next… give it a try?</p>
<p>This was Zhou Guangyi’s thought. These Tyranny players never liked running around in circles like this. Today, it was only because he was facing Fang Rui that he was careful and went to the effort to spend so much time wandering around. But now, Zhou Guangyi’s patience had reached its limit. Cold Seasons was in front, Boundless Sea was behind using all sorts of skills to attack nonstop. But Cold Seasons suddenly stopped and spun around, riding a cold light as he flew toward his opponent, prepared to kill.</p>
<p>Shining Cut!</p>
<p>An attack skill that also involved the character moving at an extremely fast speed, and in an instant he had appeared next to Boundless Sea. The audience roared in excitement. This counterattack was extremely sudden, but as soon as he decided to take action, it was with such a decisive move. The Assassin’s momentum could change with a glance.</p>
<p>The Shining Cut came very quickly, but Fang Rui wouldn’t just waiting to be hit. If an attack like this was enough to take him down, did he have the face to stay in this profession?</p>
<p>Boundless Sea jumped to the side. With a movement of his hands, a mass of Qi sparking with electricity formed between his palms, and he forced it toward Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>Qi Master skill: Flash Burst. After hitting the target, it would pour qi into the target, dealing continuous damage. This skill, if used in coordination with a team CCing the target, a Flash Burst lasting until the end could be extremely painful.</p>
<p>Although this wasn’t as strong as that situation, Zhou Guangyi didn’t dare slow down. Cold Seasons sheathed his knife from the Shining Cut and jumped, directly to Boundless Sea’s side.</p>
<p>Then, Boundless Sea also turned with him. He was still holding the Flash Burst in his hands, pushing it in this new direction.</p>
<p>You’re using that as a shield!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi thought this, Cold Seasons instantly jumped up, and then double-jumped. In an instant, he was behind Fang Rui, and he straightened his legs into a Diving Arrow kick.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea was still holding that Flash Burst. This attack was like that, as long as the right controls were being continually inputted, it could be pushed around indefinitely. Even as Cold Seasons ducked around and used that Diving Arrow kick, Boundless Sea’s Flash Burst was still prepared to be sent toward him.</p>
<p>But Diving Arrow also had the side effect of giving the user another jump. Regardless of whether or not the kick landed on its target, the user could borrow its power for movement. Zhou Guangyi of course wouldn’t let Cold Seasons crash into that Flash Burst, so he used the force of the kick to move backward.</p>
<p>Fang Rui finally gave up on this Flash Burst, and pushed out a Qi Bullet. This low-level attack didn’t cause much damage, nor did it have any particular effects, so Zhou Guangyi didn’t prepare to dodge it. But this Qi Bullet was actually launched inaccurately. Given its trajectory, it was going to pass right by Cold Seasons without his doing anything.</p>
<p>But the Golden Right Hand!</p>
<p>Fang Rui had the title of the Golden Right Hand because of his accuracy in attack. How could he miss this attack?</p>
<p>This guy was thinking too much!</p>
<p>This was Zhou Guangyi’s instant judgment. He hadn’t planned to dodge this attack, but Fang Rui thought he would, so he aimed slightly elsewhere as a predictive attack, making the attack miss?</p>
<p>No! It wasn’t like that!</p>
<p>The instant the Qi Bullet passed him, Zhou Guangyi realized it. Even if it was supposed to be a predictive attack, there was no way it should have that trajectory, and given his Golden Right Hand, there was no way he picked the wrong position by accident. This was…</p>
<p>It didn’t have much power, but the Qi Bullet was a flashing white mass, and as it passed by his face, it filled Zhou Guangyi’s camera with that flashing whiteness.</p>
<p>This guy wanted to make this effect!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi finally realized it, but it was too late…</p>
<p>He couldn’t see Boundless Sea’s movements, only guess at them, and in the end he couldn’t escape the evil claws of this master of playing dirty. This time, the Golden Right Hand’s attack was extremely accurate. Boundless Sea thrust two pointed fingers towards Cold Seasons, and the qi between his fingers was forced into Cold Seasons’s body.</p>
<p>Qi Master Level 75 skill, Pulse Break.</p>
<p>There were many attacks where the goal wasn’t to damage the target’s health, but the target’s stats.</p>
<p>Decrease vitality, decrease strength, decrease intelligence, decrease spirit. With a successful Pulse Break, the corresponding attribute of the target would be decreased. The Pulse Break that Boundless Sea used here was Break Intelligence, which decreased Cold Seasons’s intelligence stat.</p>
<p>Decreasing intelligence affected the target’s magic attack, magic defense, and total mana.</p>
<p>An Assassin didn’t rely on magic attacks, and the class’s magic defense wasn’t particularly good either. After being hit by this decreased intelligence, his magic defense became even more flimsy. And a Qi Master mostly dealt magic damage. This was obviously the effect that Fang Rui wanted.</p>
<p>After that attack finished, another immediately followed. A palm landed on Cold Seasons’s body, a Qi Blast, and the qi was forced into Cold Seasons’s body. There were no flashing effects, but the equipment on Cold Seasons’s body suddenly looked like it was malfunctioning, and Cold Seasons’s health slid down at an extreme rate. When a Qi Master dealt damage, it was just that quiet and incredible.</p>
<p>The combination of a Level 75 and a Level 70 effect instantly stole away a quarter of Cold Seasons’s health. Cold Seasons was ultimately sent flying by the Qi Blast, but after he got up, he saw that Fang Rui hadn’t controlled Boundless Sea to chase him over here.</p>
<p>“Hurry and get up, victory still hasn’t been decided!” Fang Rui, filled with righteousness, continued to talk in the chat…</p>
<p>Chapter 1149: Qi Master versus Assassin (3)</p>
<p>After being blasted away by the high-level skill, Cold Seasons returned to his feet with a Quick Recover. However, when he looked across, Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea showed no sign of seizing this opportunity to pursue him. He stood steadily while the airflow created by the qi attack’s explosion stirred up the dust on the ground. He looked righteous and had the imposing manner of a grandmaster.</p>
<p>What happened? Did his playstyle also change after switching classes?</p>
<p>The doubt only lingered in Zhou Guangyi’s mind for a second.</p>
<p>The Qi Master’s design was radiant and righteous, but just then, Fang Rui had sneaked an attack when his view was blocked by the Qi bullet. How sneaky and deceitful was that? Playing dirty wasn’t just a tactic, it involved many aspects, such as the technique and mentality. Fang Rui was someone whose dirty playing was tainted right to his bone’s core.</p>
<p>Why didn’t he seize the opportunity to launch his attacks after the high-level skill? Due to the system’s judgment, it was very difficult to continue a combo after a high-level skill, but there was still a lot of opportunities for him to seize. However, Fang Rui seemed as if he were unwilling to take advantage over someone in a tough spot. Boundless Sea stood silently like a grandmaster, waiting for Cold Seasons to get up and make his move.</p>
<p>What was strange about it?</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi had to wonder why!</p>
<p>When a quarter of his health was blasted from Boundless Sea’s high-level skill, he thought that Fang Rui might not be scheming. Perhaps he only wanted to use reverse psychology to make Zhou Guangyi lose focus. Now that Boundless Sea had a calm and composed manner, Zhou Guangyi couldn’t help but hesitate.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea didn’t advance, but neither did Cold Seasons. There were 14 units of distance between the two. It was as if someone pressed pause.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi couldn’t see through Fang Rui’s intentions, so he thought about letting Fang Rui make the first move. Zhou Guangyi planned and decided to counter every change by remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>However, Fang Rui was patient like him, and Boundless Sea also did not move. The two confronted each other in such manner for one minute.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you moving!” Fang Rui spoke in the chat.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you moving?” Zhou Guangyi asked in return.</p>
<p>“I’m waiting for you to move,” Fang Rui replied.</p>
<p>“…” Zhou Guangyi was speechless. Why was he trash talking with Fang Rui?</p>
<p>Then I’ll move!</p>
<p>His Tyranny roots made his blood boil, and Zhou Guangyi decided not to overthink this. Let’s charge straight on and make this an intense fight!</p>
<p>Cold Seasons initiated with a Shining Cut. The cool air cut through 9 units of distance out of the 14 units between them. Boundless Sea retreated the moment Cold Seasons was about to attack. Fang Rui was planning to flee!</p>
<p>There was a plot after all!</p>
<p>This thought flashed in Zhou Guangyi’s mind. However, his determination was set. No matter what trap Fang Rui had prepared, he decided to fight head-on. After a Shining Cut, Cold Seasons split into two. He used Shadow Clone Technique, the Ninja’s lowest level skill. The actual Cold Seasons teleported behind Boundless Sea. The dagger was about to quietly slit his throat with Cut-Throat.</p>
<p>However, this attack was within Fang Rui’s expectations. Boundless Sea suddenly ducked down and dodged the attack. The character twisted his body around and used a Back Throw while he was ducked down half way.</p>
<p>Cold Seasons immediately jumped back and barely dodged the grab. His body then flickered and returned to Boundless Sea’s side as he stabbed with his blade.</p>
<p>A normal movement wouldn’t have such a quick speed. Zhou Guangyi was currently using the Assassin skill: Teleporting Stab. It was as if the three unit distance didn’t exist as he flashed back to the target’s side.</p>
<p>It seemed like Boundless Sea was still recovering from his Back Throw. However, when Cold Seasons’ dagger stabbed forward, Boundless Sea’s stretched out his hands from the grab immediately rubbed together.</p>
<p>Countercurrent!</p>
<p>This was the Qi Master’s lowest-level skill, as well as one of the airborne skill available for every class. Although it required the Qi Master to launch it by pressing his hands together, it had its strength in staying hidden. No one had expected Fang Rui to cancel his Back Throw much earlier on, and borrowed the position where both his hands were stretched out to launch a Countercurrent. This was hard to defend from.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Guangyi was different! He knew Fang Rui very well. Although he resolved to attack proactively, he still reserved some power for defence.</p>
<p>Teleporting Stab versus Countercurrent!</p>
<p>In terms of the skill level, Teleporting Stab was definitely higher leveled and was faster. If this skill continued to be used, it would definitely pierce Boundless Sea first. However, this attack was unable to interrupt Boundless Sea’s Countercurrent. Since the launching method of Countercurrent was unique and the air was already rising up, it couldn’t be defused by such an attack.</p>
<p>This skill could be exchanged for damage, but he would be the one who was suspended into the air by Countercurrent.</p>
<p>Should he trade?</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi immediately made the decision. He cut down ruthlessly without backing down. The Countercurrent then sent Cold Seasons flying in midair, as well as the beads of blood that trailed from his dagger.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Guangyi was willing to make the exchange, it was obvious that he had methods to counter it. Air Jump, the Assassin’s unique passive skill, allowed them to face airborne effects with ease. After being suspended in midair, Cold Seasons leapt back again. He jumped even higher and activated the Assassin’s new Level 75 skill in midair: Rend!</p>
<p>There was no need to question the damage of a Level 75 skill. There were five new Level 75 skills for the Assassin: Rend, Kill, Dodge, Flash, Exterminate.</p>
<p>The five skills could be used separately, but when the five were used in the order of ‘Rend, Kill, Dodge, Flash, Exterminate’ as a combo, it would deal additional damage. After all, the Assassin only pursued instant and efficient bursts.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was already starting with the Rend, which showed that he believed he had the opportunity to finish using the ‘Rend, Kill, Dodge, Flash, Exterminate’ combo. No one would have thought that when he started with the Rend, Boundless Sea, who was previously on the ground, was tumbling away.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi suddenly had no place to use his skill and experienced the loneliness of life…</p>
<p>This guy!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi thought that when Fang Rui was exchanging Countercurrent with his Teleporting Stab, he had skills which would follow up after the airborne Zhou Guangyi. He used Rend, the high-level skill, so he could have a showdown with Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that, after what seemed like a wrong judgement, Fang Rui resolutely made Boundless Sea flee after the exchange.</p>
<p>He could only use the high-level skill by slashing at the empty air. Although Cold Seasons didn’t receive any attacks after being suspended in midair, Zhou Guangyi wasn’t happy at all. The moment Cold Seasons reached the ground, he followed it up with another Shining Cut. This low level skill had a short cooldown, so it was often used to launch a quick sneak attack by Assassins.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea suddenly turned around and fired a Qi Bullet. Zhou Guangji was hasty in his pursuit, so his lack of defence caused him to be hit straight in the face. Although the damage wasn’t high, and it wouldn’t stop his Shining Cut, it was satisfying to watch the Qi Bullet hit and explode in someone’s face. Zhou Guangyi felt annoyed as he watched it explode on his screen, and immediately realized something: not good!</p>
<p>This was just like the Qi Bullet from before. Fang Rui was aiming to restrict his vision.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi mashed his keyboard, but he was too late. Boundless Sea almost came at the same pace as the Qi Bullet. When the Qi Bullet exploded, Boundless Sea’s following attack had arrived. He jabbed with his finger for Pulse Break.</p>
<p>Break Intelligence!</p>
<p>No way? Zhou Guangyi yelled in his head when he saw the Pulse Break take effect. After that, the Qi exploded and Cold Seasons was blasted away. Boundless Sea was calm and stood straight like a grandmaster.</p>
<p>To be blasted away twice with the same method. Zhou Guangyi didn’t know whether it was because Fang Rui was too shameless, or that he himself was too stupid.</p>
<p>Cold Seasons stood up again and Boundless Sea remained unmoving.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Guangyi couldn’t stand idly any more. After losing some of his health twice, almost half of his health was gone. Cold Seasons immediately rushed up and launched his attack.</p>
<p>“Sigh, why are you so hasty this time,” Fang Rui called in the chat while Boundless Sea turned and fled crazily.</p>
<p>An idea flashed in Zhou Guangyi’s mind.</p>
<p>Fang Rui… was using the cooldown method!</p>
<p>The cooldown method was when a player attacked the opponent solely with high-level skills. However, the cooldown for the high-level skills was rather lengthy, so it couldn’t be used continuously. As a result, when this tactic was used, the player would need to change positions or use any other methods to stall for time after the high-level skills was used. When the cooldown had finished for the high-level skills, they would be used again, and this process would repeat.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was currently using the high-level skills Pulse Break and Qi Blast. The damage inflicted on the Assassin, a class with low defense and low health, was very great. Judging from the two characters’ situations so far, Cold Seasons could only receive five more of the two skills maximum before he would die.</p>
<p>The cooldown method was commonly seen in the online arena, especially classes with some handy high-level skills. Some players actually relied on high-level skills to attack the opponent before running and hiding for the rest of the time. This was a method of fighting that was extremely looked down upon.</p>
<p>However, the cooldown method was rarely seen in professional matches. One of the reasons was that the method wasn’t accepted by many. The other reason was that a pro player wouldn’t be helpless and struggle when dealing with high-level skills like normal players would.</p>
<p>However, Fang Rui still managed to use the cooldown method.</p>
<p>As the master of playing dirty, he had no qualms about using such an unaccepted and disdained method.</p>
<p>When he was using this method, it was obvious that he wouldn’t purely rely on the damage of the high-level skills. He only managed to succeed twice by launching the sneak attack at the most surprising time when the Qi Bullet blocked the opponent’s view. He wasn’t greedy at all despite succeeding with the Pulse Break. After the Qi Blast exploded, he didn’t think about how he could connect it as a combo.</p>
<p>This guy…</p>
<p>All in all, Zhou Guangyi was pretty familiar with Fang Rui, so he could predict his intentions. Since Fang Rui had changed his class, he couldn’t immediately play with ease and habit like he did with the Thief for many years. Fang Rui used the cooldown method because repeating a few skills was a lot easier than having to deal with full sets of skills and combos for a different class. In addition, his unexpected dirty playing was able to make Zhou Guangyi suffer twice.</p>
<p>I won’t let it happen a third time!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi felt that he had already paid enough for this painful lesson, so he wouldn’t be tricked again.</p>
<p>After that, Fang Rui made the effort to avoid fighting, while Zhou Guangyi was also helping him calculate the skill’s cooldown. He estimated when the two skills would finish its cooldown, then he would immediately be on guard with caution.</p>
<p>After he had failed twice, Fang Rui was helpless. “You’ve seen through me.”</p>
<p>“It’s a cheap trick,” Zhou Guangyi said.</p>
<p>“Hey, where did half of your health go?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Here’s my attack!” Cold Seasons sprinted ahead.</p>
<p>“You only have half of your health left, you think I can’t handle that?” Fang Rui yelled and faced him.</p>
<p>This time, it was a real showdown.</p>
<p>In the end, Fang Rui won.</p>
<p>Chapter 1150: As Blossoms Fade and Fly Across the Sky</p>
<p>Fang Rui understood Zhou Guangyi better than Zhou Guangyi did of him. After succeeding twice, Fang Rui doubted that his trick would work a third time. He had decided that he would face Zhou Guangyi in a direct confrontation to determine victory.</p>
<p>But did that mean that he would put his dirtiness aside? Of course not! In this situation, Fang Rui suddenly facing Zhou Guangyi righteously in a direct confrontation was a dirty move.</p>
<p>With those two previous moves, the cooldown method had deeply taken root in Zhou Guangyi’s mind. When Fang Rui started playing like a great hero, Zhou Guangyi couldn’t help but feel apprehensive. He was unable to fully commit to a direct fight without any second thoughts. Under these circumstances, Cold Season’s health had started with about half of Boundless Sea’s health. In the end, Zhou Guangyi lost. It was an inevitable outcome. Even so, when Fang Rui clashed directly with Zhou Guangyi, it hadn’t been an easy victory. When Cold Seasons died, Boundless Sea had less than half of his health left. As for Zhou Guangyi, it was only when Cold Seasons fell did he realize that in that last half, Fang Rui hadn’t set up any traps. However, not setting up any traps became the greatest trap. He had once again fallen for Fang Rui’s trickery.</p>
<p>Yes…</p>
<p>Whether it was in an official match or a private conversation, Zhou Guangyi hadn’t lost to Fang Rui just once or twice. It was just like this match every single time: he would always be constantly reminding himself to be careful and be wary of Fang Rui’s dirtiness, but in the end, he would always fall into Fang Rui’s trap and lose miserably.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he wasn’t trying. His opponent was just too crafty!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi noticed that after every loss to this guy, he would always have the same thought. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>When Zhou Guangyi came down from the stage, he was quite calm. He simply had too much experience losing to Fang Rui, so another loss was something he could cope with. If a rookie had been in his place and lost in this way, who knew how hard the rookie would take the loss.</p>
<p>When Zhou Guangyi returned to his team’s player area, his teammates consoled him. He could only smile and express that he was fine. Now, it was time for Team Hundred Blossom’s second player to come out: their team captain Yu Feng.</p>
<p>Yu Feng had joined the league in Season 6. In terms of career length, he was a junior to Zhou Guangyi, but his current fame far surpassed Zhou Guangyi’s. He was also Team Hundred Blossom’s captain and core player. Zhou Guangyi hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he still warned Yu Feng: “Keep a steady heart!”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Yu Feng chuckled and nodded his head. He recognized Fang Rui’s fame as the master of playing dirty. As a player who joined in Season 6, he had only joined a year later than Fang Rui and Zhou Guangyi, so his competitive experience didn’t lose out to those two.</p>
<p>When Yu Feng walked onto the stage, the crowd became even more fervent. This match would be a confrontation between two All-Stars.</p>
<p>The map was the same as before: Life-Seeking Path. Yu Feng was currently using what was once the former Number One Berserker, Blossoming Chaos. After receiving Blossoming Chaos, Yu Feng took back the title of Number One Berserker for his character. In recent times, Team Blue Rain had wanted to sell Brilliant Edge, the Berserker formerly used by Yu Feng, in the winter. After Yu Feng transferred, no one succeeded him, so Brilliant Edge had just been sitting there idly for half a season. However, the winter season transfer window happened to coincide with Glory’s massive update, resulting in a drastic drop for the value of Level 70 characters. But because of this drop in value, quite a few teams fought for it. In the end, Brilliant Edge had been sold to Team Heavenly Swords.</p>
<p>However, Team Heavenly Sword was a unique team. Their team roster was untouchable and their characters couldn’t be moved either. After Team Heavenly Swords took away Brilliant Edge, they immediately dismantled Brilliant Edge and gave the equipment to Loulan Slash. A rising Berserker character was thrown away just like that. Quite a few people cried at the loss. Sometimes, compared to players, the fate of these characters made people feel even more sorrowful and helpless than the players.</p>
<p>The Berserker that Yu Feng had used for many years had been thrown in the trash, but Yu Feng wasn’t affected much by it. He had fully adapted to his new Berserker.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos soon reached the center of the map. To no one’s surprise, Boundless Sea wasn’t there</p>
<p>So you want to try the same trick?</p>
<p>Yu Feng thought to himself, but he didn’t hesitate. Blossoming Chaos advanced forward and entered the complicated intertwining maze.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, Boundless Sea appeared, shooting out a Qi Bullet to provoke and probe Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Yu Feng had Blossoming Chaos avoid it. He didn’t panic. He simply used his normal running speed to dodge and move towards Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>The tangled and complex map was filled with twists and turns, but Blossoming Chaos’s thought process was very clear. He calmly followed behind Boundless Sea. Whenever a fork appeared, he never seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p>It was evident that Yu Feng wasn’t a stranger to this map. He even had a decent tactical understanding of it.</p>
<p>The two characters played hide and seek just like this. On the stadium’s large screen, a bird’s eye view of the map was displayed, showing the two characters moving around.</p>
<p>“He’s trying to trap him.” Ye Xiu lifted his head and said, when he saw how the two were moving.</p>
<p>“This punk seems to be quite familiar with this map.” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“Mm, his understanding and decisions are on point. Fang Rui has been forced into a corner.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“He’s trapped.”</p>
<p>On the map, Boundless Sea’s movements stopped. At this moment, he had reached the end of the map and could not continue moving forward. As for the other exits, Yu Feng had sealed them. Yu Feng had finally forced Fang Ruin into a dead end.</p>
<p>“Who would have thought that someone like you would have researched this map.” Fang Rui spoke in the chat as his character turned around. Blossoming Chaos already had his greatsword out, dragging behind him.</p>
<p>Greatswords had the highest attack out of all swords, but greatswords were also the heaviest weapons, yet many Berserkers loved using them. Even though Blossoming Chaos had been remodeled when Yu Feng came, this greatsword had been preserved and had been upgraded to Level 75.</p>
<p>Burial Blossoms.</p>
<p>This was the greatsword’s name. It didn’t sound like a name befitting that of a greatsword, especially since this name gave quite an unsettling feeling towards Team Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>However, the community was brimming with youths. No one really thought too much about it. What’s more, didn’t the former owner, Sun Zheping, have to give up on this weapon because of what it forbade?</p>
<p>Burial Blossoms? Very good. Very cruel. When this weapon was created, the name automatically generated for it had once cast quite a gloomy shadow on quite a few people in Team Hundred Blossoms. However, the owner of the weapon took it up and then shattered this shadow into pieces. That year, just how tyrannical had Blossoming Chaos been, brandishing that greatsword Burial Blossoms?</p>
<p>Nowadays, the forgotten Burial Blossoms once again saw the light of day last season. In the second half of the season, it had been upgraded to Level 75. It was now helping Team Hundred Blossoms rise to glory again.</p>
<p>Burial Blossoms was lifted above Blossoming Chaos’s head. Yu Feng clearly didn’t plan on chatting with Fang Rui. He completely ignored Fang Rui’s words. Yu Feng felt like his resistance towards trash talk was quite high. Don’t forget, he had come from Team Blue Rain. The Alliance’s most terrifying trash talker had been his teammate!</p>
<p>Collapsing Mountain!</p>
<p>It was the most common move used by Berserkers to initiate a fight. It was evident just how calm he was right now.</p>
<p>As for Fang Rui, he didn’t appear to be panicked after being forced into a dead end by a Berserker. He observed the momentum of Collapsing Mountain and leaped backwards. Then, he pushed his palms and a Qi Bullet shot towards Blossoming Chaos’s face.</p>
<p>Anyone who watched Fang Rui’s fight with Zhou Guangyi would know that the purpose of this Qi Bullet wasn’t to injure the opponent, but to block the opponent’s line of sight. The theory was no different from the Knight’s Shield Blind strategy. The Shield Blind strategy was more precise and more difficult to figure out the timing though.</p>
<p>This sort of trick wasn’t going to work on Yu Feng though. Blossoming Chaos stepped to the side and the Qi Bullet flew past him. He pulled on his greatsword and with a Backwards Slash, the enormous sword frame hacked towards Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>Fang Rui immediately activated Qi Flowing Cloud. Boundless Sea’s movement speed increased and he dodged the sword, utilizing this opportunity to move past Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos immediately switched attacks. His other hand grasped towards the nearing Boundless Sea. It was the Berserker’s Soul Devouring Crimson Grip.</p>
<p>This grab skill was quite tyrannical. The blood from the hand would form a domain. The hand didn’t need to directly grab the body. As long as the target was within a certain rainge, the target would immediately be sucked in.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Fang Rui didn’t dare let Boundless Sea keep moving forward. The greatsword Burial Blossoms swung to the side, forcing Boundless Sea to roll to the side. The greatsword Burial Blossoms chased after him. The Soul Devouring Crimson Grip left hand gripped back onto the greatsword hilt and struck out with a Wild Blood Strike.</p>
<p>This chain of skills was practically instinctive to Yu Feng. As for Fang Rui? Facing these fast-paced and precise mix-ups, his unfamiliarity with Qi Masters was forced out. For every variation, Fang Rui would always be slightly slow. After several blows, his rhythm lagged a beat behind. Finally, Blossoming Chaos’s attack was unable to be dodged.</p>
<p>“A scene too appalling to look at!” Ye Xiu shut his eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s still in the middle of changing classes. Facing a top-tier place is simply too difficult for him,” Wei Chen remarked.</p>
<p>This Wild Blood Strike was a solid strike. And it just so happened that this attack triggered Burial Blossoms’s 6% chance effect. Sword light transformed into innumerable flower petals that danced in the air. Boundless Sea should have originally been sent flying by the Wild Blood Strike, but he had unexpectedly been stopped and swept up along with these flower petals in the air.</p>
<p>It was a forced knock-up, which had a 6% chance of trigggering when Burial Blossoms hit a target: Blossoms Fade and Fly.</p>
<p>And when the enemy was in the air, any pro player would have numerous combos in mind to execute. Launching an enemy into the air was never a disadvantage for them. The only ones with a headache would be the ones knocked into the air.</p>
<p>Chapter 1151: Give Me A Buff</p>
<p>Gore Cross!</p>
<p>The flowery lights from Burial Blossoms had yet to fade away before Yu Feng made his move. The greatsword’s range of movement wasn’t great when Blossoming Chaos flicked his wrist, but it was enough to let out a horizontal and vertical slash. The airborne Boundless Sea was hit directly, the blood that flew out formed the perfect shape of a cross.</p>
<p>He swung out a Destruction Slash, which damaged the opponent as well as lowered his defense. The Qi Master was a class with cloth armour, so they already had low defense against physical damage. After it was lowered by Destruction Slash even further, the following chains of attacks caused his health to fall rapidly.</p>
<p>Was victory going to be decided so easily with just one attack?</p>
<p>Yu Feng was completely focused as he attacked. His opponent was an All-Star, so he couldn’t leave any openings. Combos didn’t work just by releasing skills in a certain order, it required him to adapt depending on the situation. . The terrain, distance, opponent’s class, and opponent’s reaction were all factors that would influence what skill to choose and the timing. Glory was able to continue for many years without losing popularity because of its complexity and infinite variations.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was currently making extremely precise judgements for every attack, and all of them were on point. The Berserker’s flawless combo made Boundless Sea tumble and struggle in midair.</p>
<p>Yu Feng’s Berserker wasn’t as wild and bold as Sun Zheping’s, but he was more precise and meticulous. Both of them had their own strengths, so debates on who was better was only because everyone saw them in their own lights.</p>
<p>The combo was able to cut down a majority of the half of the life he had remaining. What he had left was only a bit over 10%, so he was only a step away from entering red blood mode.</p>
<p>Bosses would release high level skills when they their health dropped to red blood, but this was only a signal of danger for players. Fortunately, Yu Feng’s combo was at the point where it couldn’t be broken.</p>
<p>With some health remaining, Fang Rui could still make some sort of counterattack, right?</p>
<p>The crowd in the stadium felt nervous for Fang Rui. If he was defeated by Yu Feng in such manner, then the advantage of winning with half of his health left against Zhou Guangyi would have gone to waste.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the spirits of the Team Hundred Blossom’s players rose.</p>
<p>This was what it meant to be captain. This was the moment when the core raised their team’s spirits.</p>
<p>“Go captain!” Although Yu Feng couldn’t hear it, a few rookies still yelled out nonetheless. Even though the noise from the home crowd drowned them out, the rookies weren’t discouraged. Yu Feng’s performance was able to stir up everyone in Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>“Fang Rui isn’t going to lose like this, right?” Ye Xiu said regretfully.</p>
<p>As one rose, another would fall.</p>
<p>While Hundred Blossoms’ morale was boosted by Yu Feng, Happy’s morale was shaken because they had lost the advantage gained at the start.</p>
<p>“It won’t happen. It definitely won’t happen..” Chen Guo shook her head. Even though she wasn’t familiar with Fang Rui and barely knew much about him, she chose to firmly believe in him on the basis of her hope.</p>
<p>“The combo’s been broken.” Chen Guo spoke.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>The combo indeed stopped, but that didn’t mean that his attacks would rest. This was only the system’s call, but judging from when the combos stopped, the distance between the characters, and that Yu Feng could still go up and make two or three attacks if he wanted to increase the number of combos, Ye Xiu knew that the combo had stopped because Yu Feng had wanted to. It was obvious that Yu Feng wasn’t aiming for a higher combo count, but rather to win the match.</p>
<p>Yu Feng didn’t continue his combo because he obviously believed that he had the chance to finish off Boundless Sea. As a qualified captain and ace, what Yu Feng thought about was no longer his personal victory, but how he could increase his team’s chance of winning through his fight. This was why during the time he played, he needed to boost the whole team’s morale to the maximum.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos lifted his sword with both his hands.</p>
<p>How was he planning to attack? Frankly speaking, even Ye Xiu couldn’t tell. Boundless Sea was already falling down to the ground, so everyone was paying attention to how Fang Rui would respond. However, Ye Xiu was watching Blossoming Chaos instead because he knew Yu Feng wasn’t finished with his attacks. Although raising his sword into the air would save some time if he used Crimson Storm, but using such a high level skill straight away wasn’t guaranteed to connect.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea naturally used Quick Recover when he reached the ground, but when he made contact with the ground and rolled, he advanced forward instead of retreating, moving closer to Blossoming Chaos’s location.</p>
<p>Everyone was stupefied…</p>
<p>He had finally broken out of the combo but wouldn’t rolling towards Yu Feng be the same as crashing himself into the blade of his opponent?</p>
<p>However, just before he finished his roll, Boundless Sea lifted his hands and attacked.</p>
<p>Qi Bullet!</p>
<p>This was aimed straight at Blossoming Chaos’s face.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Everyone made a sound of understanding in sync. One could see how engraved Fang Rui’s two performances against Zhou Guangyi last round was in people’s minds. Now that they saw Boundless Sea send out a Qi Bullet by surprise, they immediately thought of……</p>
<p>Pulse: Break Intelligence, Qigong Blast, right?</p>
<p>Everyone in the stadium became excited.</p>
<p>Too naive…</p>
<p>Yu Feng was very calm, but he couldn’t help but to ridicule. After using the same trick twice on Zhou Guangyi, you still think it’ll work on me? Fang Rui, you’re underestimating me! Too bad for you, I’ve already predicted that you would do this because you don’t have any other choice. With a Qi Master, you aren’t familiar enough with the class to fight at such a high-level.</p>
<p>“Go back and practice!”</p>
<p>Yu Feng still managed to type up something at such a critical moment. People had to wonder if players who originated from Blue Rain all shared a certain trait.</p>
<p>Qi Bullet?</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos was about to use his high-level skill, his body leaned forward so he could summon up power. By lowering himself, he completely dodged the Qi Bullet, and his sight wasn’t blocked.</p>
<p>He clearly saw Boundless Sea’s action.</p>
<p>He braced up his arms, this was……Reinforced Iron Bones, the Strikers’ low-level pre-advancement skill.</p>
<p>A good plan!</p>
<p>Yu Feng couldn’t help but praise in his mind. It seemed that Fang Rui didn’t expect for the same trick to work thrice, so he added another small trick this time. He already knew that he couldn’t win, so Fang Rui only wanted to take away some of Blossoming Chaos’s health. This was why right when the Qi Bullet was sent out to block Yu Feng’s sight, he activated Reinforced Iron Bones.</p>
<p>Reinforced Iron Bones increased the user’s defense and gave the user Super Armor.</p>
<p>Fang Rui knew that Boundless Sea didn’t have much health left, so he charged forward boldly. If he fought Blossoming Chaos straight on, then he would be taken down. So this was why Reinforced Iron Bones became the core of his surprise attack. This skill allowed him to take a surprising amount of damage from his opponent, which naturally gave him the opportunity to deal a satisfying amount of damage..</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’ve seen it. How could I give you this opportunity?</p>
<p>If he activated Reinforced Iron Bones, Crimson Storm by itself couldn’t create an instant kill, but…</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos let out a roar as he leaned forward. His eyes and the skin immediately turned blood red. The Berserk’s cooldown was finished, so Yu Feng chose to activate it at this time. With this buff, instant killing Boundless Sea with Crimson Storm wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Fang Rui obviously realized that his trick was seen through, but he had already reached the point of no return. Crimson Storm’s attack range was pretty big, and since Boundless Sea was already this close, it was impossible for him escape from the attack. He could only charge ahead. However, facing an instant kill attack, would he still have the chance to deal any damage?</p>
<p>Not many people could understand the current situation. The crowd became excited and believed that Fang Rui was about to succeed again with a Pulse Break and Qigong Blast combo, which will send the opponent flying away!</p>
<p>Pulse Break? How much damage would it make?</p>
<p>Yu Feng thought to himself as the bloody Burial Blossoms struck down, filling the sky with a bloody aura. Boundless Sea, who was situated in it, started to lose health, but the height of the attack had yet to come.</p>
<p>The stadium became quiet,. Everyone could see that Boundless Sea was truly on the defensive now.</p>
<p>However, Boundless Sea continued to sprint ahead at nearly zero health.</p>
<p>Would he make it in time?</p>
<p>Everyone in the stadium felt nervous for Fang Rui. Even a pro player with the most accurate calculations couldn’t predict whether Boundless Sea could damage Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Within the boiling, bloody air, Boundless Sea’s right hand managed to touch Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>He ran out of time!</p>
<p>Everyone sighed, Boundless Sea’s health had fallen to zero.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, it was as if a strong blast of qi poured into Blossoming Chaos’s vest as it rustled in the air.</p>
<p>Qigong Blast!</p>
<p>Boundless Sea’s health hit zero, but the damage was dealt. Qigong Blast, he went straight for the Qigong Blast. Fang Rui didn’t use Pulse Break to increase its damage.</p>
<p>Yu Feng’s face turned uglier.</p>
<p>However, it was only damage from a high-level skill… even though it wasn’t perfect, it was still acceptable.</p>
<p>Soon after that, Blossoming Chao’s health slid down, but it was greater than he had expected.</p>
<p>One fifth!</p>
<p>The Qigong Blast actually took out a fifth of his health! It was even stronger than his Crimson Storm, a Berserk-buffed one too.</p>
<p>Wait… Berserk?</p>
<p>Yu Feng suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>At this moment, he saw that Fang Rui had replied to his message: “You too.”</p>
<p>Go back and practice!</p>
<p>What Yu Feng meant was that Fang Rui’s Qi Master wasn’t up to his level.</p>
<p>However, Fang Rui said you too…</p>
<p>Yu Feng realised that he had still fallen for his trap.</p>
<p>Berserk buffed all of his offensive capabilities, but it also drastically weakened his defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>Fang Rui used Reinforced Iron Bones to trick him into using Berserk. He didn’t use Pulse Break, because Berserk had given him enough of a boost to Qigong Blast.</p>
<p>This was why when Qigong Blast was used. Along with the weakening of Blossoming Chao’s defence from being in Berserk mode, he was able to take away a fifth of his health.</p>
<p>Although Yu Feng won this match, he suffered a crushing defeat in the last moment. A skill he activated himself had helped his opponent.</p>
<p>“He’s truly dirty…” Yu Feng sighed.</p>
<p>Chapter 1152: Rules</p>
<p>Fang Rui left the stage, and as he walked back to Happy’s player area he waved and greeted the crowd. The last bit against Yu Feng was the most interesting part of Fang Rui’s performance, but it was high-level in terms of technical content. Without the commentary, the live crowd had trouble understanding it, so they would need to go back to fully appreciate it.</p>
<p>But no matter what, to defeat one of the Hundred Blossom’s players and then take down a fifth of the health of the captain and core player, Fang Rui had performed admirably. As the home crowd, of course they had to show their support with their applause.</p>
<p>In Happy’s player area, Mo Fan silently stood up, and without saying anything to his teammates, he headed down toward the stage. Fang Rui was still interacting with the crowd, and all of their attention was on him, so not many noticed Mo Fan. It seemed that Fang Rui didn’t notice him either, but when they passed each other, he simply said to him, rather abruptly, “Play well.”</p>
<p>Mo Fan paused in his step and turned his head back to look, but Fang Rui didn’t stop, nor did he look at him. He was striking poses for the crowd to take pictures of him!</p>
<p>Mo Fan continued to quietly walk onstage and entered the player booth.</p>
<p>The third battle of the group round: Happy’s Mo Fan, playing Deception, versus Hundred Blossoms’s Yu Feng, playing Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>One was a rookie, one was an All-Star level God. On paper, there was an extremely clear disparity in this match-up.</p>
<p>This battle was like the first battle of the individual competition, but now the situation was reversed. This time, it was Happy’s player stepping onstage for the first time, against a first-string God in the professional circle. Mo Fan hadn’t appeared in the opening round.</p>
<p>Learning from what had happened in the individual competition, the judge was somewhat anxious and made a special visit to check on the status of this Happy rookie. But all he found was that this player’s face was as still as water.</p>
<p>Poor thing, he was so nervous that his facial expression was frozen stiff. The judge sighed in his heart.</p>
<p>“No need to be nervous, just treat this as a normal game,” the judge said to him warmly. He sympathized greatly with rookies.</p>
<p>But the rookie only glanced at him. Without saying anything, he entered the player booth with that frozen expression.</p>
<p>He didn’t hear me speak? But that’s not right, he looked at me. He did hear me speak? Then what kind of reaction was that? The judge was at a loss. But this wasn’t his responsibility, it was just his own good intentions. Doing this was enough, so he didn’t pay any more attention, and went back to the judging area to check the confirmation status of both competitors. That rookie wouldn’t be like the last one, would he? Entering the player booth and then not doing anything?</p>
<p>But the judge saw that both competitors had confirmed they were ready. The rookie’s actions were decisive!</p>
<p>The judge checked the time and it was about time, so he allowed the new battle to begin.</p>
<p>The map was the same as before.</p>
<p>But Mo Fan was new to the professional scene. Even if he often played in the in-game Arena, he hadn’t professionally analyzed these maps like most pro players did. And Yu Feng, on the other hand, had already demonstrated in the previous battle that he was no stranger to this map. No matter which way you looked at it, the victory in this round seemed like it was already determined.</p>
<p>Even the applause from the crowd was rather subdued, as though not wanting to give the rookie too much pressure. There were no shouts of “you must win” or anything like that.</p>
<p>The two characters entered the map. Yu Feng’s Blossoming Chaos directly charged toward the center, while Mo Fan’s Deception began moving along a roundabout path.</p>
<p>The four Nightwalker subclasses very rarely battled head-on, so Yu Feng was unsurprised when he arrived at the center of the map without seeing Deception.</p>
<p>He really was quite familiar with this map. He didn’t even have to look around to determine the positions from which the opponent might launch a sneak attack.</p>
<p>Yu Feng stared at these positions. At this time, Mo Fan’s Deception had already arrived, and was hiding at one of these positions, staring at Yu Feng’s Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Neither side moved. The battle was at a standstill.</p>
<p>For Glory competitions, whether or not to introduce a time limit had always been a source of controversy.</p>
<p>With a time limit, playstyles would become more utilitarian, and the battles would become more uninteresting and ugly to watch. But without a time limit, there would be patient stalemates that made the battle suffocatingly dreary, especially for the broadcast. These tactics wasted time with nothing happening, and it drove them crazy.</p>
<p>Right now, for example…</p>
<p>Neither Yu Feng nor Mo Fan took the initiative to attack. They were both waiting for the other to expose an opening they could exploit.</p>
<p>This sort of tense, anticipatory atmosphere sounded like it carried a lot of feeling, but when watching, it looked like a frozen image.</p>
<p>The players were testing each other’s patience, but they were also testing the patience of the crowd. If everyone had enough patience, would this scene just drag on forever?</p>
<p>Part of the reason why this situation could come about was because of how Glory maps were designed. The maps they used for battles were extremely vast, increasing the number of options available in battle and increasing this sort of hiding and testing patience.</p>
<p>How to solve this? People had pondered this for several seasons now, but no satisfactory solution had been reached. But they had to solve this problem, otherwise it could really happen that neither side attacked and instead just stared at each other for an hour.</p>
<p>In the end, the Alliance gave the power to the judge. If such a situation came up in battle, they could make a ruling.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was of course familiar with all of the rules of competition. He didn’t move.</p>
<p>Mo Fan was now a pro player, and of course he understood the rules, but he had never experienced the rules. He didn’t move either.</p>
<p>Thus, soon there was an announcement in the battle system.</p>
<p>It was from the judge. After this long standoff, the judge declared that Mo Fan would be given a yellow card for wasting time in battle.</p>
<p>Even though Yu Feng hadn’t moved either, he had directly approached and was out in the open, while Mo Fan’s intent while hiding was obvious. In these conditions, the one who would be given a warning was Mo Fan; he was the one expected to take the initiative. Yu Feng was clear on this point, so he wasn’t worried. He patiently waited until Mo Fan was forced by the judge to make a move.</p>
<p>One yellow card was considered a warning. Two yellow cards would become a red card. In football, a red card meant that the player was dismissed from the game. In Glory matches, in an individual match, if a player got a red card and was expelled, victory was given by the judge to the opponent.</p>
<p>Mo Fan had read the competition rules, and now, he finally experienced the rules.</p>
<p>After the yellow card, if he continued to maintain this situation, the second yellow card would come much sooner, and he would quickly get a red card.</p>
<p>So Yu Feng knew, after this Mo Fan must move. He focused all of his attention on his surroundings.</p>
<p>As expected, Mo Fan moved.</p>
<p>Deception left the place he was hiding, and quietly walked, switching to another position. And then, he hid himself again.</p>
<p>He continued not to move.</p>
<p>The judge was instantly furious!</p>
<p>At first, he had cared about this rookie, but this rookie was trying to play this sort of clever trickery with him. Switching to a different position to hide, you think that that’s enough to consider yourself as taking the initiative?</p>
<p>Seeing that Deception appeared to have no intent of attacking, the judge sent another announcement in the system.</p>
<p>Second yellow card, changed to red card, Deception is disqualified!</p>
<p>The crowd was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Mo Fan was shocked.</p>
<p>What? Was this not allowed?</p>
<p>The system declared Yu Feng’s victory. Even Yu Feng himself was surprised.</p>
<p>What was this rookie from Happy doing? He got a yellow card and still didn’t move, was he looking for that red card? Yu Feng had no way of knowing that Mo Fan did move, but his movement made the judge feel that this player was mocking him. The rules were not made so you could find loopholes in them like this!</p>
<p>With the red card, Mo Fan was declared the loser, and players that earned a red card were banned from the next round of matches. Depending on the situation, there could be even more severe suspension penalties.</p>
<p>The live crowd was speechless. They had no idea how to express their current feelings toward all of this. After all, this was a rookie playing onstage for the first time, booing him seemed a little harsh! But being red carded like this was equivalent to giving the opponent a perfect victory, this this this… it really made people upset.</p>
<p>Under the conflicted eyes of the crowd, Mo Fan left the stage and headed back to the player area.</p>
<p>Happy’s players wanted to cry. This was all an issue of miscommunication! But the problem was, it was truly too difficult to communicate with this kid. They let him figure things out on his own, and it resulted in this sour outcome.</p>
<p>Mo Fan returned to the player bench and returned to his seat. The others shot conflicted looks at each other, but no one went up to say anything.</p>
<p>And Mo Fan? His face was finally no longer so expressionless and now revealed some hesitation. After some internal struggle, he finally opened his mouth with uncertainty. “What… should I have done?”</p>
<p>He only said this one sentence. Even the point of his speaking wasn’t clear.</p>
<p>“I’ll teach you,” Su Mucheng said, smiling. She stood from where she was sitting in the front row and went back to the corner next to where Mo Fan was.</p>
<p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But Chen Guo was still in low spirits. They’d gotten off to a good start in the group competition, but now with Mo Fan’s red card, they were suddenly in a bad situation.</p>
<p>Happy’s third competitor in the group round was Tang Rou. Facing this difficult situation, she was actually quite excited. But she was also now very clear about her own skill level.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a shot!” These were the words Tang Rou left as she headed to the stage.</p>
<p>It was unlike her normal confidence, but for a rookie facing the All-Star God Yu Feng at four-fifths health and then another player at full health, being able to say “I’ll give it a shot” already demonstrated remarkable courage.</p>
<p>Tang Rou went onstage to the sound of enthusiastic applause. She was currently extremely popular, and not just among Happy fans. Throughout the entire Glory circle, many people were paying attention to this pretty female competitor. Of course, it was wrong to judge a book by its cover, but one had to admit that physical appearance was often the basis of first impressions. Being attractive was always advantageous.</p>
<p>Another rookie, but after being played by Mo Fan, the judge was feeling much less sympathetic toward rookies. He didn’t say much to Tang Rou, and after confirming that she entered the battle, he quickly declared the battle to begin.</p>
<p>In the previous round, one scene of silence was swapped for another, and then victory was decided by a red card.</p>
<p>This round, 23 seconds after it began, the two opponents met in the center and began to fight.</p>
<p>Chapter 1153: Can’t Back Down Even A Single Step</p>
<p>No set up. No probing. The two characters met in the center, made a move, and started fighting. The battle instantly reached a high point.</p>
<p>Everyone in the crowd was caught off guard. No one had expected the fight to be so intense as soon as the two clashed. For a moment, they even forgot to cheer and applaud.</p>
<p>Berserker, Battle Mage. Two extremely offense-oriented classes.</p>
<p>Greatsword. Spear. These two heavy weapons had sky-high physical attack.</p>
<p>But at this moment, under the two players’ high-paced playing, Blossoming Chaos’s Burial Blossoms and Soft Mist’s Dancing Fire Flowing Flame had turned into two gleams of light. The fast flashing collisions between the two weapons made it difficult for many to completely identify what skill each of them were using.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was an All-Star and a top player. He ought to be performing at a high-level. However, Tang Rou was able to defend against this high-level playing. To the crowd, she was a bigger highlight.</p>
<p>She’s worthy of being a Battle Mage coached by Ye Xiu!</p>
<p>The countless viewers watching this match all thought this. Even though there was no official statement that Tang Rou was Ye Xiu’s student, she had been discovered by Ye Xiu and a Battle Mage that had grown beside him. Whatever the case, it was impossible to say that Ye Xiu was not involved.</p>
<p>In fact, this was exactly the case.</p>
<p>As long as Tang Rou needed it, Ye Xiu had passed on everything he knew about Battle Mages to Tang Rou. After that, he helped Tang Rou establish her own style.</p>
<p>Tang Rou was a rookie. A rookie who had no fear. In the end, her playing was so fierce and violent that many people had trouble believing that such a beautiful girl could have such a ferocious Battle Mage.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s Battle Mage had also been very fierce. If not, he wouldn’t have been called the Battle God. However, his fierceness differed from Tang Rou’s. His fierceness couldn’t be replicated by Tang Rou because for Ye Xiu, apart from being a Battle Mage, he was a master proficient with all classes. His fierceness had been built upon this solid foundation. His techniques might seem very ordinary, but in real combat, these same techniques were difficult to defend against because the opponent would discover that no matter how he or she responded to it, everything would be within Ye Xiu’s grasp. One attack until the end, bringing about the title Battle God.</p>
<p>It could be said that it was because Ye Xiu had chosen a Battle Mage to be his main, so One Autumn Leaf became the Battle God. But if he had chosen a different class, the title Battle God might have belonged to a different character.</p>
<p>Through her own style, Tang Rou attracted everyone’s attention because her opponent was Yu Feng, an All-Star level top player. A rookie could fight on par with a top player. How could there be anything else but praise for her?</p>
<p>But were the two really evenly-matched?</p>
<p>The fast pace made it difficult for the viewers to clearly see the situation, but right now, Yu Feng was feeling fearful. He realized that he was being suppressed.</p>
<p>Countless playstyles had emerged from this Berserker class. From the Number One Berserker player, Sun Zheping, to the many players now. Even among these playstyles, Yu Feng was an anomaly. His Berserker was also very aggressive, but it wasn’t as simple or crude as the traditional Berserker. Within his wildness lay exceptional precision. It could be said that Yu Feng’s Berserker had founded a new style. Although it had yet to become mainstream, he was most definitely the Number One Berserker right now.</p>
<p>At the moment, Tang Rou and he were clashing with brute force to determine victory. In reality, this wasn’t what Yu Feng excelled at. However, Tang Rou was a rookie. And he was Team Hundred Blossom’s captain and core, an All-Star level top player. Yu Feng could not accept cowering against a rookie in a direct confrontation. After all, he was not someone who played dirty.</p>
<p>As a result, he decided to confront this rookie directly. However, after clashing with her, he discovered that this rookie’s fierceness surpassed his expectations. If he truly continued to fight like this, he really might just lose out of carelessness.</p>
<p>I need to find back my rhythm.</p>
<p>Yu Feng instantly grasped the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>In order to protect his image and Team Hundred Blossom’s morale, he had decided to fight at Tang Rou’s pace and beat her. But after fighting her, he realized that beating her in this way wasn’t so easy. He needed to drag the match back into his pace to win. No matter what, if he truly lost, it would be the biggest blow to his image and the team’s morale.</p>
<p>Once he made his decision, Yu Feng immediately went from fighting for the initiative to going on the defense.</p>
<p>When Dragon Tooth came at him, Yu Feng didn’t have Blossoming Chaos dodge and counterattack. Instead, he attacked the Dragon Tooth to parry it.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Dragon Tooth abruptly stopped and then stabbed twice into a Double Stab. The change had been too rapid, and the spear had been too close. Yu Feng wasn’t able to parry it with an attack and hastily switched to using the skill, Guard.</p>
<p>Clang! Clang!</p>
<p>Two clangs rang in quick succession. The Double Stab had been blocked. Blossoming Chaos slid backwards. Yu Feng also jumped back too. He wanted to pull apart the distance and slow down the pace.</p>
<p>He had retreated quite fast, but Soft Mist pressed forward even faster. It was almost as if she had been charging forward before even confirming that Dragon Tooth and Double Stab had connected.</p>
<p>Phantom Dragon Teeth!</p>
<p>Another skill followed. Soft Mist flicked her wrist, and her spear transformed into numerous Dragon Teeth.</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<p>Yu Feng’s eyes widened…</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!</p>
<p>Eight after-images?</p>
<p>Phantom Dragon Teeth was similar to the Blade Master’s Shadow Steps. It relied on player input to create and maintain these after-images. The higher the number, the faster the hand speed and precision required.</p>
<p>Eight Phantom Dragon Teeth?</p>
<p>A rookie could actually reach such a level?</p>
<p>Let alone trying to parry Phantom Dragon Teeth, using Guard wouldn’t work either. Yu Feng didn’t want to trade his health away to attack because right now, he was trying to get back his rhythm. Therefore, his only choice was to continue retreating.</p>
<p>These eight after-images let out eight distinct streams of air, making it even more difficult to distinguish between the real and fake ones. Yu Feng could only dodge these eight after-images as if all of them were real. He even couldn’t use his normal movements to evade them. He raised Burial Blossoms in the air and Blossoming Chaos dashed back, utilizing the Blade Master’s Triple Slash.</p>
<p>Triple Slash wasn’t a common low-level skill that could be learned by all Swordsmen. The only reason Blossoming Chaos could use it was because his Burial Blossoms had a bonus skill up for Triple Slash. From this, it could be seen that Yu Feng truly was different from an ordinary Berserker. In his skill choices, he favored this Blade Master movement skill to give his attacks more life.</p>
<p>Through this skill, Blossoming Chaos instantly completed his movement and all eight Dragon Teeth after-images missed. Yu Feng was wondering whether he should complete this Triple Slash and attack back, but he hadn’t expected Tang Rou to immediately raise her spear after Phantom Dragon Teeth and unleash a Dragon Breaks the Ranks to chase after Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Yu Feng turned pale with fright. He hastily slashed again to turn away, but this time, the distance was too close. With Dragon Breaks the Rank’s speed and power, even if it didn’t fully connect, it still sent Blossoming Chaos into a tumble.</p>
<p>Yu Feng immediately Quick Recovered. Blossoming Chaos rolled and stood up. Then, he heard a crash from above the air. He looked up and saw Soft Mist. This time, she had used a skill while airborne. The bloom of magic from Dragon Rises from the Sea locked onto Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Hit!</p>
<p>This time, Yu Feng wasn’t able to dodge it. The Dragon Rises from the Sea landed on Blossoming Chaos’s head. Tang Rou didn’t wait for Soft Mist to land and followed with a Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart. To the naked eye, that magic force pierced straight through. Blossoming Chaos was sent flying back. Soft Mist chased after him. The chasers produced from Dragon Tooth and Sky Strike battered against Blossoming Chaos. The entire stadium was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The spectators saw Tang Rou heroically clash with a top player levels higher than her and were already very satisfied. People would always be more lenient towards rookies. How the match played out was more important than the outcome. Even if Tang Rou lost to Yu Feng, no one would say anything about it. It was just like how Mo Fan left the stage with two yellow cards turning into a red. That wasn’t how someone should lose, but the crowd stopped themselves from throwing out ridicule.</p>
<p>But right now, even someone who didn’t understand Glory could tell which side had the upper hand.</p>
<p>Tang Rou was going to beat Yu Feng?</p>
<p>After a moment of shock, the venue erupted into astonished roars. Even if Happy won in the end, there wouldn’t be such a commotion. It wasn’t only to drive the team’s morale. The crowd had been infected by Happy’s battle strength. They wouldn’t look down on their determination and future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Team Hundred Blossom’s players stared stupidly at this scene. Their captain was being suppressed by a rookie?</p>
<p>Yes, it was true.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was both stunned and furious. He hadn’t expected this rookie to be so explosive. He had retreated to try get back the pace of the match. He hadn’t thought that this would be like a dam breaking. The opponent’s offensive crashed towards him. Yu Feng was a mess, a complete mess.</p>
<p>The pace had originally been one that he didn’t like. He could still play with it thought. Even if he was being slightly suppressed, who won or who lost wasn’t certain. But as soon as he stepped back, the opposing side stepped forward a hundred steps. Establish his own rhythm? Yu Feng didn’t get the chance before his opponent overwhelmed him to the point that he couldn’t even breathe.</p>
<p>I’m going to lose!</p>
<p>In this instant, this thought leaped into Yu Feng’s mind. How could a pro player not have a clear recognition of how the match was playing out?</p>
<p>But even if he knew, what could he do? Yu Feng did his best to defend. He was no longer looking for the rhythm that he preferred. Right now, he needed to keep up with his opponent’s tempo and stabilize the situation!</p>
<p>But… I can’t keep up!</p>
<p>Yu Feng discovered that Tang Rou was even faster and fiercer than the start of the battle. And this had been brought about because he had stepped back…</p>
<p>In front of this opponent, you can’t back down even a single step!</p>
<p>In the end, along with this understanding, Blossoming Chaos fell.</p>
<p>Chapter 1154: Group Arena Decider</p>
<p>Applause! The instant Blossoming Chaos fell, there was no hesitation or shock. The crowd had been waiting for this moment. A rookie beating an All-Star? The crowd shouldn’t be never expecting this sort of outcome, but this match was different. When Yu Feng retreated, Tang Rou pressed hard, beating up Blossoming Chaos into a sorry state. At that moment, the confidence in their hearts blazed. They started looking forward to what should have been impossible and readied themselves to cheer and applaud when it happened.</p>
<p>It truly did happen. Tang Rou beat Yu Feng. Soft Mist’s spear pierced through Blossoming Chaos, taking away the last shred of his life.</p>
<p>Glory!</p>
<p>The symbol of victory flashed onto across the screen. The crowd erupted into thunderous cheers and applause. The rather unfortunate part was that this was the group arena. The winner needed to stay in the player booth and get ready for her next opponent. She couldn’t come out and receive their her applause. The crowd didn’t care about that though. Even if the main character wasn’t there, the rest of Team Happy were there, no? Victory belonged to the individual and the team. This was Tang Rou’s victory, but it was also a victory for Team Happy’s.</p>
<p>When Yu Feng came out from the stageplayer booth, he looked calm, but his heart wasn’t calm at all.</p>
<p>An All-Star beaten by a rookie? This might become the headlines of the news. And he served as the contrast to the news, the target to be ridiculed.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was unwilling!</p>
<p>If they played again, he was confident that he could beat Tang Rou. Unfortunately, there were no ifs in competition.</p>
<p>Yu Feng walked down from the stage dimly and returned to his side’s player bench. His teammates didn’t know how to console him. Yu Feng was the spiritual pillar of the team. It was always him who comforteding everyone else. However, he had now encountered such a defeat. What should they say?</p>
<p>Yu Feng didn’t wait for everyone to console him. After sitting down for a bit, he regained his calm. He knew that he could not panic right now. If he did, the entire team would slack because of the loss of their backbone.</p>
<p>He had lost, but his loss didn’t represent Team Hundred Blossom’s loss. There was still another player left for Team Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>“Xiaoping.” Yu Feng called out.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping was Team Hundred Blossom’s third player for the group arena. He had joined the league in Season 6. After a year on the bench, he was promoted to the main roster in Season 7. He played a Summoner, a class that had never appeared before in All-Stars before.</p>
<p>With the captain calling for him, Zhu Xiaoping immediately went over. In terms of seniority in the team, Zhu Xiaoping had been ion the team longer than Yu Feng. However, he respected the newly transferred captain, and he had the quite the opinion ofn their former captain, Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping had officially appeared on the competitive stage in Season 7, the year Team Hundred Blossoms made it to the finals. Even though they ended up losing to Team Tiny Herb, second place was still a great achievement. The team’s morale rose, and many of them clenched their fists, ready to work even harder next year.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping was among them. However, in the next season, Zhang Jiale suddenly announced his retirement, turning Team Hundred Blossoms into a complete mess. Their successor to Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, Zou Yuan, paced back and forth helplessly. Their astonishing new talent, Tang Hao, was unable to carry to the team because he was not the core. In the end, Team Hundred Blossoms failed to make it to even the playoffs. Everything had started with Zhang Jiale’s sudden retirement. Zhu Xiaoping had originally been a youth filled with hope that season. Of course he would hold a grudge against Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>It could be said that Zhu Xiaoping was a firm Zhang Jiale opposer. When Zhang Jiale announced his return, he had been hoping that Zhang Jiale would not return. Tyranny? Zhu Xiaoping sneered. In his eyes, he saw Zhang Jiale as a selfish person. The new Yu Feng seemed to be very responsible though. He took his duties very seriously. Even if their record wasn’t that good when he had first arrived, he never felt disheartened or pushed the blame onto anyone else. Zhu Xiaoping appreciated this very much, so he had always firmly supported Yu Feng.</p>
<p>“Captain.” Zhu Xiaoping walked over.</p>
<p>“Be careful. This Tang Rou is better than we had expected. She’s a model competitive player.” Yu Feng said.</p>
<p>‘But she only has half her health left.” Zhu Xiapoing said.</p>
<p>“She used her ½ health to take out my ⅘ health.” Yu Feng said. He was implying that if she could take out ⅘ of his health with ½ her health, she could take out all of yours with what she had left. Of course, there was no need to say that out loud. Zhu Xiaoping understood what he meant.</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll be careful.” Zhu Xiaoping wasn’t displeased. Whether it was Yu Feng’s professionalism or his skill, he held a high opinion of Yu Feng.</p>
<p>“Good luck.” Yu Feng said.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Zhu Xiaoping nodded his head. Under the hopeful gazes of his teammates, he walked onto towards the stage.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms versus Team Happy, the group arena deciding match began. A half-health Soft Mist versus Zhu Xiaoping’s full-health Summoner, Wind Carving.</p>
<p>Both were Mages. Neither of them hesitated when the match started.. They headed straight for the center and came across each other not long afterwards. At By this time, Zhu Xiaoping had already summoned several beasts.</p>
<p>Because of the limited number of skill points, Summoners could not level all of their summons to max. Which skills to level depended on each player’s preferences. As a result, there were countless combinations with almost a new school of thought being created every so often. However, despite the numerous variations, they could not depart from the core design. Every new school of thought weren’t solely based on a player’s preferences, but also for logical reasons.</p>
<p>Usually, there were one or two summons that as acted as the core and the other choices were constructed around this core. From this, it could be seen that summons were usually chosen to construct a team, so it was very complicated. A part of why there were no top Summoners in the league was because of the class. Whether it was tactics or play, this class was difficult to use. But for a new player, this class had its easy parts. When killing mobs, they just had to summon a bunch of monsters and then just sit there safely behind their summons while sipping tea. It sounded very simple.</p>
<p>A class that was easy to pick up, but difficult to master was quite popular. Zhu Xiaoping was had been one of these people. He liked this class and had studied this class hard. He hoped that one day he could lead his own summoned army to take the throne in Glory. He had worked hard for that day to come, every practice, every match….</p>
<p>Seeing Soft Mist charge at him, Zhu Xiaoping immediately had Wind Carving arrange his summons into a formation.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping’s Summoner style had been popular for a long time. It was the undying Undead Knight style. As the name implied, this style had an Undead Knight as the core. Undead Knights had high defense, high physical attack, and high health. Its huge body gave the user a sense of safety. Zhu Xiaoping’s Undead Knight Style had built upon the foundations of the style along with his own individual addition to it. This addition was the usage of an Spirit Cat. Zhu Xiaoping was a pro player. His playstyle would naturally be imitated by others. As a result, the Undead Knight and Spirit Cat style was considered as the most optimal way of using the Undead Knight. All sorts of guides had appeared on the web.</p>
<p>However, pro players weren’t pro players because they were always imitated, but because they were incapable of being surpassed.</p>
<p>The Spirit Cat Knight style wasn’t just dependent on the Spirit Cat and Undead Knight. It also depended on the player’s skill in controlling his or her summons.</p>
<p>At this moment, in front of Zhu Xiaoping were a large, dark armored Undead Knight and a slender snow-white cat as protection for the Summoner.</p>
<p>Come!</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping watched Soft Mist’s movements carefully and had his Undead Knight fight her. His Undead Knight held a shield in one hand an extremely long spear in the other. He raised the spear and stabbed towards Soft Mist.</p>
<p>The staff in his hands waved again and again. Summon after summon appeared before him. The Spirit Cat Knight style was centered around the usage of these two summons. That didn’t mean the Summoner diwouldn’t have summon anything else. There were many summons that supported and attacked.</p>
<p>For example, Demon World Flowers!</p>
<p>This plant came from another world and practically no Summoners would want to give up on this summon. Even though it could not move, it was extremely powerful within its attack range. It could release poisonous pollen, use its roots to attack from underground, bind the target with its vines, and its flower petals could devour the target.</p>
<p>Demon World Flowers were never the core of a Summoner playstyle, but if there was a poll, the vast majority of people would consider the Demon World Flowers as the most annoying summon to deal with. As long as it was summoned brought out and the Summoner stood nearby, it would bring about a whole lot of trouble. Trying to wait out the Demon World Flowers’ duration was impossible. All summons could stay on the field forever as long as they did not receive damage. The only saving grace was that only one flower could be summoned at a time.</p>
<p>Whenever Demon World Flowers were summoned, anyone would have to carefully consider whether to step into that area, especially when there were other summons rampaging there.</p>
<p>However, Soft Mist didn’t seem to notice this formation. Her footsteps didn’t stop or slow down as she charged straight towards him.</p>
<p>“Sure enough, compared to our research on her, she’s even more…” Zhu Xiaoping had trouble finding the right words to describe Tang Rou’s actions. He was in the middle of his summoned legion, safely ordering his summons to surround Soft Mist.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!!</p>
<p>Soft Mist released her skill.</p>
<p>“How impatient!” Zhu Xiaoping sighed. His Undead Knight went forward with his shield to block it.</p>
<p>No class dared to clash with Dragon Breaks the Ranks directly, but the Undead Knight had no fear. Perhaps because it was only a summoned creature that could be born again in a new world and could be replaced with a new Undead Knight soon afterwards…</p>
<p>Chapter 1155: Breaking Through the Legion of Summons</p>
<p>The Undead Knight faced Soft Mist’s Dragon Breaks the Ranks.</p>
<p>In this situation, many would feel their hearts hurt seeing their high-level skill landing on a summon. A summoned creature could be re-summoned after dying. Often times, it wasn’t a fatal loss for the Summoner.</p>
<p>But Tang Rou refused to retreat. The Undead Knight reached her, but Soft Mist didn’t pause. Charge!</p>
<p>As for the Undead Knight? After receiving orders from its master, even if it wasn’t willing, it could only carry them out. Soft Mist’s spear and the Undead Knight’s shield collided against each other.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks was a high-level Battle Mage skill. A single summoned creature didn’t have the ability to completely negate its momentum. The Undead Knight wasn’t sent flying, but it was pushed back, plowing two ditches in the ground. The spear in its hands stabbed towards Soft Mist.</p>
<p>Soft Mist’s posture was lowered and leaned to the side. The Undead Knight’s spear missed, hitting the ground instead. Soft Mist took one step diagonally to circle around the Undead Knight.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>A flash of white flew out.</p>
<p>The snow-white spirit cat had hidden behind the Undead Knight and suddenly launched a sneak attack.</p>
<p>A summon’s AI wasn’t that intelligent. Zhu Xiaoping had controlled the Spirit Cat to make this sneak attack.</p>
<p>This attack was silent and sudden. But to his surprise, Soft Mist’s spear was actually able to parry the Spirit Cat’s attack in time.</p>
<p>Circle Swing threw the Spirit Cat to the side as Soft Mist continued to press forward. Neither the Undead Knight nor the Spirit Cat were her targets. She only had one target, the Summoner Wind Carving.</p>
<p>The Spirit Cat’s sneak attack failing had clearly been outside of Zhu Xiaoping’s expectations. Even with Yu Feng’s warning, he still hadn’t expected Tang Rou to be so quick and precise.</p>
<p>Devil World Flowers attacked at this moment. A vine suddenly shot out from beneath Soft Mist. However, there was always a sign before a vine attacked. Tang Rou was no longer a Glory noob. She had a solid understanding of all 24 classes now. As soon as she entered the summoned legion’s formation, the first thing she did was be on the lookout for the Devil World Flowers. Just before, the Devil World Flowers’ roots had suddenly rustled. Tang Rou immediately knew that a vine attack was coming, so she had Tang Rou jump.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a vine attack came. However, Soft Mist had already jumped in the air, so the vine missed.</p>
<p>Shattering Heaven and Earth!</p>
<p>The Level 75 Battle Mage skill crashed down at the center of the summons. The blazing Dancing Fire Flowing Flame pierced through the crust of the earth and was pulled out. Soft Mist flew backwards and magic waves erupted outwards from her at the center. Anything with health inside its range would receive damage. Even though Zhu Xiaoping ordered these summons to avoid this attack, the summons failed to dodge it cleanly. The spirit-type summons with low-defense were instantly killed by this powerful attack.</p>
<p>“Not good!” Off stage at Hundred Blossom’s player bench, Yu Feng slapped his leg and stood up.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” His teammates also stood up.</p>
<p>Yu Feng didn’t say anything. He fixed his gaze on the battle. In that instant, neither side had made many mistakes. Even though a few of Zhu Xiaoping’s spirit summons had died, the cooldown and mana consumption for summons were low, so a few deaths wasn’t anything to worry about. Yu Feng didn’t care about such losses. In that instant, what he saw was Zhu Xiaoping retreating.</p>
<p>Facing a powerful level 75 Battle Mage’s Shattering Heaven and Earth, retreating was a very reasonable thing to do. However, Yu Feng, who had just fought with Tang Rou, felt a bad premonition arise in his heart.</p>
<p>In front of her, you can’t back down a single step!</p>
<p>Yu Feng had understood this after losing to Tang Rou. However, it had just been a realization. He hadn’t treated it like a lesson, so he didn’t tell Zhu Xiaoping.</p>
<p>But this scene suddenly reminded Yu Feng of his previous match. That inadvertent thought floated into his mind. He suddenly felt like things weren’t going to be looking good for Zhu Xiaoping soon…</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping obviously wasn’t thinking the same thing as Yu Feng. Of course his Wind Carving should safely retreat from Shattering the Heaven and Earth’s range. He resummoned the summons that had died, moved his summons into formation, and prepared to start surrounding Soft Mist again.</p>
<p>Undead Knight! This defender had taken a Dragon Breaks the Ranks just before. Now, he was the vanguard once again. Before Shattering the Heaven and Earth’s power fully dissipated, it stepped into its range.</p>
<p>However, Soft Mist was even more eager than it. Before Shattering the Heaven and Earth’s effects disappeared, she dashed out towards Wind Carving.</p>
<p>“Damn, a pity!” Zhu Xiaoping sighed. Behind Soft Mist, the Demon World Flower’s vines had missed. The Undead Knight had just been a feint. Its purpose was to hide the Demon World Flower’s attack, so the Demon World Flower vines could bind her.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping didn’t know if Tang Rou had noticed it or her eagerness had rescued her. In any case, she safely dodged this attack.</p>
<p>From the current situation, Wind Carving seemed to be in danger. Summoners were one of the weakest classes in terms of close combat. Zhu Xiaoping didn’t panic though. Wind Carving waved his magic staff and disappeared. The Undead Knight’s large body appeared before Soft Mist. Its long spear thrust towards Soft Mist.</p>
<p>Switch!</p>
<p>Using Switch, the user could switch places with a summon. Zhu Xiaoping utilized Wind Carving’s teleport to get the Undead Knight to attack Soft Mist. The timing was perfect.</p>
<p>Tang Rou continued on bravely though.</p>
<p>Her target Wind Carving was nowhere to be seen, but the Undead Knight had reached it. What to do?</p>
<p>The same as before! Fight!</p>
<p>After dodging the Undead Knight’s attack, she noticed that the other summons had surrounded her. Soft Mist swung her spear into a 270 degree arc, stopping the summons’ advances. Then, she jumped backwards and thrust her spear.</p>
<p>Hundred Dragon Meteor Strike!</p>
<p>It was a skill that required player inputs. The spear split into numerous afterimages. For a moment, it was impossible to see how many attacks were truly coming. The system helped to speed up the attack.</p>
<p>The spear shadows formed a circular arc. The summons that tried to advance were repeatedly hit. Her spear’s Flowing Flame effects triggered three times, shooting out lines of fire that instantly killed any unlucky summons in its path.</p>
<p>The only one that could continue forward was the Undead Knight.</p>
<p>It was because of this feature that the Undead Knight became a favored summon among Summoners. But although the Undead Knight had this strength, it was also slow and sluggish. Soft Mist pushed away the other summons and jumped back to pull away from the Undead Knight. She turned around and ran, leaving the Undead Knight’s spear to hit nothing but air.</p>
<p>As for the Spirit Cat, it had suddenly thrown itself at her from out of nowhere.</p>
<p>But this time, Soft Mist pushed it away with a Falling Flower Palm. Utilizing her own momentum, along with the Falling Flower Palm, the Spirit Cat was sent tumbling away.</p>
<p>Then, Zhu Xiaoping discovered that his encirclement failed to take form. The encirclement had been completely torn apart by Soft Mist. And now, the Summoner Wind Carving was fully exposed to Soft Mist. He seemed to be able to feel the heat from her Fire Chasers.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping suddenly started to panic.</p>
<p>A Summoner without his summons was extraordinarily weak. He had already used Switch too, so it was on cooldown. Was there enough time to summon anything?</p>
<p>But Wind Carving suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Teleport…</p>
<p>Wind Carving’s weapon had the Elementalist skill Teleport added to it. For a Summoner, this skill increased the survivability of the class. For example, right now, the completely exposed Wind Carving instantly teleported behind his lovable summons…</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping was overjoyed, but he couldn’t laugh yet. Soft Mist turned around and without any hesitation, her spear thrust out and transformed into a dragon towards his summons.</p>
<p>Rising Dragon Soars the Sky!</p>
<p>Rising Dragon Soars the Sky had a grab effect. The attack target wasn’t limited to just one either. In that instant, the summons in pursuit of Soft Mist were devoured. That tenacious Undead Knight was no exception; it was unable to resist Rising Dragon Soars the Sky’s damage.</p>
<p>All of the summons were pulled together. Not just that, the magic dragon was still roaring with Wind Carving within its range.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping had focused on getting his summons to evade it, but he had unexpectedly forgotten about himself. By the time he jumped back in panic when the dragon head arrived, it was too late. Soft Mist extended her reach and this skill’s attack range was pushed to its limit. Wind Carving was chomped by the dragon head and took the full brunt of the following magic explosion arising from Rising Dragon Soars the Sky.</p>
<p>The battle magic engulfed Wind Carving and his summons and then dissipated….</p>
<p>After this attack, no more summons were left on the field. Even the Undead Knight couldn’t take the brunt of Dragon Breaks the Ranks and Rising Dragon Soars the Sky.</p>
<p>The originally noisy legion of summons was instantly cleared away. The not so far away Demon World Flowers were still rooted there with its petals and leaves gulping up the earth. However, this summon was never the core. With no other summons around it, its effectiveness was drastically diminished. Soft Mist didn’t even look at it as she turned around and charged towards the recovering Wind Carving.</p>
<p>This time, he had no protection.</p>
<p>This time, he had no options left.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping was in a daze. He suddenly had trouble understanding what had just transpired.</p>
<p>What just happened? My summons were instantly destroyed?</p>
<p>Summon again? His opponent was already too close to him. How could she give him any opportunities? Zhu Xiaoping lost the battle…</p>
<p>Chapter 1156: Team Competition, Get Ready!</p>
<p>She… she won again?</p>
<p>This time, the entire crowd was truly shocked.</p>
<p>It was impressive enough that Tang Rou had managed to fight on equal footing with Yu Feng, and they considered her win to be a fortunate accident. But now, with only half her health, Tang Rou was able to defeat the third player of Hundred Blossoms… Even though Yu Feng had already lost a fifth of his health to Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea, he still had four-fifths left. It was by no means a stretch to call this a 1v2.</p>
<p>A mere rookie, in her second-ever round of competition, successfully completed a 1v2, one of whom was an All-Star level superstar.</p>
<p>What was this?</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>The crowd was frozen for quite a while, until suddenly, the stadium exploded with applause, shouts, and cheers. When the results of the group arena were announced, the sound level transferred to the live broadcasts spiked. The clapping echoed through every corner of the stadium. Even those Glory fans who weren’t particular fans of Happy and had just come to watch the excitement realized that they might be witnessing the rise of another Glory star.</p>
<p>Tang Rou walked out of the player booth, and she wasn’t embarrassed by the sounds of the crowd going wild for her with their cheers. She lifted her hand in the air, letting everyone see her waving her clenched fist.</p>
<p>The crowd grew even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>This was a truly remarkable victory, for Tang Rou, and for Happy. There were already people shouting spontaneous chants from the crowd. This was a true home stadium, enough to strike guilt and terror into the hearts of the opponents.</p>
<p>The uproar continued for quite a while, so much so that the sound broadcasting system of the stadium had no way of announcing the next round of the competition. But no one needed the announcement to know that after the group arena came the crucial team competition. And right now, Happy had a strong lead on Hundred Blossoms, 4 to 1. If they won the team competition as well, it wouldn’t be a perfect victory, but it would still very much be a satisfactory victory. Especially with that performance in the group arena, which had been so exciting that it seemed to steal the spotlight from the team competition.</p>
<p>Even the crowd was this thrilled, so of course Happy’s young and old wouldn’t hide the joy in their hearts.</p>
<p>“That was too beautiful!” As soon as Tang Rou arrived back in the player area, Chen Guo swept her up in a hug. From the crowd members that were closer came several wolf whistles at the sight of two pretty women hugging, some people couldn’t help but make some dirty shouts.</p>
<p>“You played beautifully.” Ye Xiu praised her as well.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t just spend all this time basking in that victory. After the group arena’s conclusion, there was a relatively long break until the team competition. During this time, teams would often make adjustments or changes based on the opponent’s condition or other problems that came up. So, after a short period of celebration, the team came together to discuss and prepare for the team competition.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms was doing the same thing. But it was one thing to postpone a celebration, what about an atmosphere of pressure? Were they also supposed to let themselves be happy for a moment before becoming dejected again?</p>
<p>It was clear they could not. They had a rough start in the group arena, but Mo Fan’s penalty came as a great present for them, giving them the huge advantage of 2v1. But then the opponent pulled off an incredible reversal, crushing Hundred Blossoms’s spirits for good.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, what’s wrong with you all? Pull yourselves together. The competition’s not over yet, there’s still the team competition, we can win back enough points!” As the captain, Yu Feng had to raise the spirits of his teammates. But his speech didn’t seem to have much effect. Although everyone acted like their morale was boosted, Yu Feng could tell that it was just to cater to his words. Their fighting spirit hadn’t been ignited by this.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Yu Feng knew that his words weren’t anything special, it was something anyone could say. But he also clearly remembered his time in Team Blue Rain, when they were faced with extremely disadvantageous situations. Even in the finals of Season 8, where they were losing 2.5 to 7 on their home field to Samsara, Captain Yu Wenzhou’s few simple words were enough to lift the spirits of the entire team.</p>
<p>The competition isn’t over yet…</p>
<p>This was the phrase that Yu Wenzhou said the most often. Now, Yu Feng had become captain as well, and what came out of his mouth was the phrase he had heard the most in his previous team. But why couldn’t he achieve the same effect that Yu Wenzhou could?</p>
<p>Yu Feng was frustrated and helpless. He had never actually experienced such a pathetic defeat before. To be defeated in a 1v2 by a rookie, where he, the captain and core player, had been playing…</p>
<p>Was it because he himself was one of the reasons why the team’s spirit was currently so low? Was that why nothing he said could make a difference?</p>
<p>But there was no time for Yu Feng to ponder the wisdom of captaincy. He saw his teammates depressed and dispirited, yet he could do nothing to help. He could only stabilize himself first, calmly meet the upcoming challenge of the team competition, and hope that his own emotion would spread to his teammates.</p>
<p>While the two teams made their preparations for the team competition, the crowd was still enthralled by the victory of the group arena. During this break, the crowd reviewed the exciting moments of that battle, and the screens and the holographic projections were using all sorts of techniques like freeze-frames, close-ups, and slow-mos to display Tang Rou’s mighty performance.</p>
<p>The Hundred Blossoms players and fans could see all this as well, and they were upset. But this was Happy’s home stadium, who would care about the feelings of the visitors? This was the home field advantage. After all, the home team fans were the long-term guarantee for the box office!</p>
<p>The players actively prepared for battle, the crowd enthusiastically reviewed the battle, and what about the media?</p>
<p>The commentator Pan Lin was currently analyzing the match between Thunderclap and Void, but when he heard the news about the twists and turns that resulted in Tang Rou winning a 1v2 against Hundred Blossoms in the group arena, he once again interrupted to switch to broadcasting this match and explaining the situation to the viewers.</p>
<p>The esports television broadcast station received numerous calls that night. The polite ones asked which channel they could watch the match between Happy and Hundred Blossoms and understood the broadcasting system; the more aggressive ones directly asked why they weren’t showing the Happy vs Hundred Blossoms match.</p>
<p>The broadcasters couldn’t blame Pan Lin for switching to talking about another battle, they themselves regretted their decision. But who could have predicted that Happy’s match would explode with this kind of excitement?</p>
<p>Those watching the television broadcast could only continue to be helpless. Meanwhile, the online stream of this match was skyrocketing in view count, far surpassing the other nine matches. The online media who could release news quickly were already sending out draft news headlines about Tang Rou’s performance to their respective pages. As for the newspapers and magazines that didn’t release news as urgently, those reporters had already started to gracefully describe this group arena with their words.</p>
<p>Was the upcoming team competition even important anymore?</p>
<p>To them, it no longer seemed important. No matter the outcome of the team competition, Tang Rou’s performance in the group arena was guaranteed to be tomorrow’s headline. They only hoped that she wouldn’t suddenly hit a low in the team competition, but even if she did, they could still use the poetic descriptor “sometimes angel, sometimes demon” to portray her. From this, it was clear that no matter what, there would be something to write about, and the reporters were all excited, bubbling with delight. It was only until the team competition was immediately about to begin and the players were walking onstage that the reporters finally started paying attention once again.</p>
<p>For the team competition, Happy’s roster consisted of Ye Xiu’s Unspecialized Lord Grim, Su Mucheng’s Launcher Dancing Rain, Fang Rui’s Qi Master Boundless Sea, Qiao Yifan’s Ghostblade One Inch Ash, and An Wenyi’s Cleric Little Cold Hands, with Tang Rou’s Soft Mist as the sixth person.</p>
<p>From Hundred Blossoms, there would be Yu Feng’s Berserker Blossoming Chaos, Zou Yuan’s Spitfire Bright Blossoms, Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin Cold Seasons, Zhu Xiaoping’s Summoner Wind Carving, and Mo Chuchen’s Cleric Arrogant Flowers, with Zhang Wei’s Witch Endless Forest as the sixth.</p>
<p>Happy’s roster had rotated a bit from the previous rounds. The inclusion of Cleric An Wenyi was expected, of course, but aside from that, Qiao Yifan hadn’t yet appeared in this match either. Steamed Bun, who played in the individual competition, and Mo Fan, who played in the group arena, were both sitting back in the player bench.</p>
<p>For Hundred Blossoms, the healer Mo Chuchen joined, but everyone else had appeared in the earlier rounds. This sort of single replacement wouldn’t be considered a rotation.</p>
<p>The two sides came onstage. After they shook hands and performed the other necessary tasks, they entered their player booths. The judge checked that both sides were ready, and confirmed the match’s start. The sound of the countdown echoed through the whole stadium.</p>
<p>Finally, the team competition began.</p>
<p>The map used was Broken River.</p>
<p>The map was in the shape of a standard square, divided along the diagonals into four triangular regions. The top and bottom triangles were forests of stone, while the left and right triangles were forests of trees. The paths in both types of forests were complex and winding, while the northeast-southwest diagonal was a wide road, and the northwest-southeast diagonal was a river that was interrupted by the road at the intersection at the center of the map. The name “Broken River” came from this.</p>
<p>The water in Broken River rushed rapidly, but it flowed backwards. The intersection at the center acted as the source of the water. It flowed to the northwest and southeast corners of the map. There, the Broken River became waterfalls, and they were clearly the exits of the map. If a character fell into the waterfalls there, they would be directly announced as dead and eliminated from the battle.</p>
<p>The two teams appeared at the southwest and northeast corners. Aside from these two points, each of the triangular regions had a support zone.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms appeared on the upper half of the map, the northeast corner.</p>
<p>Team Happy appeared on the lower half of the map, the southwest corner.</p>
<p>The connecting road ran straight through the map with no obstacles. If they followed this road, the two teams would quickly appear in each others’ view. Happy directly charged along the road, but Hundred Blossoms chose a roundabout path, quickly hiding in the stone forest of the northern triangle region.</p>
<p>Chapter 1157: From the Front or From the Rear</p>
<p>According to the Alliance’s rules, when teams picked their home game maps, they were not allowed to use the same map twice in a season. Otherwise, if every team repeatedly used the same map, the matches would become stale. In the past two seasons, a new rule had been established. The following season, teams could repeat not more than half of the maps from last season. By the third season, maps used twice in two seasons were not allowed to be used again.</p>
<p>There were a total of 20 teams in the Alliance. Each team had 38 matches to play in a season with 19 home matches. In other words, each team had 19 chances to pick maps. In order to conform to the Alliance’s rules, each team needed to practice over ten maps. Next season, half of their maps could be repeated, so they needed to practice 5 new maps to continue following the rules.</p>
<p>From this, it could be seen that rotating through 15 maps was enough to guarantee that a team followed the Alliance’s rules each season. However, if a team only cycled through 15 maps, then after two seasons, their maps would be known by other teams, so most of the time, teams practiced more than the minimum of 15 maps. The maps chosen each season were quite flexible.</p>
<p>Happy was a new team. Their rookies were blank pieces of paper. Their chosen maps were practiced from scratch, so it was impossible to predict what maps they would choose. However, Happy wasn’t totally comprised of rookies. Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, and Fang Rui were very experienced pro players. Each of them had maps with which they were familiar and adept with.</p>
<p>Directly choosing familiar maps and then teaching their rookies to learn these seemed to be the simplest method. When Team Hundred Blossoms prepared for this match, they had followed this line of thought to predict which maps Happy would choose.</p>
<p>But then, it turned out that the map chosen was Broken River.</p>
<p>Let alone pro players, even most of the crowd would be familiar with this map. This was a well-known common map in Glory. In the Glory Arena, from 2v2s to 10v10s, Broken River was an extremely popular map, to the extent that many players might be unfamiliar with every map except this one.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, this map could be considered as home map for anyone. This type of map generally wouldn’t appear in a pro match because the home game advantage came from which maps were chosen. Choosing this type of map was equivalent to giving up on this advantage.</p>
<p>Too many people understood this logic. When this match officially started and the teams loaded into Broken River, all sorts of discussion was happening in the crowd. During the Thunderclap versus Void broadcast, Pan Lin didn’t disappoint and interjected with this piece of news. Pan Lin even chatted about Happy’s choice with Li Yibo for a bit, forcing Li Yibo to chime in with his opinions on it. On stage, Thunderclap and Void were fighting intensely…</p>
<p>Happy and Hundred Blossoms were also fighting.</p>
<p>Happy walked along the main road, while Hundred Blossoms walked along the longer broken-off riverside. Since Happy didn’t see Hundred Blossoms on the main road, Happy knew that Hundred Blossoms had taken a roundabout path.</p>
<p>But which path did Hundred Blossoms take?</p>
<p>The crowd with the omniscient view knew, but Happy didn’t know.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Assassin Cold Seasons appeared from the stone forest, but after seeing Happy, he immediately went back.</p>
<p>The viewers had noticed that Hundred Blossoms was hiding in the stone forest for an ambush, but wasn’t this type of bait too low-level?</p>
<p>However, Happy’s five players really did just run towards where Cold Seasons appeared and then disappeared. The crowd suddenly started becoming worried. Chasing as soon as they saw someone, wasn’t that something only an amateur would do? How could pros do the same?</p>
<p>Then, they saw Hundred Blossoms adjusting their positions.</p>
<p>Pros shouldn’t be like this. The viewers knew, and Hundred Blossoms knew even better, so they were mainly aiming to defend against any back attacks.</p>
<p>Happy didn’t circle around behind them, but that didn’t mean Happy had beaten Hundred Blossoms at their own game. Hundred Blossoms may be protecting themselves against any back attacks, but that didn’t mean they would neglect their frontside either. Their formation could instantly adapt. The viewers could see that. Everyone was too familiar with this map. Hundred Blossoms preparing an ambush at this spot was a choice that covered every option.</p>
<p>With both the front and back covered, Hundred Blossoms waited for Happy to arrive.</p>
<p>Happy reached right outside their range. Everyone in the crowd was sweating wildly in worry, but then, they stopped.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms watched speechlessly as a Goblin waddled its way over to them from the outside…</p>
<p>Happy did not have a Summoner right now, but a summon could still be sent in because Happy had an unspecialized, Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms watched stupidly as this weak summon walked in alone. It obviously wasn’t a threat, but a summon’s bravery was laudable. As soon as it saw a target, the Goblin immediately waved its club and charged at its target. The Goblin even threw a rock towards its target: Assassin, Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>Rock Throw was the Goblin’s skill, but don’t underestimate this simple and crude attack; it had a 20% chance of stunning the target. Just for this 20% stun chance, a Battle Mage or an Elementalist or a Witch bringing along a Goblin wasn’t surprising.</p>
<p>But then again, this Rock Throw’s speed was very slow. Hitting a target in a chaotic battle was possible, but in this current situation, if the rock hit its target out in the open without any setup, it would be very shameful.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons easily dodged it. The Goblin waddled over to Cold Seasons and then was killed in a few hits. Soon afterwards, another Goblin walked over.</p>
<p>Two Goblins couldn’t be out at one time, but after a summon died, the summoner would receive a notification. As a result, once Cold Seasons killed off the Goblin, Ye Xiu summoned another one, which came right back in.</p>
<p>“What is he doing?” In Hundred Blossoms’s channel, the Cleric Mo Chuchen was unable to hold back.</p>
<p>“Focus,” Yu Feng said. He felt like this sort of confusing trick was to distract them. That was what he thought, but he didn’t say it with certainty in the channel. In reality, he was also very confused. What is he doing?</p>
<p>When the second Goblin came in, Hundred Blossoms’s formation didn’t change. As a result, this Goblin once again targeted Cold Seasons. It ran at him and then was killed after a few hits.</p>
<p>The third Goblin came in.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms was being driven mad, but they also understood. This Goblin was sending them a message: Don’t be naive. We’re not going to run in.</p>
<p>If Hundred Blossoms didn’t come out and Happy didn’t go in, what would the result be?</p>
<p>This question was rather difficult to answer. The tactics involved in a team competition were far more complex than the tactics involved in an individual competition. Mo Fan could quickly be sent out with two yellow cards into a red, but in the team competition, if a stalemate appeared, the referee would need to carefully ponder over it. Even though referees had undeniable authority in their decision, after the match, the referee’s decision could be judged to see if it was reasonable, especially for a particularly difficult decision. It was a situation no referee wanted to encounter.</p>
<p>However, the referee for this match was clear-headed.</p>
<p>Because this match wasn’t in a stalemate. Three Goblins might have walked in, but Happy’s other players were moving. Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, Qiao Yifan, and An Wenyi were circling around to the back.</p>
<p>Yu Feng’s initial judgement had been correct. This deliberately confusing move was to distract them and create a diversion.</p>
<p>However, Hundred Blossoms wouldn’t be so distracted that they wouldn’t notice what was happening behind them, no? They were feeling a bit restless, but their formation hadn’t slackened. No matter which way they were attacked, even if it was a pincer, they would still have the advantage.</p>
<p>At this point, Lord Grim had summoned a total of five Goblins now. Ye Xiu was also talking with the enemy team in the public chat.</p>
<p>“How many has it been so far?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“5…” Yu Feng replied, unable to say anything else.</p>
<p>“How many do you plan on going until?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>If they went out now, they might be the ones caught in the enemy formation. Team Hundred Blossoms pondered over what to do. Should they go out? Happy didn’t seem to dare charge in, but at the same time, if they kept up this stalemate, the referee would eventually intervene sooner or later. What would the referee rule? There was clearly an ambush lying in wait. Forcing Happy to charge in was unreasonable. However, Happy was defending the entrance. Forcing Hundred Blossoms to come out wasn’t reasonable either.</p>
<p>At this moment, Hundred Blossoms deeply felt the referee’s troubles.</p>
<p>“Maybe he’ll reset the match?” Zou Yuan said.</p>
<p>With neither side being an easy decision, resetting the match to resolve a stalemate had occurred before.</p>
<p>“Wait for a reset?” Zhou Guangyi said as he killed off the fifth Goblin. He didn’t like this type of stalemate. In fact, he didn’t even like setting up this ambush even though he was an Assassin.</p>
<p>The final decision came down to their captain Yu Feng. As he pondered… a sixth Goblin had waddled in. Everyone was already getting numb to it.</p>
<p>“I think…” Zhou Guangyi was about to type out his opinion, when he suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. Then, he saw three Anti-Tank Missiles shooting towards him at a speed far faster than that waddling Goblin.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi didn’t have time to type. He immediately rolled. The three Anti-Tank Missiles exploded at where he just escaped. It wasn’t until the explosion did the other four suddenly snap back to the battle.</p>
<p>All of them turned to the front, looking for signs of the enemy. For a moment, they had forgotten about their responsibilities because of this sudden attack.</p>
<p>Opportunity was just an instant.</p>
<p>From behind Hundred Blossoms, four of Happy’s players charged in.</p>
<p>Chapter 1158: Pincer</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms’s negligence had only been for an instant. With the continuous pointless harassment from Goblins, a sudden accurate attack made every Hundred Blossoms player instinctively take a look in that direction. It was simply human nature.</p>
<p>However, this human nature became an opening in this battle. Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, Qiao Yifan, and An Wenyi, who had circled around behind them, started their assault.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan first laid down his ghost boundary.</p>
<p>Sword Boundary increased both Intelligence and Strength. It was an extremely powerful supportive buff for any class. Dancing Rain, Boundless Sea, and Little Cold Hands were already standing inside this Sword Boundary’s range. Dancing Rain, who had the longest range out of them, was the first to initiate the fight. Of Hundred Blossoms’s five characters, four of them were completely exposed to her. A huge opening in their rear had appeared.</p>
<p>Heat-Seeking Missile!</p>
<p>A target landed where Dancing Rain pointed her finger, and a missile flew towards this target in an arc. Right when Hundred Blossoms’s players turned back around, they suddenly saw four Happy players pop up out of nowhere. As they turned pale with fright, the Heat-Seeking Missile descended from the sky and crashed into the target. A mini-mushroom cloud erupted in the middle of three of Hundred Blossoms’s players. It didn’t directly hit any of them, but the shockwaves from the explosion was enough to make them suffer. The three affected players dodged, disrupting the carefully arranged ambush formation set up by Team Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Two consecutive gunshots rang. As Team Hundred Blossoms’s ranged attacker, Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms counterattacked. On Happy’s side, Boundless Sea’s two hands formed a circle and then pushed out. A net of light instantly enveloped the four Happy players in the rear. It was the Qi Master’s defensive skill, Qi Guard, which absorbed all damage for its duration.</p>
<p>Qi Guard lasted 30 seconds, but with enough damage, the QI Guard could be broken ahead of time. It was similar to a summon. Qi Guard had its own health too.</p>
<p>But at the moment, only Bright Blossoms’s attacks could reach them. A single character’s DPS wouldn’t be able to break through Qi Guard so easily.</p>
<p>The others in Hundred Blossoms started counterattacking too. Several summoning circles flashed, and Zhu Xiaoping summoned several creatures, which rushed out as their shields. But on Happy’s side, One Inch Ash flicked his blade and laid down an Ice Boundary, which restricted the movements and lowered the defense of any enemies within it. Launcher and Qi Master came out and started throwing out AoE attacks, instantly decimating the summons and rampaging onwards towards Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Ghostblade, Launcher, Qi Master.</p>
<p>These three classes had powerful AoE abilities. In this narrow stone forest, their attacks covered the entire area. Happy’s ambush from behind had come with ample preparation, methodically utilizing the terrain. It was absolutely the result of professional practice.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms was caught off guard and hastily made adjustments. Trying to break through Happy’s firepower directly would cost them too much. Zhou Guangyi’s gaze finally landed on the sides of the stone forest. There were no lack of footholds on these stones. With the Assassin’s Air Leap, he could hop over and open up the situation with an ambush.</p>
<p>As soon as he thought of this, Zhou Guangyi immediately had Cold Seasons jump over. Teammates had their own tacit understanding with each other. They didn’t need to communicate every single of their actions. The others noticed Cold Seasons’s movements and understood Zhou Guangyi’s intentions. They started a full-front assault to break through in coordination with Zhou Guangyi.</p>
<p>Right when Cold Seasons jumped towards the first foothold, Zhou Guangyi saw Blossoming Chaos type in chat: “Careful!!”</p>
<p>Who are you talking to?</p>
<p>A thread of doubt flashed through Zhou Guangyi’s mind. He looked downwards. It didn’t like any of the others had encountered any dangers! Just at this moment, a cold light silently slit across Cold Season’s throat. Blood splattered into the air and rained down.</p>
<p>Cut Throat!</p>
<p>How could Zhou Guangyi not recognize this Assassin skill? It wasn’t until now did he realize that Yu Feng had been warning him. The only one who could have executed this move was Lord Grim. He was able to silently approach me from behind and complete a Cut Throat?</p>
<p>In this instant, Zhou Guangyi really felt like his throat had been slit. After being hit by this attack, Cold Seasons had been stopped mid-jump. However, the attacks weren’t over yet. Lord Grim didn’t wait for him to turn around. Lord Grim used Eagle Stamp, stepping on Cold Seasons as the two fell towards the ground.</p>
<p>Yu Feng’s Berserker Blossoming Chaos was on the ground waiting. Observing how the two would land, he flew out with a Collapsing Mountain.</p>
<p>Lord Grim wasn’t greedy. As soon as he saw Blossoming Chaos leaping towards him, he utilized Eagle Stamp’s momentum to shoot backwards, allowing him to just narrowly dodge Blossoming Chaos’s blade.</p>
<p>The others in Hundred Blossoms provided ample support. Bright Blossoms fired several shots in the air. Wind Carving summoned several more creatures and commanded them to surround where Lord Grim would land. Their Cleric Arrogant Flowers casted a Sacred Fire in the air for Lord Grim to run into.</p>
<p>Then, they saw Lord Grim pull out his sword and release a Falling Light Blade. He switched directions in mid-air, evading Bright Blossoms’s gunshots and Arrogant Flowers’s Sacred Fire. His sword returned to the sheath, and his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened up. It didn’t turn into a spear or a shield. The front umbrella ribs bunched together and formed an arc, transforming into an Exorcist’s sickle. This sickle swung in a circle, and a blue light floated into the air, surrounding Wind Carving’s summons.</p>
<p>Rising Emblem!</p>
<p>Lord Grim safely landed on the ground, while the summons were sent into the air. Hundred Blossoms’s players were dumbstruck. This string of different skills had been performed with such freedom and ease. When had they ever seen such a thing before? Even if they had seen an unspecialized before, without the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, it was impossible to complete such a fluid chain of skills.</p>
<p>The crowd exploded with excitement at this combo. All sorts of cheers and shrieks clamored in the venue. But for Hundred Blossoms, failing to block Lord Grim was secondary. In order to intercept Lord Grim, their formation had been messed up again. On the other end, the other four Happy players broke through an opening and their AoE attacks swallowed up Zou Yuan’s and Mo Chuchen’s two characters.</p>
<p>Being pincered like this was no good, but which way should they break out?</p>
<p>As the captain, Yu Feng realized that he wasn’t able to come to a firm decision. To their rear, the four from Happy had heavy firepower. Breaking through the rear would result in heavy losses. But to their front, Ye Xiu’s unspecialized was all sorts of weird. Even if they had the numbers advantage, he felt like they would be unable to break free from him. That would allow the four from the rear to approach them and provide support for Lord Grim, leaving Hundred Blossoms with even less room to maneuver.</p>
<p>Yu Feng was hesitating. On the other hand, after Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons landed back on the ground and rolled, he directly sliced towards Lord Grim with a Shining Cut.</p>
<p>As a player from Tyranny, his enmity towards Ye Xiu was especially natural. What’s more, he was the successor to Cold Seasons, which had once instant killed Ye Xiu with one strike. He had also been Cut Throat by Ye Xiu as an Assassin.</p>
<p>New enmity and old enmity formed a never ending circle. His side had four people and the other side had one, it was simple math. As a result, Zhou Guangyi didn’t hesitate to charge at Lord Grim.</p>
<p>I guess that’s what we’re doing…</p>
<p>Yu Feng saw Zhou Guangyi make his move already, so he stopped hesitating. Blossoming Chaos immediately opened the way with a Triple Slash and slashed towards Lord Grim. The two characters arrived at the same time, instantly forming a pincer onto Lord Grim. Lord Grim didn’t seem to be in a fluster though. He fished out something from his umbrella and threw it down towards the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Purple smoke spread through the air. Lord Grim had thrown a Ninja tool, Smoke Bomb.</p>
<p>Under the cover of the purple smoke, Yu Feng and Zhou Guangyi weren’t able to find Lord Grim’s whereabouts. The two could only have their characters wave their weapons and hope to hit him. Then, a dark shadow flew out from the purple smoke. The two didn’t notice it due to the purple smoke. Blossoming Chaos and Cold Seasons were suddenly wrapped around by the dark shadow. The dark shadow retracted and the two characters were bound together.</p>
<p>Witch skill: Night Cloak.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a hand extended out from the purple smoke and slammed into the two of them. With a bang, Falling Flower Palm sent the two flying away back to the AoE bombardment from the other four Happy players.</p>
<p>At the rear, Zou Yuan and Mo Chuchen were finally able to escape from the bombardment with the help of Zhu Xiaoping’s summons, but then they saw Lord Grim slap their two teammates back to them. They couldn’t break through from this side, and they couldn’t break through from that side either. Hundred Blossoms was suddenly in chaos. Everyone was thinking of what they should do.</p>
<p>Flash Bullet, Smoke Bullet!</p>
<p>Zou Yuan stood out. His Bright Blossoms threw two grenades and then let out a flurry of skills. Light layered on top of each other, producing Zhang Jiale’s famous Hundred Blossoms style. He planned on using this light cover to let the team escape.</p>
<p>This sort of strategy was no stranger to Hundred Blossoms. Even if Yu Feng and Zhou Guangyi hadn’t come from Hundred Blossoms and had only been with the team for a year, when they first arrived, they had started by adapting to the core playstyle. It was only after they started gradually adjusting to their personal styles and strengths did they stop copying these former strategies.</p>
<p>And now, Zou Yuan had come out with Hundred Blossom’s signature style. The team disappeared within the light. Seizing the opportunity provided by Flash Bullet and Smoke Bullet, they pounced towards the entrance guarded by the lone Lord Grim and got out smoothly.</p>
<p>This scene gave all sorts of mixed feelings towards the Hundred Blossoms viewers.</p>
<p>What did this Hundred Blossoms Style mean to Team Hundred Blossoms? The fans had originally thought that the team had turned a new page, but in this crucial moment, this disdained Hundred Blossoms style left behind by Zhang Jiale had helped them win a chance to turn this battle around.</p>
<p>The fans of Hundred Blossoms felt a mix of emotions well up in their hearts. However, the players on stage didn’t have time to think about all that. They had broken out, but Happy was chasing after them. Su Mucheng’s Launcher and Ye Xiu’s unspecialized had extremely long-ranged attacks. The Qi Master’s Cloud Grasping Fist and the Ghostblade’s ghost boundaries could force them to stay if they weren’t careful.</p>
<p>The battle wasn’t over yet. It was just a new situation laid out in front of them now.</p>
<p>Chapter 1159: What Shouldn’t Be Here</p>
<p>By getting out of Happy’s pincer attack, Hundred Blossoms had escaped from their biggest crisis. Even though they were running away, they weren’t rushed or muddled, and their speed wasn’t that fast either. They had no intentions of completely shrugging off Happy.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms clearly had a plan in mind.</p>
<p>In their team’s class composition, Yu Feng’s Berserker and Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin were close-ranged combatants. As for Happy? Their unspecialized, Launcher, and Qi Master had mid-ranged and long-ranged capabilities. Ghostblades had a slightly shorter range, but Ghostblades still had superior range compared to Berserkers and Assassins. Ghost boundaries could be placed up to 13 units away.</p>
<p>If Hundred Blossoms insisted on breaking away from Happy, they would suffer quite a few losses even if they succeeded. After breaking away, if Yu Feng and Zhou Guangyi wanted to go on the offensive, breaking through the enemy side’s long-ranged blockade would be an issue.</p>
<p>However, since they had just gotten out of the pincer, the distance between the two sides wasn’t too far, so their Berserker and Assassin could quickly become threats if needed.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms looked to be running away, but in actuality, they were waiting.</p>
<p>They were adjusting their formation and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<p>Everyone was focused, waiting for that moment to appear.</p>
<p>It’s here!</p>
<p>With a glance at their surroundings, everyone in Hundred Blossoms immediately became understood that their opportunity had arrived.</p>
<p>“Turn!” Yu Feng didn’t miss this timing and gave out an order in the chat. Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms was the first to turn. His gunfire poured down onto Happy. Mo Chuchen’s Cleric, Arrogant Flowers, rolled behind an enormous rock to the side and readied himself to provide healing and support to his team. Zhu Xiaoping’s Wind Carving stood behind Bright Blossoms. He summoned an Undead Knight as a shield for them and followed with a Demon World Flower.</p>
<p>Yu Feng and Zhou Guangyi, the two close-combat classes, needed to utilize the cover from their allies to enter the enemy ranks.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos and Cold Seasons, one on the left, the other on the right, a Triple Slash, a Shining Cut, to rapidly dash forward. However, they were met with two rays of light. One from a Launcher’s Laser Beam, the other from a Qi Master’s Sky-Piercing Strike, one on the left, the other on the right, to welcome these two.</p>
<p>The two were startled. Triple Slash could at least switch directions. Blossoming Chaos immediately slashed again to the side, letting him just narrowly dodge the Laser Beam. Cold Seasons, on the other hand, was out of luck. Shining Cut could not turn midway through. Forcefully cancelling it and then moving wasn’t as fast as Triple Slash, which let the user turn as a built-in ability. Sky-Piercing Strike connected squarely with Cold Seasons, creating a huge qi wave. Shining Cut didn’t need to be forcefully cancelled as it was interrupted. Cold Seasons was thrown into the Broken River. There was no way to Quick Recover on the water, so Cold Seasons dropped in with a splash.</p>
<p>Bright Blossom’s attacks failed to make enough of a disturbance?</p>
<p>Lord Grim’s huge umbrella, which was far larger than a normal shield, gave them their answer. It didn’t need to be open for long. It just needed to shield at the crucial moment to allow Dancing Rain and Boundless Sea to get their skills off in time.</p>
<p>Everyone in Hundred Blossoms was depressed.</p>
<p>Using a shield to provide cover? It was such an ordinary tactic, but unfortunately, they neglected it because the other team didn’t have a Knight. Even though they had studied Lord Grim’s unspecialized, without practical experience fighting against him, it was hard to fully bring what was in their mind into reality. In that quick change of pace, they had overlooked this point. But by the time they realized it, the error had been made. Bright Blossom’s attacks were ineffective, thus, the assault by Yu Feng and Zhou Guangyi was completely countered.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons was thrown into the river, and so there was no need to talk about the completeness of Hundred Blossom’s offensive right now. Zhu Xiaoping immediately had his Undead Knight push forward to be a shield for them, when everyone suddenly noticed something from the corner of their eyes. They took a glance and saw a Satellite Beam descending from the sky, directly towards Arrogant Flower, who was hiding behind a rock. Arrogant Flower staggered out; half of his body had been burnt black.</p>
<p>A mess! It’s a complete mess!</p>
<p>They hadn’t noticed Dancing Rain’s attack at all. Lord Grim’s umbrella was just that big. It had completely blocked their line of sight towards Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan’s One Inch Ash also leaped out at this moment. A ghostly light dropped from the tip of his sword, and an Ice Boundary formed. The edge of it just happened to sweep past the Demon World Flower. The Demon World Flower was incapable of moving, so it could only take on the persistent damage from Ice Boundary. Not long afterwards, it was frozen into an ice cube. Suddenly, Lord Grim charged out! In the previous second, he had been holding his shield up. In the next second, he became a close-combat attacker that Happy didn’t originally have.</p>
<p>Dragon Tooth, Falling Flower Palm!</p>
<p>The Battle Mage two-hit combo landed on the Undead Knight. The Undead Knight was naturally hardy though. A Dragon Breaks the Ranks only made it slide back. The stun and knockback effect from these two low-level skills were simply unable to move it. However, Lord Grim closed in another step and wrapped his arms around it, lifting the heavy Undead Knight into the air.</p>
<p>There were situations where a Grappler’s grab failed, but the Undead Knight was not one of them. With a Back Throw, the Undead Knight slammed into the ground. The instant that heavy body hit the ground, a loud sound boomed. The resulting shockwave was twice as large as a normal target, and it just happened to reach the frozen Demon World Flower, instantly shattering it.</p>
<p>Lord Grim charged forward again. Yu Feng’s Blossoming Chaos moved forward to block him, but Dancing Rain’s support immediately arrived. After Ye Xiu changed classes, the synergy between the Best Partners hadn’t lessened. Yu Feng also had teammates, but the level of coordination between them couldn’t compared to that between Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng. When they tried to help, it felt like they couldn’t keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>I can’t rely on other people helping. I’m the core of the team!</p>
<p>Yu Feng was unwilling to back down. Blossoming Chaos’s two eyes suddenly turned scarlet-red. Despite being under the enemy’s suppression, he activated Berserk to forcefully make a counterattack!</p>
<p>Soul-Devouring Crimson Grip!</p>
<p>After activating Berserk, Blossoming Chaos’s speed increased dramatically. His left hand grabbed towards Lord Grim. But as soon as his hand touched, Lord Grim was unable to endure this grab and poofed into smoke.</p>
<p>Shadow Clone Technique?!</p>
<p>Even though Shadow Clone Technique was a low-level skill and had a quick hand seal, a hand seal still had to be formed. When did Ye Xiu form it? Yu Feng discovered that he didn’t know.</p>
<p>Where did Lord Grim go?</p>
<p>Yu Feng immediately had Blossoming Chaos turn around. He saw Lord Grim’s true body run towards Wind Carving and use his close-combat capabilities to bully the weak Summoner.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos immediately raised his sword and was about to rush over, when a force suddenly pulled at him from behind. His body involuntarily flew backwards.</p>
<p>Fuck!</p>
<p>Yu Feng cursed inwardly. At the same time, he saw Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim turn around decisively, leaving Bright Blossoms’s explosive attacks behind him.</p>
<p>Cloud Grasping Fist!</p>
<p>Yu Feng didn’t need to turn around to know that this was Fang Rui’s doing.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>In the previous second, he was struggling to break the suppression from Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng. But by the time he acted, Ye Xiu suddenly switched targets to their Summoner. As a result, Yu Feng reacted instantly by chasing after him, but then, Fang Rui sneakily made his move, pulling Hundred Blossoms’s core into their ranks.</p>
<p>After being pulled into the enemy ranks, what would the result be? Every pro player knew all too well. They would become the target of their attacks. That was the only possibility.</p>
<p>In front of Boundless Sea, Qiao Yifan’s One Inch Ash had stacked up several ghost boundaries, ones that lowered enemy defenses, ones that dealt damage, one that buffed allies. The instant Blossoming Chaos landed, before he could even turn around, Boundless Sea jabbed at him with his finger and then with another finger. It was the Qi Master’s Level 75 skill, Pulse Break: Break Intelligence, Break Strength. At the same time, Little Cold Hand’s Holy Commandment landed, immersing him inside its light…</p>
<p>That wasn’t all. Blossoming Chaos was still inside his Berserk mode. His defenses were already drastically weakened.</p>
<p>The rest of Hundred Blossoms obviously wasn’t going to just sit there and watch. Cold Seasons had just gotten out of he water and went to rescue Blossoming Chaos, disregarding everything else. A boom sounded. Zhou Guangyi, who had been solely focused on rescuing, didn’t notice Dancing Rain’s cannon pointing at him. She predicted his movements and shot a missile towards him. Splash! Cold Seasons fell into the water again.</p>
<p>As for Bright Blossoms’s gunfire and Wind Carving’s summons, Happy completely ignored them.</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>The debuffs and buffs from the ghost boundaries, the Qi Master’s Pulse Break, the Cleric’s Holy Commandment, and Blossoming Chaos’s own Berserk piled on top of each other. Finally, Happy’s frenzy of attacks arrived.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos, Team Hundred Blossom’s core, the former number one Berserker that had become number one again after Yu Feng inherited it, was instantly killed.</p>
<p>Nothing could be worse for Hundred Blossoms than their core character meeting its end and in such a short instant too.</p>
<p>Blossoming Chaos was already gone from the shores of Broken River. For that instant kill, Happy had attacked with everything they had, leaving the ground full of scars.</p>
<p>“Attack!!!” Yu Feng was no longer there. Thus, as the vice-captain, Zou Yuan immediately took lead. He could see that even though Happy’s wave of attacks had killed Blossoming Chaos, they had messed up their rhythm to achieve it. Nearly all of them had used high-level skills and were in the middle of their ending animation. It was an opportunity for Hundred Blossoms to stage a counterattack.</p>
<p>After giving out the order, Bright Blossoms stepped forward.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang bang….</p>
<p>The noise wasn’t from gunfire, but the crisp sounds of ice colliding. Bright Blossoms, WInd Carving, and Arrogant Flower had frozen into ice, immovable blocks of ice.</p>
<p>There was only one skill that had 100% chance of instantly freezing the targets hit.</p>
<p>The Elementalist’s Ice Line!</p>
<p>A skill, which wasn’t in accordance with the present class compositions, had appeared. It had been cast without any of them knowing either. As a result, as soon as the three moved, they immediately went into contact with Ice Line and instantly became frozen.</p>
<p>Chapter 1160: The Rushing Broken River</p>
<p>The Elementalist’s skill Ice Line suddenly appeared at this moment.</p>
<p>Should this come as a surprise? The situation was too complicated to say for sure.</p>
<p>This was a situation with no Elementalist, yet an Elementalist’s skill had appeared, so of course it was a surprise. But this situation included the unspecialized Lord Grim, so perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising. But the unspecialized was only supposed to have access to low-level skills available before choosing a class, and Ice Line was not such a skill, so this was surprising. But Lord Grim had used Cloud Grasping Fist with his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella before, so everyone was aware that the unspecialized could access higher-level skills through his weapon.</p>
<p>Especially after the Cloud Grasping Fist, the unspecialized Lord Grim had already displayed countless high-level skills with the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, and now, he used an Elementalist’s Ice Line. This caused everyone to realize a frightening reality.</p>
<p>Ordinary weapons could only have one skill applied to them. But because the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella could change between a variety of different forms, each form could have a different skill applied to it according to the class. It was known that applying a skill to a weapon was not a complicated process. The materials and skillbooks required, compared to rare materials, weren’t too difficult to obtain. So the skills applied to the weapons held by professional accounts were changed regularly. Depending on the opponent, they would often choose a skill that they felt was the most useful to apply to their weapon and use it for the next battle.</p>
<p>One weapon, one type of change.</p>
<p>But the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella…</p>
<p>No one wanted to think about it anymore. It was a headache.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms couldn’t think about such long-term headaches right now, because they were the victims of this change right now. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella had the Ice Line skill? It hadn’t been mentioned in the match data they had studied beforehand. Even though this general possibility had been proposed, and in theory Hundred Blossoms had been prepared for it, it had really just been an idea tossed around. The idea meant that Lord Grim could use every single ability in Glory. 24 classes, hundreds of skills. Even if just talking about aerial skills, they all had their own characteristics and uses. Now that they were talking about every single skill in existence, there was absolutely no way to defend against that.</p>
<p>Even more devastating was the fact that Ye Xiu used his skills so stealthily. Hundred Blossoms had no idea when he had laid down this Ice Line. They discovered it when they triggered it, and by then there was no escape for them.</p>
<p>Lord Grim had access to higher level skills through his weapon. Because he could only add one level, the power wouldn’t be that strong. His Ice Line couldn’t last for long, but it was enough. Happy only needed to withdraw their attacks and adjust, how long would that take?</p>
<p>The fact that he would lay down this Ice Line meant that they were already prepared for the next stage of attack.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons once again scrambled onto the shore from the rapidly flowing river, and all he saw was wave after wave of devastating attack, flashing so much that he almost couldn’t look directly at his screen. His teammates had already been swallowed by these countless flashes, and he couldn’t even find their positions. All he could see were the health bars of his three teammates rapidly plummeting.</p>
<p>Under the overwhelming barrage of attacks, a Cleric simply had no way of casting. Healing skills that had no cast time could be used in emergencies to save the situation, but in an emergency like this where there was no way of escaping from the situation, a few instant casts wouldn’t help much.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was their last hope, and he himself was clear on this point. He didn’t shrink back, nor did he recklessly charge ahead. He controlled Cold Seasons to quickly follow the shoreline so he could get a better view of the situation. Finally, he saw the Happy trio that was blasting attacks at the Hundred Blossoms players.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain, Boundless Sea, One Inch Ash.</p>
<p>No time to hesitate, charge!</p>
<p>Cold Seasons flashed ahead, and Dancing Rain suddenly turned her cannon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The cannon blast flew toward him.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi, who had already been blasted into the river twice now, was now fiercely on the defensive. In the same instant that the cannon moved, he was already twisting aside to nimbly avoid it. Since he didn’t have the support of any teammates right now, he didn’t use Shining Cut, which was a skill that once used was hard to retract. It would be impossible to use this skill to directly break through the defense of so many enemies.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain’s cannon shot missed, but she swung out a Gatling Gun, and bullets began flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi activated Swift Movements, then used Swift Run, and Cold Seasons’ movement speed reached its peak. His dodging amidst the rain of bullets could truly be called elegant, a beautiful solo maneuver, and he finally arrived near the three players.</p>
<p>Cold Flash!</p>
<p>At this distance, Zhou Guangyi finally acted without hesitation. He was confident that no other skill was faster than him. One Inch Ash lifted his blade, the power of ghosts coalescing, as though to meet him with a Ghost Slash.</p>
<p>But, was he fast enough?</p>
<p>The cold light fell, and as expected, One Inch Ash’s Ghost Slash wasn’t fast enough. A string of blood droplets flew out in front of his chest, and he staggered backwards. Zhou Guangyi didn’t rush to kill him, since Boundless Sea was still blasting his teammates. His priority was to rescue his teammates, because by himself, he couldn’t take on all of these opponents. His use was to interrupt their rhythm.</p>
<p>Cold Seasons swiftly turned and came at Boundless Sea with a Heart-Piercing Stab. But his own body suddenly flew up. Zhou Guangyi turned his camera frantically only to see Lord Grim lifting high his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella in spear form, sending him flying with a Circle Swing.</p>
<p>Where in the world did this guy come from?</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s depression was incomparable.</p>
<p>He really wasn’t unfamiliar with Ye Xiu at all. Even though he wasn’t a player of that era, he had come from Tyranny. Which team could beat Tyranny at understanding Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>But Zhou Guangyi discovered that he truly had no way of predicting the Ye Xiu before him now, the Ye Xiu using Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Cold Seasons was sent rolling on the ground, but the effects of his sudden appearance and interruption were clear to see. From Su Mucheng to Qiao Yifan then to Ye Xiu, Happy needed three players to take action to control him. Any attacks toward Cold Seasons were attacks that didn’t go toward the trio from Hundred Blossoms, and Zou Yuan seized this opportunity to use one of the Spitfire’s high-level skills, Chaotic Thunder.</p>
<p>Aside from this official name, this skill had a nickname, Goddess Scattering Flowers. Bright Blossoms reached into the pockets at his hips, withdrawing countless grenades between his fingertips as though they were flower petals, and sent them flying with a shake of his wrists.</p>
<p>These grenades were varied and complicated. Some were ordinary ones that exploded upon impact, some were powerful bursts, some exploded after a set countdown, some released poisonous gas, and so on and so forth. In essence, it was all of the different types of Spitfire grenades combined into one attack, and now, they were all hurled toward Happy’s players.</p>
<p>Too many grenades were released at once to determine which type each of them were. Happy didn’t dare to just take the damage, since many Spitfire grenades had effects aside from just pure damage. Take the Burst Grenade, for example: although its damage wasn’t high, the impact was so powerful that even Super Armor couldn’t stop it. No matter what status someone was in, if hit by the Burst Grenade, their position would be instantly scattered.</p>
<p>The best defense was a good attack. Happy’s players all dodged in different directions, and the place where they had been standing was blasted apart. Fire, smoke, poison gas, powerful blasts, they were scattered all around.</p>
<p>Happy hadn’t dodged enough. Because Qiao Yifan’s One Inch Ash had been standing at the core, he was hit by the poison gas and became Poisoned, and his health began to drop by the second.</p>
<p>And Su Mucheng’s Dancing Rain, while using Aerial Gun to escape, was hit by the blast of a Burst Grenade, sending her even farther away.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms instantly seized this opportunity. Mo Chuchen’s Cleric found cover and hurriedly began casting Heals, Zhu Xiaoping’s Summoner quickly called several summons as support. Bright Blossoms, who had orchestrated this stunning reversal for Hundred Blossoms, was already reaching for more grenades, and he dominated the scene with all the atmosphere of a core player. But after quickly scanning his surroundings, he suddenly realized: Lord Grim, Boundless Sea, and also Cold Seasons, where did they go?</p>
<p>“Underwater!” Zhou Guangyi realized that his teammates might have lost him, and rushed to send this message in the team chat.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, he hadn’t expected that Fang Rui, while dodging, had still remembered him. Boundless Sea, with Qi Flowing Cloud activated, had brushed by, specially coming by to pat him. Zhou Guangyi had tried to dodge, but he hadn’t dodged enough, his shoulder was hit, and that one pat had turned out to be a powerful Qigong Blast. In an instant, Cold Seasons was sent into the air.</p>
<p>He had no tears left as he looked at the Broken River below him. Zhou Guangyi prepared to use Air Jump to return to shore, but Lord Grim suddenly appeared above him. With an Eagle Stamp and then a Falling Light Blade, Cold Seasons was directly shoved into the water again. And then Fang Rui, that guy, he had controlled Boundless Sea to enter the water as well! In that 2v1, Cold Seasons was miserably beaten up underwater.</p>
<p>When the Hundred Blossoms players saw the message, they all rushed to the riverside. But the river was rushing fiercely. The three were fighting underwater, but from the surface, nothing unusual could be seen.</p>
<p>“Where!” Zou Yuan sent to the chat, worried.</p>
<p>It was clear that Zhou Guangyi wouldn’t have reported his position if he weren’t in need of immediate support.</p>
<p>“Washed away” What a short message! There wasn’t even any punctuation.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and the others grew worried. If you were washed away by the Broken River all the way until the end, you’d be washed out of the map and directly eliminated. Zhou Guangyi’s desperate message showed that he was currently in a bad situation right now. Right now, they could see that Su Mucheng, Qiao Yifan, and An Wenyi’s characters were all here, but Ye Xiu and Fang Rui were still missing. Were they in the water fighting Zhou Guangyi?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and the others were in a dilemma! If they went to save Zhou Guangyi, it would be hard to get rid of the three in front of them. If they didn’t save him, there was nothing but disaster waiting for Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons. But as they struggled with their options, a silhouette flashed out of the stone forest, riding a broom. He directly flew to the surface of the river, and went under with a splash.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei!</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms’ sixth person, entered the battle from the stone forest. After seeing the message in the chat, he directly rushed to the riverside and entered the water. Finally, Zou Yuan and the others saw that they had support. Now, they could relax and deal with Happy’s three in front of them, and at the same time think about how they could regroup with the others.</p>
<p>With Zhang Wei, it would now be a 2v2… But Happy’s side had Ye Xiu and Fang Rui. Even though they didn’t want the opponent’s mere presence to smother their own spirits, they couldn’t help but feel uneasy. Better to quickly confirm their status to reassure themselves…</p>
<p>Chapter 1161: River’s End</p>
<p>The water in Broken River rushed rapidly. If a character stopped moving in the middle of the water, they would certainly be swept away. Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons was forced into the water by Lord Grim’s slash. His first priority at this moment was figuring out how to escape Ye Xiu and Fang Rui. Fighting against the water’s flow could come later.</p>
<p>Once they entered the water, Lord Grim and Boundless Sea hadn’t stopped attacking, and the two characters had taken control of all the advantageous positions.</p>
<p>What were the advantageous positions? In the midst of the rushing water, upstream positions were advantageous. Attacks that followed the flow wouldn’t be as impeded by the water, and these attacks would in fact travel faster than normal. With how swiftly the Broken River flowed, the effect of the additional speed was quite significant.</p>
<p>At first, Zhou Guangyi was worried about these two forcing him to the end of the river and out of the map, but a few moments later he realized he was overthinking. If the current situation continued, he would be a dead body long before he reached the river’s end.</p>
<p>Knowing that he was in a difficult situation, Zhou Guangyi finally sought help. Not long afterwards, he heard the splash of someone entering the water. His heart sped up, and he thought, this must be the backup arriving to help. And this splash had come from upstream, meaning that this person had seized a position advantageous to those of both Lord Grim and Boundless Sea. He could use the flow of the water as a buff to increase speed.</p>
<p>As expected of an experienced veteran like Zhang Wei, when he arrived at the riverside, he didn’t enter the water immediately. He had followed alongside it for a while, carefully studying until he confirmed everyone’s position. Only then did he choose the most favorable position to enter the water.</p>
<p>Once he came down, Zhang Wei’s Witch Endless Forest began attacking. With a Broom Tornado he twisted downstream, arriving right in front of the two and battering them. Ye Xiu and Fang Rui would have wanted to dodge to the side and let him sweep past, but if they dodged, they would be letting Cold Seasons go free.</p>
<p>But would Ye Xiu and Fang Rui be beaten up that easily?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim flashed to the side, making way for Endless Forest, but then he swept his sleeve, sending a Night Cloak toward Endless Forest and Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei himself was a Witch. If he were taken down by his own class’s skill, that would just be too embarrassing. He watched the attack coming, and Endless Forest waved his broom in a knocking motion.</p>
<p>In the air, a Witch could use their broom to jump six times. Now in the water, Broom Mastery also helped movement. With this knock, Endless Forest suddenly sank toward the bottom of the river, and the Night Cloak swept through empty water. Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons now had more space than Endless Forest. Borrowing the flow of the water to help his movements, he was also able to sink down and dodge this attack.</p>
<p>Endless Forest, who had sunk lower, now waved his broom again to propel himself upward toward Lord Grim. And Lord Grim waved his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, turning it into a spear and casually parrying his attack. To the side, Boundless Sea’s hands were moving, water rippling between them, and he suddenly thrust downward. The qi swirled in the water, its trajectory clear, and Endless Forest immediately swept his broom again to dodge.</p>
<p>Happy’s two players were toying with Endless Forest. It was now as though they had completely forgotten about Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was once again depressed.</p>
<p>When he had dodged downward earlier, he had also had some plan in mind. He thought that by sinking down, Happy’s two would follow him. Zhang Wei’s Endless Forest would only need to wait for a moment in the lower position before immediately being able to seize the upstream position.</p>
<p>But who would have thought? As soon as he swam aside, those two didn’t even look at him, instead starting to fight Endless Forest.</p>
<p>Cold Seasons had escaped. But Zhou Guangyi couldn’t just stand by and watch Zhang Wei be beaten down! His earlier little plan was too straightforward, in front of these two it was far from enough!</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons obediently came back to attack. But Ye Xiu and Fang Rui, in this short moment of 2v1, had managed to once again seize the upstream position. When Cold Seasons returned, he was downstream with Zhang Wei’s Endless Forest.</p>
<p>Their position was downstream, their situation was also downstream…</p>
<p>On the riverbank, Zou Yuan and the others were worried about Zhang Wei and Zhou Guangyi as they fought Happy. Wind Carving’s summons legion had taken up the task of blocking the opponents, but in the face of the long-range firepower of the Launcher, the typical summon was already essentially dead by the time it reached close-range. The Undead Knight was a little stronger, but because it was so slow and couldn’t coordinate with anything else to block the opponent, it could easily be avoided and wasn’t much use.</p>
<p>Watching his summons being summoned and then blasted to death, Zhu Xiaoping felt his heart hurt. The death of a summon didn’t hurt Wind Carving’s health, but every summon used up mana. So in every battle, every summon had to be carefully calculated so that it served a useful purpose. It was like how other classes had to use their mana-consuming skills carefully, to cause damage, or disrupt rhythm, or thwart a target. No matter what it was, it had to serve a purpose.</p>
<p>And now, although Wind Carving’s summons served the purpose of protecting them, they were used up rather too quickly. Zhu Xiaoping, judging from past battle experience, could tell that his usage pacing this match was a little too fast.</p>
<p>They couldn’t continue like this, or else he would run out of mana, and Wind Carving would become a useless person on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“You guys go first, I’ll cover you!” Thus, Zhu Xiaoping resolutely sent this to the team chat.</p>
<p>He had decided. He needed to spread out their formation and thoroughly tend to these three from Happy. He was a Summoner, so he could call forth many dear helpers; he should have this ability. To just avoid them and let his summons act as cannon fodder didn’t seem wise. Zhu Xiaoping even felt that, judging from Dancing Rain’s attack rhythm, the opponent was purposefully trying to waste all his summons.</p>
<p>“Alright!” Zou Yuan and Mo Chuchen didn’t doubt him. A Summoner had the ability to take on two or even three people at once, because he was never fighting by himself.</p>
<p>Directly facing against his opponents, Zhu Xiaoping could carefully control all of his summons, and they wouldn’t be defeated so easily by his opponents. He summoned an Undead Knight, who lifted his shield, and Wind Carving himself closely followed along behind. This time, he wouldn’t summon from afar. He wanted to directly control his summons, so under the protection of Undead Knight, he would approach closer to his opponents before calling forth a summons legion.</p>
<p>Of course, the Undead Knight moved rather slowly, and it would be easy enough for the opponent to maintain distance. But even if that happened, Zhu Xiaoping would complete his mission of obstruction. At most he would be sacrificing one Undead Knight, a far cheaper price than all the summons he had lost earlier one after the other.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Cannon fire exploded relentlessly upon the Undead Knight’s shield. Although the Undead Knight wobbled, his steps were still resolute. As Zhu Xiaoping predicted, the opponent wouldn’t split apart just to kite Undead Knight. They didn’t slow down as they ran forward. But this time, now that he himself was here, there was no way he was letting them go around him.</p>
<p>One Inch Ash waved his sword, and a ghostly aura flickered along the length of his blade.</p>
<p>Was he about to lay down a Ghost Boundary?</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping saw clearly and summoned a Phantom Cat not far from where One Inch Ash was. Under the protection of the Undead Knight, Zhu Xiaoping wasn’t afraid of being interrupted.</p>
<p>The summoned Phantom Cat immediately rushed toward One Inch Ash. Whether he was hit by an attack or tried to dodge, the casting of the Ghost Boundary would be interrupted. Dancing Rain went to attack the Phantom Cat, meaning that the attacks on this side lightened, and they could rush forward with their momentum.</p>
<p>Controlling the summons truly made a difference!</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping was extremely satisfied with his condition. He really felt pretty good today! How was he defeated by a rookie in the group arena? He didn’t understand… Or maybe, today was that pretty girl’s lucky day! Even Yu Feng had lost in a direct fight against her. Now that he thought about it, that pretty girl was Happy’s sixth player right now. What would happen if she came out to battle?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping felt that he had good control over the situation. Things were progressing as expected, and he even had the time to ponder other things. Phantom Cat’s fast harassment prevented One Inch Ash from laying down a Ghost Boundary. This sort of fast and small close-range attacker wasn’t an easy opponent for the Launcher and Ghostblade classes. Zhu Xiaoping seized the chance and controlled Wind Carving to summon more creatures, quickly creating an army. He didn’t bother with Demon Flowers or other summons that weren’t nimble. These summons would be limited in their usefulness in front of a Launcher and Ghostblade.</p>
<p>Right. Launcher and Ghostblade.</p>
<p>…Huh? Launcher and Ghostblade?</p>
<p>Where’d the other person go? Where was Happy’s Cleric?</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping suddenly discovered that Happy’s Cleric Little Cold Hands was nowhere to be found. Wind Carving was hidden behind the Undead Knight this whole time, so even though he paid close attention to the situation at hand, his vision was limited. It wasn’t until now that his army was formed that Wind Carving majestically walked forward, only to discover that one of his opponents was missing.</p>
<p>“The opponent’s Cleric escaped!” Zhu Xiaoping immediately warned the others in the team chat.</p>
<p>“Escaped” was really giving himself a lot of credit. In reality, he was just trying to cause a disruption, not trap them entirely.</p>
<p>Attack!</p>
<p>As Zhu Xiaoping directed his summons forward, he studied his surroundings, trying to find Little Cold Hands. And then, he found an entrance to the stone forest nearby. Had Little Cold Hands entered there?</p>
<p>If he entered there… Zhu Xiaoping’s mind spun. This was a map that everyone knew, and as a pro player, he could clearly visualize it in his mind.</p>
<p>If he entered there…</p>
<p>He would pass the spawn point!</p>
<p>The spawn point, or in other words, the support zone. In Happy’s limited match data, they had used this strategy before, letting their healer exit the battle, replacing him with an attacker.</p>
<p>And the attacker that Happy could use as replacement was someone that no one, certainly not Hundred Blossoms, would dare underestimate anymore.</p>
<p>All this flashed through Zhu Xiaoping’s mind, and he frantically sent another message. “Healer went to player exchange area, Soft Mist might enter battle!”</p>
<p>“Soft Mist entering battle? Right now? To do what?” Seeing Zhu Xiaoping’s message, the Hundred Blossoms players weren’t as alarmed as he was. They even sent this message to the public chat as mockery.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and Mo Chuchen had finally arrived, easily helping Zhang Wei and Zhou Guangyi to escape their predicament. Now that they had turned the situation around, they were prepared to bully Happy.</p>
<p>“To come fight, of course,” Ye Xiu replied in the chat. “What use is a healer here?”</p>
<p>Behind Lord Grim, the riverbanks were blocked by insurmountable walls, and the Broken River became a waterfall plunging downward. Looking through this gap, one could see a beautiful expanse of scenery. But it was no use, for right here was the end of this world…</p>
<p>Chapter 1162: Specious Memories</p>
<p>The expressions on the Hundred Blossoms players became strained at Ye Xiu’s words. Their characters in the game couldn’t show this though. Their four characters stood in a very standard offensive formation. Zhang Wei’s Witch Endless Forest and Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin Cold Seasons stood at the front. Zou Yuan’s Spitfire Bright Blossoms was positioned behind them in the middle. Mo Chuchen’s Cleric Arrogant Flowers was to the right of Bright Blossoms.</p>
<p>They seemed to just be standing where they pleased, but in reality, the distance between each team member, the view that each team member had of the field, and the vigilance towards their opponents were all strategically arranged. The possible variations and tactical thinking inside this formation couldn’t be explained in just a few words.</p>
<p>But after hearing Ye Xiu’s words, the four players couldn’t help but make a few adjustments.</p>
<p>Their previous formation had been a practiced one that they had instinctively arranged themselves in after seeing Lord Grim’s and Boundless Sea’s positions. However, they suddenly realized that the end of Broken River, the edge of this map, was an instant death spot that needed careful consideration before entering.</p>
<p>There used to be all sorts of strategies on how to play around the end of Broken River. However, this map had been played on so many times, and it had been so long since this map had been chosen in competitive play. What team specifically practiced for these strategies nowadays? Perhaps they might have some memory of the strategies involved, but their teammates back then definitely weren’t the same today. Different classes meant different ways of coordination. If they tried to play from what they remembered, it was possible that it would conflict with their current team structure.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the Hundred Blossoms players suddenly realized how terrifying it was for Happy to choose this map.</p>
<p>For familiar maps, coordination and whatnot could be accomplished without much thought.</p>
<p>However, unfamiliar maps required more carefulness and observation to minimize mistakes.</p>
<p>As for Broken River, this map had once been a familiar one, but was now an abandoned one. Everyone had seemingly correct but actually incorrect memories. Were these memories accurate? When victory or defeat depended on these memories, the Hundred Blossoms players were hesitant. Doubt started to wel up within them. They were afraid that those fuzzy memories might lead to a fatal mistake.</p>
<p>The Hundred Blossoms players hesitated, and at the same time, they now understood why Happy had chosen this map.</p>
<p>These situations depended on their resolve. And judging from the current situation, they clearly weren’t resolute enough. After Ye Xiu spoke those words, Hundred Blossoms kept on adjusting their positions. They were clearly having trouble parsing through their memories.</p>
<p>“At that time, our team still had Sun Zheping and Zhang Jiale!” The old general Zhang Wei recalled Hundred Blossoms’ golden age and the scenes of their battles at Broken River.</p>
<p>“At that time, battling alongside our captain was truly fun…” Zhou Guangyi recalled his time with Tyranny and his days fighting with Han Wenqing’s Desert Dust.</p>
<p>At that time… Zou Yuan didn’t have an at that time. He had joined the league in Season 7. By then, this map had already fallen out of use. He really didn’t have any competitive experience with Broken River.</p>
<p>As for Mo Chuchen? Mo Chuchen was also nervous because of Ye Xiu’s words. At this spot, if the opponent pushed them off the waterfall, they would instantly die. What would be the point of healing? How was he supposed to help his team?</p>
<p>The Hundred Blossoms players each had their own thoughts. For a moment, their positioning became even more disorderly.</p>
<p>How could Ye Xiu or Fang Rui miss this opportunity?</p>
<p>Sky-Piercing Strike!</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea leaped up and a powerful wave of qi shot out through his hands towards Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>The Hundred Blossoms players clearly reacted slowly to this sudden attack. Anyone could see that their priority was distancing themselves from the waterfall.</p>
<p>They only dodged. None of them thought of counterattacking. After Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea shot out a Sky-Piercing Strike, he didn’t receive any interference, so he swiped his two hands and slashed out a Qi Blade.</p>
<p>This Qi Blade was formed from the Qi Master’s breath, so it was without form or light. The only trace of it was the stream of air left behind when it sliced through the air. It was a very concealed flying weapon type skill. Even if the opponent noticed the attack, because of its immaterial form, it was difficult to judge the distance, making defending and dodging more difficult to time. The only way to dodge was to dodge as soon as you noticed it. Safety first.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan saw Boundless Sea swipe his two hands against each other, forming a ripple in the air. He knew it was a Qi Blade, so he immediately had Bright Blossoms dodge to the side. But to his surprise, the trajectory of this ripple wasn’t a straight line, but a cunning arc that deviated from Zou Yuan’s prediction. In the end, the Qi Blade struck Arrogant Flowers, Team Hundred Blossoms’ Cleric.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu just said that healing in this battle was pointless, yet Fang Rui’s attack had been aimed at Hundred Blossoms’ healer.</p>
<p>Mo Chuchen was completely caught off guard. The Qi Blade connected squarely with Arrogant Flowers. There was no eye-catching explosion or spurt of blood, but the damage dealt was no worse than those flashy attacks. Plus, it had quite a strong knockback. After taking this hit, Arrogant Flowers immediately stumbled.</p>
<p>As Boundless Sea fell from the skies, he stretched out his hand towards Arrogant Flower and grabbed.</p>
<p>But then a flash of light swept over. Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin promptly attacked from the side to cut off Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>“Lord Grim!!”</p>
<p>The old general Zhang Wei had experienced hundreds of battles. No matter how ferociously Boundless Sea attacked, he would never fail to pay attention to Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim. While everyone was focusing on Boundless Sea, Zhang Wei saw Lord Grim lift his two hands and get into a certain position. Wasn’t that the Qi Master’s Cloud Grasping Fist?</p>
<p>He hastily warned everyone in his channel. Zou Yuan reacted the fastest. Before even understanding what the situation was, Bright Blossoms turned and started firing at Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu had no choice but to cancel his sneak attack and dodge.</p>
<p>“Come this way!!” The rescued Mo Chuchen directed his Arrogant Flowers to the stone forest to the side. His thought process was quite simple. Since fighting at the end of Broken River was so confusing, why not just fight further away from it.</p>
<p>“Go.” Vice-captain Zou Yuan approved of Mo Chuchen’s thinking and ordered the team to shift over there. In truth, Zou Yuan didn’t like these sorts of special terrain, but he could see the hesitation from his teammates towards their current battlefield.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms had the numbers advantage, 4 to 2, yet they did not confront the other side directly and took the initiative to shift the battlefield away. Arrogant Flowers ran the fastest. The other three also moved towards this direction. Seeing the waterfall leave their sight, their hearts just started to steady when a boom suddenly came from ahead of them. Arrogant Flowers, who had just run into the stone forest excitedly, was directly thrown out.</p>
<p>Soft Mist burst out with a Dragon Breaks the Ranks. Arrogant Flowers had been sent flying by this attack already, but that didn’t seem to stop the dragon’s momentum.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and the two others hastily dodged. Ye Xiu and Fang Rui saw this and immediately became spirited.</p>
<p>“Grab one over!!!” Ye Xiu yelled.</p>
<p>“Okay, which one?” Fang Rui replied.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms’ four players were greatly alarmed. They thought Cloud Grasping Fist was about to come at them again, so they kept rolling on the ground refusing to get up. But after looking towards that side, they knew that they had been duped. Lord Grim and Boundless Sea were running rapidly towards them, and Cloud Grasping Fist was not a skill that could be used while moving.</p>
<p>Their target was still Team Hundred Blossoms’ Cleric, Arrogant Flowers. Lord Grim, Boundless Sea, and Soft Mist had quickly formed a triangle with Arrogant Flowers in the middle.</p>
<p>Counting on a Cleric to break out of an encirclement alone was unfair. Hundred Blossoms’ other three players immediately tried to rescue him. Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms shot a Flash Bullet. However, Happy’s three players responded by rushing towards the middle. Lord Grim’s Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened up with a whoosh. The Flash Bullet knocked against the umbrella and exploded. However, the three behind the umbrella were unaffected by it and continued to pummel Arrogant Flowers.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan wanted to cry, but no tears came out. If he had known they would do that, he would have thrown a Burst Grenade…</p>
<p>There were no ifs, but it wasn’t too late now. Zou Yuan threw a Burst Grenade.</p>
<p>“DON’T!!” Zhang Wei shouted, but he was too late.</p>
<p>The Burst Grenade exploded on the umbrella’s canopy. The powerful shockwave sent Happy’s three characters flying, but… where was Arrogant Flowers. Teammates were exempt from allied skills, so he should still be there!</p>
<p>“Thanks!” Lord Grim expressed his thanks. Zou Yuan composed himself and then took another look. He had located Arrogant Flowers; he was in Lord Grim’s hands.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan’s view had been blocked by the umbrella, so he didn’t know the situation. However, Zhang Wei, who was at a different angle, could see things. When Zou Yuan threw a Burst Grenade, Lord Grim just happened to grab Arrogant Flowers.</p>
<p>Fling!</p>
<p>Grabs had the highest priority out of any skill. Even the shockwave from Burst Grenade failed to interrupt Lord Grim’s grab, leading to Arrogant Flowers being pushed out along with Lord Grim.</p>
<p>And Burst Grenade did nothing but send people flying away. The airborne Lord Grim was free to move around. As a result, he continued his combo with a Fling, throwing Arrogant Flower away. Where to? Towards the waterfall of course…</p>
<p>“Ah!” Zou Yuan cried out, but unfortunately, no one could hear him. None of the other three Hundred Blossom players were able to intercept him in time.</p>
<p>“Don’t panic! Figure out the direction of the flow and swim back!” At the crucial moment, it was the still the old general Zhang Wei who was the calmest. He deduced that at Lord Grim’s height, it was not possible for him to directly throw Arrogant Flowers outside of the waterfall. Arrogant Flower would fall into the water, but as long as he figured out the direction of the flow fast enough, he wouldn’t be pulled down the waterfall. However, he needed to be fast because it had to be done in an instant.</p>
<p>Calm down!</p>
<p>Mo Chuchen nervously reminded himself. He could see the surface of the river and the scenery outside the map, which looked quite beautiful.</p>
<p>I can’t go there!</p>
<p>Mo Chuchen encouraged himself, boosting his confidence. He was ready to drop into the water.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>What was that? That wasn’t the sound of a splash? Where am I?</p>
<p>His screen violently shook. By the time Mo Chuchen finished adjusting himself, he realized that the Broken River was far away. Arrogant Flower was already heading down towards that beautiful world on the other side…</p>
<p>Chapter 1163: Get Out!</p>
<p>How could this be?</p>
<p>Mo Chuchen still didn’t understand, but Arrogant Flowers’ name was already gray in the team list.</p>
<p>“Nice snipe.”</p>
<p>Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea said in the public chat.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay rusty forever :)” Ye Xiu replied with a smiley face.</p>
<p>Just before Arrogant Flowers would have fallen into the water, Mo Chuchen had been prepared to swim against the current. At that moment, a bullet fired from the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, sniping Arrogant Flowers and sending him off the map to his death.</p>
<p>What was the point of a healer here?</p>
<p>Ye Xiu’s words hadn’t disappeared yet and could still be seen in the public chat! Yet in the blink of an eye, the player he killed happened to be this “useless” healer.</p>
<p>Perhaps a healer was useless here, but what about elsewhere? The healer’s value would be very high. However, Hundred Blossoms no longer had the chance to experience the value of having a healer.</p>
<p>Right now, Hundred Blossoms hadn’t dealt any major damage to the enemy team nor were they in an advantageous position, yet they had already lost their core player and their important healer. Hundred Blossoms’ current situation was extremely bad. In a normal match, teams in this situation might just directly call GG and forfeit the match.</p>
<p>However, Hundred Blossoms didn’t want to forfeit.</p>
<p>They had already lost quite terribly in the individual competition and the group arena. Right now, they only had a single point. Typing “GG” and losing would be disastrous.</p>
<p>If the enemy team can use this instant kill zone, so can we!</p>
<p>We have no healer, but the enemy team doesn’t either!</p>
<p>In terms of numbers, both sides each have three players. Neither side has the advantage!</p>
<p>Zou Yuan, Zhou Guangyi, Zhang Wei. The three Hundred Blossoms players would no longer retreat. Without a healer, playing tug of war with Happy was not wise. Right now, they needed this instant kill zone more than Happy. They needed to instantly kill these Happy characters to come back from this terrible situation.</p>
<p>“Attack!</p>
<p>Zou Yuan ordered in the team chat. The three Hundred Blossom players sprinted forward.</p>
<p>The Burst Grenade explosion, Lord Grim grabbing, flinging, sniping Arrogant Flowers off the map had all happened in an instant. The three Hundred Blossoms players also instantly examined the situation and made a clear decision. While the three Happy players were still steadying themselves, they immediately pounced on them and attacked. Their target was the character closest to the waterfall, Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Broom Tornado!</p>
<p>Zhang Wei liked to use this Witch skill. This time, Endless Forest flew into the air. As his broom spun, he shot towards Lord Grim like a tornado.</p>
<p>Below, Zhou Guangyi’s Assassin was using Shining Cut to move. However, this time, he wasn’t using it to attack, but to coordinate with Zhang Wei and restrict Lord Grim’s movement options. Along with Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms firing non-stop, they forced Lord Grim towards the waterfall.</p>
<p>“You guys learn fast!”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu still had time to type a few words. It seemed like he wasn’t worried about his current situation. And just like this, Lord Grim confidently ran towards the waterfall as if to satisfy Hundred Blossoms’ desires.</p>
<p>If only we had a Burst Grenade right now!</p>
<p>Zou Yuan looked at Burst Grenade’s cooldown and felt annoyed. If he had a Burst Grenade, the shockwave would be more than enough to send Lord Grim off the stage. How convenient would that be?</p>
<p>But right now?</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan quickly thought about this question and realized that it wasn’t easy for the three to do something. While Lord Grim could just grab Arrogant Flowers and throw him, the three of them didn’t have that type of skill.</p>
<p>This situation gave Zou Yuan a greater understanding of why Happy chose Broken River. It seemed like a map that everyone knew, but in reality, because of each team’s class composition, it was unfavorable for Hundred Blossoms. In addition, Team Hundred Blossoms only had fuzzy memories of how to play on this map. The impact of this fuzziness could now be deeply felt.</p>
<p>This was a map that fully utilized Happy’s home field advantage!</p>
<p>After seeing Lord Grim confidently retreat towards the waterfall on his own accord, Zou Yuan smelled a a scheme. Happy had come to this map prepared. They had definitely practiced tactics revolving around this special terrain.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan watched Lord Grim’s movements closely, while constantly taking note of Boundless Sea and Soft Mist.</p>
<p>Those two were on their way back after being blown away by Burst Grenade.</p>
<p>What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Zou Yuan truly didn’t have any idea. Truthfully, he didn’t have any experience with this map.</p>
<p>“Careful.” Zou Yuan could only remind his two teammates.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei wasn’t a particularly talented player. However, having been a pro player for so long, he was well-practiced. In this instant, he also felt like there was some deeper meaning behind Lord Grim’s calm retreat. He pondering over what it could be, when he saw Zou Yuan’s warning in the chat.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei was greatly alarmed. Had something happened already?</p>
<p>He looked around in a panic and swept over the three Happy characters one by one, but he didn’t discover anything unusual. He woke up immediately afterwards. The warning had been because Zou Yuan felt like there was something fishy about Lord Grim.</p>
<p>A communication error between teammates wasn’t good. Zhang Wei realized that his condition was off. However, he was powerless to fix it. Without having a clear understanding of why they were at a disadvantage, they couldn’t help but hesitate.</p>
<p>In any case, we have to try!</p>
<p>In the end, Zhang Wei made his decision. They were already at a disadvantage. In this sort of situation, if they didn’t struggle and gamble, how could they win?</p>
<p>“Forward!” Zhang Wei feared that the other two would fail to coordinate properly because of the hesitation in their hearts, so he let everyone know before acting.</p>
<p>“Forward!” Zou Yuan knew that they could not drag this on. After replying to Zhang Wei, his Bright Blossoms threw a grenade.</p>
<p>Seeker Grenade!</p>
<p>This grenade came with its own propeller like a mini-helicopter. After it flew out, it locked onto Lord Grim and flew towards him.</p>
<p>Boom!!</p>
<p>Lord Grim held up his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella and shot down this Seeker Grenade in mid-air.</p>
<p>But this was just the start of Bright Blossom’s assault. Another two grenades were thrown, normal ones that could also be used by an unspecialized. Lord Grim jumped backwards to dodge them, but another grenade followed closely behind. Lord Grim once again opened up his umbrella and also wanted to shoot down this grenade. To his surprise, that grenade had yet to reach him, when it suddenly exploded.</p>
<p>Timed Grenade!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu immediately recognized it as a time grenade. To put it simply, it was a time bomb. The timer could be set as long as 8 seconds, but the one Bright Blossoms threw was at most set to 2 seconds. Zou Yuan linked it together with his other grenade and had it explode before Lord Grim could respond.</p>
<p>But at such a distance, let alone damage, Lord Grim wasn’t even affected by the shockwave from the explosion. However, the smoke produced from the explosion temporarily blocked his sight.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu immediately had Lord Grim roll. Sure enough, a Magic Ray pierced through the smoke, but it missed because Lord Grim had preemptively dodged it.</p>
<p>“This old fox…” Zhang Wei was helpless. He was already one of the oldest players in the Alliance, but his opponent was even more senior than him. There was probably nothing Ye Xiu had never seen before. It just depended on whether he could react in time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their coordinated attack wasn’t effective. Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons had originally been lying in wait for an opening, but Ye Xiu wasn’t their only opponent. Fang Rui and Tang Rou promptly joined the battle. Cold Seasons wasn’t able to act in time before the two interfered.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi could defend against Tang Rou’s Soft Mist wild frontal assault, but the problem was that the cunning Fang Rui was lying on the sidelines. It was truly unbearable.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and Zhang Wei saw this situation and knew that it would be bad if they didn’t help. Zhang Wei’s Endless Forest threw a Lava Flask over to that side. Zou Yuan had Bright Blossoms turn around and fire a few bullets, but most of his attention was still on Lord Grim.</p>
<p>He’s coming!</p>
<p>Seeing Lord Grim stop retreating towards the waterfall and instead charge at them, Zou Yuan didn’t panic and started eagerly looking forward to it. Bright Blossoms held a tiny remote control in his left hand. Previously, he had thrown not three but four grenades. A Remote Control Grenade was three units away from Lord Grim right now. One step, two steps…</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Remote Control Grenade exploded. The shockwave sent Lord Grim flying back. Zou Yuan felt a surge of excitement in his heart. Zhang Wei also noticed it and knew that this was a rare opportunity. In this instant, he and Zou Yuan displayed a high-level of tacit understanding. Zou Yuan’s Bright Blossoms turned towards Soft Mist and Boundless Sea, helping Cold Seasons ward them off. Zhang Wei’s Endless Forest, on the other hand, rode on his broom and chased after Lord Grim.</p>
<p>The Remote Control Grenade’s power wasn’t that high. The knockback wasn’t enough to knock Lord Grim off the waterfall. What’s more, Lord Grim could use skills to prevent that.</p>
<p>Broom Tornado!</p>
<p>Endless Forest flew into the air and immediately came down like a tornado. He aimed precisely. At this angle, he could send Lord Grim towards the very edge of the map while retreating with a jump backwards.</p>
<p>“It’s been so many years and you’re still doing the same trick!”</p>
<p>A message from Ye Xiu popped into the chat. Zhang Wei suddenly felt that the situation wasn’t good. However, the Broom Tornado had already been activated. Lord Grim’s umbrella was faster though…</p>
<p>Circle Swing!</p>
<p>Endless Forest was knocked into the air. His Broom Tornado had been broken, and Zhang Wei was helpless. This was the difference between them. He was just an experienced veteran, but Ye Xiu? He was one of the players who stood at the top of Glory. If Broom Tornado was done correctly, it could completely avoid this type of interrupt. Over Zhang Wei’s professional career, he had always favored this skill, but in the end, it was still blocked by Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>The umbrella drew a circle in the air. The one thrown out of the map wasn’t Lord Grim but Endless Forest. However, Endless Forest was a Witch. With the skill Broom Mastery, he had plenty of room to maneuver. This was why Zhang Wei, although feeling helpless, was not yet panicked. But who would have thought, when the Circle Swing finished, Endless Sea hadn’t even had the chance to move yet before the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella retracted and shifted from spear to gun form.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>Three Anti-Tank Missiles exploded onto Endless Forest, pushing him far out. And then, the shockwaves from the explosions pushed him even farther along.</p>
<p>“FUCK!” Seeing the distance between the inside of the map and his position outside of the map, Zhang Wei lost all hope. Witches could somewhat fly in the air, but it was impossible at this distance!</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms’ Witch, Endless Forest, killed!</p>
<p>Chapter 1164: The Strongest New Team in History</p>
<p>They had waited with high hopes for the chance to push Lord Grim off the map, but all that happened was that their own side lost another powerful general. Zou Yuan and Zhou Guangyi were agonized. It wasn’t even one defeat, it was a combo. Just after Endless Forest’s icon grayed out, Zhu Xiaoping’s Summoner Wind Carving fell as well.</p>
<p>For one person to last this long against Su Mucheng and Qiao Yifan was quite a feat; Zhu Xiaoping already proved himself a worthy Summoner. But he didn’t have the ability to both stall and defeat two players at once. In all of Glory’s history, there had never been such a powerful Summoner before.</p>
<p>In the team competition, Happy’s roster was still whole and perfect, while Hundred Blossoms had already lost four players.</p>
<p>At this moment, Zou Yuan and Zhou Guangyi stopped moving. Under these conditions, was there any point in continuing fighting? They lost this match, completely and thoroughly. 1 to 9 wasn’t a total sweep, but it wasn’t far off, either.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan and Zhou Guangyi didn’t say anything to each other. They just stopped at the same time, and it was clear that they were in agreement.</p>
<p>“GG”</p>
<p>“GG”</p>
<p>Each player sent a “GG,” and then Bright Blossoms and Cold Seasons withdrew from the battle. Happy officially won the battle. The roar of the crowd was like thunder – this was a huge victory, 9 to 1!</p>
<p>Happy’s team competition players walked out of the player booths together to greet the audience, and the stadium reached a new high of excitement.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms’ players walked out as well. As the losers, it was best for them if they left this stage quickly, but they still had to follow some customs. Hundred Blossoms politely acknowledged the applause they received from the crowd, and with the spirit of “friendship first, competition second,” they spoke to their opponents.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, you played well.” Yu Feng took the initiative to congratulate Happy’s players, displaying Hundred Blossom’s grace.</p>
<p>“Haha, continue to work hard,” Ye Xiu said casually as he shook hands with Yu Feng. After hearing this, Yu Feng was a bit depressed. What do you mean, “continue to work hard”? That made it sound like Hundred Blossoms’ only goal was to surpass Happy.</p>
<p>“Haha, you too.” Yu Feng forced a chuckle, then led Hundred Blossoms offstage. They met up with the rest of their teammates, and immediately left through the player tunnel. It was the winner’s stage, let the winner enjoy it!</p>
<p>The Alliance mandated that pro players must attend the post-match press conference of every match. To the losers of the match, this was another torture to endure. Reporters were merciless, always rubbing salt into their wounds. Hundred Blossoms knew that this conference would be particularly excruciating, so aside from their captain and vice captain, they sent out their veteran player, Zhang Wei.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that Hundred Blossoms lost this match. Could you talk about some of your thoughts?” The opening question was rather ordinary.</p>
<p>“Our team members all worked hard, but unfortunately the opponent played better.” Hundred Blossoms Captain Yu Feng also gave a very standard answer.</p>
<p>“Did you at all predict that you would be crushed by Happy like this? Please forgive my usage of the word “crushed,” but judging from the final point score, the match was incredibly one-sided.” A harsh question followed, deliberately attacking the Hundred Blossoms players.</p>
<p>“This outcome was unexpected for everyone, and I admit that we never thought this could have happened. But I don’t believe that Hundred Blossoms was crushed. We won one point in the individual round, and we had the upper-hand for part of the group arena. As for the team round, maps like Broken River that have instant-kill points will often lead to a result that seems very skewed. The points are only the result, but looking at the process, I truly cannot see where Hundred Blossoms was crushed.” Yu Feng didn’t reveal any anger, but he replied sharply to this question.</p>
<p>“Captain Yu, what do you think about Team Happy’s Tang Rou?” Immediately, another reporter asked a pointed question to counterattack. Tang Rou certainly wasn’t a name that Yu Feng would be happy to hear right now. It was another knife to the wound.</p>
<p>“She’s very skilled,” Yu Feng replied. “She will become an outstanding pro player.”</p>
<p>“Could you be more specific? For example, outstanding in what way?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>“To win a 1v2 in the group arena and help the team earn the overall victory, isn’t that enough to show her outstandingness?” Yu Feng clearly saw the reporter’s purpose in asking about Tang Rou. He had lost to a rookie, which was truly shameful, but he wouldn’t try to hide. He had the courage to face any challenge directly because he was the captain and core of Hundred Blossoms. He had to be able to shoulder any difficulties that Hundred Blossoms had.</p>
<p>“Then what about Hundred Blossoms’ Zeng Xinran? This was his first time playing in this season, but both the result and the process were unsatisfactory.” For comparison, another reporter brought up the rookie on Hundred Blossoms’ side, Zeng Xinran. In the entire match, aside from Mo Fan, who had committed a foul and was disqualified from the game, Zeng Xinran’s performance was the most abysmal. This was the incontestable truth.</p>
<p>“It was his first official match ever, so he was inevitably nervous. It takes a while to get used to the professional scene, but he will be able to display his ability,” said Yu Feng.</p>
<p>After that, there were more questions targeting specific details about the match. The good thing was that Hundred Blossoms was prepared for this, and the players they sent out for this conference were all experienced in this area. Finally, they made it through the questioning.</p>
<p>“I’d like to ask the three Hundred Blossoms players, after this match, could you talk about your opinion of Team Happy?” At the very end of the press conference, Chang Xian from the City H branch of Esports Home had the opportunity to ask the final question.</p>
<p>“For this question, I don’t think we each need to say our own opinions. Our view of Happy is unanimous.” From Hundred Blossoms, Zhang Wei was the one to answer. “Regarding their roster, they have three All-Star players – I don’t think I need to say any more about that. Regarding their characters, aside from their two All-Star characters, the Silver equipment on their other characters is enough to make an opponent hesitate. During the transition stage after the game update, level 75 Orange equipment narrowed the gap between the smaller teams and the powerhouses. We were stuck for too long at level 70, so we need to take another look at the so-called gap between all of the teams. With this situation, combined with Happy’s status, I think it’s safe to say that Happy is the strongest new team in the history of the Alliance!”</p>
<p>Zhang Wei’s answer brought forth even more questions that the reporters wanted to ask, but after answering this final question, Hundred Blossoms’ three players ignored the reporters’ shouted questions and abruptly left the press conference. Afterwards, it was Happy’s turn to come out: Ye Xiu, Fang Rui, and of course the shining star of this match, Tang Rou.</p>
<p>The press conference opened with the typical congratulations and question about their thoughts on this match.</p>
<p>“Hundred Blossoms also worked hard, but we played better.” Ye Xiu’s answer was essentially the exact same as Yu Feng’s, just switching around the pronouns. The reporters didn’t care much; no one really hoped to gain anything out of this question. In post-match press conferences, this question was essentially a “hello.”</p>
<p>After the greetings, the reporters immediately went to Tang Rou. The team battle hadn’t at all distracted from her astonishing 1v2 performance in the group arena.</p>
<p>“An exciting victory, a grand reversal!” The reporters gave their praises without restraint. “What are your thoughts on this thrilling performance? How would you judge your own performance?”</p>
<p>“I hope that I can still do better,” Tang Rou said, smiling.</p>
<p>“Still… do better? Are you referring… to a 1v3?” The reporters were in shock.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Tang Rou continued to smile.</p>
<p>The reporters’ feelings were mixed. Some approved of Tang Rou’s courage and confidence, while others immediately turned against her. After managing a 1v2, this rookie knew no modesty and immediately entertained delusions of a 1v3? This was just too arrogant! With these thoughts, these reporters took another look at Tang Rou onstage and felt that she was just like those typical self-righteous pretty girls that often showed up in novels and television.</p>
<p>This was the Glory competitive scene. Being pretty wasn’t worth anything. Many of the gazes on Tang Rou were now hostile and disdainful, even those who had previously chased Tang Rou with their praise.</p>
<p>“God Fang Rui also performed very well today, could you talk to us about it?” a reporter asked.</p>
<p>“It was just so-so,” said Fang Rui. “A little worse than I had expected.”</p>
<p>“What were you expecting?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“To sweep the group arena?” Fang Rui said, but he didn’t wait for the hostile glares before immediately adding, “Haha, I’m just kidding. I did want to take some more of Yu Feng’s health in the second round of the group arena, but sadly I couldn’t pull it off.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then regarding the second player to come out in the group arena, Mo Fan, what do you think about his performance? Was he too nervous about his first time playing onstage?” a reporter asked.</p>
<p>“That was entirely Ye Xiu’s fault!” Fang Rui’s face immediately twisted in grief and indignation.</p>
<p>“Ah? What do you mean?” Everyone was suddenly interested, and they all looked at Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“It was my fault,” Ye Xiu said, also wearing a bitter expression. “I didn’t clearly explain to him the competition rules.”</p>
<p>“Clearly explain? You didn’t explain at all!” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“I saw that he was looking at them himself!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What use is looking at them himself! Are the rules that easy to digest? You need to properly teach him how to exploit the loopholes in the rules.”</p>
<p>“You shut your mouth, is exploiting loopholes and whatnot something that a respectable pro player should do?”</p>
<p>“But there will always be a few sneaky players that do this. To defeat their sneaky tricks, you first have to understand how they’ll be sneaky!” said Fang Rui.</p>
<p>After hearing this, the reporters instantly became excited, all turning toward Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“By ‘sneaky players,’ who are you referring to?” the reporters asked.</p>
<p>“That was just an example, a general reference,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>The reporters were disappointed, but they still felt that Fang Rui was targeting someone specific. Quite a few people were already racking their brains for a player that Fang Rui didn’t get along with. Meanwhile, others continued to seize this time to ask questions.</p>
<p>“In today’s team competition, we saw that once again, Happy’s healer didn’t serve any big purpose. Is this because his skill level still isn’t at the professional level, so Happy has to rely on these strategies that don’t rely on a healer?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“That’s nonsense,” said Ye Xiu. “He didn’t serve any purpose? How was Blossoming Chaos taken down in one wave? If we were missing a single person, we couldn’t have pulled it off.”</p>
<p>“Zhang Wei of Hundred Blossoms named you the strongest new team in history. What do you think about that?”</p>
<p>“He praises us too highly. Zhang Wei is truly too honest,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1165: Damage Leaderboard</p>
<p>Xiaoshan Stadium.</p>
<p>With Excellent Era’s liquidation, their lease contract was terminated early and this stadium recovered its old name. But to the workers of this stadium, it was as though nothing changed. After a year, the stadium once again was hosting Glory Pro League, and the work they had to do was the same.</p>
<p>“Pardon, Miss, we need to clear the stadium.” A worker quickly walked up to an audience member who was standing just below the stage.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m just about to leave.” Chen Guo immediately apologized to the worker, and prepared to leave. But after taking a few steps, she couldN’T help but turn back and look again.</p>
<p>The audience seating, the player prep room, the competition stage…</p>
<p>It had already been two hours since the end of the match, but as she looked at all of this, Chen Guo could clearly picture the scene as it was during the match, even which seats had the passionate Happy fans who stood and waved their arms in the air as they screamed and cheered Happy on. She remembered it all.</p>
<p>“This… is our home stadium?”</p>
<p>Happy’s first home game was already over, but Chen Guo’s heart still hadn’t calmed down. Of course, she had watched matches here and felt the atmosphere of a home game before, but this time, compared to when she watched Excellent Era’s matches, the feeling was completely different.</p>
<p>“Miss…” The worker, seeing how Chen Guo took a few steps and then suddenly stopped again, reminded her again.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.” Chen Guo quickly turned around again. Without looking back, she walked outside through the only exit that was still open.</p>
<p>We’ll return to this place, and we’ll earn victory after victory, all the way until the end. Chen Guo’s footsteps were rapid, and her heart surged.</p>
<p>9 to 1!</p>
<p>Even though she had somewhat greedily hoped for a perfect 10 0 victory, the result they got was enough to please anyone. Chen Guo picked up her phone and dialed a number.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where’d you all go!” Chen Guo said loudly.</p>
<p>“We should be the ones asking you that question…” the person on the other end of the phone answered.</p>
<p>“I just stayed a bit longer at the stadium, to feel the atmosphere of the home stadium,” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Everyone else probably left already, right Boss?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was empty. So we can go out without worrying! Let’s go, let’s celebrate!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too late right now?”</p>
<p>“We’ll make an exception this time! This was our first home match! And we won so beautifully,” said Chen Guo.</p>
<p>“Alright…” On the other end, Ye Xiu hung up the phone.</p>
<p>At least here, this was a night that completely belonged to Happy.</p>
<p>The strongest new team in history. A huge 9 to 1 victory over Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Happy’s pretty female rookie won fame through the group arena.</p>
<p>The next day, as expected, news about Happy vs Hundred Blossoms filled the headlines on the front pages of every major esports publication. Chen Guo was elated. During breakfast, she clutched a cup of warm milk and sat in front of the computer, scrolling through the web. She just sat there with a silly grin, completely forgetting about her milk until it had already gone cold.</p>
<p>The dizzying praise felt exhilarating to her. To the occasional critical comment, she swept by with a laugh of “you people wouldn’t understand.” In the midst of the praise, the one who was mentioned the most often was undoubtedly Tang Rou. Her thrilling performance in the group arena was truly unforgettable, and quite a few people were already discussing the question of Best Rookie for this season. One Glory player made a poll about this, and Tang Rou was at the top of the list by a large margin.</p>
<p>But Chen Guo knew that selection of the Best Rookie wasn’t like the All-Stars, where they were determined by fan vote. Best Rookie was awarded by the Alliance based off their performance throughout the entire season and took into account many factors. Just because a rookie was popular didn’t mean that they would be chose. This poll was just for the players’ amusement; it meant nothing to the officials who would actually decide.</p>
<p>Even though that was the case, Chen Guo was still happy to see all of the favorable comments about her friend.</p>
<p>After reading her fill of all this excitement, Chen Guo went to the official Glory Alliance page to investigate the various technical statistics of the season so far.</p>
<p>There were countless official statistical records: damage dealt, damage boosted, damage taken, heal amount, damage reduced, longest combo, final kill, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>A player’s strength and performance could be judged from these technical statistics. However, most viewers paid attention not to the raw numbers but to the relative rankings.</p>
<p>The leaderboard for damage dealt received the most attention. There were separate group arena and team competition categories. As for the individual round, that was directly compared by win-loss records. There was a separate win rate leaderboard that didn’t count by damage.</p>
<p>Tang Rou had played a strong game, and so Chen Guo came here to see her ranking on the group arena damage leaderboard.</p>
<p>But two rounds of the season had already passed. Although Tang Rou’s performance in this round was stunning, she had lost to Sun Xiang in the first round, and her damage dealt wasn’t very high. After two rounds, Tang Rou’s ranking wasn’t as high as Chen Guo had anticipated. The current number one of the group arena damage leaderboard was none other than Sun Xiang.</p>
<p>In the first round of competition, Sun Xiang had faced a 1v2 in the group arena, and his performance in terms of damage dealt was no worse than Tang Rou’s this past round. And in the second round of competition, Samsara played an away game at Seaside, once again winning in a clean 10 to 0. And this time, Sun Xiang had truly completed a full 1v2. After two rounds, his 142546 far surpassed Tang Rou’s 70421.</p>
<p>It could even be said that comparing Tang Rou with the current number one was a mistake in and of itself.</p>
<p>Of the 84 players that appeared on the group arena damage leaderboard, Tang Rou was only number 31, slightly above the middle. The 30 players ahead of her, including Sun Xiang, had dealt more damage in the group arena after two rounds of competition.</p>
<p>And this was only for the total damage output rankings. If they looked at average per match, Tang Rou’s ranking was a bit lower, number 41 out of 84, very ordinary.</p>
<p>Chen Guo was a bit disappointed after not seeing the results she had hoped for. She scrolled the mouse wheel, searching for the names of the other Happy players. When she scrolled to the bottom, she saw Mo Fan and Deception at number 84. That 0 was particularly glaring.</p>
<p>“Looking at these things now, isn’t it too early?” Ye Xiu’s voice sounded from next to her.</p>
<p>“I’m just looking for fun,” Chen Guo said, turning her head to look at him.</p>
<p>“It’s only been two rounds, the leaderboards haven’t stabilized. Who’s number one?” Ye Xiu was eating breakfast right now, drinking from a cup of milk as he asked this question.</p>
<p>“Sun Xiang,” Chen Guo said, scrolling back up to show him.</p>
<p>“140000, that ferocious? That’s pretty much a 1v2 in both rounds!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“I know!” Chen Guo was quite depressed. She had hoped that Tang Rou was the only one to 1v2, but looking at the leaderboards, it was clear that many players had outstanding performances.</p>
<p>“If he played that ferociously, doesn’t that mean that some people wouldn’t be able to deal their share of damage?” Ye Xiu laughed.</p>
<p>Chen Guo blinked, and then began scrolling down again. In the end, at number 80, she found Zhou Zekai’s name. Not much farther ahead flashed the names of Huang Shaotian and Wang Jiexi.</p>
<p>Zhou Zekai, Huang Shaotian, Wang Jiexi.</p>
<p>Who would dare say that these three had poor DPS? But on the leaderboard after two rounds, each of them seemed weaker than the next. The reality of course wasn’t that they were doing poorly, but that they hadn’t yet had much chance to perform onstage. In their respective teams, each of these three was the powerful player anchoring the group arena. To take Zhou Zekai as an example, in the first round he had faced Lord Grim at low health, and it only took a few attacks to end the battle. In the second round, he hadn’t even gone onstage, since Samsara’s second player ended the group arena.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, of course Zhou Zekai’s damage output would be low.</p>
<p>Thus, although the raw numbers of the Glory statistics leaderboards could reveal a few things, they had to be analyzed with context. Glory’s competition system had its own characteristics, such as this situation where because a teammate was too strong in the group arena, a player didn’t have the chance to deal damage.</p>
<p>Chen Guo casually flipped through a few other leaderboards. Because they were swept in the first round, whether in the overall standings or the average standings, Happy was fairly low, nowhere near as exciting as the news reports today.</p>
<p>“How are the point rankings?” Ye Xiu asked from the side.</p>
<p>“You haven’t looked yet?” As she spoke, Chen Guo flipped to the team points leaderboard.</p>
<p>“Not yet.” Ye Xiu leaned forward a bit. Evidently, he was more interested in this information.</p>
<p>“Samsara’s in first,” Chen Guo said, looking at the leaderboard. “They swept again, 20 points.”</p>
<p>“Mm.” Ye Xiu looked further down. Samsara was in first with 20 points after two rounds, followed by Wind Howl, Blue Rain, and Tiny Herb with 18 points each. Fifth was Tyranny with 17 points, sixth was Misty Rain with 15 points. This seemed to be the cutoff for the upper tier of the points rankings, as there was a large gap between Misty Rain and the seventh place Thunderclap, who earned 13 points over two rounds. Eighth and ninth were Royal Style and Void, each with ten points. Then after that, Happy made a dazzling entrance, placing tenth with nine points. And Happy’s neighbor happened to be the team they just defeated, Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>After two rounds, Hundred Blossoms had also earned 9 points. If ordered alphabetically by the pinyin of their names, then they should be placed before Happy – Baihua (Hundred Blossoms) before Xingxin (Happy). But because the two teams had fought and Happy had won against them, Happy ranked ahead of them. After Hundred Blossoms was 301 Degrees with 7 points, and then there were the various mid-to-low-tier teams. After two rounds, none of these teams broke through to the upper tier. They all obediently stayed in the bottom.</p>
<p>Heavenly Swords, the team that Happy was friendliest with, had earned 3 points in two rounds. They were currently in second to last place, in danger of being relegated.</p>
<p>After Heavenly Swords, last place was held by Seaside. Zhao Yang retired, Boundless Sea was sold. The team that had once been solidly mid-tier had directly slid to the bottom.</p>
<p>However, only two rounds had passed so far. It was still too early to talk about a team’s chances. After all, Heavenly Swords and Seaside, the two teams at the bottom, had faced strong opponents in the first two rounds. Heavenly Swords had faced Hundred Blossoms and Blue Rain, while Seaside faced Misty Rain and Samsara. Losing to these teams, they couldn’t be accused of not trying hard enough.</p>
<p>But Heavenly Swords, who had lost 2 to 8 to Hundred Blossoms, saw how Happy defeated the same team in a drastic 9 to 1, and they couldn’t help but have mixed feelings.</p>
<p>“They really are something else!” Lou Guanning sighed.</p>
<p>Chapter 1166: Point Evaluations</p>
<p>Saturday was match day. On Sunday, all sorts of discussion on Saturday’s matches could be seen in the various Glory forums, although most of these discussions were focused on the players. The news reports, on the other hand, were either impartial descriptions of the how the match went, or remarks from interviews. The truly professional analysis generally required a day to fully digest the previous day’s matches. The most reputable Esports Home would only start reporting any detailed analysis in their Monday issue.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chen Guo hurried to buy a copy of the Esports Home weekly issue. But when she took a glance at it, she was slightly disappointed. The Esports Home’s praise for Happy wasn’t as earth-shattering as she had imagined.</p>
<p>Tang Rou’s outstanding performance in the group arena had received positive evaluations, but Steamed Bun’s performance in the individual competition and Mo Fan’s send off in the group arena had not been neglected by the respected media group. Chen Guo still felt her spirits stir when she saw the high praise for Happy’s performance in the team competition though, which particularly lauded the team’s coordination in killing Blossoming Chaos in one go. The Esports Home called it a classic textbook example. This description couldn’t help but make people think of the Glory Textbook, Ye Xiu. Sure enough, while the popular comments on the forums didn’t talk much about Ye Xiu relatively speaking, the praise for Ye Xiu by Esports Home was no less than their praise for Tang Rou. Even the class-changed Fang Rui received quite the commendation.</p>
<p>The news related to the match were mostly done by City H’s reporter Chang Xian. However, the professional analysis had been done by several special analysts. To be a part of an organization as respected as Esports Home, these analysts weren’t just people who talked big. Their analyses were very on point.</p>
<p>One of Chen Guo’s favorite parts about the Esports Home was their point evaluations for every player in the highlight match. This section was usually done by specialists too. But the analyst was different and the style was different. The writer could write more freely as well, so this section was quite popular.</p>
<p>From the broadcast of the second round, the highlight match was Team Thunderclap versus Team Void. However, the good thing about print media was that they could look at things in retrospect. As a result, they picked the Team Happy versus Team Hundred Blossoms as the highlight match.</p>
<p>Chen Guo quickly flipped to this section in glee. Sure enough, it was in the style she liked.</p>
<p>Individual competition, Ye Xiu versus Zeng Xinran.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu 5 points. Zeng Xinran -4 points.</p>
<p>Yes, this section was sometimes just this unconventional. Points were usually given from 0 to 10, but the writer actually gave Zeng Xinran negative four points. The writer’s disgust for Zeng Xingran’s performance could clearly be seen. The short commentary on it wrote: Team Hundred Blossom’s Zeng Xinran played his first ever match. Through this match, he told us one thing: he was here. Apart from that, he also told God Ye Xiu one thing: it doesn’t matter if your hands are rusty. Against some opponents, you could cut your hands off and still win. Zeng Xingran is a rookie though, so I’ll be more lenient. Instead of -5 points, I give him a -4! As for God Ye Xiu, without a worthy opponent, there’s not much for him to show off, so 5 points!</p>
<p>It was quite a biting remark, even referencing Ye Xiu’s “rustiness.” Chen Guo very rudely let out a laugh and checked the name of the writer for this point evaluation.</p>
<p>As expected, it was Zuo Chenrui. Chen Guo was no stranger to this name. He was famous for his sharp and unkind words. His evaluations were very subjective, not conforming with Esports Home’s reputation. These point evaluations were clearly marked out as “special commentary that did not represent the newspaper’s views,” making it the one place where Zuo Chenrui could shine in the Esports Home. And as it turned out, his exaggerated and sharp remarks became the most popular parts of this section.</p>
<p>As for Chen Guo, she rather liked this person’s commentary because they were often very funny.</p>
<p>After Ye Xiu and Zeng Xinran was Steamed Bun and Zhang Wei’s battle.</p>
<p>Bao Rongxin 10 to 0, Zhang Wei 5.</p>
<p>Chen Guo laughed again just from this evaluation of Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>The puzzling rookie Bao Rongxing has a mind that no one can comprehend. Perhaps he doesn’t even know what he’s doing himself. For the first half, he receives full marks. He utterly dominated Zhang Wei. For the second half, his incomprehensible feebleness proves my bewilderment for him. Zhang Wei 5 points, facing 10 points, can only be crushed. But facing 0 points, it becomes the other way around! Bao Rongxing receives 10 to 0 points. His loss is because his performance didn’t go the reverse from 0 to 10 points.</p>
<p>Evil! How evil!</p>
<p>Zuo Chenrui was just like this. He spared no efforts in ridiculing someone. If you weren’t mentioned much, then that’s pretty much praise for you. The mockery towards Hundred Blossoms was rather light. Those familiar with Zuo Chenrui knew that he was a Blue Rain fan. His negative bias towards Tiny Herb was truly deep. When the Esports Home did a points evaluation for a Tiny Herb match, they definitely didn’t dare have him do it.</p>
<p>After these two rounds was Su Mucheng’s and Zou Yuan’s match.</p>
<p>Zou Yuan wanted to fight with Su Mucheng in a direct confrontation, but he took the wrong turn and ended up being completely suppressed. Zou Yuan’s attempt to directly eliminate Su Mucheng’s suppression ended up in failure. To put it simply, Zou Yuan underestimated Su Mucheng. In terms of technique, experience, and awareness, Su Mucheng is not any worse than Zou Yuan. On the other hand, her good looks surpass Zou Yuan 10000 times. Such a dominating victory makes complete sense. Su Mucheng’s performance is a beautiful 10 / 10, her looks 10000 / 10. Zou Yuan’s performance is a 5/10, his looks… forget about it, I won’t attach a point value to him. I’ll just say it’s on the poorer side!</p>
<p>After that was the group arena.</p>
<p>Fang Rui did a good job. His simple trick worked again and again. It has to be said that even though this master of playing dirty has changed classes, his ability to dig holes is still as high as ever. But his inexperience with his class can clearly be seen. His methods for digging holes isn’t rich enough. In the second half of the match, he was forced into a direct confrontation with Zhou Guangyi. Fortunately, he dug a deep enough hole earlier, so he didn’t fall. The round ended in this way. Fang Rui 6 points. But his Qigong Blast against Yu Feng deserves a 10. (10+6)/2 gives him a total of 8 points.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi was pretty much dancing around in Fang Rui’s palms. If Fang Rui was still a Thief, Zhou Guangyi might have lost in an even uglier fashion, or perhaps he might have done better because he understands Fang Rui’s Thief better. I’m inclined to think the former, so Zhou Guangyi gets 2 points.</p>
<p>Yu Feng should have been able to take down Fang Rui without losing much health, but that Qigong Blast proved that he miscalculated against Fang Rui, 2 points. In the next round, he stood heroically in the center of the map, a well-deserved 5 points, but he won just like that by standing there, so only 5 points. In the third round, he met Happy’s rookie head-on, but was blown out. Yu Feng made the same mistake as Zou Yuan: he underestimated his opponent. But compared to Zou Yuan, as an All-Star, he had the qualifications to look down on a rookie. Thanks to Yu Feng’s negligence, we were gifted a spectacular 1v2. As such, he deserves another 2 points. 2+5+2=9 points? That doesn’t seem right. Oh, I forgot, Yu Feng played a total of three rounds, so we have to divide by 3, 3 points. Speaking of which, if I didn’t say anything, would people have noticed that Yu Feng played three battles, also playing a 1v2?</p>
<p>There’s not much to be said for Mo Fan. He’s Happy response towards Hundred Blossom’s rookie, Zeng Xinran. Zeng Xinran said he was here, so Mo Fan said he was also here. I have to give him two points though, because without him, there wouldn’t have been that beautiful 1v2.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoping, as a Summoner who is said to hold back 2 or 3 people with his 1, was blown out by the enemy. Still, we can’t say that’s Wind Carving’s fault. Zhu Xiaoping, 3 points.</p>
<p>Tang Rou beating Yu Feng, 10 points! Beating Zhu Xiaoping, 10 points! Looks, 10000 points. There’s no need for any explanation.</p>
<p>For the most spectacular performance by Tang Rou, Zuo Chenrui only said a few short words, proving that he loved to mock people but was too lazy to give praise.</p>
<p>For the final team competition, Zuo Chenrui continued with his subjective evaluations. He started off by firing shots at Yu Feng’s early send off. It looked like the Team Blue Rain fan Zuo Chenrui had quite the opinion of Yu Feng, who had abandoned Team Blue Rain.</p>
<p>“What’s making you so happy?” Everyone had arrived at the Internet cafe and was ready to begin their new week’s practice, only to see Chen Guo laughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Chen Guo gave the paper to everyone. Everyone was familiar with Esports Home. They knew that there was nothing really that funny to look at besides that section.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was that section. And looking at the writer, everyone understood.</p>
<p>“Who’s he going at this time?” Fang Rui took the paper and started reading it.</p>
<p>The player being ridiculed certainly wouldn’t be laughing, but to others, reading Zuo Chenrui’s remarks were quite fun.</p>
<p>“Hehe, hehe, hehe…” Fang Rui took the newspaper, looked over Zuo Chenrui’s commentary, and soon started laughing.</p>
<p>“Hey, he was quite nice to me.” Fang Rui was surprised when he saw the group arena evaluation of him. “Let’s see what he wrote about Little Tang.” He continued reading. Since this guy very rarely praised anyone, a lot of people would be curious to see his views on someone who had performed exceptionally.</p>
<p>“Tsk tsk, to make Zuo Chenrui not give any explanation for his evaluation, Little Tang, you’ve got a bright future ahead of you,” Fang Rui said to Tang Rou after reading over it.</p>
<p>“Really?” Tang Rou would also read over the Glory analysis in the papers, but she was mainly doing it to learn. She searched for material she needed in a targeted manner. Someone like Zuo Chenrui, who was extremely subjective and wrote exaggerated remarks, wasn’t inside Tang Rou’s study list, so she didn’t know much about him.</p>
<p>“He’s always been quite nice to girls. Have you ever seen him go all out to tear at a female player?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“This…” Fang Rui thought about it. It really had never happened before. He checked today’s paper again and read over Su Mucheng’s evaluation. Sure enough, Zuo Chenrui’s usual style wasn’t there.</p>
<p>“This guy actually has a bottom line, huh. I never noticed,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Even though he exaggerates a bit, his evaluations can sometimes be very on point. If not, did you really think the Esports Home would have him someone as irresponsible as him writing just to make jokes?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“True.” Fang Rui nodded his head in seriousness, while reading the paper aloud: “‘His Qigong Blast against Yu Feng deserves a 10.’ This guy’s evaluation is truly on point.”</p>
<p>Chapter 1167: Steamed Bun’s Review</p>
<p>“Zuo Chenrui got a lot of things right. Perfect timing, let’s use his evaluation as a starting point for our discussion!” Ye Xiu said, taking the paper from Fang Rui and lifting it in the air.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, whether they came onstage the previous round or not, everyone in Happy went to the strategy room. The always quiet, cold, and lonesome Mo Fan seemed quite eager this time. He was the first to go into the room, although his expression was as apathetic as always.</p>
<p>In the strategy room, everyone sat down at their own seat one after the other. After Ye Xiu came in, everyone stopped chatting.</p>
<p>The projection screen rolled down. Ye Xiu sat in front of a computer to the side and opened up their previous match.</p>
<p>“The first round of the individual competition… Yeah, there’s not much to say here. That Hundred Blossoms kid was too nervous. This issue…” Ye Xiu looked at his teammates. At Happy, there was only one person who would be nervous. Ye Xiu look around the room. In the end, his gaze landed on a laptop.</p>
<p>The new season started in September and so did school. Having a young genius mathematician push his academics aside to focus on a professional gaming career was somewhat of a waste, but in this past year, Luo Ji had come to love Glory deeply. He was also unwilling to give up on his position as a pro player. After weighing the two options, Luo Ji decided on staying at school. When he was needed for a match, he would fly over to the stadium.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was esports. Even if Luo Ji wasn’t personally with the team, as long as he was online, he could still practice with everyone else. However, since Luo Ji was at school, he obviously had to spend a lot of time on his academics. He couldn’t completely keep up with Happy’s pace. Happy tried their best to arrange for more important matters when Luo Ji was free. Everything else could only be communicated online. For example, right now although Luo Ji wasn’t here in-person, a laptop was placed where he would be sitting. Though a bit strange, he could participate in the meeting through a video call.</p>
<p>“There’s not much to say about this issue. Dealing with it is mainly dependent on you. From my experience, try to focus on the match as much as possible and don’t think too much about other things. It’ll help a bit.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Yes yes yes…” Luo Ji spoke through the laptop. Everyone felt weird seeing it.</p>
<p>“The second round was Steamed Bun’s. Steamed Bun, you see how he evaluated you? He gave you 10 to 0. Do you know why?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Why?” Steamed Bun asked back.</p>
<p>“Because you played very well at the start, but then played badly at the end.” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“No wonder I lost!” Steamed Bun suddenly understood. He lowered his right fist to his left palm.</p>
<p>“Yeah… let’s look at Steamed Bun’s match!” Ye Xiu said as he opened the VOD of Steamed Bun versus Zhang Wei.</p>
<p>A huge display of Steamed Bun’s match started playing on the projection screen. This wasn’t a recording of the broadcast, but Glory’s own specialized VOD. By using a special video player, they could change the viewpoint and the speed however they pleased.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu fast-forwarded until the point where Steamed Bun and Zhang Wei met.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei threw a Lava Flask, while Steamed Bun flew over with a Powerful Knee Strike…</p>
<p>For the first half, Zuo Chenrui gave Steamed Bun 10 points. What was 10 points? Perfect play was 10 points. For any other analyst, giving out 10 points was extremely rare. But for someone like Zuo Chenrui, who could give 10000 points for looks, what was 10 points? He wasn’t stingy about that, just like how he wasn’t stingy about jabbing at someone.</p>
<p>10 points…</p>
<p>Ye Xiu took the newspaper and for a moment, he didn’t know where to start. Steamed Bun and Tang Rou were the same. Both of them had started playing in the tenth server. Ye Xiu had personally watched over these two blank pieces of paper as the papers were drawn on. For Tang Rou, her lines were crisp and clear. Her thought process was distinct. Ye Xiu could see the logic behind every stroke. He could see her thoughts. However, for Steamed Bun, his art was the legendary abstract art. His playstyle and his logic did not coincide much, if at all, with those of a normal Glory player. However, sometimes he could produce surprising results.</p>
<p>As Steamed Bun’s skill continued to grow, in his practice, there were times where even Ye Xiu was caught off guard. As for Ye Xiu, he had constantly been trying to understand Steamed Bun’s thoughts. For example, he would frequently review the VOD after practice together with Steamed Bun and have him explain his logic when Ye Xiu didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Lots of times, Steamed Bun also scratched his head in wonder. He had clearly already forgotten about his thoughts at that time. This wasn’t Steamed Bun getting derailed, it was simply due to the nature of this game. Glory was fast-paced. Oftentimes, inputs could not be carefully thought about and were done instinctively. There were very few players who could remember every detail in their match perfectly. In Happy, the only one who could do this was named Luo Ji, definitely not Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>Even though he couldn’t get an answer for everything, from the places that Steamed Bun could explain, Ye Xiu gradually started to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun wasn’t playing without any logic whatsoever. It was just that his logic was rather bold and imaginative. It was born from wild creativity and observation. In this point, he was very similar to Wang Jiexi. The difference was that Steamed Bun had only played Glory for a year, while by the time Wang Jiexi became a pro player, he had been playing Glory for far longer than Steamed Bun. His foundation in Glory had been more solid than Steamed Bun’s.</p>
<p>As a result, Wang Jiexi’s creative playing was precise, sharp, and unpredictable. It was why he was called the Magician.</p>
<p>As for Steamed Bun, he was limited by his foundation. His creative playing would sometimes crash into a dead end, leading to noobish mistakes.</p>
<p>Once he understood Steamed Bun’s situation, Ye Xiu couldn’t help but sigh. If Steamed Bun had started playing Glory sooner and had more time to grow, he would definitely be even more terrifying today. But he had only just started now and suffered for that. It was true that Steamed Bun was quite talented, but this was no longer the game. Compared to the in-game Glory, everyone in the Pro Alliance was brimming with talent. And those who became Gods were the best out of all those talents.</p>
<p>Every rookie found by Ye Xiu in Happy had a certain amount of potential, but in Glory, because of all sorts of reasons, all of them had been delayed. Sun Xiang and Tang Hao, these new generation Gods, were only 20 years old. They were even younger than Tang Rou and Steamed Bun, yet they were already the stars of this era.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time that Ye Xiu had thought about this. If he had discovered them earlier, or if they had found Glory fun earlier and started practicing systematically, would their current selves have already joined those at the top of the pyramid?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no ifs. He could only dream. Right now, Ye Xiu could only do his best and help these latecomers grow faster. However, towards Steamed Bun, the amount of help that Ye Xiu could provide was becoming less and less. Steamed Bun’s playstyle was special, his unique talent. If Ye Xiu forced him to follow the conventional logic of Glory, it would kill his talent. Ye Xiu could not help Steamed Bun develop his unique talent. As the saying went, what came next would depend on Steamed Bun’s own good luck.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu would generally just help Steamed Bun make as few mistakes as possible. Those obvious dead-ends would help remind him not to make the same mistake next time.</p>
<p>In Steamed Bun’s match against Zhang Wei, he was bold and creative in the first half, but in the next half, he regressed back to the ordinary and confronted Zhang Wei head on. When he asked for the reason why, Steamed Bun’s answer couldn’t be refuted.</p>
<p>“I had more health!” Steamed Bun said.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room stared blankly. They wanted to laugh, but they felt like it was nothing to joke about. In the first half, gain the upper hand and get a health lead. Then, in the second half, there was no need to use any special tricks, just directly trade blows. It was a very common and logical strategy. Even the master of playing dirty, Fang Rui, had the same idea in his match against Zhou Guangyi. After successfully pulling off the cooldown method twice and gaining a health lead, he immediately started fighting against Zhou Guangyi directly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that…” Ye Xiu also hesitated. He fast-forwarded to the middle. “Okay, then let’s take a look at how you played after you had more health than him.”</p>
<p>Steamed Bun had more health, yet he still lost to Zhang Wei. It wasn’t hard to realize that Steamed Bun had made many mistakes. The strategy meetings weren’t just Ye Xiu lecturing them. During this time, everyone was free to speak up. The rookies and Qiao Yifan were rather quiet, though. Su Mucheng just listened more often than not. She would typically only raise an issue if something was missed. Today, no opportunities had appeared yet. Ye Xiu wasn’t the main speaker either. So, after they started analyzing the latter half of the fight, Wei Chen and Fang Rui were the ones dominating the discussion.</p>
<p>“Here, here. At 2:41, you hesitated! Don’t you think you could have just thrown your Brick at his forehead?” Wei Chen pointed at the projection screen. His tone of voice and attitude didn’t seem like he was discussing tactics. It sounded like he was telling him how to fight like a gangster.</p>
<p>“You’re right!” Steamed Bun again put his right fist to his left palm. He had taken a liking to his movement recently.</p>
<p>“The hesitation is okay, but you shouldn’t have leaped back and retreated afterwards. Why not just use Tiger Flips the Mountain?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily correct. After jumping backwards, you should have followed up with a Powerful Knee Strike. It would have been very strong too,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“Powerful Knee Strike? He could just use Shadow Cloak and wrap you up,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“That’s why you need to jump backwards first to dodge Shadow Cloak before counterattacking,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>Fang Rui looked distracted for a moment, but he quickly responded, “Fuck, if there’s no Powerful Knee Strike, where would the Shadow Cloak come from?”</p>
<p>“Young people these days, do you not understand the word ‘predict’?” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“Predict, my ass!” Fang Rui wasn’t polite at all to this shameless senior. “Steamed Bun, don’t listen to his nonsense. You should have just used Tiger Flips the Mountain and flip him.”</p>
<p>“Peh!” Wei Chen spat. “Steamed Bun, trust this senior. Jump back first and then Powerful Knee Strike. Watch the opponent carefully. You’re aiming for that small time gap. It’ll definitely give your opponent the biggest surprise.”</p>
<p>“Surprise, I like it!” Steamed Bun said happily.</p>
<p>“Mm, mm.” Wei Chen nodded his head as if he were teaching a child. “Rhythm. What’s important is the rhythm.”</p>
<p>“Steamed Bun,” Ye Xiu called out at this moment.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Steamed Bun looked towards his boss.</p>
<p>“You hesitated here,” Ye Xiu said. “Don’t hesitate next time. React faster.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Steamed Bun replied.</p>
<p>“Alright, good.” Ye Xiu nodded his head.</p>
<p>Chapter 1168: The Best Choice</p>
<p>Steamed Bun had a lot of problems in the second half of the match, so they allocated a lot of time for review until the discussion finally quieted down. After that was the battle between Su Mucheng and Zou Yuan.</p>
<p>Even though it was a victory, and even though Su Mucheng was already a high-level player, they didn’t skip this match. No matter how good a player was, there would always be mistakes that exposed flaws during battle. Reviewing matches wasn’t just to help improve the person whose battle they were studying, it let everyone learn lessons. At the same time, they could further study the opponent. Thus, no matter whom they fought against, whether they won or lost, review was always beneficial.</p>
<p>Reviewing Su Mucheng’s battle was much easier and much lighter than reviewing Steamed Bun’s. While watching the replay, Su Mucheng herself was able to notice many things about her fighting, and she would then bring them up with everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>After the individual round was the group arena, and first up was the battle between Fang Rui and Zhou Guangyi. Wei Chen pushed up his sleeves, but it was unclear what he planned to do.</p>
<p>The battle began.</p>
<p>Zhou Guangyi’s Cold Seasons reached the center of the map, but Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea wasn’t there, so he began to look for him, all the way until the two returned to the center and began to fight.</p>
<p>“You played around too much in the beginning,” Wei Chen said coldly.</p>
<p>“We know each other too well, I had to make him think a bit more,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“If he hadn’t had doubts in his heart, your cooldown method never would’ve worked,” said Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“Right.” Fang Rui nodded.</p>
<p>In the VOD, Fang Rui was having Boundless Sea play the cooldown method, showing the moment he qi blasted Cold Seasons.</p>
<p>“Not decisive enough!” Wei Chen sighed.</p>
<p>“Me or him?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>“Him,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“Well, of course,” said Fang Rui. “This is the value of my playing around earlier.”</p>
<p>“It’s impressive enough that it worked once, but it actually worked twice,” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“You guys don’t understand the depth of this match,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>Wei Chen made a disdainful face, but he didn’t retort, because Fang Rui spoke the truth. This battle was between two players that understood each other very well. It was more of a psychological contest than one of technical skill. Battles like this couldn’t be learned, not even by the most skilled players. Without that personal relationship, you couldn’t play these sorts of mental traps. And then, the technical skill was another level on top of the psychological warfare.</p>
<p>You couldn’t follow normal logic when looking at such a match. In the end, they just found some non-psychological points to look at, and they soon moved on.</p>
<p>After that was another one of Fang Rui’s battles, now against Yu Feng. In the eyes of the specialists, there were three highlights of the Happy vs Hundred Blossoms match. First was Fang Rui’s final Qigong Blast in this battle, next was of course Tang Rou’s 1v2, and finally in the team battle when they took down Yu Feng’s Blossoming Chaos.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms’ Captain Yu Feng was named the most tragic character of this match. In all three of the highlights, he was the victim. Boundless Sea’s Qigong Blast landed on the body of his Blossoming Chaos, Tang Rou’s 1v2 began by killing him, and he was the one who had been so dramatically killed in the team round…</p>
<p>One mischievous Glory player created a montage of these three highlights, set it to the music of “Why Am I Always The One Who Gets Hurt,” and posted the video online, where it quickly went viral.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu of course didn’t show this silly video. He selected the proper battle recording and the scene began to unfold before them.</p>
<p>“Too slow!” The recording had barely begun when Wei Chen suddenly let out this shout, startling everyone in the room, even Luo Ji in the laptop screen.</p>
<p>“Much too slow,” Wei Chen continued. “Every second after a battle begins is extremely valuable. If you don’t get in the right mindset as fast as you can, any small ripple can become the reason for defeat.”</p>
<p>In the VOD, Fang Rui’s Boundless Sea hesitated for about three seconds after the match began before he started moving.</p>
<p>Everyone stared blankly at Wei Chen. What he said about “every second after a battle begins” was inaccurate reasoning, even an idiot could tell he was nitpicking. But to everyone’s surprise, Fang Rui actually nodded in agreement. “You’re right. If not for that three second delay, Yu Feng and I would have met under slightly different conditions, and I might have been able to take the advantage.”</p>
<p>Everyone continued to stare blankly. Those three seconds of hesitation really affected the entire progression of the battle? Wei Chen wasn’t just nitpicking, he actually made a good point?</p>
<p>In the next moment, Fang Rui turned his head to look at Wei Chen. “Didn’t I tell you this after the match that day?”</p>
<p>“Mm, I was worried you’d forget, so I’m reminding you,” Wei Chen said, nodding.</p>
<p>The sound of one cough after another filled the room. Even just hearing this, everyone felt awkward, but Wei Chen was as calm as ever.</p>
<p>Only Ye Xiu was unaffected. He continued to watch the onscreen maneuvering, zooming out the camera view until both sides were visible, and then he began to zoom in again, finally pausing on one scene.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right here.” Fang Rui pointed on the screen. “If I hadn’t hesitated for those three seconds, then I could’ve reached that fork there at two o’clock. From there, if I could lure Blossoming Chaos in, then the situation could have been much better.”</p>
<p>“Here?” Ye Xiu used the mouse to circle the position.</p>
<p>“Right,” Fang Rui nodded.</p>
<p>“Hm, right here…” Ye Xiu directly switched to a map of Life-Seeking Path and began to study it.</p>
<p>“What if Yu Feng circled around in the ten o’clock direction?” Su Mucheng asked.</p>
<p>“With his speed, he couldn’t catch up, I… Oh!” Fang Rui slapped his forehead. “I’m using Boundless Sea right now, not Demon Subduer.”</p>
<p>“So he still could’ve gotten you,” said Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>“Yeah…” Fang Rui nodded, but he was still studying the map intently, trying to think of another way.</p>
<p>“What about here!” Ye Xiu circled another position on the map.</p>
<p>“There, if Yu Feng took the path to the right, they would meet face to face. If prepared, Fang Rui could still maintain three steps of distance, but that’s still in the attack range of a Berserker. Whether or not he could actually break through and attack would depend on the exact conditions.” Wei Chen now began to give serious analysis.</p>
<p>“But even if he broke through, wouldn’t the distance to the next fork be enough to escape?” said Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>“If Qi Flowing Cloud were activated, yeah.” This time Fang Rui didn’t mistake the character.</p>
<p>“What if Yu Feng used Triple Slash?” said Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>“He’d have to predict my move first,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>The rookies listened quietly. For this kind of discussion, they would sometimes speak up, but most of the time their views and awareness couldn’t keep up. Every time they went through this review and study, everyone would notice many things. The ones fighting were Fang Rui and Yu Feng, but they could imagine putting themselves and their own characters in one of those positions, and figure out how they would act in such a situation. Through analysis, they could reach an analogous answer. Boundless Sea could activate Qi Flowing Cloud, Berserker could use Triple Slash, and other classes would have their own ways of boosting their movement speed here.</p>
<p>Just looking at a three-second hesitation brought forth analysis of so many potential changes. But everyone also understood that all of these situations had to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. The important thing wasn’t being early or late by three seconds, the important thing was realizing and studying these changes. This was the significance of this review.</p>
<p>There wasn’t too much to look at in Fang Rui’s battle against Yu Feng, so in the end it finished quite quickly.</p>
<p>And then it was Mo Fan against Yu Feng. Everyone knew the results of this match, and there shouldn’t have been much to review. But Ye Xiu still played the recording of this match. Everyone couldn’t help but glance at Mo Fan, but this guy was as expressionless as ever. Only Qiao Yifan, who was sitting next to him, noticed how he was clenching his fists under the table.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan was a bit worried. He didn’t know what Ye Xiu was thinking. Was he purposely trying to humiliate and provoke Mo Fan by replaying this match? That… didn’t seem too good, Qiao Yifan thought.</p>
<p>No one spoke. The recording quietly played, the screen splitting in half to show each character. Soon, Yu Feng’s Blossoming Chaos reached the center of the map, and Mo Fan’s Deception arrived soon after, hiding to the side.</p>
<p>“You chose a good position.” Ye Xiu finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. Mo Fan, with his background of scrap-picking, was extremely skilled in choosing advantageous positions, no worse than any pro player.</p>
<p>“But sometimes, the best position isn’t actually very good,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Everyone startled a bit, and there was confusion in Mo Fan’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Because, when facing the best players, you aren’t the only one who knows the best position.” As Ye Xiu spoke, he switched the camera view to Yu Feng. “Blossoming Chaos’ position looks very random, but in reality, he’s carefully positioned a distance away from all possible ambush points. No matter where the opponent tries to launch a sneak attack from, he has enough space to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu snatched up the esports newspaper issue on the table and waved it around. “Zuo Chenrui said that Yu Feng stood heroically and that was worth 5 points. That wasn’t entirely mockery, his positioning was indeed excellent.</p>
<p>“Let’s look at his use of his camera view.” Ye Xiu switched the recording to Yu Feng’s camera view. The display followed Yu Feng’s control over his view as he turned.</p>
<p>“Do you see it?” Ye Xiu pointed to a position on the screen, right where Deception was currently hiding.</p>
<p>“The best position you had chosen was also where he was the most prepared for an attack,” said Ye Xiu. “If you tried to attack from here, it would be very difficult for you to get seize an opportunity.”</p>
<p>So that was the reason… As expected of senior! Qiao Yifan was sincerely happy. Earlier, he was truly a little worried that Ye Xiu’s goal had just been to shame Mo Fan. If that had been the case, he really would have been disappointed in him. But now, he saw that Ye Xiu was giving genuine feedback and advice on Mo Fan’s pitifully lacking performance in this match.</p>
<p>It was just a choice of position, but Ye Xiu used this to emphasize to Mo Fan what was different about the professional stage.</p>
<p>In this domain, anyone can have the same background and knowledge as you. The best choice might actually be the worst because everyone knows it’s the best choice. As a player who likes to use sneak attacks, it’s crucial that you understand this point…</p>
<p>Chapter 1169: Third Round</p>
<p>They finished discussing positioning. Next was the judge giving a yellow card to the calmly waiting Mo Fan, forcing Mo Fan to make adjustments, but the judge felt his actions were unacceptable, so he gave him another yellow card, and Mo Fan was disqualified.</p>
<p>“Mucheng, you talked to him about the rules already, right?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“I did,” Su Mucheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Alright, then that’s that.” Ye Xiu nodded. He didn’t ask Mo Fan to report anything, and simply ended the discussion of this battle. “Let’s look at the next battle.”</p>
<p>The next battle was Tang Rou’s thrilling 1v2. Because it was her own battle, this time Tang Rou participated in the discussion more. She wasn’t like Steamed Bun, who couldn’t figure out the situation. Her clarity of thought allowed her to gain the most from reviewing her own match.</p>
<p>After the group arena was the team competition. Every confrontation, every player’s performance, from both Happy and Hundred Blossoms, was taken apart and evaluated in detail.</p>
<p>They spent the entire morning in review, which was already a relatively short amount of time. In this competition, there really wasn’t much they could analyze. Ye Xiu’s defeat of Zeng Xinran, Fang Rui’s two battles, Mo Fan’s battle, there wasn’t much content to look at. Furthermore, this was Happy’s big victory. A victory generally meant that there were fewer problems to study. Even though the opponent’s mistakes could also be analyzed, the priority was generally figuring out one’s own problems so that they could be fixed. For example, Hundred Blossoms’ Zeng Xinran revealed the problem of nerves, but this wasn’t something that Happy needed to focus on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, their complete defeat in last week’s match against Samsara revealed many of their problems. The review that Happy did last Monday after that match lasted from morning all the way until night.</p>
<p>They finished review in the morning, so the afternoon was spent training as usual. The life of a pro player was this sort of dull repetition. Every day, they basically did the same thing. The burning passion was left to Saturday night to be released.</p>
<p>On days without matches, ordinary gamers could only wait around, looking back on previous matches and anticipating the next ones. In the second round, Happy vs Hundred Blossoms garnered a lot of attention, but to the viewers, the live television broadcast of Thunderclap vs Void was also a very high-level match.</p>
<p>In this match, Thunderclap took an early lead with Dai Yanqi in the individual round, but then they cleanly lost the next two individual battles as well as the group arena.</p>
<p>Losing 1 to 4, with so many consecutive defeats, it seemed as though Thunderclap was on the brink of collapse and Void would earn a big victory. But to everyone’s shock, Thunderclap pulled off a huge comeback in the team competition. They defeated Void and won the 5 points of the team round, and in the end won the match 6 to 4.</p>
<p>Such an exciting plot was definitely worth live broadcast, but in the end, the live commentator was distracted during the whole thing, occasionally turning the subject to discuss Happy vs Hundred Blossoms. There were indeed some viewers that objected to this.</p>
<p>There was much commentary on the Happy vs Hundred Blossoms match, but the specialized media outlets needed to present comprehensive reports. Esports Weekly, for example, didn’t neglect their analysis and discussion of Thunderclap vs Void.</p>
<p>All of the reporters and special commentators unanimously pointed out Thunderclap’s biggest change this season: they had become more confident.</p>
<p>They won 7 points in the first round and 6 points this round. With 13 points, they were currently in 7th place, not a bad start. If they maintained this stable performance, then it wouldn’t be a problem for them to earn a spot in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Their performance in the team competition received particular attention. Before, Thunderclap relied on their Master Tactician Xiao Shiqin, who had more of a chance to shine in the team competition. Now that he returned this season, he joined with his former teammates who had grown on their own, as well as new arrivals, to smoothly create a solid, unified team. Team Parade and Team Void, who had fought with Thunderclap this season, both expressed how difficult it was to face Team Thunderclap in the team competition.</p>
<p>Of course, some people said this was because Thunderclap didn’t have Xiao Shiqin last season, so their skill in the team competition had gone down. This season, with Xiao Shiqin’s return, Thunderclap was merely regaining its former ability. This view compared the current Thunderclap with the Thunderclap of last season, and said that if they compared the current Thunderclap to previous years where Xiao Shiqin was present, then it’d be more difficult to say which was better.</p>
<p>The pro scene was filled with such endless debates. After Happy’s huge victory, there were people who looked back at their earlier performance, when they were swept in the first round, to find problems.</p>
<p>One match they were swept, one match they won big. These sort of up and down results were the best evidence of an unstable condition!</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of debate, they needed the third round to give them an answer.</p>
<p>One week passed, and the third round of matches were upon them. With the first two rounds to pave the way, the third round seemed much more exciting. Happy had a big loss and then a big win, so how would they perform in this round? Thunderclap was doing well as a team, could they maintain their win streak in the team competition?</p>
<p>The attention that these two teams received was a result of their performance in the first two rounds. But in the third round, neither of them would be in the spotlight. Because in this third round, there finally appeared a match that was an unquestionable pinnacle of showdowns. As much as people discussed Happy and Thunderclap, nothing could steal away their attention from this match.</p>
<p>Glory Professional Alliance Season 10 Round 3, Team Samsara vs Team Tyranny.</p>
<p>The champion and runner-up of last season, a collision like Mars crashing into Earth appeared in the very third round of matches. What match could rival this? None, none at all!</p>
<p>Even the pro players themselves were paying close attention to this match. After all, they were group of people that loved Glory the most, of course they loved to see exciting matches.</p>
<p>Right before the third round of matches began, in the Tiny Herb prep room, Liu Xiaobie was fiddling with his phone. This caught the notice of Captain Wang Jiexi.</p>
<p>In an instant, Liu Xiaobie’s expression became strained. He attempted to hide his phone away, carefully and stealthily.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” But in the end, Wang Jiexi still asked.</p>
<p>The prep room instantly fell silent, and quite a few looked over at them. Everyone knew what Liu Xiaobie was trying to do. This guy just wanted to check on Samsara vs Tyranny in the breaks between their battles. Everyone was curious about how that match would play out.</p>
<p>But even if the captain were curious, he would certainly restabilize his mindset. He wouldn’t let himself be distracted during a competition, and of course, he wouldn’t want his Tiny Herb teammates to be distracted, either.</p>
<p>“Turn off your phone.” Wang Jiexi didn’t ask further, and merely spoke in an ordinary tone.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie, dejected, took out his phone and turned it off.</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi’s gaze swept over everyone, and the players couldn’t help but stand up when he looked at them. “This match, our opponent is Bright Green. Although they aren’t a very strong team, we can’t drop our guard.”</p>
<p>“Right,” everyone answered.</p>
<p>“Good, let’s go!” With that, the Tiny Herb players walked out of the prep room. Liu Xiaobie felt at the phone in his pocket, but in the end, he left it in the room.</p>
<p>Focus on the match!</p>
<p>This is what he told himself. He lifted his head, straightened his shoulders, and followed the pace of his teammates.</p>
<p>All of the matches going on at the same time were affected by this pinnacle match. Even at the pre-match press conferences, many reporters went on a tangent to ask about players’ views toward this match.</p>
<p>In Happy’s pre-match press conference, one reporter hoped that Ye Xiu would make a prediction. After all, Ye Xiu was very familiar with the old veterans of Tyranny. And as for Samsara? The account One Autumn Leaf, did those ties even need to be discussed?</p>
<p>“Tell us! Just give us a prediction of points?” The reporter hounded Ye Xiu for an answer.</p>
<p>“10 to 0,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What!” All of the reporters were in shock. Such a big point difference! Which team did Ye Xiu favor so much?</p>
<p>“Who’s 10 and who’s 0?” someone immediately asked, sensing that there would be a story in this.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter,” Ye Xiu said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t… doesn’t matter?” Everyone was stunned. What did that mean?</p>
<p>“How… how can you just say this doesn’t matter?” said the reporter who had hounded for an answer.</p>
<p>“You were the one who said to just give a prediction,” Ye Xiu laughed.</p>
<p>“I…” The reporter was speechless, and could only stare blankly as the Happy players left the conference.</p>
<p>Happy’s opponent this round was Radiant. After two rounds, they finally met an opponent that wasn’t that strong. Some people were already saying that real gold was revealed under fire, this match wouldn’t say much. They needed a strong team to test Happy’s true colors.</p>
<p>“Who does he think he is!” The Friday issue of Esports Weekly had lots of predictive discussions, and this one in particular made Chen Guo rather unhappy. As she waved the newspaper around, she fiercely wrote the reporter’s name into her memory: Cheng Jianbo.</p>
<p>“This is nothing!” Ye Xiu couldn’t help but laugh at Chen Guo’s indignation. “This just says that, to some people, we as a team are already stronger than Radiant, and so we shouldn’t be compared to them.”</p>
<p>“How childish!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s extremely childish,” Ye Xiu agreed. He looked around at everyone gathered in the prep room.</p>
<p>“I’m sure that everyone’s already aware of this week’s analyses of Radiant. They’re never a team that places very highly on the Alliance leaderboard,” said Ye Xiu. “However, they definitely aren’t a team that can be defeated easily. Focus on the match, and don’t think about anything else.”</p>
<p>In the first round, Happy was swept, and they suffered a lot of discussion. In the second round, they won by a large margin, and once again were subject to a lot of discussion. All of this discussion tended to pile up and add pressure on players, and sometimes this would negatively impact a player’s condition. This was especially true for rookies, who didn’t have much experience in dealing with this.</p>
<p>“Understood!” But for now, everyone gave Ye Xiu a spirited reply.</p>
<p>In the third round, Team Happy fought against Team Radiant. And after 1 hour and 23 minutes of fierce fighting, the final score hung in Radiant’s stadium: 3 to 7, Radiant’s victory.</p>
<p>In the prep room before the press conference, Tang Rou said to her teammates, “I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Chapter 1170: Promise</p>
<p>3 to 7. In the end, Happy lost this round’s away game, despite the odds looking to be in their favor.</p>
<p>Their roster this round hadn’t seen many big changes, aside from Mo Fan, who had been penalized last round and couldn’t appear this round. Instead, they sent up the veteran Wei Chen for the group arena this time.</p>
<p>Happy won all three of the individual battles, entering the group arena with a 3 to 0 lead.</p>
<p>Like the previous round, Fang Rui was first up in the group arena, and he did even better than before. When Boundless Sea fell, he had taken down one and a half players. And then Wei Chen went up. As an extremely old veteran, his reaction time and hand speed had no way of competing with those of the younger players, but although his performance wasn’t flashy, Windward Formation still took down the second player and half of the third player’s health.</p>
<p>After that, what was left to Happy’s powerful anchor Tang Rou was just one opponent at half health. He wasn’t a star like Yu Feng, he wasn’t even Radiant’s core player, he was just a very ordinary player in this mid-low tier team.</p>
<p>The home audience had already given up on this match. No one thought that the 1v2 Tang Rou would miss a victory like this. Some neutral spectators thought this would be very boring. They were only interested in this match to see the pretty female player Tang Rou, but now she only had a player at half health left to face. What excitement was there in that?</p>
<p>Tang Rou lost.</p>
<p>The audience was incredibly quiet – it was clear that Tang Rou was already a very strong player in everyone’s minds. It was only after this pause that the home crowd exploded in excited cheering!</p>
<p>They all thought that she would bring the end, but it turned out that she was the one who met her end.</p>
<p>That eye-catching 1v2 performance was of course interesting, but no one wanted to be the victim of such a scene. And this time, Radiant managed it. A character at half health used by a player who was ordinary even by Radiant’s standards managed to defeat Tang Rou, the player who had become famous with a single battle.</p>
<p>Tang Rou left the stage. Of course, she was extremely upset with her loss.</p>
<p>In the team competition, she went onstage once again.</p>
<p>Tang Rou was undoubtedly a fierce fighter. But after two rounds of Alliance matches, the characteristics of her fierce style had been seen through. Radiant used tactics specifically to target her, which in turn affected Happy as a whole. Because of this, Happy’s rhythm was thrown into disorder.</p>
<p>“No victory is ever guaranteed…” In the prep room, this is what Ye Xiu said to the apologizing Tang Rou. Happy could defeat a giant like Excellent Era, but other teams could defeat Happy in turn. If raw strength was the only thing that determined victory, then what would be the point of competing?</p>
<p>But the factor that determined this match’s victory and defeat was very clear. Even the most ordinary viewers could tell that the problems were from Tang Rou.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to analyze this carefully during our review session. Now, for the press conference…”</p>
<p>“I’ll go!” Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu nodded and didn’t say anything else. Tang Rou never backed down. She would always face any challenges head-on.</p>
<p>For this press conference, Happy sent out Ye Xiu, Wei Chen, and Tang Rou.</p>
<p>As soon as the three appeared, the camera flashes from below lit up the area. The target was Tang Rou, whom the reporters were rather surprised to see. During their wait, they all guessed that Happy wouldn’t send Tang Rou to this press conference. This level of pressure was frightening for a rookie to bear. The team would probably try to protect its new members, and have the veterans deal with this situation, right?</p>
<p>But as it turned out, Tang Rou just walked out at the very front, her expression unusually resolute.</p>
<p>Since she dared to come out, would the reporters hold back? Click click click, everyone took their fill of pictures before anything was said.</p>
<p>“Tsk tsk, how popular,” Wei Chen remarked.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Whether good or bad, at least she’s getting a lot of attention now, no?” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“How come I smell something sour?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Tch, would I care about something as unimportant as this?” said Wei Chen, filled with righteousness. But no matter how you looked at it, the whispering of these two seemed very sneaky, so the reporters turned their cameras and took many pictures of these two as well.</p>
<p>The three took their seats, and the reporters all focused their gazes on Tang Rou, hoping to discover something from her expression. But they were disappointed, for there was no hiding, no flinching. If anyone looked at her, Tang Rou would look right back, and then give a polite smile.</p>
<p>“We can begin,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>In their eagerness, the reporters almost raised their feet along with their hands. Ye Xiu randomly picked one.</p>
<p>“Question for Miss Tang Rou! What are your thoughts on your performance in this match?” This reporter couldn’t wait any longer. He was so eager that he didn’t even bother to begin with the standard phrases like “this battle’s loss was unfortunate”.</p>
<p>“My performance dragged down the entire team,” Tang Rou said. “Because of this, I’m deeply sorry.”</p>
<p>Tang Rou’s condition was clear to see. An apology now seemed like a very ordinary, standard, expected answer, and so the reporters were unsatisfied.</p>
<p>“I remember that after the last match, you said that you wanted to complete a 1v3. But in this match, you couldn’t even take down an opponent at half health. Why do you think that happened?” one reporter asked, with an air of ridicule. Tang Rou’s declaration last match about aiming for a 1v3 after her 1v2 was disliked by some people, who viewed her as too presumptuous. This reporter was evidently one such person.</p>
<p>“Victory or defeat is never guaranteed,” Tang Rou said, borrowing from what Ye Xiu had just said in the prep room. “But I will definitely complete a 1v3.”</p>
<p>“In-game doesn’t count!” one reporter jeered, earning laughter from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Right here, on the pro stage,” Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>To the reporters, this unparalleled determination and confidence seemed to be unparalleled arrogance. This rookie’s skills weren’t bad, and she’d managed to complete a 1v2, but just because of that one accomplishment, she thought she could do anything?</p>
<p>Victory or defeat was never guaranteed, the reporters could agree with this. But the person who just said this then said that she would 1v3 for sure. How brazen was that?</p>
<p>The reporters couldn’t hold back anymore. After last round, there were already quite a few people who disliked Tang Rou’s attitude. Then, even after such a sad performance this round, she still didn’t correct herself. She was still overstepping with that bullheaded stubbornness of hers.</p>
<p>One reporter was particularly aggressive, directly shouting a challenge at her during this press conference. “If you can’t do it, then what?”</p>
<p>“If I can’t do it, I’ll leave the pro scene.”</p>
<p>The crowd was shocked into silence. As a result, a whispered conversation suddenly happened to become clear for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>“Look look, that reporter over there really looks like a dog.” Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. Which one are you talking about?” Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then an uproar.</p>
<p>Evidently Ye Xiu and Wei Chen realized that the sound of their voices had suddenly been magnified. In the midst of the commotion, they each coughed and looked to the left and right, as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The reporters didn’t even know which side to respond to first. Should they be amazed at Tang Rou ruthlessly betting her own pro career, or should they be amazed at these two Happy seniors, who, instead of protecting their rookie, were mocking a reporter for looking like a dog?</p>
<p>Say, which reporter was the dog anyway?</p>
<p>The reporters couldn’t help but look around and size each other up, and those who were stared at for too long turned red in the face. What are you looking at me like that for? Are you saying that I look like a dog?</p>
<p>The thought process of these reporters was shattered into pieces by Happy’s rookie-veteran combination, and it was quite a while before things got back on track.</p>
<p>Who looked like a dog? There wasn’t much meaning in discussing this question, and in the end everyone’s attention returned to Tang Rou’s oath.</p>
<p>If she can’t complete a 1v3, she’ll quit the pro scene?</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Tang Rou, and then at Ye Xiu and Wei Chen. Did Happy’s two veterans not hear what Tang Rou just said? They didn’t even stop her from pledging such a thing. In fact, they looked as though it didn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>“If you can’t complete a 1v3, you’ll quit the pro scene?” One reporter felt that these two had been distracted and really didn’t know the current situation, so, to prompt them, this reporter repeated the statement loudly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tang Rou nodded.</p>
<p>“Good determination,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Very daring.” Wei Chen even began to clap for her.</p>
<p>The reporters were dumbfounded. These were supposed to be the reliable veterans of this team! How come it seemed like they were just here to stir up a ruckus?</p>
<p>“Do you two feel that Tang Rou can accomplish this?” One reporter took the opportunity to directly ask these two.</p>
<p>“With that kind of determination and daring,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Even metal can be cut through,” Wei Chen quickly followed up.</p>
<p>What nonsense was this? The reporters who were taking notes found that they couldn’t bring themselves to write down any more. These two were just out to make trouble, right? Right?</p>
<p>But in the midst of all the reporters who had been thrown off, one reporter was still very clear-headed and asked, “Miss Tang Rou, how many matches do you plan to use to reach this goal? Will you dedicate your entire pro career to this?”</p>
<p>The one who asked this question was gleeful, because he felt that he had found the key point. Tang Rou’s oath here was just a game of words. If she can’t 1v3, she’ll quit. But without a time limit, didn’t that just mean she would keep playing match after match trying to 1v3, and if in the end she couldn’t do it, then she’d just retire anyway?</p>
<p>You think you’re so clever! This reporter smiled coldly.</p>
<p>Tang Rou was about to reply, but Ye Xiu suddenly moved to speak before her.</p>
<p>Was he finally going to rescue her? The reporters all waited to see what kind of trick he would pull.</p>
<p>“Five matches should be enough, right?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Another uproar from the reporters. He didn’t come to her rescue? He actually gave Tang Rou even more pressure?</p>
<p>1v3 was something that many pro players never accomplished in the entirety of their careers. And now, to have a rookie swear to complete a 1v3 within five matches or else quit the pro scene… Did Ye Xiu have a grudge against Tang Rou or something?</p>
<p>“Five matches?” After hearing this number, Tang Rou actually revealed a happy smile. “Then five matches it is!”</p>
<p>Chapter 1171: The New Season’s Tyranny</p>
<p>The reporters couldn’t even keep count of how many times Happy managed to cause such a commotion.</p>
<p>1v3 within five rounds!</p>
<p>It seemed like Ye Xiu was making things hard for her on purpose, yet Tang Rou seemed ever so satisfied. Could it be that they had some way ensuring their victory?</p>
<p>The reporters hurriedly checked for Happy’s scheduled matches, but after they checked, they were dumbstruck once more.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call Happy’s match schedule a journey to death.</p>
<p>Round 4, Happy would play their home game against Team Tyranny.</p>
<p>Round 6, they’d be welcoming Blue Rain in a home game.</p>
<p>Round 8, still on their home turf, Tiny Herb would come knocking.</p>
<p>The three teams at the top of the Alliance were all congregated in the next five matches. Happy might have the home advantage all three matches, but if you wanted to complete a 1v3 at the hands of these three teams, that was a senseless dream.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, you really do have a grudge against Tang Rou! Right? Right?</p>
<p>Several reporters had their heads raised to observe Ye Xiu’s expression, while the others checked the other two teams.</p>
<p>Round 5, Happy would challenge Team Parade in their away game, a below average team like Radiant.</p>
<p>In their away game in Round 7, however, their opponent was Team Heavenly Swords.</p>
<p>Team Heavenly Swords?!</p>
<p>The quick thinkers immediately let their imaginations take flight.</p>
<p>From what info they had gleaned from the situation in the Heavenly Domain as well as what Ye Xiu let leak during a certain press conference, it was clear that Team Heavenly Swords and Team Happy had good personal relations.</p>
<p>If they had the confidence that they’d be able to achieve a 1v3 within the next five rounds… Was Heavenly Swords their ace up the sleeve?</p>
<p>Heavenly Swords would let them win?</p>
<p>The Glory Alliance had never had any match-fixing issues in the past. At most, all they had were teams whose morale had depleted with their hope for their goals lost. This sort of situation would usually appear at the end of the season, when the conclusion to the regular season had been set. No team would lose their fighting spirit at the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>Though there might have never been such a case in history, that didn’t stop people from making these malicious guesses. Almost all the reporters believed that there must be something fishy going on what with such an absurd promise. Even Chang Xian. Although he wouldn’t suspect Happy of faking a match, there must be something going on.</p>
<p>The press conference came to an end before the reporters could figure things out. In the end, all the questions were about if Tang Rou could achieve her 1v3 or not, and no one else cared about anything else regarding this match. Even when the victorious Team Radiant came to the stage, the reporters were still discussing Happy among themselves. After it was announced that they could start asking questions, someone stood and asked a very courteous “congratulations to Radiant for winning the match, how did you feel about it” before the reporters went silent.</p>
<p>The reporters were all absent minded and Team Radiant’s players, having come over delighted about their victory, were dumbstruck.</p>
<p>Before the match began, the cheers for Happy wer ever so loud. It was clear that no one was treating them like a new team to the Alliance anymore, but a team far above Radiant.</p>
<p>Radiant hadn’t been at all angry about this. Three All-Stars, just the player lineup seemed much grander than anything Radiant could offer. But so what? It wasn’t as if Radiant had never seen team with three, or even more, All-Stars. It wasn’t as if they had never fought these teams before. When had they ever given up in the face of these odds?</p>
<p>Compared to those powerhouse teams, Happy was nothing, no?</p>
<p>Radiant valiantly received Happy’s challenge. Radiant had never expected to find any breakthrough point in the three All-Stars, but the others, the rookies, became Radiant’s focus.</p>
<p>They had chosen Tang Rou. She was someone who already held an important position in the team, even being placed as the last defender in the group arena. It was clear how much the team trusted and depended upon her.</p>
<p>Against Tang Rou, Radiant had made ample preparations. Thus, from the group arena to the team competition, Tang Rou had been completely within their grasp, burying the 7 points Happy might’ve gotten.</p>
<p>Compared to many other teams, Radiant really wasn’t very strong, but they hadn’t gotten to the point where they could be bullied so easily. This time, using their home advantage, and ample pre-match preparations, they had won a match that many thought hopeless. They were excited and delighted, prepared to discuss their victory at the press conference. Yet, why did they end up ignored like this?</p>
<p>Why would this happen?</p>
<p>The three members of Radiant that attended didn’t understand. They weren’t that famous, and their team wasn’t that powerful, but that didn’t mean they should be ignored like this.</p>
<p>At the same time, at another, slightly later, press conference, things were heated.</p>
<p>The most eye catching match of the round, Samsara’s away game against Tyranny, had just ended.</p>
<p>Countless players, moved by the persistence of Tyranny’s veterans, were wishing them well, hoping that they would be able to get good results in this season, hoping that they would end their pro careers satisfactorily, hoping that they could strike a fierce blow at the Samsara that had shattered their dreams last season.</p>
<p>The result was disappointing.</p>
<p>Team Samsara, challenging Tyranny on Tyranny’s home turf, ended up winning by a significant margin of 8:2. They had only lost two points in the individual competitions, and managed to successively overwhelm Tyranny in the group arena and team competition.</p>
<p>And to think, this was their away game. Samsara was truly terrifying this season. With three rounds over, they had won flawless victories in two rounds, and in the third round, against a strong team like Tyranny, they had managed to win with an 8:2. With a total score of 28 after a mere three rounds, Samsara was still far in the lead.</p>
<p>As for Tyranny, at the end of three rounds, they had a total of 19 points, sliding them right back to number eight, the last position for the playoffs.</p>
<p>This opening no longer had an iota of the momentum they had displayed last season. Everyone’s worries for Tyranny seemed to have become reality. With another season over, how much had the state of Tyranny’s veterans slipped? After last season’s close call, had these veterans’ morale truly been unaffected? It seemed, with the loss they suffered against Samsara on their home turf, that the things that people were unwilling to see were really occurring.</p>
<p>Was Tyranny truly no longer capable of recreating its past strength? Many fans had already begun crying in the audience after seeing the result of the home game against Samsara.</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, the air was heavy. Tyranny was comprised mostly of veterans. Many of the reporters offstage had accompanied them for years. Even for those who hadn’t, after these weeks of appearing in one another’s sight, asking questions, they had manage to grind out some form of acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s upset represented the decline of the era they pursued. Each veteran reporter sympathized with this sorrow. At a time like this, it was mostly newer reporters that would tactlessly touch upon sensitive questions for Tyranny to answer.</p>
<p>“In the new season, Tyranny has already fallen behind Samsara’s immense lead by 9 points in three rounds. When faced with them directly, Samsara managed to claim 8 points in their away game. What will Tyranny do next? Will there be any changes made?” A reporter asked.</p>
<p>Make changes?</p>
<p>What changes?</p>
<p>Switch out the old for a newer generation and let that era truly become buried in the past?</p>
<p>“Tyranny will, indeed, make some adjustments.” Onstage, Vice Captain Zhang Xinjie answered this question.</p>
<p>“Oh? Could you give us some idea of the specifics?” The reporter asked.</p>
<p>“We will probably introduce some rotation, in order to make the team operate more efficiently,” Zhang Xinjie replied.</p>
<p>Rotation! Did that mean that Tyranny was preparing to switch in newer players? Did that mean that the players of that era would be truly leaving the stage?</p>
<p>The reporters gazed at the stage. When Zhang Xinjie spoke, Han Wenqing’s and Lin Jingyan’s expressions were as calm as ever.</p>
<p>“Then, what is Tyranny’s goal this season?” someone asked. Usually, in this sort of adjustment period, the team wouldn’t set their goals too high.</p>
<p>“Tyranny only ever has one goal: to be the champions,” Han Wenqing answered.</p>
<p>Was this the stubbornness of veterans? The reporters sighed.</p>
<p>“In the next round, Tyranny will face Happy. Is there anything you want to say?” Someone suddenly thought of such a question. Happy, Ye Xiu, this was a person from the same era as Tyranny’s veterans. Though Happy had another old player, Wei Chen, his pro career was short; most people saw him to be a substitute or switch, rather than a core member of Team Happy.</p>
<p>“We hope to give everyone a spectacular match.” A very standard answer.</p>
<p>“Happy’s player, Tang Rou, said that she would achieve a 1v3 within the next five rounds or else leave the pro circle. As their next opponents, what are your thoughts on this?” Tyranny’s match had ended late so the press conference was naturally later as well. The information regarding Happy’s press conference had already travelled here, and this sort of interview style was something reporters were good at.</p>
<p>“Good resolve. If you want to try to accomplish that against Tyranny, then give us all you’ve got!” Han Wenqing said.</p>
<p>“Will Tyranny make any arrangements against this?” a reporter asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Zhang Xinjie answered with one simple word, but the reporters believed him wholeheartedly. Tyranny’s strategist was Zhang Xinjie. Why would this strict and careful Cleric change the rhythm of the team just because of a bet?</p>
<p>“I give my early wishes that Tyranny earns a good result next round.” After saying that, the reporter ended his questioning. The other reporters soon followed up, most asking about the switching Tyranny would do.</p>
<p>After Tyranny and Samsara’s match, the third round came to a close.</p>
<p>In this round, apart from Happy versus Radiant and Tyranny versus Samsara, two other unexpected conclusions cropped up.</p>
<p>Team Parade had taken down Tean Royal Style, who seemed a little stronger than them, by 7-3 in an away game.</p>
<p>Team Hundred Blossoms, on the other hand, was defeated on their home turf by 301 Degrees with a 3-7.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the strong teams all won as expected, with scores above 7-3. After three rounds, the situations of the various teams were much clearer than they’d been after two rounds.</p>
<p>Chapter 1172: Happy’s Problem of Coordination</p>
<p>The third round of Season 10 finished.</p>
<p>Samsara stood at the top of the point rankings with 28 points. Blue Rain and Tiny Herb were second and third respectively with 27 points. Wind Howl was fourth with 26 points. From the point rankings, these four teams made up the first tier. After them was the fifth place team Misty Rain with 22 points. Thunderclap was sixth with 21 points; their start was looking quite good. In seventh was Void. After a mediocre first and second round, they finally pulled off a dominating performance in the third round, winning against Seaside with a perfect 10 points, placing them at seventh. At eighth place was Tyranny with 19 points. Compared to last season, Tyranny had taken the largest step back.</p>
<p>Outside of the currently qualified playoff teams, the points dropped. Team 301 was at ninth with 14 points, Royal Style at tenth with 13 points. Parade, Happy, and Hundred Blossoms were eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth respectively with 12 points each. Speaking of which, the ranking for these three teams was quite complicated. Usually, if two or more teams had the same number of points, the teams were temporarily arranged in alphabetical order, by pinyin. If two teams had records against each other that season, they would be ranked according to who had the better record. For these three teams, Hundred Blossoms (Baihua) was first alphabetically. However, Happy had won a match against Hundred Blossoms, so Happy should be ahead of them. But in terms of alphabetical order, Happy (Xingxin) should be behind Parade (Hewu).</p>
<p>It was impossible to reach a consensus just from these three conditions. In the end, Hundred Blossoms’ alphabetical advantage was removed and they became the bottom of those three teams. Of course, it was just the start of the season, so it didn’t matter too much. But at the end of the season, when accurate rankings mattered, this type of impossibly muddled situation would usually be decided by an additional match. Using something like alphabetical order shouldn’t decide a team’s final ranking.</p>
<p>After Hundred Blossoms were the lower tier teams, who were all grouped up together. In last place in the relegation zone was Seaside, who had eaten two zeros in two consecutive matches, and currently had a heroic 2 points. Heavenly Swords was in second to last place with 5 points, but the team ahead of them, Miracle (Shenqi), was also at 5 points, only beating out Heavenly Swords (Yizhan) through their alphabetical advantage.</p>
<p>The point rankings as well as the performances of each team in the third round were reported and analyzed.</p>
<p>Happy! Happy again!</p>
<p>In the third round, Samsara and Tyranny was clearly the highlight match. Happy faced a mediocre Radiant, but how come they still made it to the headlines?</p>
<p>The mighty Tang Rou had achieved a 1v2 in the previous round. Why did she lose so badly this round?</p>
<p>Right after this crushing defeat, she claimed that she would achieve a 1v3 within five rounds? And if she didn’t she would leave the pro scene?</p>
<p>Damn, this sister’s so domineering!</p>
<p>Damn, this sister’s so arrogant!</p>
<p>Damn, this sister’s so bold!</p>
<p>Damn, this sister’s so egotistical!</p>
<p>She had a brilliant victory in the second round, but an embarrassing loss in the third round. Yet even so, Tang Rou was still the most followed player in these two rounds. It was just like Wei Chen said. Whether the attention was good or bad, the attention towards Tang Rou was sky-high right now. After the 1v2 in the second round, quite a few reporters had wanted to interview Tang Rou. After the crushing defeat in the third round, even more reporters wanted to interview Tang Rou.</p>
<p>Seeing how popular Tang Rou was, quite a few people started asserting: promotion. This was definitely the media promoting her.</p>
<p>And the Esports Time reporter Ruan Cheng, who had challenged Tang Rou in the press conference and had Tang Rou make such an arrogant claim, had written a long, flowing article in a magazine calling this all a farce. So what if Tang Rou made such a promise? No one could force her to leave the pro scene. As long as her skin was thick enough, she could endure the pressure of public opinion, and she could give herself a classic excuse like “I can’t give up my passion for Glory” or “I’m willing to endure anything for my fans” and so on… As a girl with indisputably good looks, she could definitely win quite some support.</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng’s article generated a huge response. In terms of print media influence, the Esports Time was only slightly inferior to the Esports Home’s weekly issue.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the Esports Time immediately understood after seeing that it was Ruan Cheng’s article. This guy had set his targets on Tang Rou. His article had been written with for a purpose. It was to seal off Tang Rou’s retreat path. Having given predictions for her retreat path, if Tang Rou still went along it, she would undoubtedly be viewed as someone with skin so thick that it couldn’t be saved. She would receive a huge amount of criticism for it. Under this kind of public pressure, it would be hard to imagine what type of person could continue to survive.</p>
<p>After this article, many reporters tried all sorts of ways to reach Happy, hoping that Tang Rou could say a few words about it. However, Happy blocked them all. Tang Rou seemed to have disappeared. She gave no response to the criticism or the support towards her.</p>
<p>These days, Tang Rou was practicing like crazy.</p>
<p>In Tang Rou’s loss against Radiant, the problems showed by Tang Rou were actually Ye Xiu’s two biggest worries for her.</p>
<p>The first problem was that if the match wasn’t enough of a challenge, she was unable to feel enthusiastic about playing and couldn’t bring out her full potential. This sort of mental problem couldn’t be described with numbers. It was an issue borne from Tang Rou’s personality. In the game, she could still win those non-challenging battles because of the huge disparity in skill between the two sides. But in the pro scene, that huge disparity didn’t exist. Facing Radiant’s half-health player, Tang Rou still had to concentrate. However, the situation was very different from when she faced Yu Feng and Zhu Xiaoping. In addition, Radiant studied Tang Rou’s battle against Xiao Shiqin in the Challenger League and developed a strategy specifically to target her. In the end, the half-health Radiant player beat the full-health Tang Rou.</p>
<p>In the team competition, because Tang Rou felt guilty and ashamed for losing in the group arena, she really wanted to win. This sort of mentality ignited her fighting spirit, thus leading to Ye Xiu’s second worry: if her fighting spirit burns too hot, she is unable to exercise restraint.</p>
<p>Both of these two points were issues stemming from her personality. Trying to reconstruct someone’s personality was harder than climbing the heavens. These were something that she couldn’t control. They came and went subconsciously.</p>
<p>The only way to resolve these issues was to improve her skill level.</p>
<p>It was just like in the game. Even if she couldn’t display her full capabilities, she could still win. What she relied on was superior skill.</p>
<p>Understanding this point, Tang Rou focused on being aware of her mentality, while also increasing her practice.</p>
<p>Morning, afternoon, night. Apart from eating, sleeping, and the appropriate amount of exercise, Tang Rou practiced crazily day and night.</p>
<p>“Is this okay?” Chen Guo was a bit worried and asked Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“It’s always good for young people to practice more. The problem is only whether you have the motivation to persevere,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So you intentionally gave her the goal of completing 1v3 within 5 rounds, so she has enough motivation to persist with this high-intensity practice?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“No… I’m afraid that her eagerness to win will go over her head and she’ll win next round. That would be troublesome.” Ye Xiu laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>“Even so, why didn’t you give her more room? Even ten rounds would have been better!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“If I say more, with her personality, what do you think she would do?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Cut it down until she felt like it was right…” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“So if I say too much, she’ll say she won’t need so many rounds and she’ll do it in just one. What then?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Fine…” Chen Guo surrendered.</p>
<p>“But what if, I’m saying what if, she can’t do it. What then?” Chen Guo looked towards Tang Rou, who was hard at work, and whispered the question to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Yes…” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What does that ‘yes’ mean?” Chen Guo was puzzled. Ye Xiu didn’t explain, though. He looked at Tang Rou as well. This guy was pretending like he was being profound again. Chen Guo thought to herself angrily.</p>
<p>While Tang Rou was solving her individual problems, Happy also had other problems to fix. Their loss against Radiant in the group arena could be considered as Tang Rou’s fault, but their loss in the team competition couldn’t be blamed on any one individual. The team competition was fought as a whole. If any one part wasn’t working properly, the other parts needed to take on some of that responsibility. And in the team competition against Radiant, Happy had done a very poor job here, even if there was Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, and Fang Rui playing. When Tang Rou came apart, these three All-Stars failed to properly adjust the team’s rhythm. In the end, Radiant seized an opening and beat them fiercely.</p>
<p>These three All-Stars were unable to adapt to the situation when facing Team Radiant. It sounded hard to believe, but in reality, there was a serious issue between these three All-Stars – they were still getting used to playing and coordinating with each other.</p>
<p>Fang Rui obviously required time for him to grow accustomed to his new Qi Master class. Apart from that, it was his first time playing with Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng. He needed time to get used to their rhythm and their habits. Even Ye Xiu and Su Mucheng, these two Best Partners, needed time to synergize with each other in a high-level competition.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because the two were suddenly unfamiliar with each other after a year of not playing together. It was because Ye Xiu had changed classes.</p>
<p>The unspecialized, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, and the unpredictable skill combinations gave headaches to everyone in the Alliance. None of them were able to keep up with such rapid complex variations.</p>
<p>And “everyone in the Alliance” included his teammates Su Mucheng and Fang Rui.</p>
<p>They weren’t all-class experts. They had never partnered with an unspecialized before. Their situation was actually the same as their opponents. The only difference was that because they couldn’t grasp the unspecialized’s rhythm, they couldn’t properly coordinate with Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>In the first round, facing Samsara’s powerful sweep, there wasn’t enough time for this issue to come up.</p>
<p>In the second round, through the map Broken River, they never really had any direct confrontations facing Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>In the third round, facing the proactive Team Radiant and Tang Rou falling apart, the three All-Stars ran into a serious problem, where none of them were able to coordinate well with one another.</p>
<p>Before even killing any enemies, Lord Grim had dealt a fierce blow to Happy’s teamwork.</p>
<p>“It looks like we need to practice harder too,” Ye Xiu said after carefully reviewing their match against Radiant.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Su Mucheng’s expression was exceptionally resolute. Failing to coordinate with Ye Xiu, how could that be acceptable?</p>
<p>“Damn, I have to keep up with the pace of 120 short cooldown skills. I can already feel my golden right hand crying,” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1173: Intense Practice</p>
<p>After the three All-Star players of Happy carefully reviewed their performance, they began diligently practicing for the team competition. The other teams couldn’t quickly adapt to this Myriad Manifestations Umbrella-wielding unspecialized, the likes of which had never been seen before. Those other teams could only try and gain experience through the meager bits of what was available to them: real battles, recordings, and their own imaginings. But Happy could directly practice coordinating with this umbrella-wielding unspecialized. They could come to understand him, they could grow accustomed to him, they could become familiar with this entirely new and unique class.</p>
<p>In this aspect, Su Mucheng and Fang Rui were at a disadvantage. Tang Rou, Steamed Bun, Qiao Yifan, and even Mo Fan had all interacted with Lord Grim for a much longer period of time than them. This was especially true for Tang Rou and Steamed Bun. No one else knew this kind of unspecialized, but for these two, this was just another class, always fighting right alongside them as they learned this game. They were the fastest to integrate with this unspecialized, and for now, they were the team players that could coordinate with Ye Xiu the best.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan grew up in the normal system, and by the time he arrived at Happy, he already had a very solid foundational and technical strength. Like it was for Tang Rou and Steamed Bun, the unspecialized was an entirely new thing for him to learn and adapt to, but unlike them, he first had to unlearn some of his established preconceptions about Glory. So, although he had also fought for a long time alongside Lord Grim, his understanding was a little bit weaker than that of Tang Rou or Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>Then there was Luo Ji and An Wenyi. Luo Ji was also a blank sheet of paper that could adapt to Lord Grim, but the problem was that his skill level lagged behind, and he had no way of truly fighting side-by-side with Lord Grim. An Wenyi joined a little later, and he suffered from the same problem as Qiao Yifan. He had to unlearn some things in order to adapt to this entirely new class. Furthermore, his technical skill was also lacking.</p>
<p>And then there was Mo Fan. Just getting this solitary hero to coordinate with the team was already an endeavor and a half, never mind adjustment to Lord Grim in particular. The road was slow and long.</p>
<p>And all of these people were still better than Su Mucheng and Fang Rui, who had only officially arrived at Happy this season.</p>
<p>However, the skill, experience, and awareness of these two players was clear for all to see. After they began emphasizing this aspect of their training, their grasp of the unspecialized improved in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Tang Rou was training fiercely, the three All-Stars were training fiercely. The others had no reason to relax, and the entirety of Happy immersed themselves in fierce training. But Luo Ji, who wasn’t with the rest of them and who still had to worry about his studies, couldn’t keep up with Happy’s current pace of training. Because of this, he was filled with anxiety. In comparison, An Wenyi, the other college student here, was much more decisive. This person directly chose to take a leave of absence from school, and devoted himself to professional gaming.</p>
<p>“How did you convince your parents?” Chen Guo had asked him. She felt that, for a student, the greatest obstacle to this kind of decision would be the family.</p>
<p>“I gave them the prize money from the Challenger League,” An Wenyi said.</p>
<p>Calm, rational, accurate!</p>
<p>These were the special traits of An Wenyi, the person whom Ye Xiu had found in-game despite his unexceptional skill.</p>
<p>The entire team was busy, and they invested more time than ever into practice. This made Guan Rongfei restless. He essentially never went outside, but now he often came to the practice room to hover behind Ye Xiu and cough meaningfully. He was anxious to finish research on the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, and he needed Lord Grim’s account card to look at the umbrella. But now that Ye Xiu increased training, the amount of time that the card was in use greatly increased, thus reducing the amount of time Guan Rongfei had to study the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. This made him rather distressed.</p>
<p>This is also why powerhouse teams might make two or even three copies of Silver equipment, to facilitate study in the R&amp;D department so there wasn’t any conflict between them and the players.</p>
<p>But with Happy’s current state and the material requirements for the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, making an extra one was definitely unrealistic.</p>
<p>On days when he couldn’t get the account card to study the umbrella, Guan Rongfei could only spend his time on the other classes. Equipment for the other classes was, for him, much easier than the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. Especially Dancing Rain, whose equipment he had studied and developed for many years now. It was only last season, under the club’s orders, that he had stopped working to raise the equipment to level 75. But now, he once again took up this research. He was so familiar with the equipment that he hardly even needed the account card – his mental visualization was enough.</p>
<p>Another week quickly passed, round 4 was just about to start. Happy was about to fight their second home game, and their challenger was the team that was currently the subject of much gossip, Team Tyranny.</p>
<p>One week of training wasn’t enough to immediately cause drastic improvement. The results of training were silent and invisible steps upward, droplets that gradually accumulated into something significant. But after this week of intense training, at least Happy’s spirits were greatly changed – every player seemed to be shining.</p>
<p>Extra training wasn’t too much of a problem for young people, Chen Guo thought as she looked around at everyone.</p>
<p>But… what about you?</p>
<p>Chen Guo looked at Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>You’re certainly no young person. But to let everyone come together faster, you joined in on the extra training. What kind of impact would such intense training have on a player of his age? Wei Chen, for one, hadn’t kept up with this training pace. This let Chen Guo know that older players couldn’t push themselves this fiercely.</p>
<p>Chen Guo was very afraid. She didn’t even dare ask, because she knew that there was no point in asking. Even if this wasn’t healthy, Ye Xiu had no choice but to do this. Only he could wield the unspecialized. This wasn’t a class for which they could find a sparring partner.</p>
<p>Aside from well-wishes, Chen Guo could do nothing at all.</p>
<p>September 26th.</p>
<p>One day before the the fourth round of the Glory Alliance Season 10.</p>
<p>Happy, unlike other teams, was still intensely practicing. Other teams, on the day before competition, would generally go through lighter practice. The players still played the game, they wouldn’t let their hands get cold entirely, but the lighter practice allowed them to get enough rest and keep their spirits up.</p>
<p>But Happy was still practicing as fiercely as ever. Relaxation time? To them, this had no meaning. Right now, what they needed was to improve as fast as they could. Another day of practice was another day of improvement. Without enough improvement, just taking a break before the match wouldn’t change the match’s outcome.</p>
<p>Chen Guo looked around at everyone in the practice room.</p>
<p>The weather lately had been alternating between heavy clouds and showers, and although the temperature wasn’t high, the humidity made it seem hotter. The two high-power air conditioners in the training room worked incessantly to blow cold air through the room, but many players were still practice until their foreheads were slick with sweat.</p>
<p>They only had to move the mouse and keyboard, which meant that they were really only moving the parts of their body below the shoulder joint. They weren’t running, they weren’t fighting against some obstacle with their bodies. And yet they still managed to sweat from their exertion.</p>
<p>The tapping and clicking of the mouse and keyboard sounded like a curtain of beads falling to the floor. This tense and high-level atmosphere in the training room made Chen Guo feel like it was difficult to breathe. But she stayed and watched for a bit longer before quietly leaving the room.</p>
<p>When she went downstairs to the internet cafe on the first floor, she heard someone ask at the front desk, “Is Ye Xiu here?”</p>
<p>She went down a few more steps, and saw the panicked and terrified face of the young woman collecting money at the front desk. And then there was a shout in the Internet cafe, and then another, and another.</p>
<p>Chen Guo hurried down the staircase and saw the four people standing in front of the counter. And countless guests in the internet cafe had already left their computers and flocked over.</p>
<p>Han Wenqing, Zhang Xinjie, Zhang Jiale, Lin Jingyan… Team Tyranny, the four titans who had been named the Four Heavenly Kings, were standing right in front of the counter of Happy Internet Cafe.</p>
<p>The Internet cafe guests who recognized them instantly went wild.</p>
<p>This sort of thing absolutely never would have happened two years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, Chen Guo was still a diehard Excellent Era fan, and Happy Internet Cafe was still a favorite gathering place for all Excellent Era fans. If a Tyranny player appeared at the front desk then, who could predict what the impulsive fans would do?</p>
<p>But now, things were different. Ever since Chen Guo turned from a fan into a hater, Happy Internet Cafe was no longer filled with such passionate Excellent Era fans. Those that still came were calm and rational fans. They wouldn’t necessarily do anything if they saw a Tyranny member.</p>
<p>And now, many of those that came to Happy Internet Cafe were fans of Happy itself. This forced Chen Guo install another door between the stairs and the second floor, and in the back of the building, there was now a direct exit from the second floor.</p>
<p>Fans were wonderful, but they could also be such a hassle!</p>
<p>After Su Mucheng officially transferred to Happy, there was even some shameless male who, carrying a large bouquet of flowers, said that he wanted to express his love to Su Mucheng. Chen Guo was so scared that she almost called the police. At these times, having the more delinquent-like Wei Chen and Steamed Bun around actually made Chen Guo feel a little safer.</p>
<p>In an instant, the Four Heavenly Kings of Tyranny were surrounded by energetic fans.</p>
<p>To openly appear in an Internet cafe, these four Gods were too careless.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one did anything excessive. Most people just came to watch. Some of the braver ones went up to ask for an autograph, or even begged for a selfie, until Han Wenqing furrowed his brow and everyone scattered back to their seats.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chen Guo realized that there had to be a reason that these Tyranny veterans dared to show up in an Internet cafe. Han Wenqing had the Intimidate skill, with no cooldown. He could activate it whenever he wanted.</p>
<p>This was the first time Chen Guo had met up-close this ten-year captain of Tyranny. Two years ago, this was the painful enemy! Excellent Era’s potential fourth consecutive victory was lost to this person, which had earned her hatred.</p>
<p>But now, Excellent Era had faded into the mists, and Chen Guo did truly respect the fighting spirit of these Tyranny veterans. When they lost to Samsara last season, she almost teared up for them.</p>
<p>When interacting with people in the pro scene, Chen Guo often had to remind herself to project a strong aura. She, after all, was the boss of Happy. But in front of this Han Wenqing, Chen Guo felt that she shouldn’t try to act all high and mighty in front of him. This was a person who would directly kick out the boss from the training room.</p>
<p>“You’re looking for Ye Xiu?” Chen Guo went up to greet them.</p>
<p>“Yes. Is he here?” Han Wenqing asked.</p>
<p>“Follow me!” Chen Guo led the four upstairs, and took the opportunity to study the other three Gods. Zhang Xinjie, hair and clothing immaculate, wearing his glasses. When he stared straight ahead, he would never let his gaze wander to the sides. Zhang Jiale, a spirited and energetic figure, yet revealing a hint of melancholy. Was it because of too many second-place finishes? Chen Guo couldn’t help but wonder. Lin Jingyan, the former number one Brawler, didn’t have that delinquent aura that Wei Chen and Steamed Bun had. He was a very refined person, and when he saw Chen Guo looking at him, he even smiled and inclined his head.</p>
<p>Chapter 1174: A Casual Greeting</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu, there are people looking for you!” Chen Guo pushed open the door of the practice room. She was a bit excited to see the expression on Ye Xiu’s face when he saw these four Gods suddenly appearing here.</p>
<p>“Who?” But to her disappointment, Ye Xiu didn’t even look up.</p>
<p>“Me.” Han Wenqing didn’t let Chen Guo introduce him, he just directly spoke.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“Match,” Han Wenqing said.</p>
<p>“The match is across the street,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>The atmosphere instantly grew cold.</p>
<p>The match was tomorrow. Tyranny had clearly arrived in City H a day early to rest and adjust their condition before the match.</p>
<p>“Everyone, feel free to take a seat!” Chen Guo had to try and diffuse the tension, inviting the four to sit on the sofas near the wall of the practice room.</p>
<p>“Practicing hard?” But Lin Jingyan didn’t sit down, instead coming over to watch Happy practice.</p>
<p>“Do you have any dignity? Trying to sneak a peek at our practice?” Ye Xiu finally lifted his head, giving Lin Jingyan a disdainful look.</p>
<p>“Is this sneaking?” Lin Jingyan ignored him and stubbornly continued to look.</p>
<p>Right at that moment, Fang Rui happened to mess up.</p>
<p>“Haha, feeling the pressure from behind you?” Lin Jingyan laughed.</p>
<p>Fang Rui turned around and gave him two middle fingers.</p>
<p>“You changed classes pretty well!” But now Lin Jingyan stopped with the joking tone, and spoke sincerely.</p>
<p>“It’s alright!” said Fang Rui.</p>
<p>The two fell into silence.</p>
<p>Former teammates, the number one Brawler and the number one Thief, the famed Criminal Partners, now both abandoned by their team. No matter how honorably they left, it would never be enough to make up for their feeling of loss. And now, one went to Tyranny to persist with the little light he had left, while the other came to the newly-formed Happy, changing classes to strengthen the team. Although they were no longer teammates, the goal toward which they strove was still the same. Now, they would face off against each other onstage. They could no longer strive toward this shared goal together. It was inevitable that one of them would lose.</p>
<p>With Fang Rui’s practice interrupted, the team coordination practice could only stop as well. Ye Xiu stood up and looked at the four of them. “Did you need something?”</p>
<p>“Nah, we’re staying nearby. We figured we’d come walk over and take a look.” As Zhang Jiale said “walk,” he himself was walking around in a circle around Happy’s lineup of computers, finally stopping next to Ye Xiu. He looked at Ye Xiu’s character Lord Grim, who was still onscreen. Lord Grim, the character that had caused so many headaches for the Gods, big and small, of the the pro circle.</p>
<p>“Hey, let me try your little toy here,” Zhang Jiale said, trying to squeeze into Ye Xiu’s seat.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have any dignity? You also want to peek at our equipment stats?” Ye Xiu, of course, didn’t give him any room.</p>
<p>“Haha, what secrets do you still have to hide? The stats have long been figured out already,” Zhang Jiale said.</p>
<p>The stats of Silver equipment weren’t displayed, but for a long period of time, Lord Grim had worn one Silver and twelve Orange equipment. A character’s overall stats were displayed, as were those of orange equipment. With the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella as the only variable, it really wasn’t difficult to deduce its stats.</p>
<p>“That was before, now we’ve levelled up, do you need us to tell you that too?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Really? 75? How sharp, let me look.” Zhang Jiale was still trying to force his way in. If talking about rules, his doing this was extremely inappropriate. Silver equipment were the secrets of all of the teams, no one would ever try to insist on seeing them. Zhang Jiale was taking advantage the fact that he was familiar with them, plus Happy with its grassroots origin didn’t have a very serious atmosphere, so he could struggle like this.</p>
<p>“Go away, go play over there.” Zhang Jiale was pushed away once and for all, and he could only bitterly give up. Watching him, Ye Xiu was all sorts of speechless. “Don’t tell me you’re really here to spy on us! For those sort of methods, we’ll have to call the police.”</p>
<p>“Call the police? How embarrassing is that?” Steamed Bun jumped up. He grabbed a bag of drinks from under the table and swung it around in circles, instantly creating a fierce meteor hammer.</p>
<p>“Guys, can you stop!” Chen Guo yelled, exasperated and feeling the beginnings of a headache. Normally, these Gods were all glittering and glamorous, and she couldn’t help but worship them sometimes. But now that she thought about it, not a single one of them was older than herself.</p>
<p>With Chen Guo’s scolding, the practice room quieted down.</p>
<p>“So what did you come here for?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while. We thought we’d come see you,” Zhang Xinjie answered. When Chen Guo had gestured toward the sofa, in the end Zhang Xinjie was the only one to neatly sit down, and now he politely gave a response. This made Chen Guo feel that he was the only good person here.</p>
<p>“How about it, it’s not bad here, right? Anyone want to come over? Our boss is right here, if you make a good plea, then maybe in the winter transfers you can hop on this championship bus,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You’re really aiming for another championship victory,” said Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>“Who isn’t?” Ye Xiu said, before adding, “Oh, you’re not. You’d have to get rid of that ‘another.’”</p>
<p>“You bastard!” Zhang Jiale cursed. Just in this room, there were many people who had never won a championship – Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, Lin Jingyan, none of them had. But Ye Xiu specifically attacked him, to mock his four second-place finishes, of course.</p>
<p>It was said that you shouldn’t expose or attack someone’s shortcomings, but because everyone here was friendly with each other, sometimes shortcomings were attacked like this. It was just like how Zhang Jiale insisted on looking at the equipment, which would be unacceptable in other contexts with different people. But the problem was, not only did he fail to see the equipment, he was still ridiculed by Ye Xiu. Zhang Jiale was rather depressed.</p>
<p>“If you’re not here for anything serious then hurry up and leave, stop disrupting our practice.” Ye Xiu started waving his hands to get them to leave.</p>
<p>“You’re still practicing even now?” Zhang Xinjie furrowed his brow. To someone like him, who always maintained the strictest of practice schedules, practice the day before a competition was unthinkable.</p>
<p>“What do you understand!” This was what Ye Xiu said to this Glory Master Tactician, a man that really understood quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinjie didn’t retort. He stood up and said, “It looks like your team still has areas that need urgent improvement!”</p>
<p>Chen Guo gulped. Just from this one little clue, he was already able to make such a guess. This “only good person” was in reality quite terrifying!</p>
<p>“Not used to playing with unspecialized?” Zhang Xinjie looked at Su Mucheng and Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve guessed it, what else is there to say,” Ye Xiu said, helpless.</p>
<p>“I hope that we’ll have an exciting match,” Zhang Xinjie said.</p>
<p>“We will,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“See you onstage tomorrow.” Han Wenqing left this final statement, and the four Tyranny players departed.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling dizzy. They seriously just passed by to come say hi? Don’t they have anything better to do?” Seeing the four leave, Ye Xiu sighed.</p>
<p>“They completely guessed our current condition.” Chen Guo thought about Zhang Xinjie’s careful expression, and she shivered at how accurate his judgment was.</p>
<p>“It’s not hard to guess,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“So now what?” Chen Guo asked.</p>
<p>“We honestly don’t have much hope of winning the team competition. We’ll focus on getting the individual battles.” As Ye Xiu spoke, he glanced at the time. “It’s about time, let’s take a look together at our opponents for tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Are we chasing them back here?” Steamed Bun asked.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Ye Xiu didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Aren’t they our opponents tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was speechless. Steamed Bun was being himself again…</p>
<p>After that, the entire team went to the strategy room. Tyranny’s match recordings, especially those of the previous three rounds, had already been dug up and prepared. Every day, after doing the intense practice with the rest of the team, Ye Xiu still had to make time to organize all of these materials… Chen Guo deeply felt that they couldn’t continue like this. Wei Chen could help to some extent, but he couldn’t free Ye Xiu completely. Chen Guo could only be grateful that at least now they had Guan Rongfei and Wu Chen. Otherwise, if Ye Xiu had to manage things on those two ends as well, they would have to cut him into pieces.</p>
<p>Managing a pro team really wasn’t easy! During this time, she had been trying to recruit helpers. On the guild side, things were going pretty well. A number of people had been drawn in, giving semi-professional help to run the guild. Even though these people weren’t here, but work done in an online game didn’t require everyone to be in the same place. As long as there was internet, things could be accomplished.</p>
<p>On the R&amp;D side, Chen Guo also wanted to find more help. Her number one targets were the R&amp;D workers of Excellent Era after the team dissolved. From Guan Rongfei, she had managed to obtain the contact information of three of his former colleagues. But when she reached out, she found that these three were still together, and were still at Excellent Era – New Excellent Era!</p>
<p>New Excellent Era had applied to participate in this year’s Challenger League. When Chen Guo checked, they were advancing quite smoothly. Their current roster had Qiu Fei as the core player, and then some former Excellent Era trainees. This season’s Challenger League didn’t have any monster like last season’s Excellent Era; everything was back to normal. Chen Guo casually looked over, and also discovered Team Jade Dynasty, one of the teams they had fought last season. After the entire team had been fired, it seemed like they’d gathered another group of people from who knows where to give it another shot.</p>
<p>At the time, Chen Guo had invited Lin Yi and the others that Jade Dynasty’s boss had directly fired. They had expressed that they would consider her offer, and then there was no more news from them. Chen Guo contacted them twice more, but they were still wavering.</p>
<p>Not until the new season began did Lin Yi call her. He and two of the players from Jade Dynasty ultimately decided to join Happy, working for the guild in-game.</p>
<p>For them to reach this decision now, Chen Guo was quite able to understand Lin Yi’s state of mind. In the end, he still wanted to be a pro player, and this entire summer, he was likely working very hard to try and find such an opportunity. But by the time the new season began, he had been unable to find a team, and so his dream of being a pro player was put to an end. So, he contacted Happy, and became one of their guild workers.</p>
<p>Relative to ordinary players, Lin Yi’s skill at Glory was quite high. For him to be a team captain, he was exceptional in some areas. After he joined, he quickly became Wu Chen’s most effective helper.</p>
<p>With the hard work of these people, Guild Happy’s current development was very stable. On the high-end battlefields, because Ye Xiu and the others were no longer helping, the guild lost its overwhelming advantage. But in all of the various ordinary servers, Guild Happy was up and running smoothly. Happy finally had its own stores of basic materials filling its vaults. What had happened back in the day in the tenth server, with Ye Xiu selling his labor to obtain dungeon materials, would never have to happen again.</p>
<p>Chapter 1175: Tyranny Fanclub</p>
<p>September 27th, Glory Pro Alliance Season 10 Round 4 began, with Happy playing their home game against Tyranny.</p>
<p>The influence of a powerhouse team was incomparable. Although Happy now had a certain amount of popularity themselves, the crowd they could attract wasn’t enough to fill the entirety of Xiaoshan Stadium. Compared to Excellent Era’s glory days, when they’d sell out seats and even one ticket was hard to come by, Happy was still lacking.</p>
<p>But this time Tyranny had come, which drew many spectators. Plus, Tyranny itself had its fans organized everywhere. Many of Xiaoshan Stadium’s seats were filled up.</p>
<p>For a weak team, this was an annoyance of something fortunate. When a powerhouse came, they could generate a lot of ticket revenue. But at the same time, when a powerhouse came, that meant defeat was likely.</p>
<p>For Happy, this was only their second home game, they didn’t have any expectations regarding ticket sales. Even with so many spectators, Chen Guo wasn’t particularly excited. Her focus was all on the upcoming match.</p>
<p>There were many highlights to watch for in this match. There was the confrontation between longtime rivals Ye Xiu and Han Wenqing, there was the former duo Fang Rui and Lin Jingyan, there was Tang Rou’s promise of a 1v3 within five rounds. Unfortunately, although there were so many highlights, this match wasn’t the most beautiful in this round. At the same time, City S’s Samsara was playing their home game against Blue Rain.</p>
<p>A showdown between powerhouses, the television broadcast stations wouldn’t miss any of it. For those who wanted to watch the livestream of Happy against Tyranny, they would have to stream it online.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan Stadium, the away team Tyranny came onstage first. During an official match, the team members all wore their team uniforms. Tyranny, as a powerhouse team, had unusual influence. Throughout the country, their fans had formed their own fanclubs. Whenever Tyranny had a match, the diehard fans that travelled with the team to watch all their matches would contact the fans in whatever city they travelled to, and they would all come to the match together to cheer Tyranny on. Right now, on the west side of the stadium were gathered many Tyranny fans all wearing Tyranny’s uniform, and when their team came onstage, they began wildly cheering and yelling, waving various banners and slogans. Compared to Hundred Blossoms who had come in the second round, their spirit was much stronger.</p>
<p>Although Happy now had quite a few fans, they didn’t have these sort of organized fanclubs. Everyone came to cheer the team individually. In the face of the other team’s powerful momentum with their organization, Happy’s fans suddenly seemed very fragmented. Happy’s home field was about to be conquered by Tyranny.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s players waved to acknowledge the support of their fans, igniting more waves of excitement from them. It wasn’t until the home team came out that Happy’s fans started cheering, temporarily suppressing Tyranny’s spirit. But it was only temporary. The unorganized and scattered cheers were no long-term match for the Tyranny fanclubs, and Happy’s fans had to admit defeat first.</p>
<p>It seemed… they needed to create their own team fanclub.</p>
<p>Seeing all of this, Chen Guo thought back to when she was still an Excellent Era fan and her experiences with Excellent Era’s fanclub. These fanclubs, although initially formed from spontaneous friendships, after obtaining a certain amount of unity and influence, the official club would give them a certain amount of support. Happy could also follow this pattern, but for now, since Happy had only just started, they didn’t have any powerful clubs. During the Challenger League, Tian Qi and the other guild brothers had grouped together quite fiercely, but now unfortunately they weren’t in City H. Building a home team fanclub would progress more smoothly starting from the fans in the city.</p>
<p>The noise of the fans reached a peak when the players of the two teams greeted each other. At this time, the fans would become the powerful backing of their respective teams, giving them momentum from behind. The Tyranny fans, with experience and training, was able to give their team an aggressively powerful momentum at this time.</p>
<p>After the teams shook hands and exchanged greetings, they returned to their player areas. The match was about to begin, and the players for the first battle of the individual round were announced.</p>
<p>Team Tyranny. Player: Lin Jingyan. Character: Dark Thunder, Brawler.</p>
<p>Team Happy. Player: Su Mucheng. Character: Dancing Rain, Launcher.</p>
<p>A faceoff between top-level players at the very start! The crowd went wild. The two players stood from their respective areas, and after a casual greeting, they headed toward the stage.</p>
<p>The experienced players entered the match, and the first battle swiftly began.</p>
<p>A one-on-one map, a village at dusk. It seemed less like a battlefield and more like a scenic view at twilight, slowly revealed by the holographic projection. This was a map with which Su Mucheng was very familiar. She liked the scenery of this map, and because she liked it, she became familiar with it, and once she was familiar, she could use it in a competitive match.</p>
<p>What about Lin Jingyan?</p>
<p>With his former partner Fang Rui, Happy knew all of his secrets. When they were choosing maps, they considered opinions from all sides. Following Fang Rui’s reports, all of the maps they had chosen for today’s match were ones that Lin Jingyan hadn’t studied. Of course, on the other hand, any maps that Lin Jingyan hadn’t studied, Fang Rui wouldn’t have any deep understanding, either. He had grown up under the same training as Lin Jingyan, the only change being that one year when Lin Jingyan had left first.</p>
<p>That year, Wind Howl had made some adjustments to welcome the new core Tang Hao, so they had practiced a few new maps.</p>
<p>“However, these maps were to welcome Tang Hao, who had grown up in Hundred Blossoms. I think that even if they don’t fit Tyranny, Zhang Jiale would probably be familiar with them anyway.” This was Fang Rui’s analysis. It was evident that the effects of a player transfer were complex and far-reaching. Those who thought that Glory was just about hitting and killing had a far too shallow understanding of this game.</p>
<p>So, for the first battle of the individual round, the player Su Mucheng selected a map she liked, Rainfall Village.</p>
<p>When talking about how big a 1v1 map could be, they would talk about this village. It was really an entire corner of a village.</p>
<p>The two characters loaded on the map and the battle began. After circling around a small hut in front of the spawn point, Su Mucheng already saw Dark Thunder ducking around and borrowing the scenery as cover, looking like he wanted to do some strategic maneuvering.</p>
<p>But at this point Lin Jingyan clearly saw Dancing Rain over here, so Dark Thunder stopped ducking around, and boldly walked forward.</p>
<p>“This map really doesn’t have good cover!” Lin Jingyan said in the chat.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng replied with a smiley face.. Of course that was the case. A long-ranged attacker needed the target to exist in their line of sight; it wasn’t good for a Launcher if there was a lot of cover. Su Mucheng chose a map she liked, but of course she would first consider how advantageous the map was to her in a battle.</p>
<p>“Here’s not bad!” Lin Jingyan suddenly sent this message. Dark Thunder, in the afterglow of the setting sun, circled behind a tile-roofed house.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng smiled. Dancing Rain continued to move, and then she lifted her cannon. Power accumulated at the opening, a charged Quantum Bomb.</p>
<p>Dark Thunder, behind the house, was currently looking around. Lin Jingyan was truly rather unfamiliar with this map, and he was currently investigating to see if he could find something he could use to his advantage. He was trying to develop a strategy, he wasn’t in a hurry to directly fight Su Mucheng. As an old veteran, it wasn’t suitable if he always wanted to fight head-on to determine victory. A veteran should use the experience and tactics he had accumulated through the years. Leave the direct confrontations and the hand speed competitions to the youngsters!</p>
<p>As Lin Jingyan studied, he suddenly heard a “biu” sound, short and sharp.</p>
<p>Quantum Bomb!</p>
<p>The sounds of the Launcher’s skills were quite loud, and they all sounded different. Just from the sound, you could distinguish the skill. Not only could Lin Jingyan hear that this was a Quantum Bomb, he could also tell that this shot was charged.</p>
<p>The power of a charged Quantum Bomb simply couldn’t be compared to a direct instant shot. Lin Jingyan hadn’t even figured out where Dancing Rain had appeared and he had no idea which way he should dodge. But ducking and rolling would at least reduce the area of his body that was exposed, and it was certainly better than just standing around and waiting to be attacked.</p>
<p>But Dark Thunder had barely started to roll before the powerful shockwave hit. The wall of that tile-roofed house was blasted into pieces, bricks flying everywhere, a few hitting Dark Thunder. The power of the Quantum Bomb could directly break through walls, and the rolling Dark Thunder was sent tumbling.</p>
<p>“Damn, that’s dizzying!” Lin Jingyan controlled Dark Thunder to stand up, and saw that the Quantum Bomb had directly blown a hole in that wall. Through this hole, he could see the large open doors on the other side of this building. Dancing Rain? Lin Jingyan had no time to see those shadows clearly, for a beam of light shined at that door, as though to swallow it, but in the end it only passed through the doors, and then the hole, directly toward Dark Thunder.</p>
<p>Laser Rifle!</p>
<p>Across the house, Su Mucheng’s attacks were still continuous. Lin Jingyan, who had just been knocked down by that Quantum Bomb, was clearly a bit slow to react to this. He was unable to dodge this Laser Rifle either, and was hit square on, directly pushed back into a pile of hay behind him.</p>
<p>The hay scattered around him, swirling in the wind like snowflakes. Dark Thunder waved his claw and burrowed out of the pile, only to see that Dancing Rain had already gotten a lot closer. She lifted her hand and a brilliant lighter flew toward him in an arc.</p>
<p>Is this still scientific? The throw was this far and this strong, yet the flames of that lighter were as stable as ever.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan cursed silently, but he also knew, the lighter wasn’t the point here, the fearsome thing was the subsequent Heat-Seeking Missile.</p>
<p>Once he accurately studied the path of that lighter, Dark Thunder retreated back, quickly returning to that haystack.</p>
<p>But the path of that lighter wasn’t what Lin Jingyan had predicted. It seemed to fly a bit farther.</p>
<p>It was affected by the wind speed?</p>
<p>At this time, there was no time to ponder scientific principles. Dark Thunder retreated further.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Dark Thunder was instantly surrounded by roaring flames. When that lighter landed, the Heat-Seeking Missile hadn’t even arrived yet. The hay was ignited first.</p>
<p>Suddenly surrounded by fire, Lin Jingyan was clearly stunned for a moment, his controls a bit slow. Dark Thunder was just a few beats slow in escaping from the field of fire, and he was hit by the Heat-Seeking Missile.</p>
<p>The mushroom cloud rose into the sky, and the thick smoke again enveloped Dark Thunder.</p>
<p>Chapter 1176: Starting to Falter</p>
<p>They’d only been attacking for a short while now, only three attacks had been used, but the beautiful rural scenery had already gained a broken wall with a gaping hole, and an inferno of flames, and a rising mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>The sunset, the quiet evening beauty, was gone in an instant. The sight of Lin Jingyan’s Dark Thunder pathetically crawling out of the thick smoke only added more tragedy to the setting.</p>
<p>But not all was lost. Dancing Rain continued to follow him with her attacks, and Dark Thunder had to jump this way and that to try and hide. Not long after, the map scenery was destroyed even further. This setting was beautiful, but the Launcher was a force of destruction upon this map. And this was a map that Su Mucheng liked…</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan didn’t even have the strength to complain right now. He was at far too much of a disadvantageous situation right now, and as he looked around, he couldn’t find a single suitable place where he could hide and catch his breath. In the face of a Launcher’s firepower, everything on this map might as well be non-existent.</p>
<p>What a weak little village!</p>
<p>This was the only lament Lin Jingyan had left.</p>
<p>Was he going to just lose like this?</p>
<p>There was no way for Lin Jingyan not to think like this. If he lost, the media, the reporters, the commentators, the players, countless people, would they all once again start pointing at his old age?</p>
<p>Do I need your gossip? I know my own condition better than anyone else. Old age? Yeah, right! I’m not even thirty yet, okay?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan had a very gentle and warm personality. In the face of all sorts of provocative questions, he generally wouldn’t have any sort of aggressive response. But no response didn’t mean that he didn’t have any opinions. Lin Jingyan felt that he was still fine, that he could still fight.</p>
<p>But could he really still fight, or… or was he just unsatisfied, and motivating himself to make this sort of assertion? Sometimes Lin Jingyan himself was unclear, but he still believed in the feelings he had during a match.</p>
<p>This match was extremely difficult. But this was absolutely not because of his age.</p>
<p>On this map, Su Mucheng’s offense was extremely coherent. All of the map’s features could be used to help her attack. And Lin Jingyan wasn’t very familiar with this map. But even if he were, it wouldn’t have helped much. By now, the features had basically all been destroyed.</p>
<p>It was definitely because of that kid Fang Rui, Lin Jingyan could guess. But this sort of “selling out” was very logical, and while in Tyranny he had also given lots of reports about Fang Rui, possibly even more than what Fang Rui had revealed about him. After all, he had watched Fang Rui as he grew up, all the way from when he was a baby rookie switching classes and finally settling on a Thief. More could be seen when looking down as opposed to looking up.</p>
<p>Was there really nothing he could use to change this situation?</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan hadn’t given up yet. He used the Glory knowledge he had accumulated over eight years.</p>
<p>Thick smoke, thick smoke, thick smoke…</p>
<p>Thick smoke covered the areas the Launcher had destroyed.</p>
<p>And then, the wind direction on this map…</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan studied his surroundings. Behind him, the Launcher’s cannon shots were loud as Su Mucheng chased him closely.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan hadDark Thunder duck through a cloud of smoke. It was much like the effect of a Smoke Bullet; once Dark Thunder entered, he couldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng immediately adjusted Dancing Rain’s position.</p>
<p>Over here, a line at 2 o’clock… Lin Jingyan calculated, and continued to move Dark Thunder.</p>
<p>Still nothing?</p>
<p>Su Mucheng had Dancing Ran increase the angle,, but Dark Thunder was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Next, I can walk over here… this wall was half-exploded, a bit low, if I duck down… no, I’ll be exposed. Too bad I don’t have the Gunner’s Slide Kick! Alright, I’ll have to be a bit wasteful…</p>
<p>In a place where there was no target at all, Dark Thunder suddenly used a Tyrannical Chain Punch.</p>
<p>This skill was used to press an opponent onto the ground and flatten them. Naturally, there was a forward charge movement to throw the person. With this throwing animation, Dark Thunder passed over the wall as as though he were crawling.</p>
<p>Then over here…</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan continued his careful calculations.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng was surprised to realize she’d lost Dark Thunder’s position.</p>
<p>He just vanished right from under her eyes? Su Mucheng didn’t know where he was, so she could only look around randomly.</p>
<p>The audience had the greatest clue. The omniscient view of the battle showed them that Dark Thunder was currently circling around to the back. But the path he chose to get there, how come Su Mucheng couldn’t discover him? Even though the screen displayed Su Mucheng’s camera view, you needed to be able to visualize on your own to understand what was going on here.</p>
<p>Under his patient persistence, Lin Jingyan finally succeeded in circling around.</p>
<p>The audience let out some gasps. Even the home fans were feeling a little moved. And the Tyranny fans were shouting and cheering like crazy, as though they had just won a grand prize.</p>
<p>But even if he had successfully circled around, Lin Jingyan still had a ways to go! Even if he managed a beautiful sneak attack, that didn’t necessarily mean he could close the gap between himself and Su Mucheng for good.</p>
<p>He had spent too long being attacked in the beginning! Lin Jingyan understood this clearly. This opportunity now had been difficult to come by, so he treasured it. Carefully and silently, he moved Dark Thunder forward.</p>
<p>Powerful Knee Attack!</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan finally launched his offensive. Dark Thunder, who had vanished from Su Mucheng’s eyes for so long, suddenly appeared, but he was already behind Dancing Rain’s body. The knee hit right at the center of Dancing Rain’s back. After that attack finished, he followed with a Brick, knocking Dancing Rain dizzy.</p>
<p>Combo start!</p>
<p>One hit, two hits, three hits…</p>
<p>The system’s combo counter jumped upward as Lin Jingyan fought meticulously. The veteran maintained the precision and accuracy of his controls. Although his hand speed had slowed, it was now more stable.</p>
<p>To directly take down an opponent with one system-counted combo attack was very unlikely. A pro player might be able to do it when fighting an ordinary player, but in an equal fight, there was no way to play so gorgeously.</p>
<p>So, false combos were created. When chaining attacks together, the usefulness of false combos couldn’t be disregarded.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan’s ability to execute false combos was also quite significant. The true combo had already been interrupted twice, but with a precise false combo attack linked on, he was able to continue attacking.</p>
<p>Slap, Uppercut, Sand Toss, Tiger Flips the Mountain, then toss a Molotov Cocktail…</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan continuously adjusted his attack method.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But in the gap between the Sand Toss and the Tiger Flips the Mountain, Dancing Rain suddenly fired a shot.</p>
<p>The powerful recoil changed Dancing Rain’s position in the air. But the Tiger Flips the Mountain also came very quickly, and the swinging arm headed toward Dancing Rain in midair.</p>
<p>A grenade flew from Dancing Rain’s hand.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan ignored it. He wouldn’t give up his currently ongoing offensive just to dodge this attack.</p>
<p>Tiger Flips the Mountain must stop her!</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan grit his teeth. With a swipe of his mouse, Dark Thunder’s hands advanced swiftly.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The light of the grenade swallowed Dark Thunder whole.</p>
<p>He missed… In the end, the Tiger Flips the Mountain hit nothing but air. The grenade hit Dark Thunder, and Dancing Rain’s next attack landed as well, beginning the counterattack.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan felt a twinge of sadness in his heart.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been able to stop it?</p>
<p>If this was before…</p>
<p>Yes, to be suppressed by Su Mucheng at the start of the match wasn’t because of his age. But this time, he failed with this Tiger Flips the Mountain, precisely because his reaction time and his speed were falling…</p>
<p>Uppercut, Sand Toss, then Tiger Flips the Mountain… Had he already fallen to the point where he would leave an opening with this combo?</p>
<p>To realize one’s inability during a live match was truly a heartbreaking thing. Especially this kind of inability, in an area that couldn’t be improved further. If he couldn’t do this now, he would never be able to do it again. This is what the passing years brought; no one could turn back time.</p>
<p>Dark Thunder was once again beaten down.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan, discovering that his ability was slipping, found his attention divided. He was unable to take back the initiative. In the first battle of the individual round, Su Mucheng won.</p>
<p>The stadium was filled with applause.</p>
<p>The scattered fans could still come together at this time to show their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng came offstage and waved to greet the audience.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyan came offstage and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>This time, if he was criticized again, he truly had no rebuttal.</p>
<p>Was he really starting to falter? Lin Jingyan lifted his head to look at the scoreboard in the stadium. Tyranny: 0. Happy: 1.</p>
<p>It was just one point.</p>
<p>The difference wasn’t so large!</p>
<p>It was still early! Lin Jingyan’s thoughts suddenly cleared. If there was an opening in this combo, then in the future he’d just have to pay attention to it, that’s all. How could he fill this opening, what effect would this opening have when fighting the various classes, would he need to warn his teammates to cover and coordinate in a team battle…</p>
<p>After they went back home, he would just have to study this!</p>
<p>As Lin Jingyan thought to himself, he returned to the player area.</p>
<p>“Your positioning was pretty good.” Zhang Jiale praised him.</p>
<p>“Haha!” Lin Jingyan laughed. It was true, that bit of positioning was pretty good. He had lost some things, but gained some things as well. Perhaps he could no longer accomplish the Uppercut – Sand Toss – Tiger Flips the Mountain, but he could still accomplish this kind of clever positioning.</p>
<p>“Now, watch me!” Zhang Jiale gave Lin Jingyan a thumbs up, and Lin Jingyan responded in kind.</p>
<p>The second battle of the individual round.</p>
<p>Tyranny: Zhang Jiale, using the Spitfire Dazzling Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Happy: Ye Xiu, using the unspecialized Lord Grim.</p>
<p>“Oh hey, it’s you,” Zhang Jiale said, as they shook hands before the battle.</p>
<p>“Scared? Kneel before me!” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“We’ll see who’s kneeling in a bit,” said Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>“Such irrational confidence.” Ye Xiu shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale was a mighty God, what was so irrational about being confident? Ye Xiu’s mockery was baseless.</p>
<p>“Fuck..” In the end, Zhang Jiale just cursed bitterly. Because he was clear that in a 1v1, his chances of winning were indeed not very high.</p>
<p>His Hundred Blossoms style relied on confusing the opponent and hiding himself. But Ye Xiu was the Glory Textbook, and his skill at playing a Spitfire himself was quite high. Compared to others, he could see through the skill composition of Zhang Jiale’s Hundred Blossoms style, and then find the secret door to unravel it all.</p>
<p>There was a reason, after all, that Ye Xiu had been able to break through Blood and Blossoms by himself all those years ago.</p>
<p>But the past was the past, and now was now.</p>
<p>Without having fought, who knew the outcome?</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale shrugged his shoulders and entered the player booth.</p>
<p>Second battle of the individual round, begin!</p>
<p>Chapter 1177: Scared?</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The instant the map loaded, quite a few people in the crowd gasped.</p>
<p>Because the map that Ye Xiu had chosen for this round was the Arena.</p>
<p>It was a map used in game when two people wanted a fast match. It was incredibly simple and bare, a square expanse of flat land.</p>
<p>There were no places for shelter, and the area was also very small. When the two characters appeared, their eyes already met, and it would only take a few steps forward before they were within a Gunner’s attack range.</p>
<p>“You actually chose this map…” Zhang Jiale said in the chat. The meaning of this map couldn’t be clearer. It was a straightforward confrontation, nowhere for the opponent to hide or dodge. Of course, that also meant that you yourself couldn’t hide or dodge, either.</p>
<p>“Heh, scared?” Ye Xiu asked.</p>
<p>Scared? Scared? Scared?</p>
<p>Online and offline, it was this same phrase over and over! Scared, my ass! Zhang Jiale fumed, and in an instant he released smoke and fireworks to surround himself, as though it were a small universe suddenly bursting into existence, sometimes shrinking and sometimes expanding.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t hold back either. Lord Grim rushed forward!</p>
<p>The light and shadows shrouded him, an obstruction and an attack all in one.</p>
<p>Lord Grim instantly turned into smoke. What the lights attacked was only a Shadow Clone.</p>
<p>The real body was already behind Dazzling Hundred Blossoms. Cut-Throat! Light flashed from his hand.</p>
<p>Dazzling Hundred Blossoms rolled and avoided the attack and simultaneously retaliated with a grenade.</p>
<p>Lord Grim didn’t retreat or dodge. With a whoosh, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened up, and the explosion was blocked outside of the umbrella.</p>
<p>The umbrella closed, flames crackled in the air, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella had already become a spear, and Dragon Tooth thrust forward.</p>
<p>Rolling, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was still rolling, and he tossed another grenade of another unknown type.</p>
<p>Lord Grim still didn’t give way, the spear was retracted, a slide-step, a palm thrust forward.</p>
<p>Falling Flower Palm!</p>
<p>The slide-step allowed him to avoid the newly thrown grenade, but Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was now two rolls away, a bit out of reach of the Falling Flower Palm.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a cold light appeared, it was Sword Draw!</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was retracted, this was the ready pose of a Falling Flower Palm, but having the weapon at one’s side, wasn’t that also the ready pose of a Sword Draw?</p>
<p>Two skills. One pose. But because of the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella’s ability to shift between spear and sword, they were completely merged together.</p>
<p>This Sword Draw came faster and more unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The normal way to prepare for a Sword Draw was to notice the sheathed ready pose, but because the Falling Flower Palm pose, it was completely overlooked.</p>
<p>Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was hit by the sword, and blood droplets flew everywhere. Lord Grim took the chance to rush to Dazzling Hundred Blossoms’ side. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was broken apart into two tonfas, one in each hand, and he came at Dazzling Hundred Blossoms with punches and kicks.</p>
<p>Sptifires weren’t good at close-combat, and Zhang Jiale fought for his life to dodge and get free. Finally, he seized an opening, and a grenade hit the ground.</p>
<p>Burst Grenade!</p>
<p>A powerful knockback came out, a force that couldn’t be blocked.</p>
<p>But before this, Lord Grim stepped once.</p>
<p>One step wasn’t enough to escape the blow away effect of the Burst Grenade, but one step could change one’s position relative to the grenade.</p>
<p>One step forward, the shockwaves from the Burst Grenade would hit Lord Grim’s front.</p>
<p>One step backward, the shockwaves from the Burst Grenade would hit Lord Grim’s back.</p>
<p>The damage from an AoE skill sometimes varied by whether or not it hit one’s back. The Burst Grenade did not follow that rule. Thus, the damage and effects were entirely the same.</p>
<p>What was different was that, behind Lord Grim there was no one, but right in front of him was Dazzling Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>Lord Grim was pushed flying by the shockwave, but since he was sticking so close to Dazzling Hundred Blossoms, he immediately hit the other’s body, and so Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was sent flying as well.</p>
<p>“You fucker…” Zhang Jiale wanted to cry. Who knew there were such shameless close-combat tactics?</p>
<p>The two characters were together sent flying. In midair, the Spitfire was still at a disadvantage in close-combat, and the midair Lord Grim was already making his next move.</p>
<p>By the time they were about to land, Lord Grim had already sent out a number of low-level attacks, and ultimately he didn’t let Dazzling Hundred Blossoms land freely. Eagle Stamp, Falling Light Blade, Lord Grim was stomping on Dazzling Hundred Blossoms. And this wasn’t the end, there was still a Punisher, several bullets sent to Dazzling Hundred Blossoms’ head.</p>
<p>The crowd was shocked!</p>
<p>This was the map with which they were most familiar, this was the method of fighting to which they were the most accustomed. But who could fight with such rapid and fierce rhythm like these two?</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale could hold his own in the beginning, but after Lord Grim started close-combat, he was stuck on the defensive and sent into a mess. He’d only dropped that Burst Grenade with difficulty, hoping to send Lord Grim a little farther away, but Lord Grim had managed to take advantage of it, and he was pushed even more closely to Dazzling Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>The following nonstop sequence of an unspecialized’s low-level skills was frankly dizzying. The viewers couldn’t even count the number of skills, they could only watch the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella shifting back and forth, a feast for their eyes.</p>
<p>Attack, attack, nonstop attack. Lord Grim had the advantage all the way. When the occasional attack from Dazzling Hundred Blossoms hit him, it was clearly just his sacrificing a bit of health for a better offensive.</p>
<p>No way, was he really going to kill off Dazzling Hundred Blossoms just like this?</p>
<p>Everyone held this thought in their hearts. And in the end, Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was really killed off just like that.</p>
<p>The corpse fell at the corner of the map. Lord Grim sheathed his blade, opened his umbrella, and lifted it to the air to block the raindrops of blood that scattered down.</p>
<p>“These days, I’ve been training ferociously.” Ye Xiu left this final message in the chat and cleanly exited the battle, collecting the point and leaving.</p>
<p>The crowd was stunned for a long time before they finally reacted.</p>
<p>This battle was already over. This was an entirely one-sided domination. And this opponent was by no means an ordinary person, this was the top God Zhang Jiale. In this battle, the unspecialized class revealed its heretofore unseen dominance, extraordinarily high skill speed and complex variations were used to their full potential. This time it was Zhang Jiale who met this opponent, so what if he were switched with other players? How would they fare? Would they also be ruthlessly beaten up like this?</p>
<p>When Zhang Jiale walked out of the competitor booth, his expression was still a little horror-struck.</p>
<p>Before, he had felt irritation at the difficulty of facing an unspecialized. This time, Zhang Jiale felt terror. That huge assortment of the low-level skills of 24 classes, the feeling of them endlessly striking his body with no opening to break free…</p>
<p>But just because he couldn’t find an opening didn’t mean that there was no opening. It was only because he was unfamiliar, because he lacked experience, that his reaction couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>This battle was pretty good for gathering intelligence, wasn’t it? Zhang Jiale laughed bitterly. This was the only comfort he could take from this. He had actually suffered a perfect defeat. Zhang Jiale shook his head and sighed as he walked offstage and returned to the player area. Over there, Ye Xiu had also just returned. Seeing the other player look over here, Ye Xiu smirked. “Scared?”</p>
<p>Scared scared scared! Fuck off with your scared!</p>
<p>But this time, Zhang Jiale was truly a little scared…</p>
<p>For now, they couldn’t fight this class. But it was alright. After this round, they wouldn’t face him again for several months. The situation then wouldn’t be the same!</p>
<p>Now was now. The future was the future.</p>
<p>Without having fought, who knew the outcome?</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale maintained this attitude. To Ye Xiu’s “scared?”, he shrugged his shoulders and sat back down in his seat.</p>
<p>The second battle of the individual competition was over. Happy: 2. Tyranny: 0, still.</p>
<p>The fans needed morale as well, and their morale generally came from the team’s performance. When the team was low, how would the fans have the spirit to cheer you on?</p>
<p>Zhang Jiale’s perfect defeat destroyed the fans’ morale, and their lagging behind in the points had them in low spirits as well.</p>
<p>At least there was still the third battle, hurry and win a point!</p>
<p>The fans pulled themselves together to cheery Tyranny on. This was an away game, and so the fans were relatively lacking in numbers. Before, their unity and understanding was enough to knock over Happy’s scattered fans. But now, their morale was cleanly killed, and meanwhile Happy was all riled up after such a perfect victory. The atmosphere of the home game was won back. After only a few cheers from the Tyranny fans, they were drowned out by the hollering of the Happy fans.</p>
<p>Round 3. Tyranny’s player: Song Qiying, character: Striker, River Sunset.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A rookie from Tyranny, onstage for the first time, playing the same class as decade-long core player Han Wenqing. And the name of the character he played was from the same line of the same poem as the name of the King of Fighting, Desert Dust.</p>
<p>Was this the successor to the King of Fighting?</p>
<p>The people couldn’t help but make guesses. There were two ways to find successors for core characters. One was to raise someone within the team, and the other was to recruit someone from elsewhere who played the same class.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Tyranny had raised someone to inherit the character. But Han Wenqing was old and strong, refusing to retire, and the person who was supposed to replace him could wait no more.</p>
<p>A pro player only had so many years to shine, and no one would be willing to passively wait and let their time run out. In Season 6, the Striker player who Tyranny had raised to replace Han Wenqing, named Jia Shiming, transferred out of Tyranny.</p>
<p>As it turned out, this was a wise decision. Han Wenqing continued to play from Season 6 to Season 10 now, and was the ace player for all that time. If Jia Shiming had continued to wait, he would have melted on the bench by now.</p>
<p>But after Jia Shiming left Tyranny, he hadn’t managed to earn any big fame.</p>
<p>He had chosen to join Royal Style, and after playing with them for two seasons, he transferred to Void. Right now, he was still on Void, but he still had not made it onto their main roster.</p>
<p>Now it was already Season 10, four years of Jia Shiming’s professional career had gone by, and no one still expected him to make any grand breakthrough.</p>
<p>Many people wondered, this player had been chosen to be a core player for his team, how did he end up without even a spot on a main roster? How did Tyranny pick people?</p>
<p>Even when Zhang Jiale and Lin Jingyan joined Tyranny, people brought up this point as ammunition for ridicule. They said that after Jia Shiming, Tyranny no longer trusted their own eyes when picking people, so they could only taken in powerful Gods that had already proven their strength.</p>
<p>This was only a joke, of course. Tyranny’s training camp was still very seriously raising young and interested players.</p>
<p>Song Qiying was only 17 years old right now. Whether or not he would become Han Wenqing’s successor had yet to be decided for sure.</p>
<p>But as long as he was skilled enough, they wouldn’t need to ask Tyranny for any proof.</p>
<p>How would this rookie’s first battle play out? As they waited in anticipation, Happy’s player had already stepped onstage.</p>
<p>Fang Rui, the master of playing dirty…</p>
<p>Many people were already in mourning. For a rookie, no type of player was more hated.</p>
<p>Chapter 1178: Normal Etiquette</p>
<p>The battle loaded, revealing the map: Magic World.</p>
<p>It was a bit difficult to pin down exactly what kind of world the world of Glory was. There were firearms and cold weapons, there was magic, the Glory world truly encompassed too many things. So, in terms of maps, there was everything from magical dreamlands to a parking lot.</p>
<p>The map that Fang Rui chose was a strange, shifting little world crafted from magic, one of his preferred maps. Lin Jingyan would certainly know this, but Fang Rui wasn’t deterred because of that. He was skilled at many maps, so even if Lin Jingyan told Tyranny everything, they wouldn’t be able to guess which map Fang Rui would use for this match, and they couldn’t specially prepare for every possible map. That was why choosing the map was such an advantage for the home team. Even if the opponent had some understanding of you, it would still be difficult to make any preparations.</p>
<p>The match began, and both characters began to move.</p>
<p>Song Qiying was a rookie that had never appeared onstage before. Aside from age and class, there was no information on him. Although he was only 17 years old, Fang Rui didn’t dare underestimate him. After this season finished, Han Wenqing would have played for a full decade. If he still wasn’t finished within two years, then some scientists should really take him apart for research.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Tyranny needed a new player to step up. And Song Qiying’s age fit quite well. For now, he could play a few matches, gaining real experience and steadily growing up, and in two or three years he could play a big role.</p>
<p>Although Tyranny had made a mistake in the past, there was really no way of underestimating someone who was being raised to be a core player. After the battle opened, Fang Rui opted to lie low as he moved, strategically weaving this way and that as he moved.</p>
<p>On this map were countless magic lights and shadows which were unbreakable. If you touched some of them, you would take damage. Fang Rui knew the distribution of these magic lights like the back of his hand, but if a player was unfamiliar with them, then the battle would become extremely difficult.</p>
<p>In the three individual battles, Happy’s map choices were all very distinctive. Su Mucheng chose a scenic map where the props could all be destroyed, Ye Xiu chose a simple and bare stadium map, and Fang Rui chose a magic map where nothing could be destroyed.</p>
<p>The carefully-moving Fang Rui neared the center of the map. He looked outwards, but he didn’t find a trace of River Sunset.</p>
<p>Was he also strategically moving? Fang Rui found this unexpected. This was Han Wenqing’s successor. Although every player had their own style, it was generally easier to transition if the successor had a similar style to the original. If possible, the team generally hoped that the familiar style of the core player could be passed down.</p>
<p>“Strategically moving? What a personality!” Unable to see his opponent, Fang Rui began his trash talk attack in the chat.</p>
<p>The message was sent, but the opponent didn’t respond. The audience members exchanged looks with each other.</p>
<p>Because they knew, Song Qiying was not, in fact, using any strategic movements. He was heading straight toward the center of the map. He hadn’t arrived yet only because his movement speed was a bit too slow.</p>
<p>Even with no opponent and no obstacles, Song Qiying had River Sunset move slowly, very slowly. The display screen showed Song Qiying’s viewpoint, and everyone could see his camera constantly turning this way and that. But even if you were trying to defend against the opponent, you didn’t need to start this early? It wasn’t like the opponent could instantaneously teleport to any position on the map. For the two characters to meet, there was a minimum amount of time that would have to elapse first. But Song Qiying acted as though he were defending against something and continued to walk this slowly. After Fang Rui launched his trash talk attack, the crowd anticipated his response, but in the end, he didn’t even acknowledge this message, like a stone facing the roaring ocean.</p>
<p>“What’s up, too embarrassed to talk? The rookie’s quite shy, this isn’t like Team Tyranny’s style at all!” Fang Rui continued.</p>
<p>“If there’s no need, then a reply isn’t necessary, it wastes time.” Song Qiying suddenly sent this reply.</p>
<p>“Haha, then how come you just talked? Logically, your message wasn’t necessary, a waste of time!” Fang Rui replied.</p>
<p>“No, this was my explanation of my position to you. After this, meaningless talk will be ignored as stated above,” Song Qiying said.</p>
<p>“Oh really? Then what’s considered meaningful talk?” Fang Rui asked.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>“How is this question not meaningful? If a discussion of what has meaning doesn’t have meaning itself, that’s just too ironic.” Fang Rui was almost talking in tongue twisters, but still, no response.</p>
<p>“My friend, you’re really quite resolute!” Fang Rui still didn’t give up.</p>
<p>“You really won’t say anything?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Looks like I’ll have to think of a meaningful question, then!” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Hm… Did you eat dinner yet?”</p>
<p>The crowd was about to die of impatience. This Fang Rui was only focusing on the trash talk, but River Sunset was already very close to his position, approaching in a roundabout way. Fang Rui had wanted to strategically maneuver around his opponent, but he was the one about to be strategically maneuvered. And he was still trash talking. Spewing this nonsense without losing control, do you think you’re Huang Shaotian or something?</p>
<p>Straight Punch!</p>
<p>River Sunset finally circled around to a position with which he was satisfied. While Fang Rui was happily trash talking, he suddenly unleashed a Straight Punch. River Sunset darted forward and was at Boundless Sea’s side in an instant, a fist flashing out.</p>
<p>But Boundless Sea seemed as though he were long prepared for this. With a roll, he easily dodged this punch, and even typed another word in the chat: Haha.</p>
<p>This guy!</p>
<p>The crowd was speechless. So Fang Rui had detected River Sunset’s movements early on, but he purposely didn’t do anything. He continued to use trash talk to pretend that he was distracted, luring Sunset River to take the initiative to attack.</p>
<p>The Straight Punch missed. Song Qiying knew that Fang Rui had noticed him before. At this moment, when the attack was already started, even a normal player would probably continue to attack and see what they could accomplish. But Song Qiying, after this one attack missed, immediately jumped backwards twice. He didn’t continue to attack, instead taking a defensive stance.</p>
<p>“What’s this, my little friend is a bit of a scaredy-cat? I didn’t scare you that much, did I?” Fang Rui continued to blab in the chat, but in his heart he was a bit alarmed. He knew that Song Qiying was about to ambush him, and so he had prepared to defend against it and launch a counterattack. Once the opponent’s attack missed, he would seize that chance to attack. But in the end, this Song Qiying immediately retreated after missing that one attack, completely throwing off his plans.</p>
<p>Was this guy really that scared, or did he see through my intention? Fang Rui couldn’t help but wonder. Their two characters couldn’t just maintain this three body unit distance without moving, of course. When he saw the opponent retreating, Fang Rui finally decided to attack. Boundless Sea’s fist swung forward with a low-level Qi Bullet. Attack and disrupt, and then follow through.</p>
<p>But River Sunset didn’t dodge this Qi Bullet. He sunk his stance, lifted his chest, left hand protecting his front, right hand bracing his waist, and then after he completed this pose he didn’t move, as though he were a statue. Boundless Sea had already prepared a follow up to the Qi Bullet, but he saw River Sunset just take the bullet and sink into this stance.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Fang Rui suddenly realized what was about to happen and he hurriedly tried to adjust, but the right fist had already swung forward.</p>
<p>A seemingly very ordinary fist, but Fang Rui knew what was about to happen. The attack that Boundless Sea had been preparing was shattered by this one punch, instant proof of its power. And then the punch reached Boundless Sea’s chest, and with a burst of power, Boundless Sea was sent flying.</p>
<p>Emperor’s Fist!</p>
<p>A punch that looked very ordinary, but hid a vast amount of power.</p>
<p>“You little brat!” Fang Rui was normally the one taking advantage of people, but now he was the one made a fool of. He was rather upset, but could the opponent’s attack really be considered taking advantage? It was an upfront and noble punch, was there an attack any more unembellished?</p>
<p>In the end, this unembellished attack became the single thing that broke through Fang Rui’s complex plan of attack, with his distraction, interference, preparation, follow-through, and so on.</p>
<p>One strong can defeat ten clever.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Fang Rui calmed down. He needed to carefully deal with this opponent, study his every movement.</p>
<p>Striker River Sunset, Qi Master Boundless Sea, these two Fighters began to brawl.</p>
<p>In the end, Fang Rui’s skill was a step higher and he smoothly killed River Sunset. But his Boundless Sea didn’t have much health remaining either, only 14%.</p>
<p>When the match ended, Fang Rui let out a relieved sigh, feeling a bit stiflingly hot. This match had not been won easily.</p>
<p>After thinking over this match in the competitor booth for a moment, Fang Rui finally prepared to leave the stage, but then he inadvertently saw Song Qiying standing right at the center of the stage, looking at him.</p>
<p>What’s he doing? Standing in the middle of the stage, is he posing for the cameras? Fang Rui was mystified and continued to walk offstage, but suddenly he saw Song Qiying quickly making his way over.</p>
<p>“He’s looking for me?” Fang Rui continued to wonder, stopping his footsteps and waiting. Song Qiying came over, and extended his right hand.</p>
<p>Fang Rui hesitantly shook his hand, and heard him say, “Thank you Senior for your teachings.”</p>
<p>“Mm.” Fang Rui didn’t say anything, feeling that Song Qiying must have something else to say.</p>
<p>But no, that was it. After he said this, Song Qiying turned around and headed back.</p>
<p>Fang Rui stared after him, dumbfounded. As it happened, the judge came by to check on the competitor booth, and so Fang Rui asked him, “What’s up with this kid?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“What’d he run over here for?”</p>
<p>“Shaking hands and giving thanks, normal etiquette for a match,” the judge said lightly.</p>
<p>Fang Rui blinked. Indeed, it was the traditional etiquette to shake hands before and after a match. But now everyone was much more casual. Typically, they would just shake hands before a match, and shake hands after a team match, and that was it. For the individual and group rounds, they would skip on this post-match handshake, but this kid still came over to shake hands with Fang Rui.</p>
<p>“Did I inspire him in this match or something?” Fang Rui pondered over whether he had done any deep, significant thing in this battle. When he returned to the player area, he immediately complained to Ye Xiu. “This kid, he’s nothing at all like Han Wenqing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ye Xiu nodded. “He’s more like Zhang Xinjie.”</p>
<p>Chapter 1179: A Positioning Expert</p>
<p>The individual competition had finished, and Happy had unexpectedly won all three points. This was a surprising result. But after thinking about it carefully, Happy’s three All-Stars had went on stage in the individual competition, so winning all three rounds wasn’t too crazy. But then again, none of players Tyranny sent up for the individual competition were weak either. Lin Jingyan and Zhang Jiale were both top All-Star players.</p>
<p>But Lin Jingyan just ran around in a circle and then flashed before dying, while Zhang Jiale straight up suffered a crushing defeat. It was actually their new rookie Song Qiying who performed well facing the master of playing dirty, Fang Rui. In that match, it wouldn’t have been a surprise if Song Qiying had won in the end.</p>
<p>Not earning a single point was a somewhat disheartening outcome for the Tyranny fans. They could already imagine how the media would talk about Tyranny, especially Lin Jingyan and Zhang Jiale. There would probably be a few irresponsible people that would grab at the opportunity to question if they were too old to play. Those guys would definitely ignore the fact that Ye Xiu, the person who beat Zhang Jiale, was also an old veteran.</p>
<p>After a short break from the individual competition, the group arena was about to begin. Because of Tang Rou’s promise, the group arena was viewed with even more interest. From the ongoing discussion, this promise had attracted even more attention towards Tang Rou, but it had also damaged her image. Even just a casual remark claiming a 1v3 within five rounds was already too arrogant and egotistical, and putting her professional career on the line only made her claim even more irresponsible. Glory wasn’t played alone. Tang Rou also had a team around her. Everyone could see that the team valued her quite a lot, so even many Happy fans could not agree with her reckless promise.</p>
<p>In any case, what’s done was done. In the group arena, Tang Rou would be the first to go up. The other two would be Mo Fan and Steamed Bun.</p>
<p>It was an assembly of rookies. As for Team Tyranny, their first player would be the helper to the Four Heavenly Kings in the team competition, Qin Muyun, and his Sharpshooter Negative Nine Degrees. Their second player would be Bai Yanfei and his Elementalist Rota. Their final player was their one and only captain during Tyranny’s ten years of history, Han Wenqing.</p>
<p>If Tang Rou wanted to 1v3, she would need to be beat these three opponents consecutively.</p>
<p>Many people didn’t know what type of attitude they should be watching this match with.</p>
<p>If she really did complete a 1v3, it would be proof that her arrogance and ego were not unfounded. That would be truly displeasing.</p>
<p>If she failed to complete a 1v3 and left the pro scene, everyone would feel great, but Happy would have lost a dauntless general. Wouldn’t that be bad?</p>
<p>This type of conflict made them feel annoyed at Tang Rou’s rash act.</p>
<p>The match was about to begin. Even though Tyranny’s failure to earn a single point in the individual competition disheartened their fans, they still cheered them on for the group arena. As for Happy? They had a huge lead, but seeing Tang Rou go on stage, the atmosphere of the crowd turned cold. The cheers for her were sparse and soft.</p>
<p>Chen Guo was very worried. She discovered that this event would greatly damage Tang Rou’s image, even if she did succeed with a 1v3. Compared to how the crowd exploded when she completed a 1v2 in the second round, the crowd this time had become ice cold.</p>
<p>“Why did things have to turn out this way…” Chen Guo sighed. If she could go back to that day, she would have done everything she could to stop Tang Rou from going out to the press conference.</p>
<p>The countdown ticked. Five seconds later, the group arena began.</p>
<p>Despite receiving such criticism, Tang Rou’s style hadn’t changed. As soon as the match started, her character decisively charged towards the center.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we give her some applause? The crowd hesitated. They hesitated the entire time. On the other hand, Tyranny’s fan group became more and more excited as the match progressed until they seized control of Happy’s home stadium.</p>
<p>This time, the unwavering support from Tyranny’s fans didn’t disappoint. Tang Rou, with a 1v3 as her goal, lost in the very first round of the group arena.</p>
<p>The Tyranny fans were overjoyed. They obviously sent down merciless boos towards her. There were even many neutral spectators and a portion of Happy’s fans that booed along with Tyranny’s fans.</p>
<p>Tang Rou came down from the stage amidst the boos and returned to her seat in silence.</p>
<p>“This Qin Muyun needs to be studied carefully,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Tang Rou looked at him.</p>
<p>“Keep working hard!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Tang Rou nodded her head.</p>
<p>Next up was Mo Fan. His one round suspension had been lifted; he and his Deception could come onto the stage again.</p>
<p>Happy’s fans suddenly started livening up. Their treatment towards him was the complete opposite of their treatment towards Tang Rou. Tang Rou had originally been Happy’s most popular player outside of Happy’s Gods…</p>
<p>Chen Guo felt uncomfortable. She glanced at Tang Rou and saw her with her head up. Tang Rou’s eyes were staring at the highlight replay of her fight with Qin Muyun. It wasn’t until the scene shifted to the upcoming match did Tang Rou’s gaze return to the stage.</p>
<p>Qin Muyun, who had beat Tang Rou, didn’t have that much health left. His Negative Nine Degrees only had 11% health left, nearly at red blood.</p>
<p>Despite facing such a frail opponent, Mo Fan didn’t rush over. He moved strategically as always. Qin Muyun also moved strategically. As a result, at the center of the map, neither of them directly appeared. They were all hiding, carefully observing their surroundings.</p>
<p>On the screen, the camera views of both players could be seen, letting the audience know which direction the two were looking at.</p>
<p>From Mo Fan’s view, he had already locked onto the location of Qin Muyun’s Negative Nine Degrees. Afterwards, he slowly started moving.</p>
<p>He’s circling to his back…</p>
<p>Much of the crowd felt quite annoyed. The guy only had 11% health left, yet you still feel the need to sneak to his back? Just charge at him, bring him out, chase him, and kill him.</p>
<p>The opinions of the viewers clearly weren’t being sent to Mo Fan’s mind. Even if they were, it would be a question of whether or not he would accept their opinions.</p>
<p>Mo Fan was outstanding at sneaking behind someone. He quickly traversed in a circle towards Negative Nine Degrees’ previous location. Yes, previous. While he was moving, Negative Nine Degrees had already moved, but Mo Fan didn’t know.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been easy for Deception to find his target, but by the time he got there, his target was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>He had moved according to his predictions. In reality, he wasn’t certain of his opponent’s location either. Not finding his target either meant that his prediction had been wrong or his opponent had moved. Mo Fan didn’t know which one was correct.</p>
<p>Just when he was thinking about what to do next, a sneak attack came from behind Deception.</p>
<p>Qin Muyun had moved away, but he hadn’t gone too far. An important reason for why he picked his new spot was that he could see his previous spot.</p>
<p>His choice wasn’t wasted. While Mo Fan was thinking that he had ran around for nothing, Mo Fan didn’t know that he had already fallen into Qin Muyun’s trap.</p>
<p>Through the scope of his gun, Deception’s head was magnified extremely large!</p>
<p>Snipe! Headshot! Double damage. The powerful impact of the snipe pushed Deception’s body askew. Negative Nine Degrees rushed out and immediately started attacking fiercely. Deception was suddenly enveloped in a rain of bullets. The Sharpshooter’s attacks weren’t as fierce as Launcher’s, and their skills weren’t as handy as Spitfire skills. In reality, most of their skills were simply normal attacks with buffs.</p>
<p>The number of bullets produced from Rapid-Fire, Dual Shot, Scatter-Shot, and other Sharpshooter skills were definitely the champions among other Gunner classes though.</p>
<p>Deception was in a tough spot. This time, Mo Fan didn’t employ his favored strategy of running away and then searching for another opportunity later. Instead, he had Deception directly attempt a counterattack.</p>
<p>However, to counterattack, the first step had to be to break through Negative Nine Degrees’ bullet rain.</p>
<p>Shadow Clone Technique? Smoke Bomb? Substitution Technique?</p>
<p>When an opportunity arrived, Mo Fan used his escape skills. However, to his surprise, he was still unable to escape. Negative Nine Degrees’ attacks were always able to instantly shift to where ever he had just escaped to in pursuit.</p>
<p>“He’s being suppressed that hard?” Fang Rui was astonished. Tyranny’s old generals hadn’t performed well today, but their rookies were giving a frightening show.</p>
<p>“His positioning is extremely good,” Su Mucheng said. She was a Launcher and proficient at a support playstyle like Screen Cannon. With just one glance, she could see the key to Qin Muyun’s complete suppression towards Mo Fan.</p>
<p>Negative Nine Degrees’ position allowed him to cover all of Deception’s options, including the possibilities from Deception’s various Ninja skills. He wasn’t just standing there either. Whenever Deception moved, he would always adjust according to the situation, maintaining his positional advantage.</p>
<p>“He’s a positioning expert!” Ye Xiu concluded.</p>
<p>Positioning experts were especially suitable for playing long-ranged classes. Long-ranged classes had attacks with wider coverage. When melee classes picked spots, what they could attack was only limited to the area immediately surrounding them. When long-ranged classes picked spots, the area that they could cover was on an entirely different level. Very few players were like Ye Xiu, who picked flat maps without any obstructions. In maps with obstructions, long-ranged players with poor positioning skill would find it difficult to bring out their class’s full capabilities.</p>
<p>Qin Muyun was this type of expert though.</p>
<p>After watching Tang Rou’s match and this current one, Ye Xiu could completely confirm it.</p>
<p>“Positioning… Mo Fan is quite good at that too, no?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Mo Fan is an expert at picking static locations. Qin Muyun is an expert at picking spots while moving. The two are completely different,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Then this match…”</p>
<p>“If you can identify the opposing player’s possible movement options, you can make accurate predictions. No matter how great you are at positioning, there will always be dead angles. Thus, after making predictions, the rest is up to reacting to the opposing player. However, Qin Muyun adjusts his position extremely fast. Trying to escape one step at a time isn’t likely. In order to escape, you need to complete it one go. And when you do, you have to be careful that your choice wasn’t read by him or else he’ll just start suppressing you again,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“From what you’re saying, this guy sounds invincible…” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“If you have Mo Fan compete against him in positioning, then yes, he’s practically invincible,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Then what should he do?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Find a way to restrict or interfere with his positioning,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1180: Dumb Method</p>
<p>All attacks began from positioning, and positioning came from choosing a position and moving there. Harassing an opponent and limiting their freedom to move was equal to interfering with the foundations of an opponent’s offensive. This reasoning was very simple.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu had fully analyzed the problem at hand already, but Mo Fan clearly hadn’t realized the key to resolving his current situation. Mo Fan, having specialized in scrap-picking, had honed the skills and awareness required for scrap-picking to an amazing degree. However, his other abilities fell short. After joining Happy, he relied on self-teaching due to his loner personality. Now, he was a registered pro player. His abilities were special in their own way, but Mo Fan was still greatly lacking a lot of theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, Qin Muyun specialized in this sort of foundational skill, which was something easily dismissed by others. No reports had ever highlighted this ability of his. Ye Xiu and the others had also never noticed during their limited preparations. It was only now, at the match itself, that they noticed.</p>
<p>He’s so hard to deal with, I can’t shake him off!</p>
<p>Mo Fan currently had that vague idea. The reason why he was hard to deal with and impossible to shake off eluded him, and he didn’t even think to try and find it.</p>
<p>His thought process was rather simple, just to run and shake him off. Deception kept running, but Negative Nine Degrees was like a personal satellite, always following him and suppressing him with bullets.</p>
<p>“This idiot!” Chen Guo watched anxiously. Mo Fan was currently just challenging Qin Muyun to a contest of movement. If Ye Xiu dared to say that Qin Muyun would be unbeatable at such a competition, then it was clear how large the gap was between the two. If they continued like this, would Deception be defeated by Qin Muyun with this amount of health?</p>
<p>Tang Rou had been defeated in the first round and, to her, this was a huge disappointment, because her goal was to accomplish a 1v3. However, in the group arena, leaving the opponent with 11% health left wasn’t bad. However, Happy’s second player didn’t seem to have any way of dealing with this remaining 11%, and that was no good at all.</p>
<p>“Calm down. He’s not as stupid as you think,” Ye Xiu said, watching the match.</p>
<p>“What?” Chen Guo didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“He’s saving his skills,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Hm? What does he want to do?” Chen Guo didn’t bother guessing and asked directly.</p>
<p>Her answer came in the form of a sudden change in action from Mo Fan.</p>
<p>Attack! A full frontal assault!</p>
<p>Ninjas were designed as a rogue-style class, talented at ambushing and assassinating. Currently, he was acting more like a main DPS, using brute force.</p>
<p>Smoke Bomb, Substitution Technique, Shadow Clone Technique, Storm Shuriken!</p>
<p>One Ninja tool, one disruption skill, one disruption plus movement technique, one projectile. Finding an opportunity, Deception unleashed four consecutive skills. Negative Nine Degrees’ movements were still not disrupted. Mo Fan had never noticed that it was Negative Nine Degrees’ movements that were causing him trouble,, but the purpose of these four skills wasn’t to disrupt his movements.</p>
<p>These four skills were just to create an opening.</p>
<p>Ninja Arts: Shadow Dance!</p>
<p>The four skills were just to create a chance for this powerful skill.</p>
<p>Deception quickly leapt to Negative Nine Degrees’ side. Negative Nine Degrees moved about the encirclement. His precise choice of pathing and positioning were just starting points while on the offensive, but when on the defensive, they were sometimes everything. Negative Nine Degrees was actually able to dart out of the encirclement.</p>
<p>However, it had cost him. His health had fallen even further.</p>
<p>Deception’s offensive didn’t end there. Attack, attack, attack, relentlessly attack.</p>
<p>The health of both sides were dropping. Deception’s might be depleting faster, but Negative Nine Degrees had started with less health.</p>
<p>“What a dumb method!” Ye Xiu exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Chen Guo didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“He’s copying Little Tang,” Ye Xiu explained.</p>
<p>Chen Guo started, and then, when she looked back, she realized something.</p>
<p>Qin Muyun was still that Qin Muyun. When he had fought Tang Rou, he might have won, but it cost him almost 90 percent of his health. It was clear that facing Tang Rou’s style was still very stressful for him.</p>
<p>Mo Fan couldn’t find where the problem lay, but he had watched the previous match. He knew that with this way, he could lower the opponent’s health. Thus, after saving up his skills, he launched a fierce offensive. He might have not be as intense as Tang Rou, but Negative Nine Degrees didn’t have much health left anyways.</p>
<p>So this was the dumb method… As Chen Guo thought to herself, she glanced at Tang Rou who was next to them. Was Ye Xiu’s analysis of how Mo Fan should deal with Qin Muyun for Tang Rou to hear?</p>
<p>In the end, Mo Fan won, but Deception had lost almost half of his health. Compared to Qin Muyun’s 11 percent, Happy had still lost.</p>
<p>Tyranny’s second player Bai Yanfei stepped into the arena.</p>
<p>As a member of Tyranny, you had to be at least a little tyrannical. Bai Yanfei’s Elementalist really shouldn’t be called Rota, but Cannon Tower*.</p>
<p>Elementalists didn’t have as good of an attack range as Launchers, but when discussing AoE, magic won against technology. Out of all the light, dark, fire and ice elements, the character Rota focused on AoE skills. When he charged into the middle of the map and didn’t see Deception, he just unleashed a barrage of attacks onto the map and blasted Deception out of his hiding place before blasting him to death…</p>
<p>Rota didn’t use up much health, but Happy was already at their last player, Steamed Bun. On the field, Steamed Bun had performed admirably, but in the end, he was unable to complete a 1v2. In the Group Arena, Tyranny had won back two points.</p>
<p>The Tyranny fans now really had something to be excited about. They organized their cheers, once again defeating Happy’s home advantage. Next, was the all important team competition. The overwhelming cheers lasted until the lineup for the team competition was announced.</p>
<p>Happy: Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, Qiao Yifan, An Wenyi, Tang Rou.</p>
<p>This lineup seemed to be Happy’s best lineup. Currently, it was the fourth round and Team Happy hadn’t sent out any other players.</p>
<p>Tyranny: Zhang Xinjie, Lin Jingyan, Zhang Jiale, Qin Muyun, Song Qiying, Bai Yanfei.</p>
<p>No Han Wenqing!</p>
<p>When the lineup for Tyranny was announced, the audience was in uproar, including Tyranny’s own fans.</p>
<p>Switching people in and out for the team competition was a common sight, but core players were very rarely switched out. They were core players because they were irreplaceable in the team. The entire team’s strategy revolved around them.</p>
<p>But now, Team Tyranny’s lineup didn’t include their captain of ten years. In the post-match interview after round three, they did say that they were going to introduce some rotation, but no one would have thought it would start from their captain, Han Wenqing.</p>
<p>They had switched in Song Qiying, who played the same class as Han Wenqing. He might have fallen in the individual competition, but he did rather well. He was one rookie that people would be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>Discussions arose. Was Tyranny already transitioning between a new and old core player?</p>
<p>If even Han Wenqing was beginning to back down, then what about Zhang Jiale? Or Lin Jingyan?</p>
<p>The entire stadium was filled with whispers as the players met center stage to shake hands.</p>
<p>“How come Old Han isn’t playing? He afraid?” Ye Xiu asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“Rotation,” Zhang Xinjie replied briefly. Anything he could say had to be true, had to be fact.</p>
<p>“Even core players are being rotated?” Ye Xiu voiced the crux of the problem. Rotation was normal, but rotating out core players was only done when it was necessary. It wasn’t normal.</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business!” Zhang Jiale retorted. Zhang Xinjie didn’t say anything else, silently nodding in agreement to Zhang Jiale’s words. Since it was none of their business, there was no need to explain.</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s fight then!” Ye Xiu didn’t bother to continue the conversation. The members of each team got in place. In the end, Happy, even after their week of specialized training, wasn’t able to defeat Tyranny’s experienced players. With Tyranny’s Master Tactician’s flawless planning, Happy wasn’t able to cause any upsets. In the team competition, Tyranny won against Happy, gaining another five points. After losing all three points in the individual competition, Tyranny won the group arena and team competition, turning the tides and winning Happy 7 to 3.</p>
<p>There was no need to talk of how excited Tyranny’s fans were. As for Happy, disappointment was inevitable, but their spirits weren’t all that low, since after all, Happy’s loss wasn’t too ugly. The only awkward aspect was that Tang Rou, who had said she would complete a 1v3, had been defeated in the very first round. However… Tang Rou wasn’t very well liked among Happy’s fans either recently. Most people didn’t mind seeing her fail. Not many people would feel sorry about this.</p>
<p>In the post-match interview, most of the questions were about the 1v3, as expected. Tyranny replied with the attitude they always had and showed their support to Tang Rou’s promise. This answer clearly wasn’t something the media wanted. Currently, very few media outlets were on Tang Rou’s side. The more mockery they could get from other team, the better.</p>
<p>In Happy’s press conference, Tang Rou didn’t attend, but they couldn’t escape these sorts of questions. However, the reporters really stood no chance against the few that attended. Especially that Wei Chen, who didn’t even play during today’s match, spewed out words at the press conference he somehow got to attend. The questions surrounding the 1v3 had been somehow swerved off topic to the Alliance of the past. He had rambled for ten minutes and the reporters were all at a loss…</p>
<p>Happy and Tyranny’s match had its spectacular moments, but nothing that could really be written about. It was Tyranny, with their rookie replacing their core player captain in their team competition, that became the center of discussion.</p>
<p>The most popular match of the round, Blue Rain versus Samsara, had finished by then as well. Blue Rain, challenging Samsara in an away game, didn’t manage to halt Samsara’s momentum in the end. The final score was set at 3 to 7. Blue Rain had gained a point in the individual competition and two points in the group arena.</p>
<p>In these two consecutive rounds, one home game, one away, both against the powerhouses of the Alliance, Samsara had truly been tested and passed these tests. Who could stop Samsara’s advance? This became a hot new topic. Tyranny had fallen, Blue Rain had fallen. Who was next? Tiny Herb? Or Wind Howl?</p>
<p>Chapter 1181: The Demonic Journey to Championship</p>
<p>Although Samsara’s performance was as strong as ever, on the points rankings after this round, they slipped down two places. Tiny Herb, who had originally only lagged behind by one point, won 9 to 1 against Miracle and surpassed Samsara by one point. Wind Howl, who was originally behind Samsara by two points, had swept Bright Green 10 to 0 and were also now one point ahead of Samsara. Because of their alphabetical advantage, Wind Howl (Huxiao) was currently in the lead. Tiny Herb (Weicao) was in second with the same number of points, 36, and third place was Samsara with 35.</p>
<p>After losing in their away game to Samsara, 3 to 7, there was a bit of distance between their 30 points and the first three places. Misty Rain had 30 points as well, but lost alphabetically (Yanyu) to Blue Rain (Lanyu) and were currently in fifth.</p>
<p>Sixth place Tyranny was now a full ten points below the first place. Although their 7-3 win against Happy wasn’t terrible, the fact that they’d gotten a big fat 0 in the individual competition was still snatched up by the reporters looking for a topic of interest.</p>
<p>There were two other teams also at 26 points, Thunderclap and Void. This round, Thunderclap played an away game at 301 Degrees, and in the end they tied at 5 to 5.</p>
<p>This result happened when one team won all of their individual battles, and the other team won 5 points in the team competition. This result was relatively rare. The individual battles were split into the individual competition and the group arena, and those 5 points were split up, so a team could normally snatch at least one or two points. Unlike the team round, there were no teammates to help save a dangerous situation, and the team’s strength was scattered. There could be a situation like Tian Ji’s Horse Race*, or just one large mistake that affected a battle’s outcome.</p>
<p>Thus, even when a powerhouse faced a weak team, they wouldn’t dare to guarantee a full 10 point victory. With one small mistake, the opponent could snatch that one or two points. It could be said that it was even more difficult to get all 5 points of the individual battles than the 5 of the team competition, since the team competition was determined in one battle.</p>
<p>And in this match, 301 Degrees won 5 points in the individual battles. As long as they won the team competition, they would win 10 to 0, a perfect victory. But in the end, even though they had the home advantage, they were still defeated by Thunderclap…</p>
<p>To fail to get a single point in the individual battles would definitely have an effect on a team’s mindset when entering the team competition. Thunderclap, however, was exceptionally resolute. Thunderclap’s change this season had been discussed all throughout the past three rounds, some people felt that they had changed, while others felt that this was just the return of the old Thunderclap. But after this team competition, famous commentator Cha Xiaoxia wrote that Thunderclap had indeed changed, even from the previous Thunderclap that had Xiao Shiqin.</p>
<p>“The current Thunderclap is more confident and more determined.</p>
<p>This change is what Xiao Shiqin brought back upon his return. He experienced a failed year with Excellent Era, but he found exactly what he needed. He brought this back and changed the face of Thunderclap. I look forward to their performance this season.”</p>
<p>This was the commentary Cha Xiaoxia wrote after this round. And, as a self-proclaimed Happy fanboy, he of course wouldn’t skip on the commentary of Happy vs Tyranny.</p>
<p>Regarding Tang Rou’s promise of a 1v3, fanboy Cha Xiaoxia was resolute in his hope that Tang Rou would succeed, but he was still a bit worried. He worried that Tang Rou couldn’t accomplish it, but he also worried that Happy, in order to facilitate the 1v3, would ruin the rhythm of their their team arrangement. In this round, Happy’s order of battle for the individual battles were indeed different from before.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Esports Time reporter Ruan Cheng, who attacked Tang Rou the most, didn’t write much after Tang Rou lost to the first opponent in this match. All he said was a simple “as expected.” It seemed that Ruan Cheng wasn’t someone who would get excited over the just smallest thing, and it even seemed that he had begun to lose interest in this matter. However, the people who knew Ruan Cheng understood that this was just because the time wasn’t yet ripe. She had five rounds to 1v3, this was only the first.</p>
<p>“If she doesn’t do it in four rounds, and in the eighth round, Ruan Cheng isn’t at the Tiny Herb vs Happy post-match press conference, then there are only two possibilities. One, Tang Rou completed the 1v3 in that match. Two, Ruan Cheng experienced an inescapable natural disaster.” This was the judgment of someone who knew Ruan Cheng well. This wasn’t even a Glory match any more, it seemed to be a showdown between player and reporter.</p>
<p>Winning 7 points against Happy, Tyranny’s current score of 26 points wasn’t too bad. But Void (Xukong), who also had 26 points and was one place behind Tyranny (Batu) by alphabet, hadn’t done too well this round. Although they were playing an away game, their opponent Conquering Clouds wasn’t any strong team. The final score of 6 to 4 was unsatisfactory to Void supporters.</p>
<p>There was also Hundred Blossoms. After losing to Happy in their away game, they played a home game in the third round, but lost to 301 Degrees, 3 to 7. It seemed like Hundred Blossoms was beaten senseless. This round they fought an away game against Seaside, but the end result was still only 6-4. It had to be remembered that Seaside was the team with the worst performance in the first three rounds. Aside from winning 2 points against Misty Rain in the first round, they were swept in the second and third round. In low spirits, they fought against Hundred Blossoms who was also in bad condition, they actually managed to snatch 4 points. Even though Hundred Blossoms won and Seaside lost, but because of each of their skill levels and positions, Hundred Blossoms was the one unsatisfied, while Seaside seemed to have found the light of dawn.</p>
<p>After Hundred Blossoms’ small victory of 6 points, they were 11th on the leaderboard with 18 points. Ahead of them was the team that had tied with Thunderclap, 301 Degrees with 19 points. Ninth was Parade, after fighting a home game against Radiant, a team around their skill level, they earned a beautiful 8 to 2, and currently had 20 points.</p>
<p>Royal Style was at 12th, having suffered in their away game this round against Heavenly Swords 3 to 7. Royal Style slid down two places on the leaderboard, while these 7 points allowed Heavenly Swords to finally fight out of the relegation area, to 16th place.</p>
<p>At 13th was Happy, at 15 points after four rounds. Aside from their big win against Hundred Blossoms in the second round, they had not tasted another victory. Disregarding the first place on the leaderboard, their distance to eighth place, the last playoff spot, was a large 11 point difference.</p>
<p>This ranking was a far cry from their early declaration of aiming for the championship. Quite a few people talked about this alongside Tang Rou’s 1v3 in five rounds. Was this sort of arrogant attitude just Happy’s style?</p>
<p>Crashing in two consecutive rounds, Happy couldn’t help but feel a little disheartened. Even though they knew that this team still had problems here and there, their thirst for victory wouldn’t be dampened at all. Sundays after match Saturdays were Alliance-regulated rest days, but when Chen Guo came to the Internet cafe early Sunday morning, she saw that the door to the second floor was already opened, everyone already lined up in the training room.</p>
<p>These guys…</p>
<p>Chen Guo couldn’t help but sigh. In reality, she’d already lamented this many times. Even if Happy’s people might lack in skill, their spirit was never something to worry about. Big loss, big win, ups and downs, many people might not even be able to sleep at night. But Happy’s people could always adjust, and continue to sit in front of their computers, working hard.</p>
<p>Like this, we’ll win for sure. Chen Guo carried this thought, and Happy continued to train hard.</p>
<p>Round 5…</p>
<p>Round 6…</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. September was over in the blink of an eye, and they were now halfway through October. Starting from the fifth round, the Pro Alliance was reaching consecutive highs, powerful matches appearing one after another.</p>
<p>In Round 5, Samsara played an away game at Tiny Herb. Samsara’s crushing dominance seemed to shrink again, but they still managed to win, 6 to 4. On Tiny Herb’s home field, Samsara obtained a small victory. In the same round, another match between powerhouses received attention, Tyranny against Blue Rain. On their home field, Blue Rain emerged victorious, 7 to 3.</p>
<p>And then in Round 6, there were two more important faceoffs. Tiny Herb at Tyranny, Wind Howl at Samsara.</p>
<p>In the end, Tyranny earned a small victory over Tiny Herb, 6 to 4. But the discussions about their capabilities didn’t quiet down. Compared to their strength last season, where they had led the leaderboard the entire time, this season Tyranny was hovering just above the cutoff for playoffs, even falling down occasionally. They no longer had the boldness of last year.</p>
<p>Samsara had their home game this match, taking down Wind Howl 8 to 2. And in the post-match press conference, the manager of Club Samsara suddenly expressed his complaints about Samsara’s match schedule this season.</p>
<p>“Starting from Round 3, Tyranny, Blue Rain, Tiny Herb, Wind Howl… If I called this the most demonic match schedule in history, I don’t think anyone would object? At the same time I haven’t forgotten, after this round in Rounds 7 and 8, we’re facing Misty Rain and Void. This is truly an unforgettable journey to the championship.”</p>
<p>In reality, the sharper reporters discovered early on that Samsara’s match schedule was so demonic, and they’d used this in some of their questions toward Samsara. Samsara didn’t try to avoid the topic, but they downplayed it. Now after six rounds of opponents, four of which were powerhouses, no matter whether they were home or away, Samsara managed to defeat all of them. No one asked, but Samsara now voluntarily brought up this point.</p>
<p>The reporters suddenly understood. Samsara didn’t want to discuss this before because they wanted to follow the style of their captain Zhou Zekai: no talk, just do!</p>
<p>And so they won their way here. Big or small victories, they won against every powerhouse.</p>
<p>And so now, they could discuss this problem with no pressure at all. This wouldn’t feel like an excuse, because they had completely conquered this challenging match order.</p>
<p>The cameras clicked and flashed as the reporters asked each of the players onstage about their feelings after facing this demonic match schedule.</p>
<p>“These victories were extremely important, both in earning points for our team, and in suppressing our main competitors. I’m glad we were able to accomplish this,” Vice-captain Jiang Botao said.</p>
<p>“Not bad, but I think that we can do even better.” Bringing One Autumn Leaf from Excellent Era and swiftly becoming a crucial player for Samsara, Sun Xiang had become less haughty than before, but his confidence had increased quite a lot.</p>
<p>“…” Samsara’s Captain Zhou Zekai, after about ten seconds of long thinking, finally nodded. “Good.”</p>
<p>“What’s good? That winning these matches was just ‘good,’ or ‘good’ thing you managed to win these matches?” one reporter asked.</p>
<p>“Mm…” The long thinking was inevitable, and everyone waited patiently.</p>
<p>“Both!” After this long thinking, Zhou Zekai replied with this one word.</p>
<p>“Could you talk about your views of Tang Rou of Happy, who declared she would complete a 1v3 in five rounds?” The reporters tirelessly chased after almost every player in the Alliance with this question. They were still asking, which meant that Tang Rou had yet to succeed. Right now, three of the five rounds had passed. Tang Rou only had two more chances.</p>
<p>Chapter 1182: Round 5, Round 6</p>
<p>In the fifth and sixth rounds, Team Happy’s opponents were Team Parade and Team Blue Rain</p>
<p>Away game against Parade, home game against Blue Rain, but their scores were 3-7 and 1-9. After their win against Hundred Blossoms in the second round, Happy had now lost four matches in a row. Even though their losses to powerhouses like Tyranny and Blue Rain were expected, teams like Radiant and Parade were only mid-tier teams in the Alliance. Disregarding the championship, even if their goal was just to make it to playoffs, they needed to earn points against teams like these</p>
<p>But facing Radiant and Parade, the final score was 3 to 7 for both matches. They won all three individual battles, but in the group arena and the team competition, they couldn’t defeat their opponent</p>
<p>The strongest new team in history?</p>
<p>After the sixth round, the issue of Esports Time that released once again used this title, the same title that had been brought up after the second round. That time, Happy was the headline on the front page, but this time, they were just in a casual spot in the issue, and the title now had a large question mark after it</p>
<p>After 6 rounds, Happy had 19 points at 15th place, only 9 points away from the relegation zone of ten points. Maintain their current position? Everyone felt that this goal was realistic for them. As for championship or whatnot… That was such a joke, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>This was Ruan Cheng’s mockery in the latest issue of Esports Time. It seemed like he was no longer interested in Tang Rou’s promise of 1v3, and he now focused his efforts on doubting the entirety of Happy. It had to be said that Ruan Cheng was an experienced reporter. After six rounds, he accurately pinpointed all of Happy’s problems</p>
<p>“The various teams all worried in the face of Lord Grim’s new unspecialized class, but it now seems that this worry was unnecessary. Instead of saying that Lord Grim is their threat, it should be said that Lord Grim is their helper. I think that if Ye Xiu were not using this unspecialized right now, and was instead using a Battle Mage, Team Happy’s scores would be slightly better than what they are right now. Though, if that were the case, would the self-declared 1v3 pretty female rookie still have a spot on the team?”</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng correctly identified Lord Grim as the culprit of the problems of coordination that Happy faced, his tone all sorts of mocking, and in the end he still remembered to single out Tang Rou and her bet</p>
<p>Esports Time’s articles could to some extent influence public opinion. In round 7, Happy played their away game at Heavenly Swords, and in the pre-match press conference, the reporters were already coming to attack</p>
<p>“Losing four matches in a row, the unspecialized has a strong problem of compatibility with the rest of the team members. Happy’s performance in this season so far is far from your target of the championship. What do you think about this problem?” one reporter asked Ye Xiu</p>
<p>“Our team is improving every day, and every round could see a turning point,” Ye Xiu answered</p>
<p>“Really? Then could you give a prediction of how many more rounds that’d take?” someone asked, biting on that “more.” Ye Xiu took a look, wasn’t this that reporter from Esports Time, Ruan Cheng? Unlike Esports Home, Esports Time didn’t have reporters stationed everywhere and reporters following teams. As a half-monthly magazine, they didn’t need news as urgently as weekly publications did. They generally didn’t report extensively on specific matches, and instead published more overview-type articles. So their reporters often wouldn’t appear at every live match, and would instead hunt for material as needed for what they wanted to write</p>
<p>It was clear that after Tang Rou, Ruan Cheng considered Happy as his material. After his article, he once again came to Happy’s home game. This was the fourth round of the five-round promise. In two rounds, the bet would be decided, and it happened to fall on a week where Esports Time was set to release an issue. Ruan Cheng was calmly absent from the previous three rounds, but this round he finally couldn’t restrain himself and came to Happy</p>
<p>To emphasize that “more,” he was clearly referencing the fact that Tang Rou’s five-round promise was nearing its end. Ruan Cheng certainly had reasons for being unable to stay away from this match. Tang Rou’s five-round promise happened to fall during a demonic match order. Tyranny, Blue Rain, Tiny Herb, who expected a rookie to accomplish a glorious 1v3 in the face of these powerhouses? Thus, the key was in the rounds against Parade and Heavenly Swords</p>
<p>Tang Rou had failed in their match against Parade, so now, their match against Heavenly Swords was critical</p>
<p>Plus, there was the fact that Heavenly Swords and Happy were on such good terms with each other. What if they had some prior arrangement? Everyone could see Tang Rou’s importance to Happy. If she really ended up quitting, not only would it affect herself, it would be a huge blow to Happy as a whole. Under these conditions, whether or not she could complete a 1v3, Happy was probably even more nervous than Tang Rou</p>
<p>At this time, they met Heavenly Swords. Heavenly Swords and Happy had a good relationship. And this team had a special characteristic. Their captain was the boss, the main players were just a group of the boss’s friends. A team that played Glory so much that they invested money into a team to enter the Pro Alliance, one could imagine how unscrupulous these people were. Ruan Cheng truly worried that these guys would throw a match. So he wanted to come to this match in person. If Heavenly Swords did do this, then Ruan Cheng would be powerless to stop it, but he could at least carefully stare at everything that happened in this match. He wouldn’t let these group of people carelessly discard the spirit of competition</p>
<p>So in this pre-match press conference, he asked a question like “how many more rounds” because he wanted to see if Happy dared to confidently declare that today was the day</p>
<p>Ye Xiu looked at this guy, laughed a little and asked, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng blinked, then chuckled. “I’m the one asking the questions here, how come you’re asking me now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m asking you, how about you help give us a prediction?” Ye Xiu said</p>
<p>“I hope that Happy will obtain satisfactory results today.” Although Ruan Cheng hoped that Happy would fall over and die in the street forever, in public he still got by with some righteous words</p>
<p>When the other reporters asked questions, they were all about Happy’s difficulties and Tang Rou’s 1v3</p>
<p>After six rounds, the standings were becoming clearer and clearer. Right now, they were separated into three tiers</p>
<p>The first seven teams all had scores above 40 points. Samsara, with 49 points, was once again in the lead. Wind Howl was second with 47. Blue Rain and Misty Rain with 46 points each were third and fourth. Because Tiny Herb lost consecutively to Samsara and Tyranny, they had 44 points and were in fifth. Thunderclap, the team regarded as changing the most this season, were in sixth also with 44 points. Void had 42 points, seventh place</p>
<p>After these seven teams, the 40+ point top tier ended. Tyranny at eighth place was still in range for playoffs, but they only had 35 points right now. Although this score was a distance away from the first seven, it was about the same distance from the teams in ninth through twelfth. All five of these teams were in the 30 point mid-tier. Judging by the current point standings, they all had a chance of earning the eighth spot in the playoffs. Hundred Blossoms hadn’t encountered a strong team in rounds 5 and 6, so they finally performed rather well and earned the ninth place spot with 32 points. Afterwards, Parade, 301 Degrees, and Royal Style were tenth through twelfth place</p>
<p>After them were Radiant and Heavenly Swords with 22 points each, and after that were the bottom tier teams with below 20 points. Happy, at 19, was first among these teams</p>
<p>There weren’t too many surprises in the sixth round. The strong teams continued to be strong, the weak teams lost in all sorts of ways. The final point counts were about as expected, comparing the teams’ strengths on paper. Tyranny was the biggest disappointment. Last season they had swept countless forces, challenging records, yet this season they were at the doorway to the playoffs, a distance away from the first seven</p>
<p>Thunderclap was the biggest excitement. Even though they frequently made it to playoffs, it was normally by a small margin, squeezed in like Tyranny was now. But now, their point score was good, only five points away from first place. Aside from points, what was also important was their change in matches. Their current confidence and resolve was a rare sight in the past</p>
<p>Last season, Hundred Blossoms had gotten off to a weak start before ending strong. Their playoff fight against the strongest team at the time, Tyranny, made them optimistic about their future. But this season, in the very second round they were powerfully defeated by Happy, then drifted along in a dreamlike state for a few rounds. These past two rounds though, they finally seemed to wake up, but on the whole, their performance was rather disappointing</p>
<p>These three teams, as well as Team Happy, were currently the subjects of the most discussion. Clearly, there wasn’t much good to say. People generally enjoyed seeing other people’s suffering</p>
<p>At this time, the round 7 matches were finally about to begin. Like the previous rounds, this round didn’t lack exciting matchups. Samsara, with their demonic match order, after fighting four powerhouses would be facing Misty Rain this round. In addition, the four powerhouses were all fighting each other this round: Tyranny at Wind Howl, Blue Rain at Tiny Herb</p>
<p>The television broadcast team was in a dilemma! It was too hard to reconcile all of these conflicting important matches. Happy, Hundred Blossoms, Thunderclap? No matter how much discussion they generated, they couldn’t compare in such a situation. In the end, they chose to broadcast Wind Howl versus Tyranny. Tiny Herb and Blue Rain had their old rivalry, but Wind Howl versus Tyranny represented a confrontation between the new and the old. Ever since Tyranny gathered its three old veterans, this sort of conflict noticeably became much more intense</p>
<p>At the same time, the players of the various teams appeared onstage</p>
<p>“God, hello! Everyone, long time no see!” Lou Guanning pulled out the attitude of a host at this home game, giving Happy’s members a grand and warm welcome</p>
<p>“Long time no see, long time no see.” Upon investigation, Happy’s closest friendships were really just with these few from Heavenly Swords. Compared to the previous rounds, where the pre-match player greetings were just formalities, this time they truly expressed their feelings of having not met in a while, shaking hands, and even chatting a bit</p>
<p>“How are you? Going onstage today?” Ye Xiu asked as he shook Sun Zheping’s hand</p>
<p>“Of course,” Sun Zheping said</p>
<p>“Oh really? I really want to just crush your hand right now!” Ye Xiu laughed</p>
<p>“Just try it.” As Sun Zheping spoke, he tightened his grip. His hand was injured, but not to the extent where he couldn’t feel anything. He just couldn’t endure the rapid, long-term, high-intensity controls required in playing Glory competitively, that was all</p>
<p>“Haha, see you onstage.” Ye Xiu shook his hand free and went to the next player. In Heavenly Swords, it was still just the same five plus Sun Zheping who had the professional attitude. The other filler members just skillfully walked by with no fighting spirit, as though they just wanted to hurry up and sit back down</p>
<p>“God, have some mercy on us!” Lou Guanning cracked a joke when he shook hands with Ye Xiu</p>
<p>“Not good, the judge is listening!” said Ye Xiu</p>
<p>“Kidding, kidding!” Lou Guanning quickly said. Glancing to the side, he saw the judge really was aiming his ears toward them. Because of Tang Rou’s promise, the relationship between these two teams had been brought up again and again, and Lou Guanning was well aware of this. But in the middle of this turmoil, Ye Xiu still said this sort of thing</p>
<p>“God, you’re just too good at making small talk!” Lou Guanning said, wiping away sweat</p>
<p>Chapter 1183: That Familiar Feeling</p>
<p>After this genuinely warm-hearted greeting, Happy and Heavenly Swords began their match.</p>
<p>This was Heavenly Swords’ home game. Although they were a very distinctive team, just from the number of seats filled, it could seen that they weren’t a particularly popular team right now. Even after one year in the Alliance, they weren’t any better than Happy. In the end, strength was the most important thing in competition, and Heavenly Swords’ strength was only about mid- to low-tier. Additionally, Heavenly Swords wasn’t the only professional team in their home city. For many years now, City B was home to Tiny Herb, which was a team that was much more famous and had long established themselves as this city’s symbol of Glory. Heavenly Swords was both a weaker and a later team, so it was very difficult for them to establish themselves here.</p>
<p>While they were preparing for this, they had billed themselves as a grassroots team, which made a lot of noise in game. But now everyone knew the truth. The only thing “grassroots” about Heavenly Swords was their strength. The five players were all from extremely rich families. Not a single hair on their heads was “grassroots.”</p>
<p>Heavenly Swords wasn’t too successful commercially, but no matter how senior or professional a Glory commentator was, they wouldn’t casually try to judge the operations of a team like Heavenly Swords, which was formed by some people who played Glory themselves and invested their own money to form a team, even acquiring a stadium. Their beginnings were different, so it wasn’t suitable to apply conventional logic to them.</p>
<p>But no matter what kind of background or what kind of business operations, when a team stood here, victory was everything. The players of both teams returned to their respective player areas, until only the first two players in the individual competition remained onstage.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Sun Zheping.</p>
<p>“Not bad.” Sun Zheping was very pleased with this matchup, and a fire ignited in his eyes.</p>
<p>He’d retired for many years, and then returned to this stage. This was all familiar to him, and yet foreign at the same time.</p>
<p>What was familiar was that, no matter what updates and upgrades there were, this was still Glory’s battlefield, it was still the same 24 classes to slaughter.</p>
<p>What was foreign was that many people he had known in the past were no longer here. With every round of battle this season, all Sun Zheping saw were unfamiliar faces, including the people currently standing by his side. None of them were the Alliance of his memory, the teammates of his memory.</p>
<p>Characters as strong as iron, players like flowing water.</p>
<p>It’s all in the past…</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time this sigh had crossed Sun Zheping’s mind. But now, in this moment, the one who stood before him on the battlefield – Ye Xiu!</p>
<p>Sun Zheping felt as though he were suddenly transported to those earliest seasons, with familiar people, familiar characters, familiar settings, familiar feelings.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin!” Sun Zheping clenched his right hand into a fist, lifted it to his mouth, and blew inside.</p>
<p>In the past, this motion had been his habit, but many fans had now forgotten it. Even Sun Zheping himself hadn’t revived this habit after his return. But now, after suddenly rediscovering this feeling of familiarity, this trademark motion naturally reappeared.</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself.” Ye Xiu saw everything. He smiled, and entered the competitor booth.</p>
<p>The battle began.</p>
<p>Berserker Another Summer of Sleep, unspecialized Lord Grim, appeared at the two corners of the map.</p>
<p>When the map loaded, the audience was stunned.</p>
<p>This was Heavenly Swords’ home game, they had the right to choose the map. For the individual battles, the maps were of course chosen by the battling player. And the map that Sun Zheping chose was the Arena, the map that was limited in size, with no obstacles or changing features. It was the same map that Ye Xiu had chosen in the match against Tyranny, when he completely defeated Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>And now, Sun Zheping chose this same map to welcome Ye Xiu in a battle. Of course, he hadn’t known beforehand that his opponent would be Ye Xiu, but the choice of this map still seemed like it was sending some message to Happy.</p>
<p>“What a…”</p>
<p>Once they entered the map, Ye Xiu was about to send a message, but he’d only typed out two words before Sun Zheping’s Another Summer of Sleep had already sprinted several steps forward, sending a Collapsing Mountain his way.</p>
<p>It was a very normal opening for a Berserker, but when Sun Zheping displayed this skill, something felt different about its momentum.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>For someone like Ye Xiu, with many years of Glory experience, this wasn’t enough to cause a doubt.</p>
<p>It was rhythm, Sun Zheping’s rhythm, revealing this fierce and aggressive momentum. Ye Xiu had only typed two words before the light of the blade was already falling.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu could only switch his attention to controlling his character. Complain about the map choice? Sadly, Sun Zheping didn’t give him this time.</p>
<p>When the Collapsing Mountain fell, Lord Grim had already rolled to the side. Without waiting, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened to become a spear, slashing up with a Sky Strike. It seemed that this skill was a bit hasty, since Sky Strike had lesser priority than Collapsing Mountain. If these two skills met, Collapsing Mountain would shatter the Sky Strike.</p>
<p>But experienced Glory players could quickly realize that the timing of Lord Grim’s Sky Strike was impeccable. It would hit the opponent exactly when Another Summer of Sleep’s Collapsing Mountain hit the ground and ended, completely avoiding the system’s determination of priority.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sun Zheping was one of these experienced Glory Players. The Collapsing Mountain, about to hit the ground, was suddenly twisted to the side.</p>
<p>Such a small twist didn’t change the time difference between these skills, but it allowed the shockwaves from Collapsing Mountain head closer toward Lord Grim…</p>
<p>The skill had reached its ending sounds, and Ye Xiu noticed this change, but there was no time to change his controls.</p>
<p>Collapsing Mountain hit the ground, and in this moment the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella lifted up in a Sky Strike.</p>
<p>Hit!</p>
<p>Another Summer of Sleep was sent to the air, but at the same time, Lord Grim was blown back.</p>
<p>Lord Grim was unable to dodge the shockwaves of Collapsing Mountain.</p>
<p>This was just two low-level skills, but they encompassed such a rich, exciting confrontation, completed in a rise and fall. Those with weaker eyes, whose skills weren’t high enough, didn’t even notice the precise timing of the Sky Strike or the urgent adjustment of Collapsing Mountain. Those who just treated this as a direct clash of two skills were, as the saying went, burning a piano for fuel and cooking a crane for meat.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At this moment, there was another explosion between the two characters as they were pushed away. Lord Grim, knocked away by the shockwaves of Collapsing Mountain, shifted his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella into gun form and sent an attack toward Another Summer of Sleep. But Another Summer of Sleep immediately used a Blade Master’s Guard, parrying the fired bullets with his sword.</p>
<p>“Your reaction’s not bad!” This time, Ye Xiu had time to type out a message. This was a change of skill that only an unspecialized could manage, but Sun Zheping still managed to react in time.</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself.” Sun Zheping didn’t care if the time wasn’t exactly right, he just shoved Ye Xiu’s exact words from before the match right back at him.</p>
<p>“Not at all.” Ye Xiu still sent a reply. As soon as Lord Grim hit the ground after the shockwave, he lifted a cold light and swept toward Another Summer of Sleep.</p>
<p>Assassin skill, Shining Cut!</p>
<p>In an instant, the distance that seemed to be growing between the two characters was suddenly shrunk again. And in this moment, Another Summer of Sleep was still rolling on the ground, a Quick Recover after being hit by Sky Strike.</p>
<p>Destruction Slash!</p>
<p>As Another Summer of Sleep stood up, he unleashed this Destruction Slash.</p>
<p>The Berserker was a wild and aggressive class, and the skills of this classes often had one characteristic: high priority.</p>
<p>The sub-level 20 skills of an unspecialized had no way of competing with the priority of a Destruction Slash. Lord Grim’s rushed approach with a Shining Cut seemed more like he was delivering himself into the jaws of a tiger.</p>
<p>The Destruction Slash, carrying the Berserker’s intent to kill, surged toward Lord Grim.</p>
<p>But Lord Grim’s body vibrated, and a strong aura seemed to envelop his body.</p>
<p>Reinforced Iron Bones!</p>
<p>Lord Grim used this Striker skill now, meaning that he intended to take this Destruction Slash head-on.</p>
<p>The damage of a Destruction Slash wasn’t very high, as it was more of an effect-inducing attack. Targets hit by a Destruction Slash would have a large reduction in defense, this was the so-called “destruction.” So, taking a Destruction Slash wasn’t just sacrificing some health, it also meant that in the next five seconds, the character’s defense would be reduced by up to 70%. Classes with naturally high defenses were especially affected by this skill, which was why it was called a nightmare for high-defense classes.</p>
<p>Lord Grim’s equipment was a chaotic mess, with no bonus effects from class armor, and the defense granted was all over the place, not following the logic of a single level. And now that he activated Reinforced Iron Bones, which raised his defense not by percent but by points. This, plus the chaotic defense of the character Lord Grim himself, and then reduced 70%, the question of what his defense would ultimately be after all of that was a complicated calculation…</p>
<p>The audience didn’t need to calculate, because once this attack hit, they could directly see the changes of the character’s stats. And the pro players? With their practiced calculation ability, they could instantly grasp the effect on Lord Grim’s defense after a points increase and a percentage decrease.</p>
<p>The end result: 7% reduction.</p>
<p>7% decrease in defense, ten times less than 70%. The effect of this Destruction Slash was basically negated by this Reinforced Iron Bones. But the Reinforced Iron Bones wasn’t as simple as just increasing defense. In the 20 seconds of Super Armor after activating this skill, it also guaranteed that the character could unleash unreasonably strong attacks.</p>
<p>The Destruction Slash slammed down.</p>
<p>Lord Grim’s body swayed slightly, but under Super Armor, this swaying was basically the extent of the effect of Destruction Slash’s priority.</p>
<p>Lord Grim swung his fists, which clenched the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, already shifted into two tonfas.</p>
<p>Straight Punch, Knee Attack, Uppercut, Qi Bullet…</p>
<p>The combo attack was already unleashed, landing like raindrops upon the body of Another Summer of Sleep. Lord Grim’s strengthened state exuded an intense madness, hardly below that of a Berserker…</p>
<p>That’s right… If he weren’t like this, how could he have broken our Blood and Blossoms combination all by himself back then?</p>
<p>As he watched Another Summer of Sleep suffer this succession of attacks, Sun Zheping rediscovered another familiar feeling of days gone by.</p>
<p>Chapter 1184: That Terrible Feeling</p>
<p>Lord Grim practically only used Grappler close combat skills. In their match versus Tyranny, Zhang Jiale’s Dazzling Hundred Blossoms was directly blown out under this howling whirlwind of attacks. What about Zhang Jiale’s former partner of Blood and Blossoms, Sun Zheping?</p>
<p>There weren’t many in the crowd with such old memories of the past, but for these two players, this match was a battle that had continued from the past until today. Sun Zheping seemed to have never left, and Ye Xiu seemed like that past Battle God.</p>
<p>“It won’t be so easy!”</p>
<p>Sun Zheping roared in the chat. Another Summer of Sleep seized an opening, an aura of blood erupted from his body.</p>
<p>Berserk?</p>
<p>No, this was even stronger than Berserk. It was an Awakening skill learned at Level 50: Bloodthirsty Frenzy.</p>
<p>Bloodthirsty Frenzy could not be stacked with Berserk. Only one status effect could exist at one time. Bloodthirsty Frenzy increased offensive stats by 25% more than Berserk, and also gave the user Super Armor and a Bloodthirsty effect, which can be split into two opposing effects. Bloodthirsty gave the user 10% Life-Steal for all attacks, but Bloodthirsty also traded health with each attack, consuming one’s own life to deal more damage to the opponent.</p>
<p>When this skill was activated, it was very rare for Berserkers to continue being on the defensive. Just the Super Armor effect that was stronger than Reinforced Iron Bones could let the Berserker avoid the effects of most skills.</p>
<p>However, grabs were a special case. As soon as Ye Xiu saw Sun Zheping activate his awakening skill, he immediately dashed forward to try Fling him. However, Bloodthirsty Berserkers were even more ferocious than Berserk Berserkers. The heavy greatsword was almost like a lightsaber as it cut through the air. Lord Grim’s hand had yet to extend when Another Summer of Sleep’s greatsword arrived. Ye Xiu realized that if they had to compete in speed, Lord Grim would be at the disadvantage.</p>
<p>Guard!</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella transformed into a sword. Lord Grim raised the sword horizontally and blocked the attack with a clang. This Guard had been executed tightly, but the Bloodthirsty Another Summer of Sleep had extraordinary strength. Although this attack had been blocked, Lord Grim had actually been knocked back, his two feet sliding over the ground.</p>
<p>This wasn’t outside of Ye Xiu’s expectations though. Lord Grim borrowed the momentum and leaped back. His sword returned to its sheath, and the umbrella turned into a gun, shooting the ground with Aerial Fire to quickly pull the distance between the two of them. However, Another Summer of Sleep’s greatsword had already arrived.</p>
<p>This guy!!</p>
<p>Sun Zheping’s speed had exceeded Ye Xiu’s imagination.</p>
<p>This attack wasn’t a skill. It was just a normal attack, which had little starting and ending lag. The greatsword sliced through the air in an arc to try catch the Aerial-Fire retreating Lord Grim. Aerial Fire worked, but Lord Grim was still caught by the tip of Another Summer of Sleep’s greatsword.</p>
<p>Bullets shot straight at Another Summer of Sleep’s chest. Blood splattered everywhere, but Another Summer of Sleep didn’t even flinch. He raised his greatsword in the air. Sword shadows from Wild Blood Strike spread through the air and hacked at Lord Grim, dragging along a bloody mist.</p>
<p>With just one attack, Lord Grim’s health slid down. Even the crowd felt worried.</p>
<p>Knights had exceptional defense. It wasn’t just because of the plate armor worn by them, but rather their Plate Armor Proficiency that took the health and defensive capabilities of plate armor to the next step. However, just the existence of Plate Armor Proficiency wouldn’t make an Elementalist want to choose Plate Armor for better survivability because they couldn’t give up the Intelligence and Cast Speed from Cloth Armor.</p>
<p>Every class obtained huge improvements in combat capabilities from Armor Proficiency, but the unspecialized didn’t have these. Lord Grim could only rely on the original stats of the armor to strengthen himself. However, he effectiveness of the armor on Lord Grim was weak. It couldn’t compare to his transforming Myriad Manifestations Umbrella.</p>
<p>Wild Blood Strike struck Lord Grim to the ground. Ye Xiu had Lord Grim try to roll away, but Sun Zheping’s Another Summer of Sleep was already in pursuit. With an Earth-Shattering Slash and the offensive buffs from Bloodthirsty, it was almost like he teleported. His figure flickered. He suddenly appeared in front of Lord Grim and slashed downwards with his greatsword.</p>
<p>Lord Grim dodged again. However, Earth-Shattering Slash dealt AoE damage, and Lord Grim was unable to completely get out of its range. Under the intense swaying from the earthquake, Lord Grim wasn’t able to stand up stably. Another Summer of Sleep slashed twice, horizontally and vertically, completing a Gore Cross.</p>
<p>Hit, hit, consecutive hits!</p>
<p>Sun Zheping bravely activated Bloodthirsty Frenzy, letting him forcefully interrupt Lord Grim’s continuous attacks and also giving him the initiative.</p>
<p>This bravery and boldness did not let down his former title as the Number One Berserker. No, even now, no one had this same confidence and this same valor to employ such a brute-force method to take back the initiative. To many people, this type of choice might be unwise. If Lord Grim’s grab had been just a bit faster, he might have been able to throw Another Summer of Sleep away before his frenzy of attacks.</p>
<p>However, Sun Zheping had done it. This wasn’t his first time either. In his professional career, who knew how many times his risky and imprudent brute-force transformed into the deciding point. This was not just luck. Behind this brute force hid precise observation and judgement. After that was his determination and resolve to put everything into one move. This was what many lacked, but Sun Zheping possessed.</p>
<p>To others, the always advancing Han Wenqing was more fierce, while Sun Zheping was more wild. It was a wildness that disregarded everything else!</p>
<p>“It won’t be so easy!”</p>
<p>In the public chat, Sun Zheping’s words from before his Bloodthirsty Frenzy activation had yet to disappear. These same words suddenly popped up again. These two seemed to like to return each other’s words in today’s match. However, did just saying it won’t be so easy make it easy?</p>
<p>Lord Grim suddenly trembled. This unspecialized also turned scarlet red. A dense aura of blood seemed to be emanating from his skin.</p>
<p>Bloodthirsty Frenzy?</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>Those who understood the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella knew that while a skill could be added to each transformation, awakening skills such as Bloodthirsty Frenzy were exceptions. Level 50 awakening skills as well as Level 20 class advancement skills were every class’s most distinct skills. They were skills that could not be used by any other class. An unspecialized was no exception.</p>
<p>Lord Grim wasn’t using Bloodthirsty Frenzy, which meant the only other possibility was Berserk.</p>
<p>Berserk was very different from Bloodthirsty Frenzy, but it was generally viewed as a lower-leveled Bloodthirsty Frenzy. In fact, according to Glory’s narrative, Berserkers learned Bloodthirsty Frenzy through their understanding and control over Berserk. Bloodthirsty Frenzy could be considered an upgraded version of Berserk.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lord Grim activated Berserk. Did he want to want to use the budget “Bloodthirsty Frenzy” to fight with the real Bloodthirsty Frenzy? And because it was a skill placed on his weapon, it would only have one skill point in it. This Berserk was far from the Berserk that Berserkers always maxed out. It was like trying to break a stone with an egg!</p>
<p>Everyone was thinking this, but Another Summer of Sleep’s next attack unexpectedly missed.</p>
<p>No way?</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>It was just a level one Berserk. The buffs given to Lord Grim couldn’t be that much, yet just this slight boost made it so that Sun Zheping was unable to react in time?</p>
<p>Yes, he couldn’t react in time…</p>
<p>Another attack whiffed. Sun Zheping couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>It had been so many years from his injury to retirement to his return, yet his habits hadn’t changed. And Ye Xiu still remembered. As a result, in this match, Sun Zheping searched for the feel from that year and burst forth. Ye Xiu’s choice to fight measure for measure suddenly suppressed Sun Zheping’s momentum.</p>
<p>The change was because of that Berserk.</p>
<p>Although it was only at level one and the buffs were minimal… Sun Zheping was unable to keep up with this tiny change. This had nothing to do with speed, but rather rhythm. Sun Zheping always pushed his rhythm to the highest. Switch the beat, switch the speed? No. There was no such concept in Sun Zheping’s mind. He got to his rhythm in one step and that one step reached the limit. As a result, when Ye Xiu’s Lord Grim activated Berserk and his offensive stats increased, Sun Zheping’s attack rhythm seemed to have reached a bottleneck, unable to reach the next step. This was because he had already been at his limits. Sun Zheping had always competed at his limits.</p>
<p>Sun Zheping needed to adjust his rhythm, but he wasn’t good at it and he felt disgusted doing it. Moreover, he also knew very well that Ye Xiu wanted to stop him there. The instant he changed up his rhythm, Ye Xiu would take back the initiative once again. At their skill level, just this change up in tempo could be the deciding factor of this match.</p>
<p>The difficulties of subtleties within this fight was not able to be understood by even pro players, let alone the average viewer, if they did not understand these two well enough. They would be astonished just like the viewers: it was just a level one Berserk, why can’t Sun Zheping keep up?</p>
<p>“How disgusting!” Having his surging offense get cut off like this by Ye Xiu made Sun Zheping feel as sick as if he had eaten a fly. It hadn’t been easy for him to find back that familiar feeling from the past. Why did this terrible feeling have to come back too? This opponent is just as annoying as before!</p>
<p>A sense of rhythm… what was that? I’ll probably never understand in this lifetime… Against this guy, I’m probably not even doing as well as Zhang Jiale.</p>
<p>In the end, Another Summer of Sleep fell.</p>
<p>The sense of rhythm was an extremely fatal flaw for this first-generation God. Compared to what a pro-level player should possess, his sense of rhythm could be described as a complete mess.</p>
<p>As a result, facing an opponent who knew him well, his weakness was quickly drawn out and he met a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>“Not bad. To think you could still get out that type of offense. You scared me.” After the match, Ye Xiu specifically went to call out to him.</p>
<p>“Stop with the nonsense. I still lost.” Sun Zheping was annoyed.</p>
<p>“How could you beat me alone?” Ye Xiu laughed.</p>
<p>Chapter 1185: An Opponent Thoroughly Understood</p>
<p>In Happy’s away game, with Ye Xiu’s victory, Happy led 1 to 0. However, for those who supported Happy, this sort of opening was unable to excite them. Recently, Happy had this kind of tempo; their openings were good, but then they started dropping points, especially in the team competition. Up until now, their only team competition victory was against Team Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>What about today?</p>
<p>In the current climate, it was still rather rare for Happy’s fans to come to their away games. However, Happy had fought in City B in the Challenger League finals. It was the place where they beat Excellent Era. Seven Fields and his group of guild buddies were all residents of this city. In the Challenger League finals, they had formed a small group and came to cheer them on. Guild Happy was flourishing at the moment, and Seven Fields and his guild buddies were core guild members. Team Happy was coming to their city to play a match, so how could they not organize guild members ahead of time to cheer for Happy?</p>
<p>The Pro League’s seating arrangements weren’t as casual as the Challenger League’s. Away team fans would usually be grouped together in one area to avoid being mixed in with home team fans, so if any disagreements arose, there wouldn’t be any conflicts. Seven Field’s group sat at Happy’s away team seats. Quite a few people had come. After Happy won the first round of the individual competition, all of them were cheering loudly. In a stadium usually filled with home team fans, it was quite a spectacle to see.</p>
<p>The second round of the individual competition took place under this type of atmosphere.</p>
<p>Team Happy, Qiao Yifan. Ghostblade, One Inch Ash.</p>
<p>Team Heavenly Swords, Zou Yunhai. Elementalist, Ocean Ahead.</p>
<p>Heavenly Swords’ characters had been created when these friends first started playing the game. Now that they were in the pro circle, they switched out their equipment for new ones. After much effort from Lou Guanning and them, they replaced their old equipment for better ones. From this point, Heavenly Swords had pretty good equipment because their efforts were focused! The good things were all piled on their five core characters. Even if the other characters were butt-naked, they wouldn’t care. With such a concentration of resources, their characters naturally became a lot stronger, albeit at the cost of their non-core characters.</p>
<p>Happy and Heavenly Swords used to play with each other constantly in the game, so they were all familiar with each other. After Qiao Yifan and Zou Yunhai entered the stage, they even chatted a bit in the chat. After the countdown started and the two began fighting, Qiao Yifan won in the end. His performance was always consistent. Even though he never had any overwhelming advantage over Zhou Yunhai, he always had control over the situation. When Zou Yunhai came down, his expression looked a bit ugly. He was clearly unhappy with being stuffed out in this fight.</p>
<p>Friendship first, competition second?</p>
<p>These were oftentimes just words. As long as one was on stage, who wouldn’t want to win? Bad blood appearing because of a bad match wouldn’t be anything new. Quarrels occasionally arose even when teammates practiced against each other, let alone an official match where victory or defeat mattered.</p>
<p>Of course, Zou Yunhai was just gloomy. He wasn’t at the point where he would quarrel with Happy. It was just that after two consecutive losses, Heavenly Swords wasn’t nearly as relaxed as before. Just because the two teams were good friends with each other, hoping for a peaceful ending was too sweet.</p>
<p>For Happy, their third player was Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>For Heavenly Swords, Lou Guanning had originally planned on saying a few words to their third player, but when he saw that their opponent was an All-Star, he ended up not saying anything. He simply patted their player’s shoulder and sent him up.</p>
<p>Lou Guanning admitted that he was still a distance away from an All-Star. If he had to face an All-Star, whether he won depended on luck and how he performed that day, so he wasn’t able to point out any crucial win conditions.</p>
<p>Heavenly Sword’s player was called Li Weiyi. He was the one that Heavenly Swords had signed to meet the minimum requirements. The individual competition and group arena required six players to compete in, but Lou Guanning and his friends were five people. Among them, Zhong Yeli was a Cleric and could only come out in the team competition. Thus, there were only four remaining; two others were needed.</p>
<p>They didn’t try to recruit any famed generals to meet this quota. The positions of the five friends were untouchable. What famed general would be willing to just be someone to meet the quota?</p>
<p>In the end, Lou Guanning found two people from who knew where. They had some skill, but there would be some objection to call them truly skilled. In the third round, Su Mucheng easily won. Happy had a 3 to 0 lead, sweeping the individual competition. Lou Guanning didn’t say anything to the returning Li Weiyi. Asking a stopgap cheerleader to win over an All-Star was asking too much.</p>
<p>Team Heavenly Swords’ roster was extremely abnormal. It wasn’t like they didn’t have the resources to change that, but rather they weren’t willing to. Their original aspiration was to give the five of them an opportunity to fight on the pro stage. They weren’t done yet, so they didn’t plan on giving up on this opportunity to other pro players.</p>
<p>A short break followed after the individual competition. The two teams could talk and do some preparation for the group arena during this break. With the individual competition over, it was obvious who would be playing in the group arena.</p>
<p>However, the roster for the group arena was set before the match began and could not be changed at this time. The Alliance had considered letting teams make adjustments mid-match, but in the end, they hoped that the players would focus their attention on the match itself and not waste too much of their efforts on benefiting from making adjustments.</p>
<p>Because of their good relationship with each other, it was hard to avoid the two teams mingling together during this break time. The Alliance didn’t forbid two teams from talking to each other during this break, but whenever there was any contact between two teams, the referee would always be watching over very strictly in case the players were violating the integrity of the competition. There was someone in Happy who had made a bet. With Happy’s opponents being their friends, all sorts of rumors had flown around long ago. The staff members of the Alliance were watching the communication between the two teams very tightly.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t Happy taking the initiative to go over and talk, but rather Heavenly Swords who had just gotten swept in the individual competition. Lou Guanning looked like he was at a funeral. He walked around Happy in a circle before finally saying to Ye Xiu: “God, you’re too fierce. What you guys are doing is saving up your strength and then taking out the knife to start the operation!”</p>
<p>“Haha,” Ye Xiu laughed, “It’s undeniable, our understanding of you guys is the most comprehensive.”</p>
<p>Lou Guanning was speechless. He was most scared of God Ye Xiu’s calm and righteousness that was completely reasonable and irrefutable.</p>
<p>“But then again, you guys can’t keep doing this long-term!” Ye Xiu said. “Even if you guys are constantly improving, if your team is always just you five, you lack variance. You’ll quickly be completely grasped by others.”</p>
<p>“I feel like… it’s fine…” Lou Guanning said.</p>
<p>“That’s because there aren’t any teams who feel threatened by you guys, right?” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“God…” Lou Guanning cried. Could you not be so honest? For their matches this season, Lou Guanning had felt quite satisfied with Heavenly Swords’ performance. No matter who their opponents were, they always won a few points. In their fourth round, they even beat Royal Style 7 to 3.</p>
<p>That was Royal Style! Even though they were no longer frequent visitors of the playoffs, for good or bad, they had an All-Star and were a very experienced team. Taking them down gave Heavenly Swords a huge boost in confidence. All of them felt like they had grown and improved after a year in the Alliance. But to God Ye Xiu, they were just opponents “who weren’t worthy of being studied.”</p>
<p>This couldn’t be considered as others looking down on them though. A team had 19 opponents in the Alliance. Everyone’s time was limited, so teams needed to choose who to focus and who not to focus on. If a team tried to grab them all, it was very possible that the team would end up not grabbing any. And among these teams, Heavenly Swords belonged to the category of who not to focus on. Lou Guanning had no choice to concede on this point, which was why God Ye Xiu’s words made him tearful.</p>
<p>“You’ll be going up in the Group Arena, right? Hurry up and get ready. We’ll let you guys see just how disastrous it is to be completely understood by your opponents,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>How disastrous it is to be completely understood by your opponents?</p>
<p>Lou Guanning and the others knew very well by the end of this match.</p>
<p>Facing Hundred Blossoms, they had won 2 points. Facing Blue Rain, they had won 1 point. Facing Royal Style, they had won 7 points. And facing Royal Style, who had beaten Happy, they had won 6 points. This season, they had utilized their home game advantage well. Both of their victories were their home games.</p>
<p>But this time, in their home game versus Happy, Heavenly Swords ended up with 0 points.</p>
<p>10 to 0!</p>
<p>Team Heavenly Swords was swept clean by a team that had only won one match so far.</p>
<p>Happy didn’t give them any mercy. Of course, Heavenly Swords also maintained proper sportsmanship. In the group arena, after Tang Rou beat one of their players, she lost to their second player, Wen Kebei’s Battle Mage.</p>
<p>1v3? Four rounds had passed, and Tang Rou had yet to achieve even a 1v2.</p>
<p>Her chance with Heavenly Swords ended with failure. Her only chance left was against Tiny Herb. A 1v3 against Tiny Herb?</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, Ruan Cheng had snatched a good spot. He trusted that even though Happy had a perfect win today, their mood probably wasn’t too good. From a long-term perspective, Tang Rou failing a 1v3 and leaving the team was an enormous loss to them, whether that was in strength or in popularity. This beautiful girl really did have some fans right now. Ruan Cheng had received no small amount of hate for his attacks on her.</p>
<p>“Did Tang Rou not come? What a pity. There’s probably a lot of pressure on her, right?” Seeing that Tang Rou was missing from Happy’s seats in the press conference, Ruan Cheng didn’t even say any polite congratulatory words for their win today. He directly brought out the bet that he had been banking on this entire time.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the team from top to bottom is confident in Tang Rou,” Ye Xiu said calmly.</p>
<p>“There’s still one round left. We can’t be too hasty with our words, so we’ll just have to wait and see!” Ruan Cheng’s words weren’t said too early, but his confident look as if he had planned this in advance was truly loathsome. He might as well have just displayed the schadenfreude at the bottom of his heart out in the open. It would have looked more sincere and natural!</p>
<p>“Little Tang is too pure! I say, she only said what she would do if she didn’t keep her promise. But if she succeeds? Don’t you think you should do something?” Fang Rui said to Ruan Cheng.</p>
<p>“I’ll send her my heartfelt blessings, really.” Ruan Cheng put on an honest face. He wasn’t about to be provoked!</p>
<p>“Grab me a bucket!” Fang Rui shouted. “I’m going to puke!”</p>
<p>Chapter 1186: Never Happened Before</p>
<p>After finishing their post-match interviews, Happy’s group ran into Heavenly Swords’ players.</p>
<p>Being swept 10 to 0 was truly embarrassing, and Heavenly Swords was clearly unhappy with tonight’s match. However, they fulfilled the words “enemies on stage, friends off stage.” They put their emotions in order and showed their hospitality as hosts to Happy.</p>
<p>Around this time, the other matches this round were also finishing up. The highlight matches this round coincidentally ended with the home teams losing as well.</p>
<p>Tiny Herb versus Blue Rain, 4 to 6.</p>
<p>Wind Howl versus Tyranny, 4 to 6.</p>
<p>The powerful young Team Wind Howl tripped up against the experienced old Team Tyranny. The controversy over Tyranny finally eased after this match.</p>
<p>Apart from these two matches, there was also Samsara versus Misty Rain, ending 9 to 1. Samsara continued onwards with their unstoppable march. During the pre-season, people had been worried about compatibility issues between Sun Xiang and Samsara, but from the looks of it, Sun Xiang’s addition to the team was an exceptional move. Whether it was in the individual competitions or the team competition, Samsara’s strength had improved remarkably. If their momentum stayed, Sun Xiang’s and One Autumn Leaf’s transfer could definitely become a classic example of an amazing transfer in the history of Glory.</p>
<p>Apart from these powerhouses, the other powerhouse met with misfortune. Team Void had unexpectedly lost against visiting Team Miracle in their home game.</p>
<p>The other new team this season was not as weak as the other new teams in past seasons. The former Team Excellent Era players that made up Team Miracle showed why they had once been in a powerhouse team. After being swept by Team Blue Rain 10 to 0, Team Miracle was able to win a few points every round. This round was even more of an upset.</p>
<p>Although their 17 points at the moment was able to get them to 17th place, fourth from last, because they were a new team and because the other new team was very popular, the amount of attention towards Team Miracle was limited.</p>
<p>When Samsara complained about their demonic match schedule this season, if anyone had taken a look at Miracle’s schedule, they would have noticed that within these seven matches, Miracle had already run into Tyranny, Blue Rain, Tiny Herb, Wind Howl, Misty Rain, and Void.</p>
<p>Demonic schedule? Team Miracle’s was even worse. Despite their schedule, for their team to not even be in the relegations zone was already incredible. After this upset, Team Miracle finally received some attention. This team consisting of former Team Excellent Era players as the core had some substance to them.</p>
<p>Apart from these matches, the rest were practically all home team victories. Only Team Parade lost as the home team 4 to 6 against Team 301.</p>
<p>After these seven matches, Samsara remained at the top of the rankings with 58 points with Blue Rain in second. Thunderclap once again showed astonishing improvement. Thunderclap used to be a team pacing back and forth at the edge of the playoff zone. Right now, they had pushed their way to third place with 52 points, the same as Blue Rain. Fourth place, Wind Howl. Fifth place, Tiny Herb. Sixth place, Misty Rain. Seventh place, Void. Eighth place, Tyranny. Not much had changed between these eight playoff teams.</p>
<p>Happy crushed Heavenly Swords 10 to 0. With these 10 points, they were ranked 14th with a total of 29 points, one place up from last round. The bottom two relegation teams were Seaside and Bright Green. The gap between them and the other two teams had grown even wider. The distinction between top, middle, and bottom tier teams were becoming more and more clear.</p>
<p>That night, Happy accepted the hospitality of Heavenly Swords, who had suffered a crushing defeat by their hands. Heavenly Swords, of course, wasn’t in too great of a mood. Happy didn’t lose themselves just because of this long-awaited win though. At this moment, they were all concerned about one problem: Tang Rou. There was only one round remaining for her five round bet, and their opponents for this final round was Team Tiny Herb.</p>
<p>Complete a 1v3 against Tiny Herb?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, looking at past data, the situation was looking extremely unfavorable. Ever since Wang Jiexi joined Team Tiny Herb, Tiny Herb had never been 1v3ed in the group arena, whether this was against the Battle God, Sword Saint, King of Fighting, or the Great Gunner. The teams with those Gods may have won the group arena in the end, but a 1v3 had never been done before by anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, just because it had never been done before didn’t mean it couldn’t happen in the future. These statistics were also reported to let people know just how much of a challenge Tang Rou faced.</p>
<p>There were obviously people who were rejoicing at her misfortune and quite a lot of them too. At Happy, the most worried was Chen Guo, of course. She was too afraid to talk to Tang Rou, fearing that her uncontrollable nervousness would infect and disturb her. Right now, she really wanted to hear a concise solution from Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” she asked Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu only shook his head. “She can only rely on herself.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing you can do?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“It’s not possible to have a surefire method for something like a 1v3,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“What if… she fails? What do we do?” Chen Guo was worried!</p>
<p>“Then it’ll be her choice,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you help her choose 5 rounds? Why didn’t you say 50!” Chen Guo didn’t care about Ye Xiu’s previous explanation.</p>
<p>“Be more serious!” Ye Xiu looked at her and said.</p>
<p>Chen Guo was speechless. She wasn’t joking though. If Ye Xiu had said 50, perhaps this matter would have just been left as banter. But then again, even if a reporter like Ruan Cheng didn’t deny Happy that opportunity to regard it as a joke, Tang Rou herself might not accept it. When she really put her mind to it, she was quite scary. Chen Guo remembered when Tang Rou helped her complete the Heavenly Domain challenge. Once she had decided on doing it, she kept trying again and again, unable to be pulled away.</p>
<p>Chen Guo let out a long sigh. She had thought of too many ifs. In the end, what had to come would come.</p>
<p>October 25th, the eighth round of the Glory Pro League sounded. There were several powerhouse confrontations: Blue Rain vs Wind Howl, Tyranny vs Misty Rain, Samsara vs Void. However, the match chosen to be broadcast was Happy vs Tiny Herb.</p>
<p>1v3 in 5 rounds was the biggest topic of this match. Even though practically no one thought Tang Rou could do it, they still hoped to personally witness this moment. The broadcast team had chosen this match to comply with the popular opinion.</p>
<p>When it was almost 8 PM, the players on both sides entered the stadium. After greeting each other, the first players in the individual competition went onto the stage. But in the commentary, they still hadn’t started introducing these two players. They were still discussing Tang Rou’s 1v3.</p>
<p>“A poll on whether Tang Rou could complete this 1v3 just closed right before this match started. We can see that among the 65525 voters, 64388 voters thought that Tang Rou will not be able to achieve a 1v3. In other words, only 1137 people believed in Tang Rou, which comes out to about 1.7%, not even 2%. Coach Li, what are your thoughts?” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“Uh… even though Happy is a new team, they’re quite popular. We can see this from the number of seats filled in their home stadium. 1.7% means that many Happy supporters don’t think that Tang Rou can complete it. In addition, fans don’t always vote based on a logical analysis. Most of the times, they vote based on their feelings, a show of their well-wishes. However, from looking at how Happy’s supporters are voting, we can see that even among their fans, Tang Rou’s bold 1v3 promise is unpopular,” Li Yibo started speaking.</p>
<p>“Oh, then what are your thoughts, Coach Li?” Pan Lin asked.</p>
<p>“Haha, the courage and confidence of young players is laudable, but they can’t be too ignorant!” Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>“It looks like Coach Li doesn’t think highly of Tang Rou’s 1v3! Okay, then I’ll stand opposite to you. I’ll support Tang Rou.” Pan Lin laughed. His attitude was clearly just to liven up the atmosphere. It didn’t mean he was a true fan.</p>
<p>“If she can really do it, it’ll be a historical moment! If I remember correctly, according to past data, Team Tiny Herb has never been 1v3ed before, right?” Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>“Yes! I hope we can see this historical moment! Okay, the first round of the individual competition is about to begin. Happy will be sending out their team captain, the former owner of the Battle God One Autumn Leaf. Nicknamed the Glory Textbook, Ye Xiu is using the unspecialized Lord Grim, a character that has received much attention this season. As for Tiny Herb, they sent out their new generation Witch, the genius Gao Yingjie. This could be considered a confrontation between two generations. The map chosen is Red Plum Pavilion. Coach Li, who do you think will win?” When the match went underway, Pan Lin immediately stopped discussing the topic of Tang Rou’s 1v3 and started talking about this confrontation. Asking about predictions of the outcome was a common topic for commentators. In reality, the question wasn’t simply for predictions on who would win. In order to make a prediction, an introduction and analysis of the two opposing players had to be done, so it always worked as a conversation topic.</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu is experienced, he’s familiar with every class, and he uses an unspecialized. These are where his advantages lay. However, Gao Yingjie has grown into a youth that can take charge. He’s young. He has energy. And to Ye Xiu, Gao Yingjie is perhaps an unfamiliar player. They have never fought before.” Li Yibo was familiar with how to reply to this type of question. He lay bare the advantages that both sides possessed and didn’t talk about his actual prediction. When the outcome of the match became clear, he could just follow up: See, I told you guys XX is very XXXX!</p>
<p>As for this fight? Who would be Li Yibo’s justification this time? At this moment, the two sides finally started clashing.</p>
<p>Chapter 1187: Carefully Honed Talent</p>
<p>Magic Missile!</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie’s Kind Tree started out simple, testing the waters with a not-so-powerful Magic Missile.</p>
<p>Lord Grim dodged easily. Obviously, he didn’t lack in ranged methods of attack. Myriad Manifestations Umbrella raised, three Anti-Tank Missiles seemed to have been swung out, roaring with a fiery tail as they flew at their target.</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie’s Kind Tree immediately waved a hand, and a star shaped symbol was tossed out, transforming into a Magic Ray as it darted forth.</p>
<p>Star Ray?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>This Magic Ray accurately struck one of the Anti-Tank Missiles, then immediately rebounded towards another, then another, and then sped right for Lord Grim.</p>
<p>This was a variant of Star Ray: Star Refraction. Compared to Star Ray, it wasn’t as powerful, but one could utilize the distinguishing feature of this refraction to create unexpected attacks. Currently, after refracting thrice, the three Anti-Tank Missiles had already exploded in midair, light flashing and smoke billowing. As for Lord Grim? He had no choice but to dodge the attack that came refracted at him.</p>
<p>With his sidestep, Kind Tree was already charging out of the smoke and fire, directly at Lord Grim. With a wave of his hand, a Lava Flask was thrown down, and soon after, he was swinging his broom at Lord Grim. Gao Yingjie’s flurry of attacks quickly followed swiftly after his Star Refraction, barely giving Ye Xiu any chance to react.</p>
<p>Sword Draw!</p>
<p>The broom was about to hit Lord Grim’s head when a blade of light flashed out. Because of the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella’s transformative abilities, it often hid a lot of very easily-distinguishable skills in strange movements. This Sword Draw was exactly this. However, the prodigious Gao Yingjie reacted swiftly. Kind Tree’s advance immediately stopped and turned into a backwards jump.</p>
<p>The ground had already melted under the Lava Flask, but Ye Xiu refused to give up such a good opening. Lord Grim used a Knight’s Charge and pursued Kind Tree against the damage from the lava.</p>
<p>The two figures moved, immediately changing positions. Lord Grim came over with his Charge while Gao Yingjie’s Kind Tree avoided the attack by getting on his broom mid-jump.</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie’s reaction speed was truly amazing. Even Ye Xiu was a little surprised at his miss. However, a counterattack immediately followed.</p>
<p>Broom Tornado!</p>
<p>Just barely dodging this attack by riding his broom, Kind Tree immediately turned his broom and quickly swung it down at Lord Grim. The entire process looked as if Kind Tree had simply switched directions twice in midair, smoothly and clearly.</p>
<p>This time, Lord Grim didn’t have the time to dodge. With the rapid spinning of the broom that Broom Tornado created, it was hard to parry as well. Ye Xiu could only go onto the defensive, raising his sword horizontally with a Blade Master’s Guard. What followed was the continuous sound of the broom clashing with the edge of the sword. Broom Tornado battered at Lord Grim at high speed, sweeping him back.</p>
<p>Star Ray!</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie wasn’t greedy. Just as the Broom Tornado was going strong, he suddenly canceled the skill and threw out a Star Ray. At such a close distance, there was no way Lord Grim could dodge. The Magic Ray hit, causing Lord Grim to stumble. Kind Tree’s broom was already enchanted with Frost Powder. As it was whipped through the air, it left a trail of shattered ice crystals in the air as it slapped down at Lord Grim.</p>
<p>For melee combat, Witches mostly just used normal attacks, but with specialized magic tools, they could enhance their weapon’s damage and enchant their weapon with special effects. For example, Frost Powder had the chance of freezing the target directly. Even if you were unlucky, it would still inflict a slow. Everything depended on the target’s resistance.</p>
<p>Now, the number of pieces of Silver equipment on Lord Grim’s body was slowly increasing, but he still mostly had Orange equipment. This meant his stats were easy to figure out. Gao Yingjie currently used Frost Powder naturally because he had realized that Lord Grim didn’t have much of a resistance to ice.</p>
<p>Slap, slap, slap…</p>
<p>That was how Witches attacked. Even with Frost Powder, normal attacks wouldn’t do any significant damage, but if he was hit and frozen, that would be dreadful.</p>
<p>Kind Tree started off with three consecutive attacks which Lord Grim barely dodged. The fourth attack, Gao Yingjie knew the other wouldn’t be able to dodge, but that was when Lord Grim threw a handful of powder over as well…</p>
<p>This was…</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie recognized it immediately, but Kind Tree’s attack was already sweeping forth, he didn’t have time to retract it.</p>
<p>A hit!</p>
<p>As expected, Ye Xiu couldn’t dodge this attack, but it was just a hit. What could a normal attack do?</p>
<p>Freezing effect?</p>
<p>It was gone… What Lord Grim had thrown just now was something Gao Yingjie was more than familiar with, the Witch’s Disperse Powder. The effect of Frost Powder on his weapon also counted as a buff. When met with Disperse Powder, it was immediately neutralized.</p>
<p>However, only the Frost Powder was neutralized, not Kind Tree’s attack. This hit was just a normal attack, without the wanted freeze effect, but with the following attack, Gao Yingjie was already attempting to inflict his own effects.</p>
<p>Sweep!</p>
<p>The broom swept up diagonally with the Witch’s knock-up skill. Lord Grim was immediately suspended in the air. Gao Yingjie quickly followed after with Kind Tree to take this chance to unleash a combo, but instead saw the suspended Lord Grim facing him, looking straight at him.</p>
<p>A trap!!!</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie instantly realized.</p>
<p>When struck with a knock-up skill, it was impossible to adjust your position so well, so there was only one explanation: Lord Grim hadn’t actually been struck; he had merely jumped up. Ye Xiu had predicted his next move and cooperated to create the illusion that he had been struck, and then he would launch an unexpected counterattack…</p>
<p>The light of a blade flashed and Lord Grim plummeted with a Falling Light Blade. Gao Yingjie was already having Kind Tree hurriedly avoid it, but Falling Light Blade…</p>
<p>With this attack, it was clear that Ye Xiu had once again predicted Gao Yingjie’s next move. Falling Light Blade’s small shockwave was just enough to capture Kind Tree.</p>
<p>Kind Tree, hit by the shockwave, was knocked to the side. Gao Yingjie rushed to Quick Recover, but Lord Grim had already pursued him over, swing down from overhead with a Collapsing Mountain.</p>
<p>Was Collapsing Mountain a hard to dodge attack? No, but the problem was the timing Ye Xiu chose. He attacked right as Kind Tree was in the middle of his Quick Recover. He couldn’t really cancel, but continuing wouldn’t do him any good, and it was too late to change directions.</p>
<p>Another trap!</p>
<p>What a troublesome opponent….</p>
<p>In the Season 8, Gao Yingjie rarely had chances to play, so he hadn’t fought Ye Xiu before. Afterwards, they had come to a few exchanges in the online game. In the new server, at the beginning, they had been crushed by the unspecialized with their low leveled classes. There was no helping that. For the unspecialized, if it wasn’t for the lack of skill points, the class would be mature at level 20. But what about other classes? When they were level twenty, they only had five skills for their class. Even if they learned more from other classes of the same type, that couldn’t compare to the unspecialized. Fewer skills meant fewer variations, then, considering how they were against God Ye Xiu with his comprehensive knowledge, their attacks would be easily seen through and dealt with. Training with Ye Xiu in the new server was a painful memory.</p>
<p>Back then, Tiny Herb’s members all had the same thought. They all believed that their immature characters had crippled their ability, and would naturally be at a disadvantage against the unspecialized. If it wasn’t so, then the result would be very different.</p>
<p>Now, fighting Ye Xiu one on one, Gao Yingjie really wanted to tell those teammates the truth. With a mature character, it really was different from using a low leveled character, but if you were to say the result would be different when fighting Ye Xiu, that wasn’t necessarily true. Even with Kind Tree, Gao Yingjie still felt that he was using the low leveled character he had once used against Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>All of his intentions had been seen through, his every move predicted. The attacks God Ye Xiu executed weren’t magnificent, but they were inescapable, always timed when you were incapable of dodging. How did he manage to hone his awareness and experience to such a degree? Gao Yingjie was suddenly a little envious. He had hand speed; he was quick at reacting; he could switch between playstyles and combinations whenever he wished. He was a prodigy; he was far faster at learning, at mastering anything thrown his way than other people. However, it was impossible for him to gain the carefully honed talent God Ye Xiu had sharpened from who knew how many battles.</p>
<p>It seemed as if everything that he was doing was being discerned and analyzed.</p>
<p>This feeling was so intense. Even against his captain, Wang Jiexi, Gao Yingjie had never felt such an imposing pressure. Shouldn’t his captain understand him better than God Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>His usual combinations wouldn’t be of any use. He had to do something that the other wouldn’t be able to predict!</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie, after losing the initiative, fell into a helpless situation. No matter how he switched up his tactics, he wasn’t able to escape Lord Grim’s control.</p>
<p>From the outside, it seemed that he wasn’t at such a disadvantage. Occasionally, he would still find chances to counterattack. In the beginning, that’s what Gao Yingjie thought as well, but soon enough, he realized that while he had accurately grasped these seemingly valuable chances, he never managed to achieve what he had been intending. He could send out a few counterattacks every now and then, but in the blink of an eye, Ye Xiu would have taken back the advantage.</p>
<p>Thus, he came to a realization. These so-called chances were all under Ye Xiu’s control as well. No one would dare say that their fighting was flawless, but Ye Xiu was able to keep the openings he revealed under his control. Thus, Gao Yingjie might’ve grasped chance after chance, but was never able to make anything out of it.</p>
<p>So this was the Glory Textbook? The strongest player in the history of Glory?</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie gazed at the weird character, swinging a strange weapon, and wearing an uncomfortably mismatched set of equipment, with fearful reverence.</p>
<p>He really is strong, but, I can’t give up just like this!</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie grit his teeth. Kind Tree didn’t have much health left, and he still wasn’t able to find an opening to turn the tides. His only choice was to go all out!</p>
<p>Glory!</p>
<p>When the word flashed on the screen, the match came to an end.</p>
<p>So in the end, he still lost?</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie stared at the fallen Kind Tree, stunned.</p>
<p>Chapter 1188: Grinding Out a Win</p>
<p>Happy welcomed the visiting Tiny Herb. After Ye Xiu won the first round of the individual competition, the two competitors walked down from the stage.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Wang Jiexi looked at Gao Yingjie, who had just been beaten by Ye Xiu and was looking a bit downcast.</p>
<p>“Amazing…” Gao Yingjie said. “He’s even stronger than I imagined.”</p>
<p>“But you’re still young. Keep working hard, and one day you will surpass everyone,” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>The Gao Yingjie of two years ago may have been named a genius and carried the hopes of countless people, but he had never dared to be so ambitious. He had always felt like having a seat in this team and playing on the competitive stage was already very, very good.</p>
<p>However, everyone in the club from top to bottom, his team captain, his teammates, they all had extremely high expectations of him. Just a member on the team? No, not nearly enough. Tiny Herb was expecting him to be the team’s pillar, the one who would hold up Tiny Herb’s banner after their captain Wang Jiexi retired.</p>
<p>Could he do it?</p>
<p>His goals were forced onto him. When he looked towards the figure of the Magician, Gao Yingjie had doubted himself more than just once. He felt like his captain was so strong. How could he ever hope to reach his level?</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to be more confident in Gao Yingjie than Gao Yingjie himself. While wallowing in uncertainty, Gao Yingjie grew, following what he was told blindly. Up until that day, the Season 8 All Stars Rookie Challenge, where he beat his captain under the gazes of millions of people.</p>
<p>At that time, Gao Yingjie had been astonished. He couldn’t believe it. It was then that a seed had finally started to sprout in his heart.</p>
<p>So I really can do it.</p>
<p>Gao Yingjie began to think to himself. After that, practicing and growing, Gao Yingjie changed beyond recognition. He had found confidence in himself. He had recognized his potential. He could firmly advance towards that goal, which he had once thought as inconceivable.</p>
<p>That season, because he hadn’t appeared in enough matches, he didn’t have the qualifications for the title of Best Rookie. However, this wasn’t important. In Season 9, Gao Yingjie became part of the starting lineup, directly learning, growing, battling alongside the person he would surpass and succeed. He was chosen as an All-Star and became one of the top 24 players in the competitive scene.</p>
<p>He had yet to reach the level of his captain, but Wang Jiexi had already given him a new target.</p>
<p>Surpass everyone!</p>
<p>And this time, Gao Yingjie didn’t panic. He would work hard towards this goal. The road to Glory had no limit.</p>
<p>In the broadcast, commentator Pan Lin and guest Li Yibo hurried to give a recap of the brilliant plays that happened in this match. Pan Lin looked at the data in his hands and suddenly said, “Coach Li, I just discovered something. Happy has been the center of attention with so much to talk about, but there’s a reality that everyone seems to have missed.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What is it?” asked Li Yibo.</p>
<p>“After Samsara clean swept them in the Round 1, Ye Xiu began coming out as Happy’s first player in their individual competitions. So far, he has a perfect record in these seven rounds, in seven individual matches. This is something that somehow no one noticed,” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“Oh? Really?” Li Yibo immediately grabbed the data in his hands. Data from too far in the past might not be there, but the win records for the two teams this season should all be there.</p>
<p>“You’re right…” Li Yibo looked at the data and confirmed it twice before continuing, “With this match, he’s won seven consecutive individual matches. To think no one’s reported on this yet.”</p>
<p>“Even if Team Happy’s win record at this point isn’t too ideal, this point shouldn’t be covered up!” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“Yes… seven consecutive wins. If I remember correctly, he’s tied for the most consecutive individual wins in Glory history, no?” Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>The two of them didn’t have this information on hand, but Pan Lin quickly found someone to search and confirm it. “Correct, the current best record for consecutive individual wins is seven, which had been set by Team Blue Rain’s Yu Feng in Season 8.”</p>
<p>“It looks like Ye Xiu’s name is going to have to be added to it,” Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps he’ll be the only one?” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“Who’s Happy’s opponents next round?” Li Yibo asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s see… Miracle…” After Pan Lin found it, he became silent.</p>
<p>Li Yibo was suddenly speechless too. Miracle. Ignoring everything else, if this was just a 1v1, it was practically giving away this point to Ye Xiu. This team’s foundation consisted of former Excellent Era players, who had grown under Ye Xiu’s hands. As for the others, they were new rookies that had joined along with Miracle; their skill levels were subpar. It would be embarrassing to compare them with a God.</p>
<p>“Uh, let’s go back to the match!” Li Yibo dragged the topic back to the match. Even though he had already given Ye Xiu eight wins in his heart, since the match hadn’t been played yet, it wouldn’t be good to talk about it.</p>
<p>The second players for the individual competition walked onto the stage.</p>
<p>Happy. Su Mucheng. Launcher, Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>Tiny Herb. Xu Bin. Knight, Angelica.</p>
<p>Xu Bin. During his time in Team 301, he had earned the nickname “Grind King”.</p>
<p>This nickname wasn’t a pretty one, but it was quite a mighty one. It really was the best title for Xu Bin’s playstyle though. After joining the championship team Tiny Herb, Xu Bin didn’t lose his defining feature. Instead, because of the support from better teammates, his speciality improved a step further. Last season, he had been voted into All-Stars at 14th place.</p>
<p>Against Su Mucheng, Xu Bin obviously wouldn’t abandon his style. After encountering his opponent and being suppressed by heavy gunfire from Dancing Rain, he didn’t panic. For someone to be named “Grind King,” he possessed unimaginable toughness. Xu Bin contended patiently with Su Mucheng. It was as if he was also a long-ranged class, but in reality, he had absolutely no attacks that could pose any threat to her. He fought with Su Mucheng in a situation where he couldn’t fight back, dodging and defending to skillfully dissolve Dancing Rain’s attacks. At the same time, Angelica tried hard to decrease the distance between the two of them.</p>
<p>Grind King didn’t mean Xu Bin was slow and that his playing wasn’t clean. It was pointing to his style, where he wore down his opponent’s spirit and skills, grinding at the opponent’s patience and pushing the opponent’s mentality off balance, or perhaps grinding until the opponent was tired. In any case, his playstyle led to openings. And whenever an opening appeared, Xu Bin’s offensive would be like a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Knight’s Spirit!</p>
<p>The instant he saw the opportunity, Xu Bin immediately had Angelica activate his awakening skill. Along with a Heroic Charge and a Justice Leap, he instantly closed the distance between himself and Dancing Rain. Su Mucheng wanted to Dancing Rain to retreat, but Angelica had used Sacrificial Roar, forcing Dancing Rain to continue attacking him. Before this, Angelica had activated an Honest Maelstrom Counterattack. Launcher attacks could also be returned by this skill…</p>
<p>In the end, Xu Bin won. The margin of victory wasn’t large, and he wasn’t particularly dominant, but all the matches he won seemed to be like this…</p>
<p>“Good job,” Wang Jiexi said to Xu Bin. He appreciated Xu Bin’s consistency very much.</p>
<p>Tiny Herb’s third player for the individual competition started getting ready.</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai. Ghostblade, Rangoon Creeper.</p>
<p>Of the eight rounds this season, this was Zhou Yebai’s third time appearing in the individual competition. To be sent out so many times was worthy of being excited about for a substitute player like Zhou Yebai. However, the individual competition? Zhou Yebai didn’t really understand. He was a Ghostblade. It wasn’t that he had no individual combat capabilities, but of the players in the team, Zhou Yebai really didn’t think that he was better than any of the others in 1v1s, but their team captain didn’t pick the others and picked him again and again in the individual competition. On the other hand, for the team competition, of the eight rounds, he had only appeared once, which truly confused him.</p>
<p>He had lost the last two times he went up. What about this time?</p>
<p>He didn’t understand this arrangement, but he respected his team captain’s wishes, so he upped his spirits and went onto the stage. On the way there, he lifted his head and looked up at the screen to see who his opponent would be.</p>
<p>Team Happy. Qiao Yifan. Ghostblade, One Inch Ash.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai turned his head in astonishment and saw Qiao Yifan almost at Happy’s player booth.</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai subconsciously glanced at his teammates. He saw that everyone was looking at Qiao Yifan too.</p>
<p>In the pro scene, players came and went. Teammates today, opponents tomorrow. It was very common. Those who had played for a few years all experienced this, but Qiao Yifan… Zhou Yebai had never really thought of him as a teammate. Qiao Yifan had been more like a busboy?</p>
<p>But right now, this busboy had found his home, and he had even changed classes to be a Ghostblade just like him. Qiao Yifan’s position in Team Happy was more firm than his, and he had appeared on stage this season more times than Zhou Yebai had.</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai hadn’t been interested in this individual competition at first, but now a sliver of fighting spirit rose.</p>
<p>Yes, just a sliver.</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan was just a lowly busboy. He even changed classes. How good could he be? He’s probably the same as when he had been playing with a… a what? Zhou Yebai suddenly realized that he couldn’t even remember what class Qiao Yifan played before in Tiny Herb.</p>
<p>He was probably so bad that he didn’t leave an impression on me? Zhou Yebai thought to himself.</p>
<p>Do you think that just because of you’ve switched classes, you’re an ugly duckling that turned into a swan? Today I’ll definitely teach you a good lesson!</p>
<p>The characters loaded into the map and the match began…</p>
<p>“Yifan, long time no see!” Zhou Yebai had his Rangoon Creeper advance as he greeted Qiao Yifan in the public chat. In his heart, he was wondering how he should teach this Qiao Yifan how a Phantom Demon was played.</p>
<p>“Senior, long time no see,” Qiao Yifan replied. Apart from Gao Yingjie, everyone else in Team Tiny Herb were his seniors.</p>
<p>“So you’ve switched to a Phantom Demon. Nice job!” Zhou Yebai said.</p>
<p>“Thank you senior for your praise,” Qiao Yifan said.</p>
<p>“Is there anything that you don’t understand, that you’d like me to show you in this match?” Zhou Yebai wasn’t modest at all.</p>
<p>“Sure… I’m behind you,” Qiao Yifan said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1189: Ghost Chaining</p>
<p>Behind?!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai went pale with shock upon seeing this message, hurriedly having Rangoon Creeper turn around.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qiao Yifan was focused on the match, and not here to joke around. He had tactically managed to swerve around and get behind Rangoon Creeper. When he sent the message, One Inch Ash’s sword was already on its way down.</p>
<p>Moonlight Slash!</p>
<p>Phantom Demons usually wouldn’t put too many skill points into slash attacks, and Qiao Yifan didn’t intend for damage to be the purpose of this strike. It was just a simple opening attack. Unless the other was under a Super Armor status, any attack would be enough to disrupt the target a little. Combos were built upon such a foundation.</p>
<p>It was definitely far too late for Zhou Yebai to dodge after seeing Qiao Yifan’s message. Considering Qiao Yifan’s caution, he naturally wouldn’t expose himself without having an absolute grasp on the situation. Zhou Yebai’s Rangoon Creeper had happily and brainlessly charged forward, while speaking with Qiao Yifan like a senior to his junior in the chat. Meanwhile, Qiao Yifan’s One Inch Ash had successfully and precisely gotten behind the other. The audience could see all of this with clarity. Zhou Yebai had become a joke at the very start of the match, one that didn’t seem to understand his own place at all.</p>
<p>Now, moonlight arced downwards, not doing much damage, but still stunning Rangoon Creeper for a split second. One Inch Ash followed up with a Ghost Claw. A sliver of the Phantom Ghost’s power drifted through the air, throwing Rangoon Creeper up. This was the Ghostblade’s knockup skill.</p>
<p>Knockups were usually a good time to follow up with a combo, but for a Phantom Demon, they shouldn’t hurry and deal as much damage with slashes as possible, but quickly set down as many Ghost Boundaries as possible.</p>
<p>Ice Boundary!</p>
<p>Plague Boundary!</p>
<p>Ghost Boundaries had cast times, so you couldn’t instantly set a boundary. It was a struggle to finish casting these two Ghost Boundaries during Rangoon Creeper’s knockup. However, Qiao Yifan very smoothly transitioned between the two Ghost Boundaries. After setting down an Ice Boundary first, he began chanting a Plague Boundary, carefully keeping an eye on Rangoon Creeper. Upon seeing the other land, Qiao Yifan was prepared to cancel the chant already, but the effects of Ice Boundary activated!</p>
<p>Rangoon Creeper, slowed by the Ice Boundary, definitely wouldn’t be able to get to One Inch Ash’s side in time. His blade trembled, and instead he sent forward a Spellblade skill: Earthquake Sword.</p>
<p>He could make it!</p>
<p>Qiao Yifan made an accurate judgement. Even as the Earthquake Sword came over, he continued his cast. The Plague Boundary was set before the Earthquake Sword swept at him, as expected. He wasn’t interrupted. After that, he had One Inch Ash roll to the side and Earthquake Sword was dodged cleanly. Qiao Yifan was very familiar with the characteristics of these skills.</p>
<p>Plague Boundary lowered the defense of the characters inside the boundary. If he didn’t attack, then there was no point to the Plague Boundary. Zhou Yebai was a Phantom Demon player, so how would he not understand this? Now, in two overlapping boundaries, he didn’t ignore everything and try to run out of the two boundaries, but instead carefully observed One Inch Ash’s movements. He couldn’t predict what Qiao Yifan would do next. That was when he realized, despite living together for a year, seeing each other everyday for a year, he didn’t understand Qiao Yifan at all. Perhaps, as a team member that he often had to train with, he knew a little of Qiao Yifan’s style in Glory, but now, Qiao Yifan had switched classes to the class he was most familiar with: Phantom Demon.</p>
<p>What was Qiao Yifan’s Phantom Demon like? Zhou Yebai didn’t have a clue. However, he believed that he had more experience as a Phantom Demon than Qiao Yifan. He might’ve been caught off guard in the beginning, but, so long as he didn’t panic, and kept a clear view of the situation, dealing with each action as it came, there was nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Ice Boundary, Plague Boundary, one focused on control, another focused on weakening. These two boundaries wouldn’t deal any significant damage, he could slow down his pace and observe slowly. Bring it, Qiao Yifan!</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>What was this?</p>
<p>On the screen, the blade in One Inch Ash’s hand was spinning. It was less like an attack and more like some sort of spell being cast. As a Phantom Demon player, how could Zhou Yebai not know what this was?</p>
<p>The Ice and Plague Boundaries under Rangoon Creeper’s feet seemed to be responding to come sort of summons, the Phantom Ghost’s power pulsing, resonating! Zhou Yebai wanted to get his Rangoon Creeper out of the boundaries, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>Ghost Feast!</p>
<p>With only two Ghost Boundaries on the field, Qiao Yifan already had One Inch Ash use Ghost Feast.</p>
<p>The two pools of the Phantom Ghost’s power, representing ice and plague erupted. Compared to a Ghost Feast with multiple overlaid boundaries, the power of the explosion of two boundaries had been reduced, but was also much clearer. Everyone could even see Rangoon Creeper struggling under the corrosive power of the Phantom Ghost’s power.</p>
<p>The match had just started and Zhou Yebai had taken an ultimate to the face, but now his nervousness after being ambushed had disappeared along with it.</p>
<p>A Ghost Feast with just two Ghost Boundaries?</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai wanted to laugh. From his point of view, this was a display of Qiao Yifan’s lack of experience and his stress from facing him. He couldn’t figure out what to do next, so he just hurriedly made the Ghost Boundaries erupt. Every little bit of damage counted, after all.</p>
<p>How pitiful!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai lamented to himself. Did the other really think that he’d become something great just by switching classes? How naive!</p>
<p>“Grow up already!” Zhou Yebai sent into the chat, admonishingly, as Rangoon Creeper charged out of the smoke and lights made by the opposing Phantom Ghost’s power.</p>
<p>Moonlight Slash, then Full Moonlight Slash!</p>
<p>The two strikes were formed as one, arcing beautifully through the air, but, if there was nothing to hit, then the two arcs of light merely looked awkward!</p>
<p>Where was he?</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai was shocked.</p>
<p>He had seen One Inch Ash at this very spot just now. He was fast enough, so how could this happen? How was this possible?</p>
<p>What on earth happened?</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai was shocked, the audience was shocked and Pan Lin, in the middle of his commentary, was also shocked.</p>
<p>“What is Zhou Yebai doing?” Pan Lin wondered aloud. The audience, with their omniscient view, clearly saw Qiao Yifan’s One Inch Ash standing just off to the side behind Rangoon Creeper, but Zhou Yebai had Rangoon Creeper strike the air with a beautiful two hit combo while yelling something like that. Was this some sort of… tactical trap?</p>
<p>“Er…” Li Yibo was very awkward. As a special guest and commentator, as Adviser Li, he had to give an answer in this sort of situation. However… what the hell was this guy doing? Li Yibo was very confused as well.</p>
<p>“Let’s watch the match first!” Coach Li’s commentary IQ was expert level. Knowing that the players on the field wouldn’t give them time to analyze this one detail, he quickly suggested they watch first, analyze later.</p>
<p>One Inch Ash, stood behind Rangoon Creeper, had already struck. By the time Rangoon Creeper’s two slashes were soaring through nothing, another Ghost Boundary had been placed. Dark Boundary! Another boundary that focused on inflicting a status effect. This time, Qiao Yifan wanted to take Zhou Yebai’s sight.</p>
<p>The screen went dark…</p>
<p>Dark Boundary!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai immediately realized what this meant.</p>
<p>Where was this guy? Where did this Ghost Boundary come from?</p>
<p>A chill ran through Zhou Yebai’s heart as he stared at the dark screen that looked like it had shut down. He was finally feeling pressured. Qiao Yifan was no longer someone he could defeat with ease. Definitely not.</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai was so shocked that he forgot to move. One of the characteristics of Ghost Boundaries was that while inside, you’d definitely feel the effects, but as soon as you stepped out, then it’d all disappear. Characters in a Dark Boundary would be blinded, so no character would give up trying to make their character move out of it. They’d usually even use movement skills to help them move a large distance at once, just to escape this annoying effect.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Yebai, too lost in the shock over the trouble Qiao Yifan was giving him, forgot such a crucial thing as to move.</p>
<p>He was stunned, but Qiao Yifan wasn’t. One Inch Ash closed in, sending out slash attacks and setting down ghost boundaries whenever given an opening.</p>
<p>One boundary…</p>
<p>Two boundaries…</p>
<p>Three boundaries…</p>
<p>The effects of Ghost Boundaries were stackable, but Qiao Yifan didn’t let all the Ghost Boundaries he send out overlap completely. The boundaries overlapped, chained together across a larger area. The very center had several overlapping Ghost Boundaries, but as you got further away from the center, some areas only had one or two boundaries presiding over them. However, with this arrangement, the area under One Inch Ash’s control had greatly increased. The Dark Boundary had disappeared by then and Zhou Yebai’s sight returned, but he couldn’t escape the control of the chained Ghost Boundaries at all.</p>
<p>This was…</p>
<p>Ghost Chaining!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai recognized this playstyle and was once again filled with shock. Ghost Chaining required a player to have a very good awareness of the situation at large. Each boundary was set down individually, but needed to be placed so that it formed a whole with the other Ghost Boundaries. As a player did this, they also had to use slash attacks to fill in the gaps left by the Ghost Boundaries. The timing of these slashes, of these boundaries, what boundaries to place, where to place them, they all needed to be planned out. It wasn’t something a person could achieve by mechanics alone.</p>
<p>This guy… can use Ghost Chaining, and so well… As for me…</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai didn’t want to admit it, but had no choice. He was incapable of performing such a beautifully done Ghost Chaining.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai felt like he was going crazy. This was Qiao Yifan? That little nobody? Had he really already mastered something as high end as Ghost Chaining? Was his skill already above mine?</p>
<p>No! Impossible!</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai didn’t believe it, or rather, he didn’t want to believe it. How could that Qiao Yifan be so strong? How could he defeat me?</p>
<p>Of course he could!</p>
<p>Glory!</p>
<p>When the word flashed on the screen, Zhou Yebai’s Rangoon Creeper had fallen with his denial and disbelief. When he walked out of the competition booth, his face was still set in an expression of disbelief. He returned to Tiny Herb’s player stands, head down as he stood to the side.</p>
<p>He had lost to Qiao Yifan, that Qiao Yifan…</p>
<p>“Someone you never bothered to take notice of has grown to such an extent… Is it scary?” Wang Jiexi suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say. He suddenly realized, if Qiao Yifan hadn’t left, if Qiao Yifan was still in Tiny Herb, both of them as Phantom Demons, would he still have a place in Tiny Herb?</p>
<p>Zhou Yebai suddenly felt a creeping sense of terror. He knew that Qiao Yifan was no longer in Tiny Herb and he wouldn’t have to compete with the other for this place, but he still felt a formless pressure on his shoulders, trying to tell him something.</p>
<p>“You can’t stagnate! In this Alliance, survival is swimming against the tide,” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1190: New Ghostblade Technique</p>
<p>With the three individual rounds over, Happy was in the lead 2 to 1. There would be a short break before the group arena, but the commentator and special guest still had much to do. Due to Qiao Yifan’s beautiful Ghost Chaining, they still had a mystery to uncover! Li Yibo wanted to just leave this be, but Pan Lin, at a time like this, just simply refused to sync to his rhythm. After hurriedly going over the current progression and situation of the round, he immediately returned to the match that had just occurred, and immediately returned to the mystery they had left unsolved.</p>
<p>“Zhou Yebai’s mistake really shouldn’t have occurred. Isn’t his judgment way off?” The broadcast cooperated with Pan Lin’s commentary and was currently giving a playback of Rangoon Creeper’s beautiful two strike combo. It was aimed at nothing, completely ignoring One Inch Ash behind him.</p>
<p>“Such a weird mistake wouldn’t be without reason, right?” With Li Yibo refusing to cooperate, Pan Lin could only keep talking to himself, asking the program director to switch to Zhou Yebai’s point of view at the same time.</p>
<p>“Wait!” The scene flashed by and Li Yibo suddenly yelled, seeming to have noticed something.</p>
<p>“What?” The scene paused.</p>
<p>“Go back, slow motion!” Li Yibo’s voice had twisted a little.</p>
<p>Pan Lin didn’t understand, but still had the broadcast director cooperate, rewinding the recording and replaying it.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Li Yibo suddenly cried out.</p>
<p>The prepared broadcast director stopped the scene. Li Yibo pointed at a point on the screen: look here!</p>
<p>In Zhou Yebai’s point of view, there was the lighting effect of the explosion after the Ice and Plague Boundaries had been blown up by Ghost Feast, and right in front of him, there was the clear cut silhouette of a person.</p>
<p>“One Inch Ash!” Pan Lin yelled, “One Inch Ash really did appear there. There was nothing wrong with Zhou Yebai’s judgment, but…”</p>
<p>“Keep this scene, switch the view,” Li Yibo directly interrupted him.</p>
<p>Pan Lin was stunned, but still had the broadcast switch to an full view.</p>
<p>“Hey!” After switching, Pan Lin cried out, unable to control his surprise. In the full view, One Inch Ash wasn’t there at all. He had already arrived behind Rangoon Creeper by then, about to get to the position he had launched his offense from.</p>
<p>“What on earth is happening?” Pan Lin was shocked, switching the shot back and seeing the silhouette of One Inch Ash once more.</p>
<p>“This…” Pan Lin stared, and stared some more, and suddenly gave a “ah!”</p>
<p>“Do you see it now?” Li Yibo asked.</p>
<p>“This… This…” Pan Lin grabbed the mouse, tracing the cursor over the image, over the edge of the silhouette of “One Inch Ash”.</p>
<p>“This isn’t One Inch Ash at all, but a silhouette formed by the lighting from the explosion of the two Ghost Boundaries,” Li Yibo explained.</p>
<p>“This… Is this something created by the system?” Pan Lin suspected.</p>
<p>“Probably not.” Li Yibo shook his head. He had never heard of anything like it.</p>
<p>“A coincidence?”</p>
<p>“We probably won’t know until Qiao Yifan is interviewed,” Li Yibo guessed.</p>
<p>The audience at the venue all saw the scene and commentary in the TV broadcast through the big screen, seeing the silhouette made in that moment by the two boundaries of Ghost Feast.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the crowd that was surprised. Even the pro players at their respective benches, including Gods like Ye Xiu and Wang Jiexi, were all dumbstruck.</p>
<p>This was something unique that they had never seen during their pro careers, such a lifelike silhouette… It was a coincidence, right?</p>
<p>Tiny Herb’s members could only guess, but Happy’s members could be more direct. They all turned their heads as one to face Qiao Yifan, using their gazes to prompt him to explain.</p>
<p>“Ah… This, is something I discovered by accident,” Qiao Yifan said.</p>
<p>“You created it purposefully!” Ye Xiu’s surprise didn’t fade because he knew that, for something like this, noticing was one thing, but replication was something else entirely.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I tried to practice it, I’m just lucky that Luo Ji helped me with the calculations involved,” Qiao Yifan said, pulling out Luo Ji to give him credit. Luo Ji was usually at school, but when it came to matchday Saturday, he would swiftly rush to the stadium to regroup with everyone else. It was tiring, but if he couldn’t even make it to the matches, then there really was no point in being a pro player at all.</p>
<p>“Just a little,” Luo Ji hurriedly added, having been pushed into the spotlight.</p>
<p>“Amazing!” Ye Xiu complimented. Setting aside the practicality of this technique for now, for such a young player to have such creativity and spirit to research a new technique was something praiseworthy. Ye Xiu dared to be certain that this was an unprecedented new technique, something that even the All-Star level Ghostblades of Void hadn’t even discovered.</p>
<p>“Ah… It’s alright! I just felt like it might be of some use.” Qiao Yifan was at a loss in the face of such a compliment.</p>
<p>“When we get back, let’s all discuss together,” Ye Xiu decided with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Qiao Yifan was very happy too. This acknowledgement was something he’d never get tired of.</p>
<p>The break after the individual competition soon ended. The following group arena would be the focus of this match, of all the matches this round. The reason the TV broadcast would choose this match was also mainly because of this group arena.</p>
<p>The venue suddenly fell silent. The Happy fans at their home stadium felt way too conflicted about this match that would decide the the result of the 1v3 promise.</p>
<p>Tang Rou stood from her seat. Five rounds… She had already failed four rounds, but her gaze was as determined as ever. Even though her opponent was Tiny Herb, even though no one had ever achieved a 1v3 against this team, Tang Rou didn’t feel a trace of hesitation or fear.</p>
<p>“I’m going.”</p>
<p>She gave her teammates a simple goodbye and went onstage. Seeing her, the Happy fans continued to be at a loss, uncertain how to respond. Instead, it was Tiny Herb that erupted into cheering and support when their first player Liu Xiaobie stood up. Happy’s home turf once again become useless. Tang Rou, who could once create an uproar, had become someone who brought a chill to the stadium atmosphere.</p>
<p>The match begun amidst this strange situation.</p>
<p>“I’m very honored to become your first opponent for your 1v3,” Liu Xiaobie typed. As a Hand Speed Expert, Liu Xiaobie enjoyed warming up by typing as he moved into position. Liu Xiaobie wasn’t trying to mock the other by choosing the topic of the 1v3. He truly admired this young woman for her 1v3 promise. Who didn’t have this sort of ambition? However, someone who dared say it, and make such a promise, that really was powerful, fierce.</p>
<p>“However, can you get past me?”</p>
<p>Windy Pavilion was a simple map without much decor. The two characters approached one another, closing the distance between them rapidly, as they adjusted their positions to prepare to attack. Liu Xiaobie’s Flying Sword leaned further and further forwards, his right hand creeping to his sword hilt with the cover from his body.</p>
<p>The two were only fifteen steps apart.</p>
<p>Fourteen steps…</p>
<p>Thirteen steps…</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was on guard for any attacks. The female Battle Mage in front of him often used Dragon Breaks the Ranks to increase speed and charge into an offense. With a mere ten something steps, it was just a blink of an eye for a Dragon Breaks the Ranks.</p>
<p>Twelve steps…</p>
<p>Eleven steps…</p>
<p>The closer they got, the clearer of a view Liu Xiaobie had. He carefully observed Soft Mist’s form. Soft Mist kept her spear held backwards. A Dragon Breaks the Ranks start didn’t look like that.</p>
<p>Was she not going to use Dragon Breaks the Ranks?</p>
<p>Then, take this!</p>
<p>Sword Draw!</p>
<p>At six steps away, Sword Draw had already been sent out.</p>
<p>Not close enough?</p>
<p>No, when the attack flew forwards, the two characters were still moving. Six steps was a short distance, so this attack was timed just right!</p>
<p>As expected, the flash of the sword created a shining line, linking the two characters together immediately. Soft Mist suddenly bent her knees in front of him.</p>
<p>That wasn’t enough!</p>
<p>There were very few Hand Speed Experts who had slow reactions. Creating variations in their attacks were their best weapon and the sword’s slash was immediately adjusted. Just bending down wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>However, Soft Mist didn’t just get down.</p>
<p>Sky Strike! Soft Mist’s spear was launched upwards. Bending down had given her a miniscule chance to maneuver, letting her parry this attack perfectly with her Sky Strike.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Their weapons clashed. Sky Strike didn’t seem to be enough to completely parry Sword Draw, but Soft Mist had fully adjusted her form by then and used the momentum from that attack to increase her movement speed and the speed of her counterattack.</p>
<p>Dragon Tooth!</p>
<p>The attack sped towards his chest.</p>
<p>As fierce as expected! Liu Xiaobie exclaimed. Wanting to take the initiative to strike with just this attack, she really hasn’t changed a bit!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie couldn’t help but think to back in the beginning, when their captain had them go to the tenth server to train with Ye Xiu. This girl had been been quite a pain to deal with. The her who couldn’t even last a minute was already clearly showing her style. Never back down, attack whenever possible, from the first attack to when she fell, she was always on the offense. Though her abilities were unpolished back then and every member of Tiny Herb could defeat her, her burning spirit had left a deep impression on them.</p>
<p>And now, she was finally on the same stage as they were and shouldering a promise of 1v3 in five rounds.</p>
<p>You really have character, but we Tiny Herb aren’t willing to be a background to that character!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie wasn’t Huang Shaotian, and he didn’t have the habit of chatting as he fought. Determined and resolute, Flying Sword darted out.</p>
<p>Triple Slash!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie didn’t back down from Soft Mist’s advance, but instead used this movement skill to meet her.</p>
<p>This sort of exchange was exactly what Tang Rou wanted.</p>
<p>Dragon Tooth stabbed forth, but hit air as Flying Sword slashed, his form swerving, and then swerving again.</p>
<p>Triangle Triple Slash!</p>
<p>With Liu Xiaobie’s extremely fast hand speed, his direction changes with Triple Slash were dizzying. Flying Sword seemed to teleport, instantly dodging the Dragon Tooth and getting to Soft Mist’s flank, the edge of his sword plummeting down!</p>
<p>Chapter 1191: Swift Hand Speed</p>
<p>The tip of the sword dropped down, but… it was a miss.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Flying Sword was already flying out.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s Destruction!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie’s triangle Triple Slash had been extremely fast, but what about Tang Rou? Her speed was no slower. Her Dragon Tooth turned into a Tyrant’s Destruction, keeping up with the dizzying Triple Slash. Before the sword could strike her, her spear thrust into Flying Sword’s body, throwing him to the side.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was shocked. In the Happy versus Excellent Era Challenger League finals, he had a very deep impression of Tang Rou’s hand speed. Xu Bin had asked how he would compare, but Liu Xiaobie hadn’t replied.</p>
<p>And now, Tang Rou had been able to catch his triangle Triple Slash, hitting him first before he could hit her…</p>
<p>Although his triangle Triple Slash required more inputs, the difference in attack speed between Soft Mist’s spear and Liu Xiaobie’s sword could not be ignored.</p>
<p>Spears usually had low attack speed; most had an attack speed of 2. On the other hand, the Blade Master’s lightsabers were the fastest weapons; most had an attack speed of 10.</p>
<p>In Glory, the attack speed on weapons were rated from 1 to 10. However, the difference between a 1 and a 10 wasn’t by a magnitude of ten. In reality, the difference between a 1 and a 10 was around 20%.</p>
<p>Glory was an input-heavy game. What truly decided an attack’s speed was the player’s hand speed. But the difference between having a weapon with an attack speed of 1 versus a weapon with an attack speed of 10 indicated that if you wanted to match the speed of a 10 attack speed weapon with a 1 attack speed weapon, your hand speed would need to be 20% faster.</p>
<p>Thus, a faster weapon attack speed was never a bad thing. However, the game was set up such that weapons with lower attack speed had higher physical attack. Finding the right balance was an issue every player had to consider. Blade Masters tended to use lightsabers and tachis, but there was no shortage of greatsword and broadsword users.</p>
<p>The weapons used by Soft Mist and Flying Sword:</p>
<p>Soft Mist’s spear, Dancing Fire Flowing Flame, had an attack speed of 4. Among spears, it was already a very fast one. Along with the bonus stat of attack speed +1, it’s total attack speed was 5.</p>
<p>Flying Sword’s Lightsaber, Chasing Spirit, had an attack speed of 10. It had a bonus attack speed of +2.</p>
<p>In total, Chasing Spirit had an attack speed of 12, 7 points higher than Dancing FIre Flowing Flame, a 14% difference.</p>
<p>With this difference, for Soft Mist to match Flying Sword, Tang Rou’s hand speed had to be above Liu Xiaobie’s. However, in a fight, the two sides wouldn’t be starting their attacks at the same time and checking to see who reached the other side first. Because of the inputs required for skills, variations between skills, and differences in attack speed, it wasn’t easy to make a simple comparison. Most players used their intuition to make a judgement.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie’s intuition surprised him. In this match against Tang Rou, he had actually been quite mentally prepared for it. Because of the 1v3 bet, Tang Rou was always first to go in the group arena. Because of this order never changed, it was easier for opponents to prepare for. For example, Liu Xiaobie knew that he would be playing against Tang Rou, so he focused his preparations towards her.</p>
<p>She really is fast. She can completely keep up with me.</p>
<p>But if you think this is the fastest I can go, then you’re very very wrong!</p>
<p>As Flying Sword was thrown aside by Tyrant’s Destruction, Flying Sword also made his move. A sword light flew out, leaving a sword mark on Soft Mist.</p>
<p>What a fast sword! Tang Rou saw the attack. She wanted to dodge, but her hand speed couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Tang Rou couldn’t help but be astonished. Flying Sword had been thrown aside by Tyrant’s Destruction, but in that split second, Liu Xiaobie had been able to leave an attack behind.</p>
<p>Although… the attack was more for show? I still have the initiative!</p>
<p>Dancing Fire Flowing Flame moved, drawing afterimages one after the other in the air.</p>
<p>Dragon Tooth, Double Stab, attacks that couldn’t be more normal, thrust fiercely towards Flying Sword.</p>
<p>Clang clang clang!</p>
<p>Clang clang clang clang!</p>
<p>The weapons of both players collided with each other repeatedly. The two competed speed against speed. Sword light and spear shadows collided and separated. Blood blossomed in the air.</p>
<p>Everyone stared in awe. The commentator and guest in charge of commentating the match were speechless too.</p>
<p>What was there to say?</p>
<p>With how fast the two were fighting, by the time they finished talking about a point, victory might have already been decided. There was no chance for them to say anything.</p>
<p>This was where the difficulty in commentating a Glory match lay. When the two sides started fighting, there were too many small details and mix-ups involved. And if the pace was also fast, there was no room for commentators to give a detailed analysis anywhere. And with how fast Tang Rou and Liu Xiaobie were playing, the commentators couldn’t even use the “list the skill names” strategy.</p>
<p>By the time he finished calling out the name of a skill, both sides had used another three skills.</p>
<p>“Too fast…” Pan Lin was able to squeeze in two words. It was truly somewhat embarrassing to not be able to point out anything.</p>
<p>“Overly fast.” Li Yibo was an experienced person with a professional experience. There might not be time to talk about the details, but he could talk about the overall picture. He didn’t look at the interactions between the two, just their skill trees.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a bunch of clocks on their skill trees. More and more of the icons on their skill trees were going on cooldown.</p>
<p>Rhythm?</p>
<p>There was no rhythm. These two people were constantly playing catch up. You’re faster than me, I’m faster than you, you chase, I chase. It became a competition of pure speed. If they continued to use skills at this pace and this quantity, there won’t be any skills to use soon. Or perhaps only low-level skills would be left…</p>
<p>Li Yibo wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Stab stab stab!</p>
<p>Slash slash slash!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was putting in inputs like crazy, but he still wasn’t able to thoroughly suppress his opponent. At this moment, he put in inputs, but the attack he had wanted to get failed to come out. Flying Sword’s offensive suddenly halted.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was only astonished for a second before he immediately realized the problem.</p>
<p>The skill was on cooldown, so it couldn’t be used.</p>
<p>But the skill was still on cooldown?</p>
<p>Not good!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie realized that his hand speed had gone out of control. His blind pursuit of speed had put him in this awkward position of being unable to connect skills because they were still on cooldown. It was because of this imbalance between hand speed and rhythm, a frequent mistake in the past, that he had been seen as a player who was wasting away his talent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he noticed it and fixed it. He started learning how to effectively utilize his hand speed, going as fast as he could when he needed to, but also suppressing it when he needed to be slower. This imbalance in rhythm stopped appearing after being aware of it.</p>
<p>After fixing the problem, Liu Xiaobie improved immensely. Last season, he was just a bit away from making it into All-Stars. This season he hoped that he could breakthrough. But in this match, his old problem had unexpectedly returned. Without him being aware, his hand speed had sped up to such a level already.</p>
<p>She really is an opponent that’s hard to stay calm against!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tang Rou had been chasing after his hand speed, so she had also been recklessly wasting her skills too to reach that speed. Even though this should have been a huge mistake and a huge opening, it wasn’t really one in this match because both sides had committed the same mistake.</p>
<p>“Haha, really…” Liu Xiaobie had wanted to say something in the chat, when Dancing Fire Flowing Flame flashed before him.</p>
<p>A normal attack?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie swiped his mouse and Flying Sword blocked this attack. Soft Mist wasn’t done though. She attack again, this time with a Dragon Tooth. Since the vast majority of their mid-level and high-level skills were on cooldown, the two sides were mainly using low cooldown sub-Level 20 skills or normal attacks.</p>
<p>She’s still attacking even in this situation. How stubborn! Liu Xiaobie sighed, while warding off Soft Mist’s attacks. But he gradually realized that something wasn’t right.</p>
<p>Normal attacks had no cooldown and could be used at any time.</p>
<p>Low-level skills had short cooldowns. After a few exchanges, they would be back up and could be used again.</p>
<p>Soft Mist was relying on this offense. It was just like before, dense and fast.</p>
<p>As a result, Liu Xiaobie that when he noticed his excessive speed and prepared to control his rhythm, Soft Mist continued to stubbornly commit this mistake.</p>
<p>She was still keeping up with her previous hand speed, or it could be said that she was still burning, still trying to think of a way to go faster.</p>
<p>This…</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie didn’t know how he should assess her. All he knew was that he was starting to have trouble warding off her attacks.</p>
<p>What is this girl thinking?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was astonished, but he felt like he had discovered something.</p>
<p>Among these were memories of the past. When he failed to meet expectations by blindly utilizing hand speed, he made adjustments had made huge improvements. Tang Rou was like the him, who hadn’t realized the issue and continued to charge through wildly.</p>
<p>If I had continued along this path, how would things have turned out?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie discovered that he had never thought about this question before. After not getting the results he wanted from this playstyle, he had quickly made changes.</p>
<p>As for Tang Rou? Did she know? Or was she just stubborn?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie didn’t know. He only knew that he was having trouble defending. A feeling rose in his heart. The two used to be speeding along neck and neck, but midway through, he suddenly realized that there was perhaps a better way to win, so he stopped speeding along and went to study. The person who kept on speeding along instantly overpassed him…</p>
<p>Was this limited to just this match? Or… his entire professional career?</p>
<p>Would the one who won in the end be the one who continued to speed along or the one to study a better way?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie’s Flying Sword fell with this confusion in him. He didn’t fall to Soft Mist’s normal attacks and low-level skills, but rather her overwhelming tempo.</p>
<p>Chapter 1192: Imaginary Enemy</p>
<p>I lost!</p>
<p>The instant Flying Sword fell, Liu Xiaobie collapsed against his seat in a daze.</p>
<p>His adjustment after slowing his rhythm had become opening for the opponent. He had figured out this “correct” method with difficulty, only for it to be broken. Was this method not actually the best choice?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie now began to doubt himself, just like he had doubted himself when he had used his explosive hand speed time and time again and yet was unable to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Carrying this shock, he walked out of the player booth, offstage, returning to Tiny Herb’s player area.</p>
<p>“You played well.” His teammates tried to cheer him up, and Liu Xiaobie managed a weak smile. They patted him on his shoulders, but they didn’t worry about him too much. It was normal to be disappointed and melancholic after a defeat. If he had come back in high spirits, that would be more worrying.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie sat in his seat. Lowering his head, he looked at his two hands.</p>
<p>His hands were still very warm, fatigued after the high-speed playing in that match, and they were still trembling nonstop. Suddenly, a cold drink landed in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie lifted his head and saw Xu Bin’s face.</p>
<p>“Still feeling the aftertaste of that match?” Xu Bin chuckled.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie shook his head. There really wasn’t too much of an aftertaste. It was just two players losing control of their hand speeds, making two different choices. One didn’t care and continued to go wild, while the other recognized the problem and immediately corrected himself.</p>
<p>No matter how you put it, the second option sounded like the correct one. But the victory had gone to the one who continued to go wild.</p>
<p>“It’s not a big deal if you lose a match. But don’t lose your conviction with it!” Xu Bin said.</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie was startled.</p>
<p>Conviction!</p>
<p>What was his conviction?</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie looked at this player in front of him. Xu Bin hadn’t even been in Tiny Herb for a whole season, he wasn’t any more senior than him here, but he had integrated into Tiny Herb extremely well. And his playstyle was distinct and unique in the professional scene, a style that grinded away at time. Even the audience would become impatient watching him, so despite his skill, he wasn’t a very popular player. Before he transferred to Tiny Herb, he always lost by a large margin in the All-Star poll.</p>
<p>Tiny Herb’s stage allowed him to shine more, but he didn’t abandon his usual style. This was his choice. No matter where he was, he would perform this style unwaveringly.</p>
<p>“Sometimes a choice isn’t right or wrong. It just depends on whether or not you have the conviction to carry it out.” As Xu Bin spoke, his gaze landed upon another person.</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi, captain of Tiny Herb. Ever since he entered the team, he was Tiny Herb’s soul, a presence that every person here respected and admired.</p>
<p>When Liu Xiaobie had been unable to get the results he wanted with his early methods, he made changes with a determined resolve. Because there was this successful role model in front of him, he had complete faith that he could make these changes.</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi, the one called the Magician. But he threw away this title, and it wasn’t until he changed many of his battle methods that he led Tiny Herb to its summit.</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi’s story was the source of Liu Xiaobie’s faith. It was what gave him the determination to change his style and make a breakthrough. But after this battle, his determination was now wavering.</p>
<p>This just showed that he wasn’t determined enough. It also showed that he was far from mature enough.</p>
<p>The road was still long!</p>
<p>Liu Xiaobie cracked open the drink and took a long gulp.</p>
<p>By this time, Tiny Herb’s second player of the group arena had taken to the stage.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun, Tiny Herb’s Battle Mage, Euphorbia.</p>
<p>Number two!</p>
<p>Tang Rou quietly counted in her head.</p>
<p>1v3. After that day, she hadn’t made any speech on the matter. Even on a normal day at Happy, it was never brought up, as though it didn’t exist. But in her heart, she hadn’t forgotten this for even a second.</p>
<p>I have to complete this! Tang Rou didn’t know how many times she had repeated this in her heart. And now, this was the final chance in her bet.</p>
<p>This was opponent number two, and Soft Mist had 57% health remaining.</p>
<p>To take down an opponent in the group arena and still have over half health remaining was generally an extremely pleasing result, but for Tang Rou, this was far from enough, because her goal was to take down all three opponents by herself. But now, after only defeating Liu Xiaobie, she’d already used up 43% of Soft Mist’s health. This 57% remaining to her was a tired remnant.</p>
<p>To clash head-on with a player who relied on his hand speed, the burden on her own two hands was unimaginable. Added to the crazy intense training Tang Rou had undergone these past 35 days, it would take a toll on even the youngest and most fit people.</p>
<p>And now, she still had to face two opponents, one of whom was Wang Jiexi. Tang Rou had known for a very long time just how fearsome this opponent was.</p>
<p>But now, there was not a trace of fear in her heart.</p>
<p>Defeat the one before her, and then, Wang Jiexi. Her thoughts about Wang Jiexi stopped there, nothing more.</p>
<p>At the start of the second battle, Xiao Yun’s message appeared in the chat. “Pretty girl, your show ends here.”</p>
<p>There was a taunt in Xiao Yun’s words. 1v3? In his eyes, it was just a show.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun had strong feelings of hostility toward Tang Rou. In the team, he had heard that Tiny Herb was interested in Tang Rou and wanted to recruit her, but she had unfortunately turned them down.</p>
<p>Tiny Herb already had a Battle Mage player, himself, Xiao Yun. And yet, the team was now looking at another Battle Mage player. Xiao Yun wasn’t at the point where he needed a successor. The fact that Tiny Herb had their eye on her, did that mean that this girl was better than himself?</p>
<p>Such a conclusion wouldn’t sit well with anyone. Towards the team, towards Tang Rou, Xiao Yun was rather dissatisfied. And now he had a chance to face off against her. Tang Rou had made that promise of quitting if she couldn’t complete a 1v3 in five rounds or whatever, and it just so happened that he was in the fifth round, stuck right in front of Tang Rou.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun was rather excited. To be able to send this Tang Rou, this player who had threatened to replace him, out of the professional scene, it was his pleasure. But he didn’t dare to underestimate Tang Rou. In fact, ever since hearing the news that the team had interest in recruiting Tang Rou, he had started paying a lot of attention toward her.</p>
<p>Tang Rou became a powerful competitor in his eyes. Any of her matches, any reports about her, Xiao Yun paid particular attention, so much so that his teammates thought that he was trying to make some advances toward this pretty girl.</p>
<p>“Advances, hell! She’d better hope she doesn’t fall into my hands!” This is what Xiao Yun said to Zhou Yebai, one of his teammates with whom he was close. And now, Tang Rou really fell into his hands.</p>
<p>I won’t let you have a good time!</p>
<p>Xiao Yun reaffirmed his determination and controlled his Euphorbia to walk out of the spawn point. Although Soft Mist only had about half health remaining, Xiao Yun still hoped to move strategically if possible, instead of meeting her charge directly. Even if he didn’t like Tang Rou, he had to admit her ferocity. Direct attacks weren’t his forte, he didn’t want to use his weakness against her strength. But the problem was, this Windy Pavilion map had hardly any cover on it. There was no way to strategically move to launch a sneak attack. Xiao Yun was helpless and could only direct his character to charge forward. At the opposite corner, Tang Rou’s Soft Mist was doing the same thing as always, rushing without any hesitation.</p>
<p>What advantage did he have over Tang Rou?</p>
<p>Imagining Tang Rou as his opponent, Xiao Yun had thought about this comparison consciously and unconsciously many times now.</p>
<p>Experience.</p>
<p>Compared to Tang Rou, he was introduced to Glory earlier, he trained as a Battle Mage earlier, he became a pro player earlier, he played pro matches earlier. Even though he wasn’t a very stable core member of Tiny Herb, he was still in Tiny Herb, this powerhouse that had won two championships. Even a casually discarded rookie from this team was picked up and treated like a treasure at Happy. To have a piece of land in this kind of team, this was already something of which to be proud. And a mere rookie wanted to replace him?</p>
<p>Xiao Yun grew angry.</p>
<p>He didn’t care that this was just the subjective will of Tiny Herb, or that Tang Rou’s refusal had in some ways helped him. He didn’t dare express any of his feelings toward Tiny Herb, but this dissatisfaction accumulated in his heart until it finally found its target, Tang Rou, as though she had been the one who actively wanted to steal his position.</p>
<p>The more Xiao Yun thought, the more hatred and rage he felt.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!</p>
<p>This was an opening move that Tang Rou liked to use, but in this battle between two players of the same class, it was Xiao Yun who used it first. Not only did he want to win, he wanted to win beautifully. He wanted to show his team that he was far superior to Tang Rou. Anything she could do, he could do better.</p>
<p>This Dragon Breaks the Ranks came very suddenly. But a powerful attack at the beginning rarely hit the opponent because the starting animation for such powerful attacks was generally more noticeable than the ones for smaller attacks. Tang Rou was now a skilled Battle Mage player, and as soon as she saw Euphorbia’s pose, she immediately controlled Soft Mist to dodge. Even though Xiao Yun also immediately made adjustments, when his spear shot out, it didn’t manage to land on its target.</p>
<p>Soft Mist dodge to the side, and after Euphorbia’s powerful attack whistled by, Dancing Fire Flowing Flame leapt out.</p>
<p>Sky Strike!</p>
<p>Soft Mist’s first attack in this round was rather plain.</p>
<p>Euphorbia immediately leapt backward, as though still carrying some remnants of the Dragon Breaks the Ranks. After avoiding this Sky Strike, his spear was already sweeping wildly toward Soft Mist.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, this was a Draconic Crusher, a level 50 Battle Mage attack. If this attack landed, the target was guaranteed to fall over on the ground. And the priority of a level 50 skill was much higher than low-level skills, so even if Soft Mist was able to adjust the angle of her Sky Strike, she wouldn’t be able to parry this Draconic Crusher.</p>
<p>So Xiao Yun was completely confident. But Soft Mist’s Sky Strike continued toward him.</p>
<p>Ridiculous, I’ll flatten you!</p>
<p>Xiao Yun’s mouse moved faster. The Draconic Crusher pressed down on Soft Mist and her Sky Strike.</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<p>The two spears met in the air, and the result was decided in an instant. The parrying effect of Sky Strike didn’t seem to exist and was immediately smothered by Draconic Crusher.</p>
<p>What about Soft Mist? It seemed that this attack was too strong, so strong that she had no way of bracing herself against it, instead rolling to reduce the force.</p>
<p>But that movement wasn’t necessary, Xiao Yun was very clear. The Sky Strike was just crushed by the Draconic Crusher, but there was suddenly a jump, and a Dragon Tooth leapt towards him like a viper.</p>
<p>Chapter 1193: What’s Fearsome Is Her Overwhelming Determination</p>
<p>She’s so fast! No wonder Liu Xiaobie lost.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun had Euphorbia dodge. Although he had been mentally prepared for this situation, when it actually happened, he became a bit nervous.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was not an opponent he could take head-on! With this, Xiao Yun’s prediction was confirmed. And since he knew this long before, of course he had prepared a strategy.</p>
<p>If she wants to be fast, then I can’t let her be fast. With my understanding of the Battle Mage class, I can definitely suppress her rhythm!</p>
<p>In a battle between two players of the same class, each side had a greater understanding of what changes could be made in battle. If Tang Rou weren’t a Battle Mage, Xiao Yun wouldn’t have this confidence, but since she was a Battle Mage, he believed that he could control the flow of battle. After all, his opponent was still a rookie, with limited understanding and control of the class. In this same-class battle, he had a slight advantage, Xiao Yun believed.</p>
<p>He calmly controlled his character to jump backward and avoid Soft Mist’s Dragon Tooth.</p>
<p>Another jump let him avoid Soft Mist’s subsequent Double Stab.</p>
<p>After the Double Stab, Dancing Fire Flowing Flame suddenly flipped up to a Sky Strike, the skill’s cooldown having just ended. But Euphorbia stuck his spear downward and this Sky Strike was suppressed. None of Soft Mist’s consecutive attacks managed to succeed.</p>
<p>The corner of Xiao Yun’s mouth twisted into a cold smirk. He felt like a cat toying with a mouse.</p>
<p>But a Magic Chaser was already flying toward him, a Light Chaser accumulated from the earlier Sky Strike.</p>
<p>As expected, not a second of rest!</p>
<p>This Light Chaser wasn’t outside of Xiao Yun’s expectations either, and he very calmly dodged it. Soft Mist immediately came with another attack, even faster, with the speed bonus granted after firing a Light Chaser. This, too, Xiao Yun had accounted for, and after he dodged the Chaser, he was already defending against the sudden attack that would come next.</p>
<p>And his responses to her attacks weren’t just ordinary dodges, as that would just give Tang Rou more space to increase her speed. Xiao Yun relied more on parrying attacks, limiting her ability to chain attacks and ruining her rhythm.</p>
<p>He did fairly well. After all, he was a member of Tiny Herb, and he had trained with the Battle Mage class for several years now. He was very clear on where and how to attack to maximally interfere with her attack rhythm.</p>
<p>This again…</p>
<p>Tang Rou was no stranger to this current situation. In fact, it could be said that she had just experienced this.</p>
<p>Last round against Heavenly Swords, even though Happy had won the two points from the group arena, Tang Rou, who was the first to come out, was defeated by the second person on their team. Heavenly Swords’ second player, Wen Kebei, was a Battle Mage.</p>
<p>Tang Rou had just experienced a same-class battle last round, and this round she once again fought against a same-class player. Xiao Yun and Wen Kebei both fought with this interference style that could only be executed by someone familiar with the class. But Xiao Yun, compared to Wen Kebei, was more practiced, and Tang Rou was suppressed harder than she was last round.</p>
<p>It was harder, but she knew it better.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s Destruction! Tang Rou still refused to give up on attacking.</p>
<p>That smirk continue to hang on the corner of Xiao Yun’s mouth. With a practiced motion of the mouse, his Euphorbia also unleashed a Tyrant’s Destruction, crashing toward Soft Mist’s.</p>
<p>An instantaneous control, an instantaneous attack, and in an instant, the spears were about to collide once again. But suddenly, Dancing Fire Flowing Flame suddenly shot upward.</p>
<p>In the last moment, just before the two skills were about to hit, Tang Rou adjusted the direction of her skill. No time to delay, the timing couldn’t be off by a hair.</p>
<p>She did it!</p>
<p>Dancing Fire Flowing Flame and the spear that Euphorbia swung toward her slipped past each other. And Soft Mist jumped into the air, and in the same way, with hardly a second to spare, she just barely dodged his attack.</p>
<p>Barely, but she managed to dodge it. And Xiao Yun? After discovering this change, it was already too late to react.</p>
<p>Tang Rou pushed her change all the way to the end, leaving no time for Xiao Yun to make any follow-up move.</p>
<p>Not just him, even someone with ten or a hundred times the hand speed wouldn’t have been able to keep up with Tang Rou’s change at that moment.</p>
<p>Shit!</p>
<p>Xiao Yun only had time to shout in his mind. He didn’t even have the chance to retract the smirk on his mouth when Euphorbia was hit by Soft Mist’s Tyrant’s Destruction. At the same time, flames burst forth and landed upon Euphorbia’s body, as Dancing Fire Flowing Flame’s special effect “Flowing Flame” was activated.</p>
<p>After one attack succeeded, things got easier. The next skills came one after another in a combo.</p>
<p>This was a combo. If this offense could be casually broken, then it wouldn’t be called a combo.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun’s Euphorbia and the Dancing Fire Flowing Flame in Soft Mist’s hands met over and over again. Tang Rou was completely immersed in the controls. Of course, she hoped with this one chain of combos she could defeat her opponent, but sadly, things didn’t turn out that way.</p>
<p>Xiao Yun, who understood Battle Mages well, quickly found a flaw in Tang Rou’s combo.</p>
<p>Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart!</p>
<p>Seeing the flaw, Xiao Yun directly used a powerful attack. Tang Rou hastily responded, Soft Mist drawing back her spear, but she had no way of completely parrying such a high-level attack.</p>
<p>Soft Mist’s offensive came to an abrupt end, and Xiao Yun used this Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart to retaliate with a new high of attacks.</p>
<p>Tang Rou’s response to this offensive was completely different from Xiao Yun’s. Xiao Yun would observe, anticipate, search for an opportunity. But when she faced each of Euphorbia’s attacks, she would always try to make a move, she controlled her character nonstop, as though Euphorbia’s attack sequence contained flaws everywhere.</p>
<p>But in reality, Euphorbia’s attacks were not interrupted. Tang Rou struggled endlessly, but to no avail.</p>
<p>But her struggling like this gave her opponent a lot of pressure. Xiao Yun felt a strong sense of danger, as though if he made the tiniest slip, it would immediately cause him to lose this match.</p>
<p>This state was unexpected for Xiao Yun. He was nervous, he didn’t dare become careless, but the more he felt this, the more flawed his controls became, often scaring himself into a sweat. Thus, Xiao Yun was unable to maintain his offensive for long before he, too, finally revealed an opening. The unrelenting Tang Rou instantly seized the opportunity. Even death wouldn’t have stopped her as she surged forward. One attack landed, and immediately a chain of attacks followed. If Xiao Yun seized a chance and interfered again? No worries, she’d just come again!</p>
<p>The two sides traded the initiative back and forth, but whether or not she was attacking or being attacked, Tang Rou’s Soft Mist always maintained an offensive stance. When attacking, she was always moving forward; when being attacked, she caused a constant fear of counterattack in the opponent, like a thorn in the back. The sweat on Xiao Yun’s forehead accumulated, and the string in his heart was wound tighter and tighter.</p>
<p>The tighter he was, the more he didn’t dare relax his hands or legs, and Xiao Yun’s apprehension only increased. The more he didn’t want to make a mistake, the more often a mistake would come find him. The battle seemed like a continuous exchange of attack and defense positions, but Xiao Yun’s attack periods grew shorter and shorter, and Tang Rou was seizing opportunities and attacking for longer and longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Under these exchanges, Xiao Yun watched as Soft Mist slowly closed the gap between their health levels. He grew panicked, and he started making more mistakes. He once again reminded himself to stay calm, stay stable, but his two hands were so stiff, so unresponsive, it was as though they were no longer his own. Where did his normal casual and easy controls go? Xiao Yun wanted to stuff his hands in his mouth and bite down hard.</p>
<p>His 43% health lead was pulled to a tie, and then, he started losing.</p>
<p>The more Xiao Yun played, the more chaotic he became. He no longer had a fraction of the confidence he’d had at the beginning of this match. All he had was overwhelming panic.</p>
<p>How could it be like this?</p>
<p>Xiao Yun didn’t understand. He had prepared thoroughly to face Tang Rou, he was confident, so how come as soon as he was onstage, he couldn’t perform? How was his condition today so bad?</p>
<p>Xiao Yun couldn’t stabilize himself or control the situation. He could only lose.</p>
<p>Tang Rou completed the 1v2, successfully entering the third battle of the group arena.</p>
<p>The crowd was silent.</p>
<p>1v2. This result was already valiant, but because Tang Rou promised a 1v3, she wasn’t done yet. Tiny Herb’s next player onstage was their captain Wang Jiexi. And Tang Rou? Soft Mist, after this battle, only had 16% health remaining.</p>
<p>“Coach Li, what do you think… this…” Commentator Pan Lin spoke haltingly. To challenge Wang Jiexi with 16% health, it was very difficult for anyone to have hope!</p>
<p>“Haha, the wonder of competition is its unpredictability! Perhaps we will witness a miracle!” Li Yibo laughed.</p>
<p>“That’s to say, Coach Li still looks favorably on Tang Rou?” Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>“We’ve already reached this point. Tang Rou is a player full of energy, so who knows, she might achieve the inconceivable!” Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s look forward to the result of what has been the focus of the past five rounds! Team Happy’s Tang Rou versus Team Tiny Herb’s Wang Jiexi!” Pan Lin announced.</p>
<p>The television broadcaster made this announcement, and the live screens in the stadium displayed the next player from Tiny Herb who was about to play. But Wang Jiexi didn’t hurry to go onstage, and instead waited for Xiao Yun to return.</p>
<p>Seeing the captain looking at him, Xiao Yun lowered his head, and looked for a corner in which to hide.</p>
<p>“What’s most fearsome about Tang Rou is not her technique, nor her hand speed, but her overwhelming determination.” After Wang Jiexi spoke, he stepped toward the stage.</p>
<p>Happy versus Tiny Herb, third match of the group arena.</p>
<p>The final opponent in the 1v3. Win this, and she would complete her promise. Just one last step.</p>
<p>However, Tang Rou was already powerless.</p>
<p>Vaccaria slid down from the sky, trailing behind him the glittering remnants of starlight from the dance of Star Extinction.</p>
<p>“A 1v3 is not so easy!” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>In the third battle of the group arena, Wang Jiexi won. No damage taken.</p>
<p>The audience was once again silent.</p>
<p>If Tang Rou’s 1v3 had succeeded, they would have been dissatisfied. But seeing her defeated so swiftly by Wang Jiexi, everyone felt a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>They themselves couldn’t say for what sort of outcome they had hoped.</p>
<p>In Happy’s player area, everything was even more still. Failing to complete a 1v3 was nothing. In fact, in terms of the match progression, for their first player to meet the opponent’s third, they held a great advantage. But, the outcome that this 1v3 failure implied…</p>
<p>At this moment, no matter how hard Chen Guo tried, she couldn’t squeeze out even a half-corner of a smile.</p>
<p>Chapter 1194: I Don’t Agree</p>
<p>She lost…</p>
<p>In the end, Tang Rou was unable to complete her promise of a 1v3 within five rounds. Chen Guo couldn’t muster even the barest of smiles, but when Tang Rou returned, she was still able to smile at all of them, just like after her losses in all of the previous group arenas. That smile was to let them know that they didn’t need to worry for her. But if they didn’t worry now, when would they? Five rounds had already passed, there were no more chances!</p>
<p>Seeing how Tang Rou was still wearing such a smile, Chen Guo only felt more miserable. She wanted to go up and say something, but she didn’t know what she could say. Tang Rou quietly sat back down in her seat, and her face finally revealed a trace of exhaustion. 35 days of crazy training, and a frenzied performance in every match. This time, facing the powerhouse Tiny Herb, she defeated two opponents in a row, but in the end, she fell so swiftly at the hands of Wang Jiexi.</p>
<p>Was everything already over?</p>
<p>Chen Guo felt a numbness in her nose. She looked at Tang Rou, whose head was lifted, staring at the replays on the screens, just like normal. They were all displaying shots from her match that had just ended.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu stood up, but he didn’t say anything to Tang Rou. He still followed the progression of the match and said something to the next player who was about to go onstage. Chen Guo was right next to him, and yet she couldn’t hear a thing he said.</p>
<p>Happy’s second player in the group arena was Steamed Bun, a player that many people thought shared some traits with Wang Jiexi. This time, facing Wang Jiexi, he lost speedily.</p>
<p>Two opponents defeated consecutively, yet Vaccaria had barely lost any health. The audience’s eyes were wide.</p>
<p>Everyone had been focused on whether or not Tang Rou could complete a 1v3. But now, it was actually shaping up to be a total reversal like this?</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s guessing, Fang Rui went onstage…</p>
<p>In the group arena, Tiny Herb won.</p>
<p>The dead silence in the crowd only belonged to Happy’s reporters. The Tiny Herb fans supporting their away team were thrilled, excited, and screaming crazily. Even Pan Lin, in the middle of the broadcast, was nearly incoherent.</p>
<p>“This… This is truly…” Pan Lin tried to organize his words. “Just when Tang Rou defeated two Tiny Herb players and everyone was wondering whether or not she could create a miracle, Wang Jiexi, Tiny Herb’s Captain Wang Jiexi, the Magician Wang Jiexi, with a crisp and clear 1v3, tells everyone: impossible! Tiny Herb maintains its record of never being 1v3’d! Wang Jiexi is truly one of the most reliable players in the Alliance! An awe-inspiring reversal!”</p>
<p>The excitement of the Tiny Herb fans conquered the entire stadium.</p>
<p>Tang Rou failed her 1v3, and the opponent pulled off a 1v3 to reverse the situation and win the match. One could only imagine how low Happy’s spirits were.</p>
<p>How would the upcoming team competition play out? Very few people could concentrate on this question, as everyone was still worrying about Tang Rou’s future. On the other hand, after Wang Jiexi’s 1v3 to win back the group arena, Tiny Herb’s morale reached its peak. With this shift, in the end, Happy lost the team competition to Tiny Herb as well. The match ended, 2 to 8.</p>
<p>To be honest, Happy losing to Tiny Herb wasn’t any big news. The most attention-grabbing part of this match was Tang Rou’s promise of completing a 1v3, and this too was a large reason why the live broadcast chose to show this match. And now, the dust settled. The reporters had all already gathered at the post-match press conference, discussing in a chaotic manner, some regretful, some gloating.</p>
<p>Esports Time’s Ruan Cheng, of course, would not miss this press conference. It could even be said that he was the star of this conference. Right now, he acted like a victor, delightedly moving through the crowds of reporters, chatting with some here and some there, leaving the sound of his hearty laughter throughout.</p>
<p>“Are you happy?” Ruan Cheng suddenly heard someone speak up beside him. He turned his head and saw this person glaring right at him.</p>
<p>“Seeing such a talented player forced to leave the professional scene for a reason like this. Are you happy?” When Ruan Cheng turned toward him, Chang Xian spat out this sentence word by word, syllable by syllable.</p>
<p>He was the reporter closest to Happy, but among all of these people, Chang Xian was still just a junior. His identity and position couldn’t compare at all to Esports Time’s senior writer Ruan Cheng. But at this moment, Chang Xian mustered his courage and hurled this question at him.</p>
<p>“Haha,” Ruan Cheng laughed. “Everyone needs to take responsibility for their choices, and I’m pleased to see a player meet such a result after their own arrogant words and actions. Of course, I prefer to see that she learns a lesson from this, corrects her shortcomings, and continues to improve. Something like this wouldn’t actually force her to retire, no? Haha.”</p>
<p>“You’re exactly right, take responsibility for your choices. Everyone’s very willing to accept a sincere apology!” Another reporter who disapproved of Tang Rou’s actions came to support Ruan Cheng’s opinion.</p>
<p>Seeing these seniors pretending to be innocent and sympathetic, Chang Xian truly felt disgusted. These people always put themselves on the moral high ground, casually pointing fingers at other people, as though anything that didn’t fit their views was automatically wrong. They spoke as though this were all for Tang Rou’s good, but Chang Xian was clear, they just wanted to see Tang Rou embarrassed, see this strong and tough player bow her head before them, thus proving the authority of their right to speak.</p>
<p>Chang Xian didn’t want to see Tang Rou lower her head before these guys, but he was even less willing to see Tang Rou quit the pro scene like this.</p>
<p>“They’re here, Happy’s people are here.” After this shout, all of the reporters took their positions. Ruan Cheng smiled and organized his appearance. With all the attitude of a victor, he prepared to thoroughly enjoy this evening.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, Fang Rui, Chen Guo, and Tang Rou, these were the four people from Happy that came for this press conference. The reporters were quietly delighted, since they had worried earlier that Tang Rou simply wouldn’t attend. But now, it seemed this girl was quite magnanimous! Not bad, lower your head! Apologize!</p>
<p>As long as you come with the right attitude, everyone will gladly accept it.</p>
<p>Although everyone was eager to jump right in, seeing the four Happy members take their seats, in the end they all turned toward Ruan Cheng. After all, this whole affair was his creation. At this time, they had to give him face, let him complete this topic.</p>
<p>“Ahem!” Ruan Cheng of course wouldn’t pass up this opportunity. After the signal that he could begin, he gracefully stood up to ask a question. “It’s a great shame that Happy was in such condition, only to suffer such a reversal.” Ruan Cheng was in no hurry, and said these perfunctory opening words.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a shame,” Ye Xiu answered.</p>
<p>“It’s a greater shame that Miss Tang Rou failed to complete her 1v3 by just one step.” Ruan Cheng smiled as he hit upon the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Tang Rou sat on the panel. Contrary to everyone’s expectations, she didn’t appear to be in a rush to examine her mistakes, nor did she show any sign of disappointment or loss. Like every other time she had appeared in such a press conference, she simply sat there, upright and proper.</p>
<p>What was the meaning of this?</p>
<p>More than a few reporters were already having second thoughts.</p>
<p>Promise?</p>
<p>To be honest, not many people really took this very seriously. Tang Rou, with her looks and skill as a player, had an immeasurable value in the pro scene. There was really no way to strictly enforce this so-called promise. But for the sake of the team’s most immediate interests, at this point, they had to smooth over their public relations somehow, right? Even if they used the reasons Ruan Cheng had exposed earlier, “for love,””for the team,””for the supporters,” or other such arguments. Or if they really had nothing else, even a reason like “to generate interest” could very well be brazenly announced!</p>
<p>But, with this calm and stability in front of them, as though this whole situation didn’t exist, what was she planning to do? Was she pretending to have amnesia?</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Ruan Cheng. Stop playing around, get to the point!</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng was also beginning to have doubts in his heart. At this time, this player seriously didn’t have any intention of lowering her head? What an infuriating person!</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng’s mood worsened, and so he picked up the pace.</p>
<p>“If I’ve counted correctly, this is now the fifth round since your promise of five rounds. Although Miss Tang Rou only missed it by one step, the 1v3 was not completed. It seems that, Miss Tang Rou, you said earlier, if you couldn’t complete a 1v3 in five rounds, you would quit?”</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng had initially intended for Tang Rou to stand up of her own volition to admit her wrong and beg forgiveness, but now, she was just sitting motionless at the panel, as though she would completely ignore the topic if no one brought it up. Ruan Cheng couldn’t stand it any more, and so he directly dug up the promise.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone’s gazes swiveled to Tang Rou.</p>
<p>Tang Rou smiled. “Quit? I don’t agree. Go on.”</p>
<p>I don’t agree, go on?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>The reporters were instantly in an uproar. Even Ruan Cheng was stunned. Chang Xian hadn’t expected Tang Rou to do this, either.</p>
<p>Refuse to lower your head, but refuse to quit as well, what can you do?</p>
<p>Chang Xian hadn’t expected that even this pretty girl would have delinquent tendencies. To put it bluntly, she was admitting that she was breaking her word? This this this… She was completely destroying her reputation!</p>
<p>A promise, no matter in what context, held significance. The words you said, the water you spilled, you could find this or that ridiculous excuse, but in the end you needed to find an explanation to give yourself a place to stand.</p>
<p>But Tang Rou wasn’t standing on anything, she just gave that sentence: I don’t agree.</p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>If the player didn’t agree, there was truly no one who could force her to quit, so this reason was very strong. But to do this was to burn your image and reputation to ashes. Having a good appearance couldn’t save you. Character, integrity, those were forever a person’s most important traits.</p>
<p>“You don’t agree?” This response caught Ruan Cheng completely off guard. His voice had gone strangled, he had no idea how to go on. “You… you shameless!”</p>
<p>He couldn’t hold back, Ruan Cheng just couldn’t hold back. To directly hurl such insults was of course frowned upon, and these writers often had to use very roundabout ways to insult someone. But in this moment, he truly couldn’t hold back anymore. This was shameless. No word could describe this more accurately.</p>
<p>“You can say what you will,” Tang Rou said. “I will continue as always. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Thank you? What the fuck! The reporters were instantly enraged. Are you trying to make fun of us?</p>
<p>Chapter 1195: Each Crazier than the Next</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the press conference reached a boiling point. Even those who hadn’t initially harbored any ill-will toward Tang Rou could no longer hold themselves back after seeing her current attitude.</p>
<p>What was this? The stubbornness of a mule? You clearly lost the bet, but you don’t apologize and recognize that you were overly confident, nor do you quit the Alliance like you said. You just toss the sentence “I don’t agree”?</p>
<p>In the ten years of the Glory Pro League, there had never been a player like this before, a player who simply refused to recognize the words they had previously said.</p>
<p>Pro players were public figures, so it was crucial that they had a good reputation. A player like this who didn’t keep her word, no matter how good her appearance or disposition, what kind of business would dare endorse her? Without these endorsements, who would be willing to use her in advertising? Even pro teams, in order to avoid affecting the image of the team as a whole, would stay far away from a player with such a bad image, no matter how skilled the player was.</p>
<p>Tang Rou’s action was completely self-destructive. Although the reporters were boiling, aside from Ruan Cheng’s accusation of “shameless,” none of them could find any other condemnation. None of them had ever experienced such a situation before, they didn’t have experience!</p>
<p>For now, the reporters were like wasps whose nest had just been attacked, filling the air with their buzzing. In the midst of it all, it was possible that a few wanted to ask some questions, but in such a noisy and chaotic situation, no one could hear anything clearly.</p>
<p>“Everyone quiet down, quiet!!” the Alliance’s media spokesperson shouted. Normally, a pro team had its own spokesperson, who would act as the host for any press conferences a team held. Happy didn’t have one, so the Alliance’s employee was a temporary fill-in. A worker from the Alliance would defend a pro team to some extent, but in the end they wouldn’t be as exhaustively dedicated to the team like a worker from the team itself. This worker right now just wanted to restore order and didn’t particularly care about Happy itself.</p>
<p>The reporters’ uproar lasted for almost five whole minutes. As it slowly settled down, everyone adopted faces of indignation. This time, none of them felt that they understood Tang Rou’s actions. Chang Xian had been pleased at first to see the reporters utterly flustered and anxious, but after that passed, he too started to worry about Tang Rou. He understood clearly how disadvantageous Tang Rou’s attitude was, and he didn’t know what sort of public relations strategy this was. With his understanding of Happy, they didn’t have any dedicated public relations team. Their press conferences were all very casual, otherwise this wouldn’t have attracted so much hatred.</p>
<p>Amidst the reporters who had regained order, Ruan Cheng acted as the voice of general opinion as he stood at the front, face filled with resentment.</p>
<p>“Miss Tang Rou, may I ask, what the meaning of your words was just now?” Ruan Cheng asked, exceedingly sophisticated. Although he had already carefully considered this, he still feared that Tang Rou had hidden some sort of trap in her words. After all, this whole situation was too incredible and ridiculous, and had never happened before in all ten years of Glory.</p>
<p>“I mean that I will not quit the Alliance, I will continue to play,” Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>Alright, this time she made herself clear. There was no way for her meaning to be twisted, was there? Ruan Cheng was suddenly full of energy.</p>
<p>“Then, what do you think your earlier promise was all about? You think that your simple ‘I don’t agree’ is enough to erase it? What do you have to say to all those Glory players that cared about you, wished you well, supported you?” Ruan Cheng said.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Hearing this, Tang Rou stood up.</p>
<p>“I deeply regret being unable to complete a 1v3. I have disappointed all those who have cared about me, wished me well, and supported me.” As she said this, Tang Rou made a short bow, and then straightened. “However, I will not retire because of this. Even if it hurts me, I will continue, and I will bear the burden of the disgrace that results. I only worry that my teammates will be dragged into this, and I hope that the team will not be harmed by any of this, because this is all my own decision. I hope that all of the criticism and accusations will only be aimed at myself, and not at Team Happy or the other team members.”</p>
<p>“Your behavior tarnishes the reputation of your team,” Ruan Cheng said.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are correct, the team is implicated because of me, they are victims,” said Tang Rou. “Thank you for being so reasonable.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the press conference became twisted again.</p>
<p>What’s this? She wants to bear all the consequences of her faults? After this clear spiel of words, those who wanted to defame Happy along with her could no longer open their mouths. But to take all responsibility like this, this Tang Rou, has she not considered her future?</p>
<p>All of the reporters sensed how insane it was for Tang Rou to destroy her reputation and future prospects like this. But they had no way of attacking this point.</p>
<p>“Do you know what effect this will have on your future?”</p>
<p>For a question like this, a simple “none of your business” was enough of a retort. If the other party really didn’t care about their future prospects, it was idiotic to make this a point. So Ruan Cheng had opened his mouth to point out to her supporters how Tang Rou harmed her team. But Tang Rou accepted all of this, in a “if you want to curse me, just bring it” attitude.</p>
<p>Any other possible position was unsustainable!</p>
<p>Were they supposed to say, so many people were looking forward to seeing you leave if you failed the 1v3, so now that you really failed, how can you make it up to those who were anticipating your departure?</p>
<p>An attack like that would probably only make Tang Rou more earnest in breaking her word, right?</p>
<p>The experienced reporters actually had no idea what to say next. They could only quietly swear in their hearts that as soon as they left they would figure out how to attack this Tang Rou. But looking at Tang Rou’s stance, they couldn’t help but feel a bit timid again. She already made it clear that she didn’t care about her reputation and that she didn’t need your support or understanding. What use would their attacks have? Would it just be a catharsis?</p>
<p>The reporters were at a loss because of Tang Rou’s toughness. Ruan Cheng had been prepared to taste the fruits of victory, only to be faced with this unexpected scene. Tang Rou embraced the situation and took everything upon herself. Then what about Happy? What do you think of this?</p>
<p>“To Happy’s members, what do you think of Tang Rou’s performance today?” Ruan Cheng said in a low voice. He finally avoided Tang Rou, he had no way of facing her toughness, he had to find a new breakthrough.</p>
<p>“Tang Rou’s performance today…” Happy’s Captain Ye Xiu opened his mouth, “was excellent.” He nodded his head, filled with certainty. And then in the face of a field of dumbstruck stares, he continued, “In the group arena, she defeated two opponents and fought all the way to the third person. A performance like that is truly powerful.”</p>
<p>The reporters felt like crying. God, could you please stop playing dumb! You know that that’s not what we’re asking. But then again, disregarding the promise, for one player to fight all the way to the third was indeed very strong! Some reporters fell into a trance. But the rest were just about to accuse the God of playing dumb, when Ye Xiu continued to speak.</p>
<p>“The ones who should be strictly criticized are the two players who went up next. Two players, and you couldn’t take down the opponent’s one player? Especially the third player, the great general anchoring the group arena, Fang Rui! The team didn’t spend so much money to get you over here just so you could be a useless dim sum! You couldn’t even take care of a Wang Jiexi?” Ye Xiu berated him. The tone of that “couldn’t even take care of a Wang Jiexi” was deafening! Ever since Wang Jiexi had entered the Alliance, the reporters had never heard this kind of sentence before.</p>
<p>“Yeah yeah yeah.” To the side, Fang Rui confessed, ashamed, “I messed up, I couldn’t focus my spirits to play well. Someone like Wang Jiexi, I should at least be able to fight ten of him.”</p>
<p>“That’s a bit much!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Eight?” Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>“Mm.” Ye Xiu nodded.</p>
<p>The reporters were going crazy. They had no way of reporting talk like this. Anyone could hear that it was a joke. If you actually talked about this seriously, everyone would doubt the judgment of your report. They could only record this talk while cursing this shamelessness, and when Wang Jiexi came out later, they could interview him and see if he objected to this. Only that would be reasonable.</p>
<p>But the main topic right now shouldn’t be this!</p>
<p>“God Ye Xiu, as the captain of Team Happy, what are your thoughts on your teammate’s retraction of her promise? I seem to remember that before, you very firmly believed Tang Rou could complete a 1v3?” One reporter, through gritted teeth, strung together a few clear keywords to spit out this question.</p>
<p>“Those were necessary words for the public,” Ye Xiu said dismissively. “Is this your first day as a reporter or something?”</p>
<p>The reporters spat blood. But they had to admit that he had a point. When facing doubts about a team’s player, the captain, or even any member of the team, had to defend the player, unless there was some serious conflict! Whether or not you believed in your teammate, when facing the world, the answer was always a public “yes.”</p>
<p>But Ruan Cheng seized a flaw in Ye Xiu’s words.</p>
<p>“That’s to say, God Ye Xiu, in reality, you didn’t actually believe that Tang Rou could complete a 1v3, right?” Ruan Cheng aggressively asked.</p>
<p>“How could that be the case? Have you forgotten, I was the one who set the five round limit?” Ye Xiu laughed.</p>
<p>“But now, she failed to complete it,” said Ruan Cheng.</p>
<p>“Mm, in the end, no one can be one hundred percent certain about the outcome of competition, not even me,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“But she made that kind of promise,” said Ruan Cheng.</p>
<p>“And now she doesn’t intend to uphold it,” Ye Xiu said calmly.</p>
<p>“What do you think of that?” Ruan Cheng said.</p>
<p>“The team cannot interfere in a personal decision. I’m very glad that Tang Rou could make such a decision, allowing us to avoid losing such an outstanding player. Thank you.” Ye Xiu’s last two words were directed toward Tang Rou.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” Tang Rou replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Insane! Everyone on this team is insane!</p>
<p>The reporters were dumbstruck. Could these people not tell the severity of this situation? They were still relaxed as they responded with ridicule. If this were any other team, the public relations team probably would have already burned to ashes from this, no?</p>
<p>Tang Rou said that her promise was her individual decision and had nothing to do with the team. But, as a member of this team, her reputation was part of the team’s reputation as a whole. Even with her statement, the team would still experience a negative effect. Regarding this, did the manager of this team, their boss, have no objection to this? She must be enraged in her heart? As it happened, Happy’s boss Chen Guo was also on the panel of this press conference, and the reporters turned their fire.</p>
<p>Chapter 1196: The Most Challenging</p>
<p>At any other time, Chen Guo would have just about died laughing from seeing these reporters harassed like this. But now, she didn’t feel like laughing at all, only crying. From the very first second she sat on this stage, she was trying very hard to control herself and prevent the tears from falling.</p>
<p>The rules of the Alliance didn’t extend to a team’s boss, so Chen Guo could have skipped all of the pre- and post-match press conferences. But now, she sat here, next to Tang Rou, because she wanted to be with Tang Rou, because she knew that Tang Rou was making a very difficult decision.</p>
<p>Chen Guo felt like she was good for nothing. She had wanted to sit up here to give Tang Rou support, only to find that she herself was the weakest. She couldn’t be calm like Ye Xiu and Fang Rui, or steadfast like Tang Rou. Hold back the tears… this was all she could manage to do.</p>
<p>The 1v3 promise had caused an uproar in the outside world, and within Happy, it had also been a topic that everyone treated with caution. After the end of the press conference where she had made the announcement, the absolutely rational An Wenyi had said frankly that Tang Rou’s actions were irresponsible to the extreme.</p>
<p>Tang Rou hadn’t retorted, and afterwards, she spent her days and nights in intense training. Everyone saw this, and so An Wenyi temporarily refrained from expressing his opinion any further. After all, the five rounds hadn’t been fought yet, perhaps Tang Rou could really pull it off. As her teammate, at a time like this, An Wenyi went along with the others and chose to encourage her and cheer her on.</p>
<p>35 days passed, five rounds finished, and in the end Tang Rou hadn’t been able to do it. In the prep room after the match, An Wenyi didn’t rush to say anything, but everyone could see from his eyes just how dissatisfied he was.</p>
<p>And then, Tang Rou apologized, for her earlier irresponsibility. And then, she announced her decision: revoking her promise, and continuing to play.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, especially the most dissatisfied An Wenyi. Now, this rational player viewed Tang Rou’s decision as even more inconceivable.</p>
<p>Everyone knew the pressure she would have to bear from a decision like this.</p>
<p>The irresponsible Tang Rou now used this sort of method to take responsibility for her team. Why couldn’t she just soften up a bit, admit some weakness?</p>
<p>An Wenyi couldn’t understand. He just knew that if it were him, he never would have thought of this self-destructive tough method.</p>
<p>The prep room was quiet.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t anyone dissuading her? An Wenyi looked at Captain Ye Xiu, at Boss Chen Guo, at his other teammates, but no one said anything. Was it because no one recognized the severity of this problem? That certainly wasn’t the case. The current silence precisely demonstrated just how shocking and frightening Tang Rou’s decision here was.</p>
<p>But no one stood up to say anything. Had everyone lost their reason? An Wenyi wanted to step forward, wanted to logically analyze the most appropriate way to address this situation. But, he couldn’t open his mouth. How to address this? An Wenyi thought that she should just lower her head to the reporters, admit that her earlier words were improper, and earnestly request that everyone agree to let her withdraw her improper promise.</p>
<p>An Wenyi could clearly see that those reporters weren’t actually very interested in forcing a player to retire, as that would generate animosity towards themselves. They were looking forward to this kind of scene, her lowering her head. With that, they could paint themselves as saviors leading a player to the correct way.</p>
<p>Was that what had to happen?</p>
<p>In his mind, An Wenyi imagined Tang Rou’s voice quietly begging forgiveness, and he saw those gleeful, arrogant, puffed up faces. After that, those guys would of course generously accept Tang Rou.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” The rational An Wenyi actually swore, harshly kicking a locker. This was just so fucking disgusting! An Wenyi found that he couldn’t find it in himself to persuade Tang Rou to act any differently than she had.</p>
<p>“Then… that’s that!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Ye Xiu, come out here for a second.” Boss Chen Guo suddenly walked out of the prep room and called out to Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Ye Xiu followed her out.</p>
<p>Just when Tang Rou made her decision, a terrifying thought suddenly surfaced in Chen Guo’s mind.</p>
<p>Given Tang Rou’s personality, it wasn’t too hard to understand her making such a tough answer and taking greater pressure upon herself. And so, Chen Guo suddenly thought of Ye Xiu. That guy, maybe he anticipated early on that Tang Rou couldn’t 1v3 within five rounds. The five round limit was his taking advantage of the situation to throw her into a trap.</p>
<p>Because he had very clearly expressed before that Tang Rou’s dedication to Glory wasn’t stable. Her interest came from the challenge, so it was possible that one day, when she reached a certain height and there were no more challenges to interest her, she would lose her interest in Glory. At that time, this added to her life attitude of a casual rich girl, what would be her resulting attitude? Would she directly quit Glory, just like she had quit music? Or would she aimlessly continue along, just because she was part of the team? Neither outcome was one that Happy wanted to see. So this time, Ye Xiu threw Tang Rou into a trap, putting her in shackles and forcing her to endlessly fight?</p>
<p>“You woman, you’re really too scary!” Ye Xiu was shocked after hearing Chen Guo’s blunt questioning.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>Chen Guo sighed in relief. She didn’t know where this thought had come from either, perhaps because she had watched Ye Xiu for a while now, and his normal way of doing things was often rather cold and indifferent. But Chen Guo would not tolerate his orchestrating this kind of plan to the teammates at his side. Hearing his refutation, Chen Guo was relieved.</p>
<p>“But now, she…”</p>
<p>“She’ll suffer an enormous amount of pressure. This is really her personality, always choosing the most difficult and the most challenging,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>Tang Rou chose the most difficult way to face this. Then what about Chen Guo herself? She couldn’t retreat. As a team, no matter what, they should always support and accept every single member of the team. Today, she stood here with Tang Rou, with whom she was the closest, but if it were any other member of Happy, she would do the same.</p>
<p>With these beliefs, Chen Guo calmly faced the reporters who raged around her. Even if she couldn’t control her tears, she would be Tang Rou’s most firm supporter, the most firm supporter of every single player on Team Happy. Just like that.</p>
<p>Insane! Happy’s people are all insane.</p>
<p>This Tang Rou didn’t consider her own image at all, and Happy’s boss didn’t consider the effect of such a player on the team’s image as a whole. There were clearly problems with the thought process of this team’s operations, big problems.</p>
<p>Don’t they understand these principles? It seemed that they did, but they acted like this anyway. Tang Rou was willing to bear the public pressure, and Happy’s boss? Even under these conditions, she emphasized her thanks toward Tang Rou for making such a difficult decision for the team.</p>
<p>How could there be a team like this, how could there be a player like this!</p>
<p>The reporters were completely resentful of Happy and Tang Rou, who didn’t fit their expectations at all. When the winners of today’s match, Tiny Herb, came out for their press conference, the reporters were still alight with an anger that couldn’t immediately be extinguished.</p>
<p>They carelessly finished with their congratulations toward the winning party and immediately asked the Tiny Herb players for their thoughts on Happy’s actions today.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Hearing that Tang Rou made such an announcement, the Tiny Herb players who attended this press conference, Wang Jiexi, Gao Yingjie, and Liu Xiaobie, found it very surprising.</p>
<p>But soon enough, Wang Jiexi nodded his head. “She would do something like that!” Wang Jiexi couldn’t help but think of their time in the tenth server, when defeating Tang Rou was a matter of seconds for him. Even a beginner could tell the enormous disparity of skill that existed between them. But despite such a frightening disparity, Wang Jiexi could only defeat Tang Rou’s character and not her fighting spirit. As Tang Rou became more clearly aware of this disparity, Wang Jiexi sensed only an increased excitement from her.</p>
<p>From then, Wang Jiexi knew what kind of person this was. And then later there was the Challenger League, when Tang Rou once again refused Tiny Herb’s invitation, Wang Jiexi took another step in understanding how different Tang Rou was from the crowd.</p>
<p>Understanding how different she was from the crowd and then looking at the things these reporters were chattering about, even Wang Jiexi felt that they were laughable.</p>
<p>The reporters clearly felt that Tang Rou breaking her word like this and destroying her self-image would prevent her from continuing to exist in the Alliance, that she would have no more future.</p>
<p>“No powerhouse team would want a player with such a bad reputation ruining their image.”</p>
<p>Wang Jiexi heard this sound, spoken with confidence.</p>
<p>It was true, these words are very reasonable. But the problem was, the “future” of which you speak is entirely different from the future in Tang Rou’s eyes. This player, different from the rest, is absolutely not walking the normal, expected path of a pro player.</p>
<p>Powerhouse team?</p>
<p>This person had already rejected Tiny Herb twice now, a rejection with no hesitation or leeway. It was evident that Tiny Herb had nothing that attracted her. The so-called powerhouse team was nothing in her eyes.</p>
<p>These group of players that Ye Xiu found all had their quirks and defects, but they were all extremely reliable people! Thinking about this, Wang Jiexi discovered that he subconsciously admired them. But facing the reporters’ questions, he sensibly evaded.</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps there’s some reason she won’t honor her commitment! I’m not too sure, so I can’t very well say anything,” Wang Jiexi said.</p>
<p>“Then what do you think about Fang Rui saying that he could take on eight of you?” One reporter also dragged this statement over.</p>
<p>To this, Wang Jiexi just smiled a little. “I look forward to our next battle.”</p>
<p>To think that trash talk like this would provoke some reaction from Wang Jiexi, the reporters found that they were too naive. And from Wang Jiexi, they couldn’t find any interesting topic to discuss. They could only turn their attacks to the other two from Tiny Herb. Tang Rou’s actions once again became the focus of their questions.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty happy she didn’t quit. I look forward to battling her again.” Liu Xiaobie only looked at the result, not the process.</p>
<p>“No matter what, her courage and determination is worth learning,” Gao Yingjie said.</p>
<p>Society’s morals were degenerating day by day!</p>
<p>The reporters lamented. They couldn’t even hear strong condemnation of Tang Rou from Tiny Herb’s players?</p>
<p>Chapter 1197: Consequences</p>
<p>The storm caused by the 1v3 didn’t pass after the end of the competition. It could be said that for the reporters, the real excitement was only just starting.</p>
<p>Several reporters, Ruan Cheng at the lead, were enraged to the core by Tang Rou’s attitude, and they immediately began to write all sorts of articles condemning her. Esports Time, the publication for which Ruan Cheng wrote, was a bimonthly publication, so there was still a week before the next edition’s release. He couldn’t wait that long, and impatiently posted on his personal blog to begin a crusade against her, calling this whole thing a scandal and provoking a big reaction. The other major media outlets also reported on this matter, attacking from various angles.</p>
<p>But amidst all this, quite a few reporters gave understanding toward Tang Rou. Chang Xian, for example, clearly stood on Tang Rou’s side, looking down upon Ruan Cheng and all those other reporters. But the problem was, the company he worked for, Esports Home, had strict requirements of its subordinate reporters. Articles from invited reporters could have the warning “this does not represent the views of this publication” attached, but articles from their own reporters faced constraints.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Esports Home couldn’t have a position, but this time, Tang Rou’s actions were extremely controversial. Destroying one’s prior commitment like this was impossible to put in a good light. Up through now, Esports Home emphasized their impartiality in the circle, so for this situation, the conclusion of their discussion didn’t express a clear position, and they played a bit for both sides. With this, Chang Xian’s article expressing clear support for Happy and Tang Rou naturally wasn’t suitable and was shot down by the editor-in-chief three times. Chang Xian was a passionate young person. After all this hassle, he was tempted to just quit this and not write, but then he thought, if he did that, then wouldn’t the voices supporting Happy and Tang Rou become even weaker?</p>
<p>So Chang Xian dug through numerous articles written by his seniors, studying them to learn how to guide an opinion under these kind of circumstances so that when touching upon both sides at the conclusion, there would be a subtle leaning toward one side. These sort of games couldn’t hide from the experienced editor-in-chief, but as long as it wasn’t too obvious, a slight bias wasn’t a big problem. After all, a robotic article with no position would appear to lack judgment and influence.</p>
<p>On one hand, Esports Home placed strict limitations on their own articles, but on the other hand, they used this topic to draw many eyes. Esports Home invited two pieces from outsiders, one was the article posted by Ruan Cheng to his personal blog, and for the other, they found the famed commentator Cha Xiaoxia.</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng’s position was obvious. As for Cha Xiaoxia, that was someone who already publicly declared himself a Happy fanboy. This sort of commentator generally wouldn’t be invited to write about a team of which he was a fan, but now Esports Home specifically invited him, undoubtedly to counter Ruan Cheng’s position.</p>
<p>Cha Xiaoxia didn’t disappoint. He was warm and understanding toward Tang Rou, while cold and mocking towards Ruan Cheng and his people.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of voices, but overall, the indisputable truth of breaking one’s word generated mostly negative discussions of Tang Rou. Esports Home’s Chang Xian tried to express a vague position, Cha Xiaoxia flew a clear banner in her support, and a few others expressed understanding of her actions, but in the end they couldn’t gain the upper hand. In the end, even they had to admit that Tang Rou’s behavior was improper in some areas. They could only express their understanding, but they couldn’t describe her as completely faultless or justified.</p>
<p>Amidst the storm of criticism, real consequences quickly appeared. Various businesses who had taken an interest in Tang Rou all withdrew their intentions of making a deal. Even some sponsors who had already signed contracts with Happy expressed their extreme dissatisfaction with Tang Rou’s speech, putting a heavy question mark on the potential of future cooperation. Happy… Because they were just entering the Alliance, not many sponsors would directly sign a long contract with them. The standard was a one-year contract, and then depending on their performance and results this year, they would make further plans. And now, this negative attention was not something that the sponsors liked.</p>
<p>And then, the Alliance paid attention to this storm as well, and with “improper words and actions” as their reason, they gave Happy and Tang Rou a fine. The Alliance was very sensitive about matters of image. After all, in the beginning, video games were called “electronic heroin.” Even though public perception had greatly improved, the Alliance didn’t dare let their guard down.</p>
<p>Even though all of this had been somewhat expected, the ferocity of it all surprised Chen Guo. Especially the fine from the Alliance, it was like adding oil to the fire, making the condemning voices grow even louder.</p>
<p>What a pain!</p>
<p>Chen Guo was in low spirits. But when she arrived at the training room, she saw Ye Xiu and Wei Chen sitting in front of a computer in serious discussion.</p>
<p>That’s good, they haven’t been affected by this. Chen Guo was glad, and her admiration of the mental strength of these old veterans increased. With their fearless attitude toward attacks, the spirits of the others will stabilize quickly. A team really needed this sort of guiding compass presence!</p>
<p>As she thought this, Chen Guo walked over toward them to listen to what they were discussing.</p>
<p>“Tsk tsk tsk, these dumbasses, do they not do any background research before writing this stuff?” Wei Chen was saying.</p>
<p>“That sort of info probably isn’t publicly available! More importantly, they don’t have that sort of imagination!” Ye Xiu lamented.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true… Hey this… This one’s pretty harsh,” said Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“That’s what I call poison!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“They really don’t know how to spell death!”</p>
<p>“Forget the small shrimp, but the bigger fish are definitely done for,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“The first one to be taken care of will definitely be Ruan Cheng,” Wei Chen said confidently.</p>
<p>“He’s really doing this diligently,” said Ye Xiu.</p>
<p>“He’ll probably lose his job immediately?”</p>
<p>“Who knows!”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“Think he’ll be directly killed?” Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>“That’s probably an exaggeration!” said Ye Xiu. “We’re talking about a proper businessman here.”</p>
<p>“But this is his own daughter! For her to be attacked like this, even killing wouldn’t be enough to resolve the hate.”</p>
<p>“I think it’d probably just be…”</p>
<p>“Ahem!!!” Chen Guo loudly coughed, angrily interrupting this shameless discussion. And here she was thinking that they were discussing some serious topic, only to find that they were just dreaming about what kind of powerful retaliation Tang Rou’s background could help her execute.</p>
<p>“Boss is here?” Wei Chen turned his head and casually greeted her before going back to cheerfully look at those articles and discussions about Tang Rou.</p>
<p>“I came to see what you two were busy with over here!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“Oh, Little Tang’s really being attacked! How do you think her old man will help teach these guys a lesson?” Wei Chen actually tried to drag Chen Guo into the discussion as well.</p>
<p>“Shame on you! Little Tang already said that she was taking this upon herself, when has she ever used her background to get something?” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>“You can’t put it like that. We all know Little Tang’s domineering attitude, but this must be taking a toll on her dad’s heart! He has to take care of a few of them as a warning, don’t you think?” Wei Chen said, particularly confident.</p>
<p>With that, Chen Guo couldn’t find any rebuttal. She could only believe that Tang Rou absolutely would not turn back and beg her family to save her, but like Wei Chen said, even if Tang Rou didn’t need it, the Tang family might act anyway.</p>
<p>Just as she was hesitating, the door behind her opened and Tang Rou walked in, talking to someone on the phone.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fine, don’t worry about me, just leave it!”</p>
<p>She hung up the phone, and the other three in the room looked at each other. This phone call sounded like it was from Tang Rou’s family, and was probably about this situation. What was the Tang family going to do?</p>
<p>Looking at the three people who were in a daze, Tang Rou waved her phone. “My dad’s also worried about this!”</p>
<p>“What’d the old man say?” Wei Chen asked, filled with respect. “Bankrupt Esports Time first?”</p>
<p>“The new edition of Esports Time hasn’t even come out yet!” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“Even if you can’t chase the monk, you still have to tear down the monastery,” said Wei Chen.</p>
<p>“What nonsense is this!” Chen Guo said.</p>
<p>Just as she said this, her cell phone rang. Chen Guo answered, still with a hint of anger in her voice. “Yes?!”</p>
<p>“Is this Boss Chen?” A male voice spoke on the other end.</p>
<p>“Yes, who’s this?” Chen Guo checked the phone number on the screen, but it was an unknown number.</p>
<p>“This is Tang Shusen,” the other person said.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Chen Guo quickly thought about this name, it seemed a bit familiar!</p>
<p>“I apologize for the trouble Tang Rou has caused you. My daughter’s personality is just like that, very strong!” the caller said.</p>
<p>OH!</p>
<p>Chen Guo’s heart skipped a beat. Only now did she react to who this was, and she immediately answered, “Mr. Tang, sir, please don’t talk like that, we…”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!” Tang Rou evidently figured out who the caller was from Chen Guo’s words and attitude, and she rushed forward and snatched away Chen Guo’s phone.</p>
<p>“Dad, what are you doing!” Tang Rou said loudly, her face revealing an extremely rare expression of embarrassment.</p>
<p>They couldn’t hear what the caller said, but Tang Rou answered, flustered, “I know, I’ll take care of it myself. You go to your meeting!”</p>
<p>“Yes, alright.”</p>
<p>“How many times have I said it, my class is called Battle Mage, Battle Mage! Battle God is a title, it’s referring to one especially powerful character in this class.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes, the player controlling it is more important, you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s in our team now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the unspecialized Lord Grim. You know a lot about this!”</p>
<p>“Talk about what! You guys don’t speak the same language.” Tang Rou shouted.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and the other two looked at each other. Listening to that, it seemed that Tang Rou’s father had researched Glory, and even wanted to talk for a bit with God Ye Xiu?</p>
<p>“Dad, please stop making such a fuss, if you can’t beat Frost Forest then let Secretary Wang find you a guide.”</p>
<p>Sweat! The three others wiped at their sweat. This level of skill was really a bit low.</p>
<p>“I can beat it!”</p>
<p>“I can’t carry you! You’re in the eleventh server. Even if my character returned to the normal server, I can only go to the tenth server, so we wouldn’t be together.”</p>
<p>“No no, don’t come over, if I have time I’ll make a character over there and find you, okay! We need to start practice, I’m hanging up now.”</p>
<p>“Yes yes, see you!” Tang Rou finally hung up the phone. She let out a long breath, and then looked at the other three, embarrassment still showing on her face.</p>
<p>“Uh… He recently also got a Glory account, and he plays it sometimes in his spare time,” Tang Rou explained helplessly.</p>
<p>“I could hear.” Ye Xiu nodded.</p>
<p>“What’s his account name? I can give Wu Chen a heads up, take care of him a bit?” Chen Guo tried to be serious.</p>
<p>“If he wants to be an experience baby, then just leave him to me!” Wei Chen said with all the air of someone trying to curry favor.</p>
<p>“Can we please just start practice?” Tang Rou was almost crying.</p>
<p>Chapter 1198: The Observation Period Ends</p>
<p>The discussion about Tang Rou continued to be omnipresent, but in the end there was no mysterious power that intervened and stopped all of it. Her father gave her true non-interfering support and freedom. Even when something like this happened, he didn’t instantly stand up to protect her.</p>
<p>Tang Rou, facing all of this expected criticism, didn’t defend herself. She didn’t expect or hope for any understanding. She withdrew and just dove even further into Glory.</p>
<p>Compared to Tang Rou, Happy’s current situation didn’t look too good,either. The criticism the team received was secondary; more important was Happy’s score on the points ranking after eight rounds.</p>
<p>There were 38 rounds in a season, eight rounds meant that over one-fifth had passed. Happy currently had 31 points, ranked at 14th place.</p>
<p>For a new team that just joined the Alliance, a score like this perhaps wasn’t bad. Team Miracle, who had also just joined this season, only had 21 points and was ranked 18th. Last year’s new team Heavenly Swords only had 25 points, two places behind Happy.</p>
<p>But Happy wouldn’t be satisfied with this kind of point score or ranking because only they knew that their goal to win the championships in their first year absolutely was not just a shameless piece of trash talk.</p>
<p>If they wanted to win the championships, they first had to ensure they made it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>And right now, Happy had 31 points after 8 rounds, average 3.875 points per round.</p>
<p>“Let’s look at last season’s final point rankings.” During Happy’s team meeting, Ye Xiu analyzed the current situation in the League for everyone.</p>
<p>“Last season, in eighth place was Hundred Blossoms, with a final score of 190 points, averaging 5 points per round. But last season, because of the game update, many teams’ scores went down. If we look at Season 8, Team 301 Degrees in eighth place had 214 points, averaging 5.63 per round. And then looking at our season now, after eight rounds, the seventh and eighth place Tyranny and Hundred Blossoms each have 47 points, which is an average 5.875 points per match. Compared to previous seasons, the situation in the Alliance this season appears to be harsher.</p>
<p>“If we use the current scores after 8 rounds as the standard, a match average of 5.875 means 223 points after 38 rounds. This could very well be the threshold for entering playoffs this season. Right now, we only have 31 points. Subtracting 31 from 223, in the next 30 rounds, we’ll need an average of 6.41 points per round to reach that threshold.</p>
<p>“The situation is grim! 6.41 points isn’t very easy to get. As soon as we lose a team competition, that means there’s no way to get 6.41 points for that round. What then? That means we’ll have to make it up through other rounds. So, our goal for each round absolutely should not just be 6.41 points, we need 7, 8, or even more points, in order to guarantee that we raise our score.</p>
<p>“The end of eight rounds marks a line. From the statistics of previous seasons, we can see that in the beginning rounds of a season, most of the teams prioritize remaining cautious, observing each other, learning more about the situation, and testing each other. There aren’t too many unexpected surprises in battle. But after around the eighth or tenth round, they’re done sounding each other out, so the teams begin to individually target specific areas to work hard, and that’s when the real chaotic fighting begins. The Rookie Block, powerhouse teams capsizing in the gutter, many players’ conditions inexplicably decreasing, in reality, these aren’t without cause. It’s because after the early period of observation, all of the teams start putting real effort in. Whoever plays their moves better will have the last laugh. If competition only compared aces and God-level characters, then wouldn’t the champions be decided as soon as the team rosters were revealed for the season?</p>
<p>“Let’s work hard, and welcome the chaotic fighting to come! We will be the ones laughing until the end!”</p>
<p>After the situation was analyzed and understood, they began discussing their battle plans for their opponent in the next round.</p>
<p>In the ninth round, Happy would be playing an away game against the other team that had debuted this year, Team Miracle.</p>
<p>The end of eight rounds meant that Miracle had already played eight matches. And in these matches, what kind of of impression did they leave on their opponents? Ye Xiu began to take them apart in his analysis.</p>
<p>Glory Pro Alliance Season 10 Round 9 was on the evening of November 1st, and this day was also the release date of the new edition of the bimonthly Esports Time. Esports Time’s position and opinions were expressed much more clearly than Esports Home’s were. It was relying on this kind of style that they managed to claim their spot of territory in the area of esports media reporting. And Ruan Cheng, as a head writer for Esports Time, took thorough advantage of the resources at his disposal. The big topic for this edition of Esports Time was exposing Tang Rou’s conduct.</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng named this incident the biggest scandal in Glory history and described it in all sorts of flamboyant, unrestrained language. Many of her performances in the eight rounds to date were carved as proof that she was human scum.</p>
<p>An angelic appearance, a dirty heart…</p>
<p>Ruan Cheng’s words were extreme. After Chen Guo received this edition, she swiftly destroyed it. It brought down spirits too much, and besides, they still had a match tonight. And although Ruan Cheng thoroughly attacked Tang Rou, he didn’t discover her family situation, which almost made Chen Guo anticipate the Tang family standing up and giving Ruan Cheng a scare. This guy was just too despicable.</p>
<p>That night, the match was held at Team Miracle’s home stadium in City M. This team that purchased its players for only 5000 yuan didn’t appear to be a particularly wealthy team. Like Happy’s, they rented their home stadium. City M wasn’t home to any other Glory teams, so this stadium naturally didn’t originally have the specialized holographic Glory projection technology. However, the amount of resources a team possessed was an important criterion considered by the Alliance when approving a new team to join. Teams that applied didn’t get the same financial support from the Alliance that teams like Happy that won the Challenger League did. But Miracle was able to successfully pass the checks and enter the Alliance, which then led people to believe that this team wasn’t particularly short on money.</p>
<p>The projection technology in Miracle’s home stadium was impressive. At this time, before the match began, the host was accompanying the projection to introduce the players and characters of two teams.</p>
<p>After eight rounds, many teams found a strong sense of deja vu in Miracle’s roster: Excellent Era!</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t just because they had three players from Excellent Era, but also because of the class composition of this team.</p>
<p>Aside from the Elementalist, the Striker, and the Sharpshooter, who were the former Excellent Era players, the first-string players of this team were a Battle Mage, a Launcher, a Spellblade, and a Cleric.</p>
<p>This was entirely the same as the roster of the old Excellent Era. What was different was that old Excellent Era had Battle Mage, Launcher, and Spellblade as their core, while the current Miracle had these three classes as the orbiting moons, and the transferred players from Excellent Era, He Ming, Shen Jian, and Wang Ze became the central axes.</p>
<p>Among them, He Ming became Miracle’s captain. This former sixth player in Excellent Era probably never would have thought that he’d have the chance to lead a team himself. But Team Miracle? To be honest, leading a team like this, He Ming didn’t feel particularly well-off. Meeting Shen Jian and Wang Ze here was a sort of consolation, a reassurance that at least he wasn’t the only person to be met with such misfortune.</p>
<p>At Excellent Era, these three had just been teammates, but after they all fell and landed here, their relationship became much closer. These three would group together to wallow in their misfortune together, sometimes talking about the good old days they spent in the powerhouse that was Excellent Era. As of now, their other former teammates had all scattered. These three admired Liu Hao and Guo Yang, who had managed to enter Wind Howl and now had a certain position in that team. Especially Liu Hao, who had now become part of their main roster, and had performed quite well in the past eight rounds. Wind Howl, who had managed to obtain him through a free transfer, all felt that they got a great deal from this.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the Cleric player Zhang Jiaxing had gone with Xiao Shiqin to Thunderclap and was also doing very well there. This season, Thunderclap was playing more and more smoothly. They were actually ranked second on the current leaderboard with 61 points, losing only to Samsara and were earning lots of attention.</p>
<p>As for Sun Xiang, that genius-level being, He Ming and the others didn’t bother to envy his fortune at Team Samsara. Looking around, it seems that the three of them had drawn the shortest straw.</p>
<p>The three were all depressed about landing in Miracle, but they didn’t dare neglect this team. In this weak team, if they were careless and became relegated, then their futures would become even more awkward and uncertain. And so, these three players worked quite hard in Miracle. Right now, they were in 18th place with 21 points, with a solid lead above Bright Green and Seaside. They even beat Void in an away game 7 to 3, one of the rare upsets in the first eight rounds.</p>
<p>And this round, their opponent, Happy…</p>
<p>He Ming, Shen Jian, and Wang Ze had complicated mixed feelings toward Happy. Things were a bit simpler for He Ming, as he had already left Excellent Era during the season that the team was relegated, and he hadn’t experienced the sweeping pain when Excellent Era fell to Happy in the Challenger League. Looking at Happy, the only complicated feelings were toward his former captain Ye Xiu and former teammate Su Mucheng. As for Shen Jian and Wang Ze, who had experienced the Challenger League, Happy could be said to be the chief culprit of their current miserable situation. If there had been no Happy, then perhaps Excellent Era would currently be a big player, lifting high its three All-Stars and shining brightly in the playoff tier.</p>
<p>“We cannot lose this match!” October 27th, during a small meeting between the three of them five days before their match, Shen Jian declared.</p>
<p>But He Ming and Wang Ze didn’t say anything. That person in Happy’s roster was a shadow upon them.</p>
<p>“That… won’t be too easy…” Wang Ze hesitated for a moment, but said it. In the current leaderboard, Happy had a lead of ten points above them. Pro players wouldn’t feel that a match outcome was decided because of a point difference. For Wang Ze, the scary thing was still that person. In front of that person, he felt that he had no way of relaxing his hands and feet, that any of his movements would be thoroughly scrutinized and seen through.</p>
<p>“Right now, they’re bruised and battered. It’s a perfect chance for us to earn points,” Shen Jian said.</p>
<p>He Ming and Wang Ze froze, and then suddenly understood.</p>
<p>That’s right! That Tang Rou in Happy had really stirred up a lot of trouble this time. If she’d been in the old Excellent Era, she probably would have already been kicked out, and even if not, she’d be buried and hidden. Happy was currently in a rough time, and these waves wouldn’t calm down again so quickly. November 1st was the ninth round and also the release date of the new edition of Esports Time. There would definitely be articles about this.</p>
<p>Let them see the articles during the day, then battle them at night. This rhythm was quite excellent!</p>
<p>Chapter 1199: Team Miracle’s Sacrificial Pawn</p>
<p>Team Miracle’s home stadium.</p>
<p>After the two teams were introduced, the players on both sides entered the venue and met in the center of the stage, shaking each other’s hands and greeting each other warmly. It looked as if their relationship was friendly and joyous.</p>
<p>He Ming was Team Miracle’s captain. He gave a most amicable greeting towards his former captain Ye Xiu, particularly showing his concern for the recent 1v3 controversy.</p>
<p>“That guy Ruan Cheng is too outrageous!” He Ming said indignantly. “He’s talking nonsense again in today’s issue of the Esports Time. He really is unbearable. Did you guys see it? If you guys haven’t, I have one here. It’s truly infuriating.”</p>
<p>He Ming held a copy of today’s issue of the Esports Time and promptly took it out with who knew what motives. He directly opened the conversation with an article about Happy, asking in a concerned manner about Ye Xiu and the rest of Happy’s opinions.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn’t brush away his good intentions. Even though he had already seen the article, he still took it.</p>
<p>“Is one copy good enough? I’ve got more, if you guys need more!” He Ming said. The members of Team Miracle seemed to have all conjured up a copy in their hands.</p>
<p>“Team Miracle really likes to read! What a good practice,” Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>“You’re too kind,” He Ming said modestly.</p>
<p>“Just one copy is enough. You guys can keep the rest!” Ye Xiu smiled.</p>
<p>“Hey! There’s no need to be polite between us! Take them take them.” He Ming signaled Team Miracle’s players to hand over their copies of the Esports Time to everyone in Happy. After handing the copies over, they didn’t give Happy an opportunity to refuse. He Ming led Team Miracle down from the stage, while waving towards Ye Xiu. “See you in the match.”</p>
<p>“See you in the match…” Ye Xiu waved his hand and then led Team Happy back to their seats.</p>
<p>On Miracle’s side, the group was stealthily glancing towards Happy’s side.</p>
<p>“They’re reading it! They’re reading it!”” someone yelled out excitedly. Quite a few people from Happy were taking a look at the Esports Time paper that they had shoved into their hands.</p>
<p>“Hehe…” He Ming, Shen Jian, and Wang Ze looked at each other and chuckled as if they had won.</p>
<p>The official match soon started. The first competition would be the individual competition. The players to be sent out by the two teams appeared on the large screens in the stadium.</p>
<p>Happy would be sending out Wei Chen, Warlock Windward Formation.</p>
<p>The three bros in Team Miracle whispering in each other’s ears suddenly froze. Hadn’t Ye Xiu always gone up first? Why’d they change it up today? Their Team Miracle had sent up their Spellblade Xiang Yuanwei. Of their six players in the individual rounds, he was their weakest. Team Miracle’s plan had been employing the principle of Tian Ji’s Horse Race, throwing their weakest to face Ye Xiu. How could they have known the other side would suddenly switch up the order?</p>
<p>Wei Chen?</p>
<p>This player could be considered an elderly person in the competitive scene. He had appeared an extremely limited number of times this season. Why was he sent out against their Team Miracle? Was this contempt?</p>
<p>He Ming and his two bros were furious. After all, they had once been part of a powerhouse. Even though they had fallen, they weren’t about to let others stomp on them as they pleased.</p>
<p>“Yuanwei!” He Ming called out to Yuanwei, “Play fast! Fight fiercely!”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Xiang Yuanwei nodded his head. He had originally been their throwaway piece. As the time drew near, he stepped onto the stage.</p>
<p>He Ming and the others had been planning on giving up this fight, so they hadn’t put a lot of thought into it. They just listened to whatever Xiang Yuanwei wanted for a map and didn’t object to it.</p>
<p>The map was Sky Garden.</p>
<p>The terrain wasn’t complicated, but it was an exceptionally beautiful map. Spellblades had a lot of flashy moves, so they would sometimes reap surprising results from this map. Xiang Yuanwei didn’t seem to have given up despite being a throwaway piece. He still put in quite some thought into choosing a map.</p>
<p>The match began. The two characters moved towards the center from their starting corners.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei listened to his captain’s advice. He didn’t play any fancy tricks and quickly went forward to take the initiative. As for Wei Chen, he pretended to charge forward wildly for a short distance, then amidst the crowd’s boos, he shamelessly hid inside a thicket of flowers. But it seemed that he still felt like it wasn’t enough cover, so he had his character lie flat on his stomach. The large screen cut to Windward Formation’s viewpoint. He was carefully looking around from the cracks between the flowers like an evil ghost.</p>
<p>The boos from the crowd intensified.</p>
<p>Team Miracle wasn’t very popular, but they still had fans. In these moments, they obviously had to give their support to the home team. Wei Chen’s despicable ambush was immediately condemned by them. Everyone hated how the referee didn’t just directly red card the guy away for such dirtiness. Happy had previous history for this! The crowd impatiently hoped to see this scene again.</p>
<p>Happy had a previous offense before, so the referee really was paying close attention to them, his demands more strict. The referee saw Wei Chen setting up an ambush and subconsciously started checking the time.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei’s Spellblade rushed forward, but the thicket of flowers chosen by Wei Chen was too thick. Xiang Yuanwei rotated his Spellblade Halis’s viewpoint left and right, passing over Windward Formation’s hiding spot several times, but he failed to notice him. The crowd was feeling even more anxious than the player.</p>
<p>1v1 maps weren’t very big. Sky Garden didn’t have complicated terrain. Since he couldn’t find his target, he had Halis raise his sword in the air.</p>
<p>Fire Wave Sword!</p>
<p>A wave of raging flames rolled forth, leaving scorch marks everywhere in its path. The frail flowers and grass were instantly burned by the Fire Wave Sword and turned into ash.</p>
<p>After this sword came another.</p>
<p>Earthquake Sword!</p>
<p>The magic waves from the sword intent raised up the earth, uprooting the grass and flowers, lifting them up and then pressing down. Even though it wasn’t as clean as Fire Wave Sword, it would still be obvious if anyone was hiding there.</p>
<p>But Windward Formation was still nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Halis turned around and pointed the tip of his sword in a different direction.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei wasn’t throwing around his skills randomly. His wave swords always aimed at areas lush with flowers and grass, letting him cover a wide range of possible hiding locations. Just from these two wave swords, it could be seen that this player was quite familiar with this map.</p>
<p>The third wave sword was aimed directly at Windward Formation’s hiding spot.</p>
<p>Ice Wave Formation!</p>
<p>A wave of ice surged forth, freezing any plant it touched. The next wave of ice shattered these frozen plants, sprinkling ice crystals onto the ground.</p>
<p>Windward Formation still isn’t going to move?</p>
<p>Everyone looked towards Wei Chen’s Warlock. Sure enough, this time, he could not sit at ease any longer. Windward Formation scrambled to dodge, rolling backwards in an extremely ugly manner.</p>
<p>Ice Wave Sword had a limited range. With this backwards roll, he was able to escape from the wave sword’s range while also staying hidden.</p>
<p>Too crafty!</p>
<p>Everyone thought to themselves. However, Xiang Yuanwei wasn’t just using these wave swords to scout out the area. Whenever he released a wave sword, his viewpoint spun quickly, observing the movements of the grass and wind at every location. The moment his Ice Wave Sword came out, Xiang Yuanwei noticed a rustle from the flower thicket at the end of the ice wave.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei was the weakest in Team Miracle. In the past eight rounds, he had only appeared once in the team competition. However, just because he was weak didn’t mean he didn’t work hard. Even if he was just a sacrificial pawn, he would still try his best, choosing his best map. It didn’t matter who his opponent was. He would strive to win.</p>
<p>Seeing a rustle from the thicket of flowers, Xiang Yuanwei didn’t wait for Ice Wave Sword to finish and immediately moved towards in that direction.</p>
<p>Electric Wave Formation!</p>
<p>After Windward Formation rolled out of the way of Ice Wave Sword, he just happened to be within the formation’s range. The ball of electricity shot out lightning, automatically chasing after Windward Formation, who was still hiding in a bush. The lightning shot through his body, the flash sweeping away the surrounding flowers. Windward Formation, who had been lying in ambush, was completely revealed. He cut a sorry figure, pressed onto the ground by the lightning. The crowd instantly erupted into cheers and laughter.</p>
<p>Too awesome!</p>
<p>Seeing someone so shameless in such a sorry state was too satisfying!</p>
<p>The crowd’s emotions reached a high point, but Xiang Yuanwei wasn’t happy just because of this. He wanted to win, and it was still too early to tell. It was just an Electric Wave Formation, not a serious blow.</p>
<p>What was important was that he had finally located his opponent’s position. Xiang Yuanwei had Halis rush forward, brandishing the shortsword in his hand.</p>
<p>Storm Wave Sword!</p>
<p>This wave sword was the fastest among all wave swords. A powerful whirlwind roared out from Halis’s sword, ripping apart any plants in its path. By the time these shredded plants drifted down, who knew how far away the Storm Wave Sword’s sword intent would be at.</p>
<p>Trapped by the Electric Wave Formation, Windward Formation was unable to dodge this extremely fast attack. The Storm Wave Sword didn’t seem to be striking him; it just looked as if it flitted by him like the wind. But immediately afterwards, numerous thin arrows of blood shot out from Windward Formation’s body.</p>
<p>After these two skills, Halis was finally in position. Spellblades kiting around the target at the farthest range possible wasn’t a good choice because the speed of wave swords wasn’t very fast. If they were too far away, the opponent could easily dodge it. Thus, compared to their skill’s attack range, Spellblades needed to fight at a slightly closer range. As for exactly how much closer, that depended on the player’s hand speed and fighting style.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei’s most comfortable and favorite distance was at two-thirds of his wave swords’ range. At this moment, his Halis had finally reached this position.</p>
<p>Earthquake Sword!</p>
<p>This low-level skill had a short cooldown, allowing him to use it once again. At a distance of two-thirds, dodging this attack would require faster reaction speed and hand speed, and these just happened to be what old generals lacked.</p>
<p>“He’s playing well!!” Down from the stage, Team Miracle’s unfortunate three were grouped together in a very good mood. Even though Xiang Yuanwei was their sacrificial pawn, it didn’t mean they had no hopes for him. Seeing that he was playing well, these three saw this lower skilled player in a new light.</p>
<p>“Sending such an old guy onto the stage, what is Ye Xiu thinking!” Shen Jian sighed.</p>
<p>“Probably to stabilize the situation? Old generals are better at dealing with pressure, after all!” He Ming had been thinking about the meaning behind Wei Chen being sent out the entire time.</p>
<p>“But in the end, he’s going to lose?” Shen Jian laughed.</p>
<p>“Our Team Miracle isn’t that easy to bully!” He Ming was quite excited. When things were going well, he was very willing to be in character, viewing himself as a glorious member of Team Miracle.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the situation suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei had just gotten into his favorite distance and was about to have Halis continue his onslaught, when he was suddenly engulfed by a plume of purple fire.</p>
<p>Warlock skill: Shadow Flames!</p>
<p>Chapter 1200: Death’s Door Opens Wide</p>
<p>Shadow Flames dealt primarily dark element damage, with supporting fire element damage. However, no one would focus on the damage for Warlock skills. The control skills, and status effects inflicted by Warlocks were the most uncomfortable to deal with.</p>
<p>Shadow Flames was no different. Apart from the first wave of health this skill seared off, it would inflict a six second long Flames effect, a damaging status that did damage every two seconds. This status damage also interrupted chants. The Wave Swords of Spellblades were instant, but Wave Formations were chanted. With Shadow Flames, a Spellblade’s rhythm would be heavily disrupted.</p>
<p>But when was this Shadow Flame unleashed?</p>
<p>Everyone was so focused on Halis’ Wave Swords and Wave Formations that no one ever noticed.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei was also shocked, suddenly afraid of being too reckless. But if he didn’t charge, Wei Chen wouldn’t let this chance go. An explosion of Curse Arrows shot out from the flower bush, clearly having been charged for a long time.</p>
<p>Shadow Flame didn’t affect the character’s movement, so Xiang Yuanwei hurriedly had Halis dodge, hoping to throw his own attack back as he did, but that was when he realized that, out of all the instant cast Wave Swords, only Waltzing Wave Sword was available.</p>
<p>Waltzing Wave Sword, as the name implied, didn’t strike in a straight line. In a team competition, it could often create unexpected effects, but right now it was a 1v1 fight with just a single target. No matter what arc the attack made, the destination was the same. Apart from being able to use it to ambush others in specific situations, Waltzing Wave Sword would just be giving the opponent ample time to dodge when fighting face to face.</p>
<p>However, apart from this Sword, the other Wave Sword skills were all in cooldown.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei immediately realized that he had most likely fell into a rather terrifying trap. His Wave Sword skills were almost all on cooldown, and his Wave Formations were under restriction from Shadow Flames. These six seconds were purposefully created by his opponent, so how could the other let him go so easily?</p>
<p>Even as he struggled with himself for this split second, Waltzing Wave Sword was still sent out. With the attack, flowers and grass flew everywhere, and it left a clear arc across the ground. If you couldn’t dodge that, then you really didn’t have any right to stand on this stage. Xiang Yuanwei really had no choice. He didn’t have the time to adjust himself, so he could only strike back like that to give his opponent a little pressure, even if it was miniscule.</p>
<p>And then, retreat…</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei hurriedly had Halis back away, wanting to get some distance. He knew that danger could come from anywhere around him. His opponent didn’t just hide his character, but used such a simple action to lure him into action and strategically beat him down.</p>
<p>Sly old fox!</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei commented on Wei Chen as he had his character escape. Speaking of which, he had thought that his opponent would be Ye Xiu and his head was filled with the strange ever-changing style of the Unspecialized! Yet he had ended up meeting a Warlock, and an endlessly shameless Warlock, too.</p>
<p>Halis was continuously moving backwards and Xiang Yuanwei didn’t dare have his character turn. He still had to keep an eye on what this shameless Warlock would do to try and disrupt him. Yet, what was most surprising, was that the other didn’t do anything. The flora was completely silent, as if Windward Formation had suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>What was this about?</p>
<p>After jumping back twice again, Xiang Yuanwei had Halis stop his retreat, confused.</p>
<p>The audience wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei couldn’t see what Windward Formation was doing in the bushes, but they could! Windward Formation, this shameless Warlock, was currently flat on the ground, charging up a spell. Players familiar with with Warlock class immediately recognized the endlessly gathering energy. Death’s Door, this was the Warlock’s level 70 ultimate, Death’s Door!</p>
<p>Using the cover from the terrain as well as a psychological understanding of his opponent, Wei Chen fearlessly and directly started chanting a time and mana consuming skill, Death’s Door.</p>
<p>“Attack already!!!”</p>
<p>Many members of the audience was already shouting desperately, even the members of Miracle, Xiang Yuanwei’s teammates, had stood up, fists clenched.</p>
<p>However, Xiang Yuanwei had his Halis carefully, cautiously observe his surroundings as he inched forwards towards the bushes Windward Formation was hiding in, sword raised.</p>
<p>Caution was good, but caution at a time like this just made the audience so desperate they wanted to curse.</p>
<p>It was only until the bushes Windward Formation was hiding in were no longer sufficient to cover up the miasma gathering at the tip of Death’s Hand that Xiang Yuanwei realized something was wrong. If he still didn’t know what this was by then, then he couldn’t be called a pro player at all.</p>
<p>Run?</p>
<p>Too late!</p>
<p>Death’s Door had a very wide area of effect, in addition, Windward Formation was a Warlock with a terrifying attack range. This Death’s Door wouldn’t give him any chance to run.</p>
<p>He’d have to go for it!</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei was quick at coming to a decision. If he couldn’t run, then he would advance and find a way to interrupt the skill. Death’s Door was a skill that had to be maintained even after being activated. They could be interrupted any time from when they began chanting to the end of the skill.</p>
<p>GO!!!</p>
<p>The audience roared as one. They all felt that at this distance, with the Spellblade’s attack range, there really wasn’t anything to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei thought the same.</p>
<p>Halis charged forwards, magic pulsing around his blade.</p>
<p>Attack!</p>
<p>The short sword swung out!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A thunderous noise that seemed to pierce dimensions boomed.</p>
<p>A black, spinning door that led to another world rotated slowly, set up directly in front of Halis.</p>
<p>Holy crap!!</p>
<p>Countless audience members fell out of their seats.</p>
<p>This Death’s Door was actually placed between the two.</p>
<p>This way, if Xiang Yuanwei had realized what was happening and turned to run like a noob, then he might really be able to run out of Death’s Door’s range.</p>
<p>However, he was a pro player, and his experience told him that running was impossible, so he tried to close in to interrupt and ran directly into the door of death.</p>
<p>The Death’s Door was probably delighted and surprised. It probably never had such easy prey before in its life. Its miasma tentacles barely stretched out of the door and were already at Halis’ shoulders.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei didn’t even have the time to attempt a dodge before he was caught by the tentacles of miasma. Then, he was easily pulled into the door.</p>
<p>Death’s Door came quickly and left quickly, too. In a 1v1, Death’s Door was primarily focused on damage. As for its control abilities, Warlocks had to continuously maintain Death’s Door so even if they trapped their target, they couldn’t send out other attacks.</p>
<p>However, Death’s Door’s attack, coming from another, demonic dimension, wasn’t anything easy to deal with. Apart from the damage, the target would be thrown about and disoriented.</p>
<p>Chaotic Rain, Hexagram Prison, Grasping Phantoms…</p>
<p>Wei Chen very calmly, with a not all that fast hand speed, sent out the skills he had long since prepared one by one.</p>
<p>Halis was inflicted with countless negative status effects. He was sometimes confused, sometimes bound, sometimes controlled, sometimes imprisoned…</p>
<p>Wei Chen had a very good rhythm to his attacks. If a veteran like him couldn’t even control his own rhythm, then there was no point in him continuing to fight on the pro scene. No matter how experienced, he wouldn’t be able to utilize it.</p>
<p>Xiang Yuanwei refused to give up, but his struggles never managed to turn the tides. Halis still fell in the end.</p>
<p>Wei Chen won and Xiang Yuanwei left the stage, depressed.</p>
<p>His heart was filled with what ifs. If he did this… if he only did that…</p>
<p>However, there were no ifs in competition. These ifs could all be turned into experience and help the player grow.</p>
<p>Wei Chen was naturally delighted when he came back. He took the boos from the audience as cheers, walking as if he was ten years younger.</p>
<p>“What other result could you expect with me at the helm?” After returning to the bench, he accepted everyone’s praises and complemented himself without any semblance of modesty.</p>
<p>“Amazing!” Ye Xiu didn’t even send him one word of mockery.</p>
<p>“What’s up today? How come you’re being so nice to each other?” Chen Guo was surprised. It was downright unnatural that Ye Xiu and Wei Chen didn’t mock each other.</p>
<p>“Hahaha…” Ye Xiu chucked, but didn’t explain.</p>
<p>Hearing these praises, Wei Chen took his fill of boasting and, when he had enough, he shook his head. “I’m going to go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Gazing at his retreating form, everyone was stunned. Something like that was something everyone should’ve dealt with before the match! Only one individual battle had gone by, it hadn’t been long.</p>
<p>“He… didn’t win as easily as it might seem,” Ye Xiu suddenly said.</p>
<p>“Ah?” Chen Guo was confused.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say a single taunt for the entire match,” Ye Xiu sighed.</p>
<p>Chen Guo continued to be stunned. Gazing at Wei Chen’s retreating figure, Chen Guo felt as though she saw a well-hidden exhaustion in his form, despite the arrogance he had came off stage with.</p>
<p>As for over here…</p>
<p>“I’m going up, then!” Su Mucheng stood. She was the second player to go up on Happy’s side.</p>
<p>“Good luck,” everyone said.</p>
<p>“It’s Su Mucheng.” Over at Miracle, the unlucky three looked to their former teammate’s name, flashing across the screen, and then saw Su Mucheng walk towards the stage.</p>
<p>“Leave it to me.” Wang Ze seemed very confident. He had been arranged in the individual competition and had hoped to be set against Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>“Good luck, the time to prove yourself has come!” He Ming said to Wang Ze.</p>
<p>When Wang Ze was in Excellent Era, he couldn’t count as a core player. Pros in his position all had the desire to prove themselves.</p>
<p>However, Excellent Era was no longer here, and he didn’t have to fight for his position in the team anymore. Instead, he had to prove himself to the entire pro circle. The All-Star level ex-teammate of his, Su Mucheng, was the best opponent he could ask for.</p>
<p>It was because this sort of clash gave people something to talk about and was very eye-catching.</p>
<p>“I have an ace up my sleeve!” Wang Ze went up, full of confidence.</p>
<p>Chapter 1201: An Ace That Isn&rsquo;t Cool at All</p>
<p>Wang Ze hadn&rsquo;t been a senior player during his time at Excellent Era. When Ye Xiu was still there, he had been a rookie, appearing a few times as a sub starting season 8, before following Excellent Era to relegations.</p>
<p>Team Excellent Era&rsquo;s players were rather sought after, but at that time, the relegated Excellent Era hadn&rsquo;t given up yet. Drawing in Thunderclap&rsquo;s Xiao Shiqin steadied their hearts, and as a result, the vast majority of Team Excellent Era&rsquo;s players chose to stay.</p>
<p>Wang Ze was one of them. However, unlike his other teammates who had the choice to accept an invite or stay with the team, he had no choices because no one had showed any interest in him.</p>
<p>To Wang Ze, this was a slap to his face. Even though he didn&rsquo;t feel like he was particularly amazing, he still had confidence in his own skill, yet no one was interested in him?</p>
<p>Wang Ze cared quite a lot about this issue. At that time, he had been in the competitive scene for two years, but he failed to attract enough attention in his few appearances on stage. He very much wanted to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>But in the third season of his professional career, what made him even more depressed was that the powerhouse Excellent Era had actually lost to the Internet cafe team Happy in the Challenger League.</p>
<p>That moment had been a dark one for everyone in Team Excellent Era. After Excellent Era disbanded and the team members parted ways, Wang Ze had been quite terrified because he hadn&rsquo;t received any invites when Excellent Era had been relegated the previous season. And in their last season, Excellent Era had been playing in the Challenger League. The attention towards them had been limited, and he had truly feared that no one would be interested in him.</p>
<p>Wang Ze had hoped for an invite, but none came. He had watched as his teammates left him one after the other, watched as Excellent Era collapsed, and watched as someone took over.</p>
<p>At that time, the players who had yet to leave all received invites from the new boss, who called for them to hang on for one more year and return to the Pro League anew.</p>
<p>Wang Ze remembered clearly that Qiu Fei, who had just been promoted from the training camp, decisively chose to stay.</p>
<p>Idiot&hellip;</p>
<p>Wang Ze had thought to himself. That season, if there was one person who was particularly eye-catching in Excellent Era, it would be the new rookie Qiu Fei. He was a youth with a bright future ahead of him. He didn&rsquo;t need to worry that he would have nowhere to go. However, Qiu Fei had actually believed in the new investor&rsquo;s plans and chose to stay.</p>
<p>But what did the new Excellent Era have?</p>
<p>Su Mucheng had left along with her Dancing Rain. Sun Xiang and One Autumn Leaf had left. Xiao Shiqin and Life Extinguisher had returned to their mother team.</p>
<p>The remaining Excellent Era was no longer a powerhouse. How could breezing through the Challenger League be so easy?</p>
<p>Wang Ze had already wasted a year. He had no intentions of wasting away in the Challenger League. Unfortunately, he still hadn&rsquo;t received any invites. Staying was at least one path that would let him continue as a pro player.</p>
<p>Wang Ze wasn&rsquo;t willing, but he also didn&rsquo;t want to resort to this last straw. Luckily, Team Miracle came around and showed interest in him. Wang Ze didn&rsquo;t hesitate to pick his new team. In his eyes, being able to remain in the Pro League was better than anything else.</p>
<p>Thus, Wang Ze joined Team Miracle. Afterwards, Shen Jian joined too, cursing and swearing after wandering around in a circle. Shen Jian&rsquo;s situation had been better than his. He had received invites from the start, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to negotiate well enough with any of them, leaving Team Miracle as his only choice left. Along with feelings of helplessness for not getting recognized for his talents, he and Wang Ze were packaged together and sent to Team Miracle. Over there, He Ming was waiting for them with his status as the core player, after being traded away for Xiao Shiqin when Excellent Era relegated and fighting in the Pro League for a year.</p>
<p>The three were former teammates, who had gathered together again at Team Miracle. No one had been delighted at that. Instead, a feeling of being cheated had sprung up in their hearts.</p>
<p>But they had already fallen into the hole. If they wanted to get out, they&rsquo;d have to rely upon themselves. Each carrying their own thoughts and hopes, the three began their journey with Team Miracle. Wang Ze hoped that he would be able to get recognition for his skill this season. Even if Team Miracle was relegated in the end, he would at least have invites waiting for him.</p>
<p>His opponent this round was Su Mucheng, an All-Star. If he could beat her, it would be definitive proof of his skill. And towards this former teammate of his, he felt like he knew the key to winning.</p>
<p>After the five second countdown, the match began.</p>
<p>Map: Desolate Town 7.</p>
<p>Desolate Town was a series of maps. If all 17 maps were put together, the map would be a complete town. But in reality, especially in a 1v1, the complete town was too big, so it was split into 17 parts. These 17 parts were of different sizes. Desolate Town 7 was the smallest among them, suitable for a 1v1.</p>
<p>As former teammates, the three from Miracle knew which maps Su Mucheng favored. Wang Ze mainly wanted to bump into Su Mucheng today, so he had prepared a map specifically for her. Desolate Town 7 was a map that Su Mucheng was good at, and as her former teammate, he knew how Su Mucheng liked to play in this map. This was why Wang Ze had chosen it. He wasn&rsquo;t hoping his opponent was unfamiliar with the map, but rather familiar with it. That way he would have a greater understanding of his opponent.</p>
<p>The two characters headed towards each other from their spawn corners. Wang Ze&rsquo;s Sharpshooter was called Kashiben, a character provided by Team Miracle. It was worse than his former Team Excellent Era character, and he had spent a lot of effort to adjust it to his preferences and habits.</p>
<p>Kashiben moved forward quickly, looking far into the distance onto the clock tower in the town.</p>
<p>The clock tower was this map&rsquo;s highest point. By seizing the high ground, one would have nearly complete coverage of the map. Desolate Town 7 was the desolate map with the most narrow and winding alleys, which wasn&rsquo;t too favorable for long-ranged gunners. Su Mucheng had been forced to be good at this map because too many opponents wanted to utilize this map to restrict the Alliance&rsquo;s Number One Launcher. As a result, Su Mucheng had to specifically practice and study this map until it actually became one of her best maps.</p>
<p>The clock tower was a location that Su Mucheng frequently occupied. She had the high ground there, allowing her to easily catch her opponent&rsquo;s position. Then, she could utilize her long-ranged capabilities to attack from afar. It was one of her most used tactics.</p>
<p>But&hellip; not today!</p>
<p>Wang Ze thought to himself. Their relationship as teammates was mutual. Since he had chosen this map, Su Mucheng wouldn&rsquo;t be so stupid as to go to it. She would intentionally avoid the spot she liked the most because her teammate knew about it.</p>
<p>Once she gave up on her usual plan, what would she do?</p>
<p>According to her habits and preferences, Wang Ze bravely made a prediction. He was currently heading over to verify it. He believed that his prediction should be correct. As a gunner class too, Wang Ze trusted that his understanding of Su Mucheng&rsquo;s thought process was very thorough.</p>
<p>Kashiben traveled through the small alleyway. Wang Ze&rsquo;s strategy was very clear. But from time to time, he would still take a glance at the clock tower. After all, it was possible that Su Mucheng would be stubborn. However, Wang Ze would be even happier if that were the case. The route he chose was a dead spot for the clock tower. If Su Mucheng went to the clock tower, he would give her a big surprise.</p>
<p>A flawless plan! Wang Ze felt satisfied with himself.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Su Mucheng appeared.</p>
<p>Utilizing Aerial Launcher, with a few ups and downs, she landed on the clock tower. Thinking that she wouldn&rsquo;t go over there, Wang Ze nearly exposed himself. Luckily, Wang Ze noticed her actions in time and hastily rolled to a dead angle in the clock tower&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>So she actually went there.</p>
<p>Wang Ze calculated the time. For Dancing Rain to make it onto the clock tower right now, she had to have taken a straight line to there, not wasting any time.</p>
<p>Was she not afraid that he would take advantage of that location?</p>
<p>Wang Ze was confident, but he didn&rsquo;t think Su Mucheng was stupid. As a result, when he saw Su Mucheng suddenly make what seemed to be a brainless move, Wang Ze stopped to think about it.</p>
<p>If Su Mucheng understood his intentions for picking this map but still made this choice, what was she plotting?</p>
<p>There were two possibilities.</p>
<p>First, she didn&rsquo;t think much of Wang Ze&rsquo;s strength, so she did as she always did.</p>
<p>Second, she guessed how Wang Ze would respond, so she had set up a trap and was intentionally luring the snake out of its hole.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng wasn&rsquo;t stupid nor was she an arrogant person, so it was most likely the second possibility.</p>
<p>Setting up a trap and luring him out.</p>
<p>Wang Ze smirked. This was the Su Mucheng that he knew.</p>
<p>It was just that this time, he wouldn&rsquo;t fall for it.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng perhaps knew where the dead angles were from this clock tower, but did she know which of these dead angles allowed for direct attacks to the clock tower?</p>
<p>Wang Ze didn&rsquo;t think Su Mucheng knew.</p>
<p>Because only long-ranged classes had the range to reach her from those spots, and very few long-ranged players would choose this map. As for Su Mucheng, she had never encountered a long-ranged opponent on this map. This wasn&rsquo;t Wang Ze guessing. He had looked through all of Su Mucheng&rsquo;s data on this map.</p>
<p>Detailed and thorough analysis, understanding, and preparation. These were Wang Ze&rsquo;s trump cards. Perhaps they weren&rsquo;t very cool, but they were practical.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain was still looking around from up on the clock tower, or perhaps she was guessing where Wang Ze would attack from.</p>
<p>No need!</p>
<p>Wang Ze smiled. He swiped his mouse, and Kashiben readied for a Thunder Snipe.</p>
<p>Sharpshooters had lower range than Launchers. Only Thunder Snipe was the exception. However, Wang Ze didn&rsquo;t want to attack from too far away in this situation, otherwise Su Mucheng would have time to react and dodge it.</p>
<p>The sniping spot he had chosen was the perfect distance.</p>
<p>At this range, if she didn&rsquo;t know ahead of time, by the time she heard the sound of the trigger, it would be too late to dodge. Even more so in a situation where Su Mucheng couldn&rsquo;t even see where it was coming from. Trying to react just based on sound was even more impossible.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain&rsquo;s forehead and long hair could be seen clearly through the ten-fold magnified sniper scope.</p>
<p>Gunshot!</p>
<p>A spurt of fresh blood flowed out from that forehead, instantly covering his scoped view with red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsk tsk, this type of attack should just instant kill her.&rdquo; Wang Ze sighed. After using the skill, he retracted his sniper rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Wang Ze saw a bright flame in the sky spiraling towards him.</p>
<p>Chapter 1202: Familiar Rhythm</p>
<p>This is?</p>
<p>Wang Ze panicked for a moment, but he quickly calmed down again. Judging from the flight path of this whirling flame, it couldn&rsquo;t hit his position no matter what.</p>
<p>At this moment, a gunshot sounded.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>After a gunshot, there was the sound of an impact. The spinning flame in the air vibrated, but it wasn&rsquo;t extinguished. It now flew forward at a higher speed, and after this collision, there was a clear change in the flame&rsquo;s trajectory. Originally, it had been unable to reach Kashiben&rsquo;s position, but now, it was enough.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was a sudden roar in the sky. Wang Ze had long figured out what this was, but he hadn&rsquo;t thought that Su Mucheng would have such an outrageous technique.</p>
<p>After being hit by the Thunder Snipe, she instantly predicted Kashiben&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>And then right after being sniped, while her body still wasn&rsquo;t stable, she was able to immediately launch a Heat-Seeking Missile, and then because this missile wasn&rsquo;t able to fly a far enough distance, she accurately fired another shot to support and extend the range of this missile. There was another important point here: Dancing Rain normally used a hand cannon, which launched powerful cannon shots that were impossible to aim with such precision. This meant that after firing the missile, she must have switched Dancing Rain to use a gun&hellip;</p>
<p>How was Su Mucheng this strong?</p>
<p>As her former teammate, Wang Ze thought that he had studied Su Mucheng enough, but he had no idea that Su Mucheng&rsquo;s technique was even more terrifying than he imagined.</p>
<p>The howling Heat-Seeking Missile fell toward him. Although Wang Ze was already frantically controlling Kashisen to dodge, the shockwaves from the mushroom cloud created by the missile&rsquo;s impact had a wide range. Kashisen was unable to avoid the explosion and was sent flying against a wall.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The attacks of Launcher Dancing Rain came flying from the clock tower.</p>
<p>Occupy the high ground, capture the opponent&rsquo;s position, fire from an extremely long distance.</p>
<p>All of this was Su Mucheng&rsquo;s familiar rhythm, and it was a rhythm that Wang Ze had specifically studied, but now, he still fell into it.</p>
<p>Dodge!</p>
<p>Wang Ze desperately controlled his character, entering one of the Clock Tower&rsquo;s dead angles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no use!</p>
<p>Even though it was a dead angle, Su Mucheng used all sorts of methods to send her firepower there. The AoE skills of a Launcher allowed her to somewhat disregard the precision of her attacks, as long as they landed close enough, they could deal a lot of damage and restrict the target.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hide in a dead angle, I have to move and shake her off&hellip;</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t this the rhythm that every one of Su Mucheng&rsquo;s victims on this map would fall into?</p>
<p>Amidst the roaring cannonfire, Wang Ze hesitated.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>He had no plan.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t prepared for any events deviating from the script he had imagined. He had been completely caught off-guard by how Su Mucheng had instantly determined his position from his sneak attack.</p>
<p>For this match, Wang Ze&rsquo;s original plan was to use accurate sneak attacks to snipe Dancing Rain shot after shot. But now, after only one shot, his position was exposed. All he heard were cannon shots, all he saw was fire.</p>
<p>Where could he go?</p>
<p>Wang Ze originally thought he knew this map very well, but now it was all fuzzy in his mind, the various routes all tangling together, preventing him from finding the exit path among them.</p>
<p>But if he just let his character stand here, he could only watch his health bar steadily exploding away.</p>
<p>Wang Ze had Kashisen charge out, but should he continue to figure out a way to hide and dodge, or should he turn and fight directly? Wang Ze still wasn&rsquo;t certain, and he didn&rsquo;t have the time to reason things out. On this map, Su Mucheng&rsquo;s attack rhythm was extremely skilled. Whether Wang Ze ran or counterattacked, she had enough experience and technique to respond.</p>
<p>Ace card?</p>
<p>Did Su Mucheng not have one on this map?</p>
<p>And it was the exact same as Wang Ze&rsquo;s, the most simple: familiarity.</p>
<p>Familiar map, familiar attack rhythm.</p>
<p>Wang Ze&rsquo;s response didn&rsquo;t pose any difficulty for her at all. With all her skill at her fingertips, she bombarded him.</p>
<p>And Wang Ze seemed to have fallen into a battle for survival. He wasn&rsquo;t acting like he was trying to achieve victory, he was just trying to survive under the cannonfire.</p>
<p>The match had already lost its suspense from the moment Wang Ze revealed the position of Kashisen.</p>
<p>Individual competition round 2, Happy won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; Chen Guo energetically welcomed Su Mucheng as she came offstage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what the opponent thinking, picking one of your best and most familiar maps, how stupid.&rdquo; The fruits of victory were in hand, and Chen Guo wanted to make it known. As Su Mucheng&rsquo;s super fan, Chen Guo knew which maps she was good at, and she recognized Desolate Town 7. She&rsquo;d even tried to imitate Su Mucheng&rsquo;s playstyle on this map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not stupid, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m not stupid either,&rdquo; Su Mucheng laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, we won.&rdquo; Chen Guo was proud.</p>
<p>Wang Ze, coming offstage, was in extremely low spirits. He had prepared thoroughly for this match, he had been confident, but it ended up like this? His strategy was still only on the first step when it received a headache-inducing attack, and he had been attacked from there until the end, blasted upon the ground.</p>
<p>He Ming and Shen Jian knew the hard work Wang Ze had put into preparing for this match. Seeing his disappointment now, they too were upset. But this was competition. Everyone worked hard, but in the end, there was always one side that would fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was still too overconfident,&rdquo; Wang Ze said with a bitter smile. &ldquo;I thought I understood the opponent&rsquo;s strength, that I had a trump card that could get me victory. But I never thought that, under circumstances I don&rsquo;t understand, the opponent improved even further&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why Glory is limitless!&rdquo; The unfortunate trio lamented, in a heavy atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I&rsquo;m going up!&rdquo; Right then, Miracle&rsquo;s third individual player had already stood up, Miracle&rsquo;s Launcher, Guo Shao.</p>
<p>Yes, Guo Shao, a name that sounded arrogant. Before the arrival of these players from old Excellent Era, he had been the core player of this new team.</p>
<p>An arrogant name, a position as core player, but Guo Shao wasn&rsquo;t that kind of person.</p>
<p>When experienced players joined, he happily gave up his position as core and captain. Passionate, with energy and ideals, Guo Shao was a Glory youth that had longed to play in the professional scene. And now, he had finally raised his sails to set forth on this journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who my opponent is?&rdquo; Guo Shao lifted his head to look at the projection screen. He carried this kind of excitement for every match.</p>
<p>The screen quickly displayed the names for the third battle of the individual round.</p>
<p>Happy, Ye Xiu, Lord Grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; Guo Shao was even more excited.</p>
<p>He Ming and the others exchanged looks, smiling bitterly.</p>
<p>What an innocent youth, he really has no idea of the terror and cruelty of the pro scene!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; The three still said some encouraging words, but in their hearts they already had no hopes for this match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, seniors!&rdquo; Guo Shao gave the three of them a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go! You have to win!&rdquo; Against their true thoughts, the three cheered him on.</p>
<p>Guo Shao went onstage, and on the other end Ye Xiu was already ready.</p>
<p>Log on, enter map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is great, I actually have the chance to fight Senior Ye Xiu!&rdquo; As soon as the characters finished loading, Guo Shao couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer and began expressing his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do your best!&rdquo; Ye Xiu never refused to interact with anyone onstage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, senior!&rdquo; Guo Shao shouted.</p>
<p>Offstage, He Ming and the other two facepalmed. Why are you telling the opponent not to worry!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu sent a smiley face emoji, and Lord Grim rushed forward.</p>
<p>The map was Desolate Town 28. In a 1v1, there was some amount of cover, but not many twists and turns, which made it rather suitable for a Launcher. Guo Shao&rsquo;s map choice wasn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu didn&rsquo;t sidestep, he directly charged forth, and quickly saw that the opponent was doing the same.</p>
<p>Boom boom!!!</p>
<p>With the sounds of cannonfire, Guo Shao&rsquo;s Launcher Berk took the lead in attacking. Ye Xiu controlled Lord Grim to dodge, having no way to retaliate.</p>
<p>Guo Shao fired his attacks at the very limit of his attack range. Although Lord Grim could use a Launcher&rsquo;s low-level skills, that didn&rsquo;t mean he had the full long range of a Launcher.</p>
<p>The extremely long attack range of a Launcher was something they got only after switching classes. Their special skill learned when changing class at level 20, &ldquo;Artillery Mastery,&rdquo; increased the range of all of the attacks and skills of this class, as well as the area they could damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, Senior&rsquo;s class doesn&rsquo;t have the range of a Launcher!&rdquo; Guo Shao actually had the time to type a message, but Berk&rsquo;s attacks never stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to lock me outside of this range?&rdquo; Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen through so quickly by senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very obvious plan. But it&rsquo;s not that easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After sending the message, Lord Grim begin to charge forward.</p>
<p>Guo Shao immediately had Berk jump backwards while simultaneously covering a large area with his firepower, stopping Lord Grim from reaching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit!&rdquo; Lord Grim was covered by the large area of firepower, and Guo Shao was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m closer&hellip;&rdquo; Ye Xiu replied as Lord Grim ducked through the cannonfire. Although he suffered some damage, the distance between the two was pulled closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo; Guo Shao&rsquo;s Berk used Aerial Cannon to increase their distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run!&rdquo; Under Ye Xiu&rsquo;s controls, Lord Grim used a Slide Kick, dodging the cannon shots coming right at him, and once he got up, he used a Shining Cut. His character sprung forward amidst cold light, and then he followed with a Charge, forcing his way through the Stingers falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Three skills used in an instant, all attacks with high-speed movement. The distance between the two characters was instantly squeezed so that they were almost right next to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior is really tough!&rdquo; Guo Shao cried, his character changing direction to get away.</p>
<p>Lord Grim suddenly used another skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Against his controls, Berk started rushing toward Lord Grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can even use Taunt!&rdquo; Guo Shao shouted.</p>
<p>The Taunt status forced the target to charge toward and attack only the taunter. Although it couldn&rsquo;t interrupt an attack, it was a powerful move to disrupt the opponent&rsquo;s rhythm, especially during a team competition when coordination was required.</p>
<p>Right now neither side had a team, so there wasn&rsquo;t that effect, but Guo Shao&rsquo;s Berk in this bit of time had no way to leave with his free will.</p>
<p>Collapsing Mountain!</p>
<p>Lord Grim swung his blades down, Guo Shao saw that he had no way to retreat, so he simply aimed his cannon at Lord Grim.</p>
<p>The cannonball flew out, but Lord Grim&rsquo;s Collapsing Mountain suddenly changed to a Falling Light Blade, and he plunged downward.</p>
<p>After dodging the cannon shot, the Falling Light Blade landed right upon Berk. Guo Shao hurriedly tried to Quick Recover, as the Taunt status finally wore off, but Lord Grim was already right next to him.</p>
<p>Slide Kick!</p>
<p>Guo Shao&rsquo;s reaction was very fast, he actually had Berk use a Sharpshooter&rsquo;s skill Slide Click. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t hit Lord Grim, at least he could slide past and start pulling apart the distance again.</p>
<p>But he hadn&rsquo;t expected Lord Grim to step to the side. Before he started fully sliding, Lord Grim stomped down in place, and at that moment, Berk slide right there.</p>
<p>After Lord Grim stepped on his opponent, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella shifted forms and sent a flurry of shots to his face.</p>
<p>Sharpshooter skill: Punisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to lose!&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Chapter 1203: The Winery on Wuchuan Path</p>
<p>Ye Xiu&rsquo;s prediction was of course made with reason.</p>
<p>Out of the 24 classes, Launchers were ranked at the bottom in close combat ability. They were never absent in the voting for &ldquo;which class is weakest in close combat,&rdquo; and their votes were never low, at about the same rank as Summoners.</p>
<p>Now that he was being stepped on by Lord Grim, an unspecialized with an immense number of low level skills and an extremely fast rhythm, no one thought Ye Xiu&rsquo;s words were unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily!&rdquo; But Guo Shao didn&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>Once Punisher was over, Lord Grim had only just moved his foot away when Berk immediately rolled and stood. However, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella had already transformed into a spear, striking forth like a viper.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Yet, what everyone heard was the clash of metal on metal. This sound was most commonly heard when parrying.</p>
<p>And, for Launchers, there was only one move they could use in parrying, if nothing unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Swing!</p>
<p>Each of the 24 classes had a knockup skill, which could be learned from the beginning. What Launchers used was this hand cannon swinging skill, Swing. Using this skill, Guo Shao managed to parry Lord Grim&rsquo;s Dragon Tooth.</p>
<p>Berk had already jumped up, cannon shots flying, aimed downwards and propelling him backwards.</p>
<p>However, Lord Grim truly had too many low level skills. Even if the movement skills he had used before were all still in cooldown, he had other choices.</p>
<p>Berserker skill: Colliding Stab!</p>
<p>Lord Grim dashed forth with his sword. Berk, even with the help of Aerial Cannon, couldn&rsquo;t match up to the speed of this dashing stab. He was immediately impaled on the blade and a combo followed after.</p>
<p>The unspecialized&rsquo;s fast paced close combat capabilities wiped the floor with Zhang Jiale and crushed Sun Zheping. Now, the one facing this was a rookie, using a Launcher, who was weak in close combat.</p>
<p>There was no suspense to this anymore.</p>
<p>However&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is certain yet!&rdquo; The rookie Guo Shao still didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your spirit is admirable!&rdquo; Ye Xiu praised, &ldquo;If so, then I&rsquo;ll have to be more careful&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella changed forms rapidly, skill after skill pushed onto Berk. Guo Shao was trying to find an opening, but there was none to be found. Every possibility of escape had been completely sealed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrifying,&rdquo; he was still lamenting, his morale seeming to be completely unaffected, but at a time like this, his Berk had already fallen.</p>
<p>Guo Shao didn&rsquo;t give up, but he didn&rsquo;t find a single opportunity either&hellip;</p>
<p>Walking out of the competitor booths, Guo Shao looked at Ye Xiu on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior is so strong!&rdquo; Guo Shao called out loudly, giving a thumbs up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he crazy, praising his opponent like that?!&rdquo; He Ming and co were close to jumping up, nervously looking at the audience. As expected, the audience had exploded into commotion. As for Ye Xiu, he just waved and went off stage.</p>
<p>In the individual competition, Happy won with a flawless 3 to 0.</p>
<p>However, Guo Shao, who had just returned to the player bench, didn&rsquo;t seem at all affected by this gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all do our best!&rdquo; Despite just having lost, he was here encouraging his teammates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little!&rdquo; He Ming&rsquo;s face was dark. As the captain, he had to say something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you compliment your opponent like that? Aren&rsquo;t you boosting their morale? Ruining ours?&rdquo; He Ming scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he really is strong, so I didn&rsquo;t really think much of it,&rdquo; Guo Shao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Guo Shao&rsquo;s forthright reason made He Ming incapable of scolding him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t do it next time&hellip;&rdquo; he could only reply, deflating.</p>
<p>They lost all three rounds of the individual competition&hellip;</p>
<p>He Ming exchanged glances with his two old teammates. If everything had gone according to their original plan, then they would&rsquo;ve given the first match to Ye Xiu, Wang Ze would strike down Su Mucheng in the second match, and then the third match would be given to Guo Shao, who was rather skilled. If he did well, they might&rsquo;ve even ended things with a lead of 2 to 1, but now, reality seemed very far from their expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re counting on you for the group arena,&rdquo; Wang Ze said.</p>
<p>He Ming and Shen Jian were going to be a part of the group arena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come I feel that Happy doesn&rsquo;t seem affected by the magazine?&rdquo; Shen Jian gazed towards Happy&rsquo;s bench. Did they not look at those magazines after getting them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wei Chen, Su Mucheng and Ye Xiu are all experienced and mature players. Being able to adjust their emotions isn&rsquo;t unexpected from them,&rdquo; He Ming analyzed, feigning calm. &ldquo;In the group arena, Tang Rou will definitely come up. She&rsquo;ll be affected by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if she&rsquo;s not participating today?&rdquo; Shen Jian asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, then the other younger players would definitely be affected,&rdquo; He Ming said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also that Fang Rui,&rdquo; Shen Jian reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fang Rui isn&rsquo;t all that used to the Qi Master yet, so his strength will be reduced,&rdquo; He Ming assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Shen Jian nodded. In reality, they had gone over these things who knows how many times before the match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going first, Jia Xing will take the middle and you&rsquo;ll be our last line of defense,&rdquo; He Ming announced the lineup at the end. Jia Xing was Miracle&rsquo;s Battle Mage player, his character was called Prideful Sorcery.</p>
<p>The short break between the individual competition and group arena passed quickly. Under the signal given by the big screen, He Ming stood, bracing himself and walking towards the stage. On Happy&rsquo;s side, the first player to go up wasn&rsquo;t Tang Rou who used to always lead the charge, but Fang Rui.</p>
<p>After seeing Fang Rui, He Ming felt a little more pressure. The other was an All-Star level player, after all.</p>
<p>Relax, he&rsquo;s still getting used to the class switch. Focus yourself, don&rsquo;t get anxious, you have plenty of chances.</p>
<p>He Ming recited to himself in his heart as he walked onto the stage and into Miracle&rsquo;s Competition Booth. On the other side, Fang Rui also entered his booth. The projection began to display images of the map that would be used for this match.</p>
<p>Wuchuan Path, a small map with a Wuxia style, was a map that didn&rsquo;t have many obstacles for the three pro players of Miracle. That was usually how group arena maps were chosen.</p>
<p>The two characters soon spawned at the two ends of Wuchuan Path. In the center of the map, there was a winery with a large flagpole outside the door. A golden character meaning &ldquo;alcohol&rdquo; was stitched into the accompanying red flag, fluttering in the wind, very eye catching. The winery proved its worth of having such a flag, though. The winery had three large courtyards, pridefully taking up the center of the map. In terms of area, it made 90 percent of the map. Desolate muddy earth surrounds the winery, and when the winds blew, the sand and dust kicked up could turn the sky yellow.</p>
<p>With the winery in the center, the two characters would meet directly. The winery became a place that could be used to execute ambushes and sneak attacks. Knowing that his opponent was the Master of Dirty Play, Fang Rui, He Ming instantly felt like the winery was filled with danger. However, Miracle&rsquo;s three wouldn&rsquo;t be unfamiliar with a map they chose. And for this map, the focus of it was the structure of the winery. He Ming had his Elementalist, Rullo, approach the winery, but didn&rsquo;t charge inside. Though the two characters were the same distance apart from the winery, their movement speeds were different. If a Qi Master wanted to take this advantage, they could activate Qi Flowing Cloud and increase their speed, getting into the winery before an Elementalist.</p>
<p>Fang Rui would definitely use the terrain to his advantage. He Ming knew this with certainty. Thus, before he stepped into the winery, he stopped for moment and went over the entire structure of the winery clearly and completely. After making an organized judgement, He Ming&rsquo;s Elementalist, Rullo, walked into the winery from the side door.</p>
<p>Immediately inside was a massive courtyard with both square and long tables. The were cluttered with many small taverns. However, no NPCs would be in an arena map. A place that should&rsquo;ve been bustling was devoid of life, giving an eerie feel.</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t stay in the courtyard long, intending to have Rullo go further inside, when he suddenly heard a popping noise.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>He Ming&rsquo;s had very precise judgement, and he turned his view to the place the noise came from. All that was there was a wall, so the sound must&rsquo;ve come from behind that wall.</p>
<p>Was it an accident? Or a trap?</p>
<p>The gears in He Ming&rsquo;s head turned quickly. Rullo walked over, but didn&rsquo;t immediately go through to the other side, but stuck close to the wall.</p>
<p>This doorway led to a rather narrow corridor. Thinking of this terrain, He Ming had an idea.</p>
<p>Rullo flashed into the doorway, staff waving and then, with a point, an Ice Wall appeared in the corridor. Only then did He Ming have Rullo dart inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cautious!&rdquo; Fang Rui&rsquo;s taunt appeared in the channel. As expected, Fang Rui&rsquo;s Boundless Sea was inside the corridor. However, he had been trapped at the other end by the Ice Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is how it&rsquo;s going to be, you can&rsquo;t hit me either!&rdquo; Fang Rui sent a rofl emoji, as if He Ming&rsquo;s Ice Wall was a really stupid decision.</p>
<p>He Ming remained unruffled by the other&rsquo;s trash talk. He was glad he was so careful. If not, then he might&rsquo;ve already been ambushed by Fang Rui&rsquo;s Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If neither of us can hit the other, then I&rsquo;m leaving!&rdquo; Fang Rui said as Boundless Sea turned to leave.</p>
<p>How could He Ming let this dirty playing opponent go so easily after catching him? Ice Wall could block movement and attacks, but it couldn&rsquo;t block an Elementalist&rsquo;s control over the elements.</p>
<p>Rullo raised a hand and elemental power began to gather in the air, curling up from the ground, eventually gathering in Rullo&rsquo;s mind. Skill: Absolute Focus. After activation, it would turn the next skill into an instant cast.</p>
<p>After that, he pointed his staff and the level 70 Elementalist ultimate, Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire, was activated through the Ice Wall. Fang Rui, who was in the middle of his escape, realized something was wrong, and hurriedly had Boundless Sea roll backwards, taking a small amount of damage. When he looked again, the lightning and fire had completely blocked off his escape route. Charging through wasn&rsquo;t a good idea. Under the player&rsquo;s control, if a target tried to simply charge through Heavenly Thunder Earthen Lightning, then it wouldn&rsquo;t just be damage they&rsquo;d take, but they&rsquo;d also be rooted, so in the end they still couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shameless! Take this!&rdquo; Fang Rui sent as Boundless Sea turned and dashed forwards, his palm striking the Ice Wall.</p>
<p>If Ice Wall wasn&rsquo;t destroyed by an attack, then it would remain for quite a long time, even longer than Heaven Lightning Earthen Fire. However, Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t want Boundless Sea to stay here and admire the scenery, waiting for time to pass. If he were trapped in this small space and let He Ming chant a few more AoE spells, then he wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance at dodging.</p>
<p>Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t mind using this powerful skill to immediately shatter the Ice Wall.</p>
<p>Chapter 1204: Fang Rui, Figured Out</p>
<p>Pa pa pa pa!</p>
<p>Boundless Sea&rsquo;s Flash Burst smashed into the ice. Spider-web like cracks instantly spread, and in the next second, the ice wall shattered into tiny bits of ice.</p>
<p>But by this time, He Ming&rsquo;s Rullo had finished casting another spell.</p>
<p>Thunder Apocalypse!</p>
<p>Lightning crashed down from above, one bolt after the other. He Ming had calculated Fang Rui&rsquo;s options and positioned Thunder Apocalypse such that Boundless Sea was perfectly centered inside.</p>
<p>Dodge?</p>
<p>With the denseness and speed of the lightning bolts, dodging was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Reinforced Iron Bones?</p>
<p>It would increase his defences and give him Super Armor, but lightning bolts produced a short paralysis effect, completely different from the hit stun from physical attacks. Reinforced Iron Bone&rsquo;s Super Armor would not be enough to move freely inside Thunder Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Qi Guard!</p>
<p>Fang Rui chose to use this Qi Master defensive skill. Boundless Sea&rsquo;s two hands traced an arc from the top of his head to his sides, forming a defensive qi barrier.</p>
<p>However, with Thunder Apocalypse striking the shield, the Qi Guard wouldn&rsquo;t last long. It was unable to ward off the destructive might of Thunder Apocalypse. Moreover, this purely defensive position gave He Ming time to cast another spell.</p>
<p>Blizzard!</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough time to cast a powerful spell. He Ming had good judgement and cast a relatively fast spell, layering Blizzard on top of Thunder Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea&rsquo;s Qi Guard shattered in an instant.</p>
<p>Piercing Lightning!</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t hesitate and threw out an instant-cast. The distance between Rullo and Boundless Sea was extremely close. For an Elementalist with weak close combat abilities, it could be considered a very dangerous distance, but it was because of this short distance that Fang Rui could do nothing about this Piercing Lightning. Lightning element spells were the fastest spells.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning pierced through Boundless Sea. The knockback from magic attacks should not be looked down upon. Piercing Lightning pushed Boundless Sea back a step, and Thunder Apocalypse and Blizzard had yet to fade away. The elemental spell formation set down by He Ming was giving Fang Rui an extremely difficult time.</p>
<p>He Ming activated Mobile Cast. In the end, Elementalists needed to maintain a distance away from their opponents. Before the two DoT spells completely dissipated, Rullo retreated while casting his next spell.</p>
<p>And Boundless Sea? Paralyzed by Thunder Apocalypse and slowed by Blizzard, Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t have any good ways to escape from his predicament. However, he couldn&rsquo;t let He Ming continue casting spells. Forcefully eating the damage and seizing the gap between DoT ticks was one way.</p>
<p>Qi Blade!</p>
<p>He Ming hadn&rsquo;t expected Fang Rui to be able to find an opening to let out an attack while under the barrage of two DoT skills. Even though he had yet to fully switch classes, his ability to grasp openings showed why Fang Rui was an All-Star.</p>
<p>Having activated Mobile Cast and in the middle of a cast, Rullo&rsquo;s movement speed was very slow. Qi Blade was a rather difficult skill to dodge too, so He Ming immediately canceled his skill and cast a Teleport.</p>
<p>Rullo suddenly disappeared. However, Fang Rui&rsquo;s reaction speed was quick. As the master of playing dirty, his first thought was that the opponent was behind him.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea turned around. Sure enough, Rullo was behind his back and had thrown a Fireball at him.</p>
<p>At this point, Thunder Apocalypse had ended, but Blizzard still remained. Although Blizzard&rsquo;s damage could not be compared to Thunder Apocalypse, the slow effect was a headache. Boundless Sea&rsquo;s movements were slowed, and He Ming had boldly teleported to a short distance between them and attacked. No matter how fast Fang Rui reacted, with his character unable to respond, he had no way of dodging.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The Fireball struck Boundless Sea and exploded. Fire element spells dealt the most damage out of all four elements. Fireball was only a low-level skill, but its explosiveness couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p>Rullo wasn&rsquo;t close to being done yet. He Ming was extremely focused, carefully and attentively watching Boundless Sea&rsquo;s situation, planning every step of his offensive.</p>
<p>After Fireball was a Dark Missile.</p>
<p>It was a low-level dark element spell. Dark element spells were neither fast nor strong, but they had strange effects.</p>
<p>Dark Missile followed closely behind Fireball and stabbed into Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>The dark element wasn&rsquo;t Rullo&rsquo;s main element. This Dark Missile was only at level one, so its damage was limited. However, its effect still came into effect. After being struck by Dark Missile, Boundless Sea spun 180 degrees.</p>
<p>It was just a turn of the body, but in a high-level match, it was an exploitable detail.</p>
<p>Having your back turned to the opponent could be considered as a short Blind as you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to know the opponent&rsquo;s next action.</p>
<p>No matter how fast your turned, you would always be a half beat behind. Fang Rui was an experienced veteran though. He wouldn&rsquo;t make such a rookie mistake. It didn&rsquo;t matter what was going on behind him; he immediately had Boundless Sea roll forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this sort of experienced response wasn&rsquo;t outside of He Ming&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<p>Elemental Power!</p>
<p>During this tight window, He Ming had Rullo cast the lowest-leveled Elementalist skill.</p>
<p>It was the slowest of all 24 knock up skills because it required a cast time. However, of the 24 knock ups, it was one of two long-ranged knock ups. As long as it was cast and the target was within its range, there was no way of defending against it.</p>
<p>In exchange for the downside of needing to cast the spell, this Elementalist knock up was given a powerful upside. Boundless Sea was inside Elemental Power&rsquo;s range. As soon as he finished rolling, he was lifted into the air.</p>
<p>Raging Flames!</p>
<p>A pillar of fire erupted from beneath Boundless Sea, swallowing him whole. Rullo continued to wave his staff. From the light gathering on his staff, the next spell had to be a powerful one. Rays of light burst forth, radiating waves of red fire. The magic condensed onto the tip of the staff and then ignited fiercely. The flames danced and swayed, letting out the cry of a bird.</p>
<p>New Elementalist Level 75 skill: Fire Bird!</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A blazing fire bird flew towards Boundless Sea, who was falling down after being knocked high into the air by Raging Flames, and engulfed him.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea burned as he flew backwards and crashed into a wall behind him. His health fell at a visible rate. The Fireball left an imprint on the wall, slowly dissipating from the burning Boundless Sea. Fire element spells didn&rsquo;t have much else other than overwhelming damage.</p>
<p>This fight was truly surprising.</p>
<p>Even though Fang Rui had switched classes, he had a shining All-Star title on him. No one would dare to underestimate him. During this period of adjustment, his Qi Master had been doing quite well too. Even though there were comments about his problems here and there, Fang Rui&rsquo;s win rate during these past eight rounds was quite good.</p>
<p>And now it looked like his honeymoon period was over!</p>
<p>After eight rounds of observation, Happy&rsquo;s rookies had yet to crash into a wall, but Fang Rui had already been completely seen through. Fang Rui wasn&rsquo;t able to display his dirtiness this fight and after being caught by He Ming, he was being beaten senselessly. At this rate, He Ming would achieve a perfect win.</p>
<p>The applause from the crowd was thunderous. After losing three individual competition rounds, there was finally a show worth seeing.</p>
<p>I really am a useless dim sum!</p>
<p>Fang Rui was sullen. In the previous press conference, Ye Xiu had given him a snide remark calling him a useless dim sum. He knew that Ye Xiu was just joking, but starting from the previous round, Fang Rui knew that his rhythm had been completely seen through. In face of Wang Jiexi, he wasn&rsquo;t able to find even a chance of winning. And in this match, He Ming, who was clearly a level lower than Wang Jiexi, was completely crushing him too.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was the master of playing dirty, but just because he was dirty didn&rsquo;t mean he had no pride. Right now, he was feeling wounded. Switching classes could be a reasonable excuse, but he didn&rsquo;t want to lower his expectations for himself because of this excuse. If he lost his heart, he would only lose again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really have some skill&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After being roasted into a half-dead state by the Fire Bird, Boundless Sea had dropped to the bottom of the wall, but Fang Rui still typed these words in chat.</p>
<p>He Ming ignored them. After Fire Bird, Rullo drew an Ice Line, trapping Boundless Sea in the center. Afterwards, he calmly started casting a new spell. There was still some distance between his Elementalist and Fang Rui&rsquo;s Qi Master. Rullo was sitting comfortably outside Boundless Sea&rsquo;s attack range. If Ice Line wasn&rsquo;t triggered, it would last for 12 seconds. 12 seconds was more than enough time for any spell, so just obediently sit there in prison!</p>
<p>He Ming felt pleased with himself. His was very satisfied with his playing this fight. This is the way to victory, right?</p>
<p>Bright light gathered onto his staff again, clearly another large spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you addicted to high-level skills?&rdquo; Fang Rui chattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look at this move!&rdquo; Fang Rui sent a shouting emoji.</p>
<p>What move? He Ming&rsquo;s mind rapidly turned. He was at a completely safe distance. No Qi Master skill could reach him. Qi Masters had no such skill, nor did any of Fighter classes. He Ming had very carefully considered everything beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;QIGONG BLAST!!!&rdquo; Fang Rui shouted the skill he used for morale support. Boundless Sea flipped over his palm and placed it on the wall behind him.</p>
<p>The imprint burned onto the wall by the Fire Bird crumbled. With a boom, an ugly dog hole was split open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fang Rui shouted in the chat as he had Boundless Sea run through the dog hole.</p>
<p>Chapter 1205: The Labor Pains of Class Transition</p>
<p>Translator: Nomyummi Editor: Nomyummi He Ming was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>Rullo&rsquo;s fearless chanting of powerful spells instantly became purposeless. That ugly doghole seemed to split the entire world into two.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea had vanished. That doghole didn&rsquo;t seem that big, yet he had very precisely darted right through. Fang Rui&rsquo;s mechanics were extremely precise, but how he got so good at worming through holes was a mystery. He Ming didn&rsquo;t know of any training with this sort of content, and he believed that Wind Howl wouldn&rsquo;t have something like that either.</p>
<p>His wonderful lead, broken, by this doghole? He Ming couldn&rsquo;t accept that. He immediately cancelled the high-level skill he was casting and hastily adjusted his character&rsquo;s position. Though the hole wasn&rsquo;t big, an Elementalist could utilize their elemental power so long as they could see.</p>
<p>But when he got there and looked at that hole&hellip;</p>
<p>Complete darkness. He couldn&rsquo;t see anything on the other side.</p>
<p>He Ming&rsquo;s face clouded over. That bastard had blocked the hole? What sort of technique was this! That was way too low, wasn&rsquo;t it!?</p>
<p>The structure of the map quickly flashed through He Ming&rsquo;s mind, and he immediately brought up what the terrain was on the other side in his mind. If he went around through this corridor, then that would be too far. He&rsquo;d have no idea where Fang Rui would stash his Boundless Sea by the time he got there. The fastest way was still to retrace his steps out of the corridor and climb over the wall!</p>
<p>He Ming immediately came to a decision. Rullo hastily retreated backwards. Just looking at the hole made him irritated. Swiftly, Rullo&rsquo;s staff raised and he chanted a Fireball.</p>
<p>Boom&hellip;.</p>
<p>The Fireball accurately flew through the doghole, sending waves of fire inside and smashing against whatever was blocking it.</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t want to waste time here. He had randomly flung a skill just to vent a little before Rullo hastily dashed away. But suddenly, his character seemed to slip from his control and was flung towards the doghole.</p>
<p>Cloud Grasping Fist!</p>
<p>He Ming immediately realized what it was, but apart from seething about this dirty play, he couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Rullo was flung horizontally towards the doghole, but naturally wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly right through. In the end, he crashed against the entrance, his health even slipping a little.</p>
<p>Pulse Break: Break Intelligence.</p>
<p>Flash Burst!</p>
<p>Boundless Sea&rsquo;s hand came through the hole and these two skills were consecutively blasted onto Rullo. With this Qi attack, even the walls were shaking. Then, both of Boundless Sea&rsquo;s hands came through, grabbing onto Rullo. With a yank, the parts of the wall around the doghole shifted out, almost to the point of shattering. The enlarged doghole was enough for Rullo to get through, and he was immediately thrown to the ground by a Back Throw from Boundless Sea.</p>
<p>The crowd was dumbstruck. The big screen wasn&rsquo;t even sure which shot to show this from, so it just ended up replaying this moment from several different angles at once.</p>
<p>Rullo, having clambered to his feet, had already been completely closed in on by Boundless Sea. Teleport was still on cooldown, so he couldn&rsquo;t pull away. Qi Master&rsquo;s had the weakest close combat ability out of the four Fighter classes, but it was better than Elementalists. Now, Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t bother with any tricks and had Boundless Sea teach Rullo a lesson with his fists.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly with his fists. Qi Master skills were primarily palm strikes and jabs, very rarely punches. When they connected, it seemed light, without much strength, but they played with the inside of the body. Those light strikes injected internal energy, and the damage it dealt wasn&rsquo;t second to any physical punch.</p>
<p>With the slaps and hits, He Ming&rsquo;s Rullo didn&rsquo;t look like he was losing in a very ugly way. On the contrary, all the dust that had gotten on him when he was thrown to the ground had been struck clean. At the same time, his health bar was also being cleaned.</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t want to be slapped to death by Boundless Sea like this. Fang Rui&rsquo;s Qi Master was still riddled with holes because he wasn&rsquo;t familiar enough with his class, and he was hindered by the habits he had spent years cultivating as a Thief player. Now, when he was attacking, he&rsquo;d show a lot of openings when comboing. This was no secret. It even appeared in the news!</p>
<p>And what He Ming had to do was to not miss the opportunity when it came!</p>
<p>Rullo swung his staff. Even Elementalists could swing their staffs for normal attacks. He Ming fought back as much as he could. He couldn&rsquo;t just stand there against Fang Rui&rsquo;s palm strikes like a sitting duck!</p>
<p>His efforts weren&rsquo;t for nothing. When the dust on his robes had mostly been slapped clean, Boundless Sea finally stumbled.</p>
<p>Piercing Lightning!</p>
<p>This instant cast spell blasted forth. At such a close distance, Fang Rui wouldn&rsquo;t have time to dodge no matter how quickly he reacted. Boundless Sea, struck by Piercing Lightning, went numb.</p>
<p>In that short time, Rullo once again activated Absolute Focus and then followed up with a cast-free level 75 ice element ultimate: Absolute Zero.</p>
<p>They were simply too close. Although Piercing Lightning&rsquo;s short paralysis had passed, Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t have the time to escape Absolute Zero&rsquo;s range. Instantly, Boundless Sea became an ice statue. One of his legs was still in midair, suspended in his fleeing position.</p>
<p>He Ming let out a breath of relief.</p>
<p>Absolute Zero had the longest freezing time out of all ice element skills of the 24 classes. When maxed out, it would freeze for up to 8 seconds.</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t rush, having Rullo pull away. In 8 seconds, he didn&rsquo;t rush to attack, because attacks would reduce the freeze time of Absolute Zero. In a one on one, it was best to use these 8 seconds to prepare to launch an offense.</p>
<p>Fang Rui&rsquo;s Boundless Sea maintained that rather silly pose, forced to watch as He Ming&rsquo;s Rullo escaped to a position and distance suited for an Elementalist&rsquo;s attacks.</p>
<p>Fang Rui was helpless.</p>
<p>Like a rookie that met the Rookie Block, he had met the labor pains of transitioning between classes. He had met it last round and hit it this round too. Even after using his masterful dirty play to save himself from the torrent of attacks and complete a counterattack, he still revealed an opening that the opponent was able to grasp.</p>
<p>He had been too greedy&hellip;</p>
<p>Fang Rui criticized himself. With how well he was settling in, it was better for him to just use simple and fast methods to stall his opponents and chip away at them, like with Zhou Guangyi. The problem was that such simple methods would be easily seen through by pro players. Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t have an infinite amount of tricks like that to use. The current him was at his wit&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>Fuck, if only I were still a Thief&hellip;</p>
<p>No, he had already come this far, how could he still have thought like that? Having these thoughts meant that his determination and will weren&rsquo;t enough! Now that he had switched classes, he had to completely become a Qi Master. The tricks he had as a Thief couldn&rsquo;t be employed anymore.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be employed?</p>
<p>After confirming this to himself, he suddenly had a doubt.</p>
<p>Could they really not be employed anymore?</p>
<p>A second doubt rose from his heart.</p>
<p>What a joke. Thief and Qi Master, two completely different classes that had no similarities whatsoever.</p>
<p>The classes might not have similarities, but&hellip; what about the thought process? Could the Thief&rsquo;s playstyle and strategies not be used by a Qi Master at all?</p>
<p>Imagine if he were a Thief, who had acquired the skills of a Qi Master.</p>
<p>Thinking from this angle, Fang Rui&rsquo;s eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>What if he were still a Thief, but had a bunch of Qi Master skills?</p>
<p>These thoughts boiled in his head, a movement of ideas that not even Absolute Zero could freeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo; He Ming, advantage back in his hands, typed in the chat. It felt pretty good to have this sort of advantage against an All-Star level player. He took note of Absolute Zero&rsquo;s timing and, without wasting any time at all, a rather long chant was finished and a skill flew out!</p>
<p>Fire Storm!</p>
<p>Elementalists had ice, fire, light and dark element spells, but because they only had a limited number of skill points, they couldn&rsquo;t learn all the skills of all the elements. Usually they would choose two elements to focus on and spent their leftover points on some helpful skills from the other two elements.</p>
<p>He Ming&rsquo;s Elementalist focused on light and fire. The fastest light and the fiercest fire. Fire and light could be called the most offense oriented combination for Elementalists. Rullo&rsquo;s equipment naturally would would prioritize buffing light and fire. As for Ice and Darkness, He Ming mostly used them for their effects.</p>
<p>Now that Boundless Sea had been frozen by Absolute Zero, he was about to receive the fiercest attack.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that the strongest of hs skills, Fire Bird, was still on cooldown. He Ming didn&rsquo;t have many options.</p>
<p>The Fire Storm whirled in and Boundless Sea quickly got out of Absolute Zero&rsquo;s effect, but at the same time, Lightning Hell fell from the skies.</p>
<p>For a fire and light Elementalist like Rullo, how could he lack the level 75 spell, Lightning Hell?</p>
<p>And this ultimate of light element spells had inherited the most distinct characteristic of its element: a quick attack with a short chant.</p>
<p>Lightning Hell had to be chanted, but the chant went by like a weak, low level spell.</p>
<p>The time it took for Fire Storm to devour the effects of Absolute Zero was enough to finish Lightning Hell&rsquo;s chant. A bolt of lightning fell just as Absolute Zero faded. Boundless Sea had no way of dodging.</p>
<p>One bolt, two bolts, three bolts, four bolts&hellip;</p>
<p>A full six bolts of lightning struck. The lightning bolts actually didn&rsquo;t strike soon after one another, but, for Lightning Hell, so long as one struck, the target would be locked on, and the rest would be directed towards the target by the system.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea, after taking the first strike, had then taken all five other strikes.</p>
<p>After two ultimates, Boundless Sea had once again taken heavy damage. The damage from the attacks he sent at Rullo, almost like he was patting the dust from him, was easily returned full force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing Boundless Sea darting through after escaping from Lightning Hell, Rullo pointed his staff and a Fireball sped out.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea practically lunged forwards to dodge the Fireball, then coming to a roll, jump, crouch, then roll. Boundless Sea rapidly moved forth using this weird method.</p>
<p>He Ming was stunned.</p>
<p>This was quite an unusual way of movement, but you couldn&rsquo;t call it weird. This was actually rather common.</p>
<p>Thieves liked to move in this way. Since traps were the main skills of Thieves, they had to crouch to set the traps, so the character would use crouching movements and maintain low set movements like rolling. Staying close to the ground allowed Thieves to maintain the form they needed to set traps. It was both convenient and discrete.</p>
<p>But this set of movements for these skills had appeared on a Qi Master?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahahaha, are you going crazy from longing for your Thief?&rdquo; He Ming sent a rofl emoji, yet that was when he suddenly realized that something was pulsing in the air.</p>
<p>Qi Blade!</p>
<p>Chapter 1206: The Thieving Qi Master</p>
<p>Translator: Nomyummi Editor: Nomyummi Qi Blade!</p>
<p>One could easily imagine how blurry a cluster of qi without light effects could be when it streaked across the air. One needed to observe the character&rsquo;s movements to predict and dodge this skill, otherwise, it would be difficult to get a grasp of the distance.</p>
<p>However, He Ming failed to notice Boundless Sea&rsquo;s Qi Blade movement, so the cluster of qi arrived before Rullo&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late to dodge!</p>
<p>Rullo was struck by this silent Qi Blade and stumbled. Most of the crowd wasn&rsquo;t observant enough to discover the Qi Blade and thought Rullo&rsquo;s shiver was some kind of starting action to cast a spell.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea, still rolling on the ground, leapt up into the air almost around the same time as the attack hit. By the time he pushed both of his palms forward, a portion of the gathered qi had already shot out.</p>
<p>Sky Piercing Strike!</p>
<p>The powerful qi attack billowed the dust on the ground and blasted right into Rullo&rsquo;s head. It wasn&rsquo;t as if He Ming didn&rsquo;t react. He had tried to dodge it, but he was too late. He thought the distance between him and Boundless Sea had been pretty safe, and he felt confident in handling any Qi Master attacks with ease. However, he soon realized his mistake when the Qi Blade was right in front of his face. Even a powerful skill like the Sky Piercing Strike was covering another attack?</p>
<p>What sort of fighting style was this? Was it related to the movement style he used as a Thief?</p>
<p>He Ming was an experienced pro player; even though he didn&rsquo;t have a complete understanding of what Fang Rui was doing, he was able to find the key idea. All of this rooted from the movement style of a Thief.</p>
<p>This particular movement method not only allowed the Thief to plant their traps quicker, but also to conceal them better. Otherwise, any idiot would be able to figure out that a Thief was planting a trap when they suddenly bobbed down from running to dig up a hole. What use was a trap if its location was known?</p>
<p>Fang Rui&rsquo;s Boundless Sea was using this exact same movement method. Even though he had no traps to plant, he achieved the effect that Thieves wanted: his attack was like a trap; it would stay hidden until it suddenly popped up.</p>
<p>This was Fang Rui&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>The former Number One Thief, Fang Rui, had impeccable control over this sort of rhythm.</p>
<p>He was now applying this to the Qi Master. Despite having only used two skills, he felt that they were effortless.</p>
<p>Stupid! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this earlier?</p>
<p>Among all the long ranged attacks, were there any attacks that were as easy to conceal as the Qi Master&rsquo;s qi attacks? They had no sound and the visual effects weren&rsquo;t flashy. This was just like a moving trap. The Qi Master was truly dirty! Such secretive methods were too satisfying!</p>
<p>After being enlightened and changing his perspective, Fang Rui interpreted the honorable and righteous Qi Master class in this dirty way. No Qi Master through the course of Glory had interpreted their class in such a way.</p>
<p>After the Sky Piercing Strike, Boundless Sea followed it up with a leap backwards. However, this leap was towards Rullo&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; Rullo nearly flipped over from the blast of Sky Piercing Strike. After he finally straightened up again with difficulty, He Ming saw Boundless Sea jump backwards towards him. Is that his back?</p>
<p>Whenever Boundless Sea landed, he squatted, and it seemed like Boundless Sea&rsquo;s hand was hitting the ground?</p>
<p>Shit!</p>
<p>His camera shook. Although He Ming didn&rsquo;t do anything, Rullo was tossed into the air.</p>
<p>Seismic Throw! Fang Rui had hid it with his back, why was he so dirty!</p>
<p>The target within Seismic Throw&rsquo;s range wouldn&rsquo;t simply bounce around like one would in a trampoline. Qi was involved in this quake, so all the targets within range would be overturned.</p>
<p>When Rullo fell, He Ming immediately performed a Quick Recover. After landing on the ground, Boundless Sea rolled. As he turned around and got up, he pushed both of his hands out. The Qi Drill rushed towards Rullo, who was still getting up.</p>
<p>I can only Teleport!</p>
<p>He Ming&rsquo;s mind was clear and knew that only this skill could help him avoid this attack. He immediately cast it, but he was still too slow. The spiralling qi drilled through Rullo, whose body spun with it. With a boom, he was pinned to the wall behind him. Fang Rui finally took revenge for the Fire Bird that had blasted him against the wall.</p>
<p>This guy!</p>
<p>He Ming was getting a little nervous. Fang Rui&rsquo;s fighting style suddenly changed from the style that he had observed for the previous eight rounds. It was rather common to take the advantage to attack while transitioning between rolls and jumps. However, no one was as thorough as Fang Rui when it came to using all of these postures just to hide his attacks.</p>
<p>When he finally noticed the Qi Blade, it was already in front of him.</p>
<p>When he noticed the Sky Piercing Strike, a portion of the qi had already come out.</p>
<p>When Fang Rui launched Seismic Throw, Fang Rui&rsquo;s back was facing him to conceal his attack.</p>
<p>As for Qi Drill, the concealing jumps for the Seismic Throw also became a method to close up the distance for this skill. Furthermore, he could complete the inputs for the skill while rolling, so he could launch it when he got up. Even if the Elementalist had Teleport, he couldn&rsquo;t use it because he couldn&rsquo;t make his move in time.</p>
<p>How were these attacks of a Qi Master? These were literally traps a Thief would set down one after another for the opponent. The only difference was that the traps weren&rsquo;t waiting for the opponent to trigger it because the current &ldquo;traps&rdquo; were more proactive.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea was moving around once again. Those rolls and jumps of a Thief made him seem like a hound as he leapt towards Rullo.</p>
<p>Ice Walls!</p>
<p>He Ming immediately controlled Rullo, who just fell from the wall, to launch this skill among the remaining skills he had left with the ice element. He needed this to block the opponent because he&hellip; needed time to think!</p>
<p>He Ming had never seen this Qi Master&rsquo;s fighting style before, so he couldn&rsquo;t interpret and counter it immediately. He needed more time to observe and analyze Fang Rui&rsquo;s attacking methods.</p>
<p>The Ice Walls cut off Boundless Sea, who couldn&rsquo;t attack Rullo directly. Take a detour? Then this would only turn into a childish game where two people surrounded a table and ran in circles.</p>
<p>Last time, the person who was in panic was him, but this time, it was the opponent, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t panic, I still have the advantage.</p>
<p>He Ming looked at both of the characters&rsquo; health and recovered his confidence. In terms of health, he still had the advantage.</p>
<p>But what should I do next?</p>
<p>Boundless Sea was nearly done smashing his Ice Walls into pieces, but He Ming didn&rsquo;t have his character do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run.&rdquo; Fang Rui sent a smirking emoji. The Ice Wall shattered at this instant, but Rullo also happened to have disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I predicted this much!&rdquo; Boundless Sea continued to jump backwards. His back became the defense to concentrate his Qi once again. However, without waiting for him to turn around, a bolt of lightning shot through his back.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea, who was still jumping backwards, froze in midair and fell.</p>
<p>The audiences were stupefied.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, they didn&rsquo;t really understand what was going on this fight.</p>
<p>That was because normal players who watched from the bird&rsquo;s eye view without enough skills weren&rsquo;t able to experience what sort of effect Fang Rui&rsquo;s changed style had made. For them, He Ming should be able to dodge all of these attacks, but he was still hit.</p>
<p>This was like Vanishing Step, dead angle strategy, or false combos. Only players who were placed in the situation would know the difficulties that they were facing.</p>
<p>He Ming was like this right now.</p>
<p>However, this was soon followed by raising the Ice Walls, Boundless Sea charging ahead, and Rullo moving with Teleport. Boundless Sea then held up his back and sent himself towards Rullo&rsquo;s direction without bothering to look back.</p>
<p>Was he looking for death?</p>
<p>Everyone thought in such manner.</p>
<p>Boundless Sea was indeed struck down by Rullo&rsquo;s spells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigh, it seems that I&rsquo;ve committed a lowly mistake&hellip;&rdquo; Fang Rui turned around. He was so deeply absorbed in figuring out ways he could secretively launch his attacks that he forgot that since he was sneaking around, he needed to ensure that he wasn&rsquo;t attacked by the opponent.</p>
<p>His backward jumps this time was too careless and predictable.</p>
<p>The audience thought Fang Rui was seeking death, but at that instant, He Ming was very nervous. Although he had Rullo immediately launch a Piercing Lightning, he truly feared that Boundless Sea had been hiding another skill, so before Piercing Lightning was released, that skill would have struck him first.</p>
<p>However, that didn&rsquo;t happen!</p>
<p>The Piercing Lightning shot Boundless Sea down, and He Ming&rsquo;s heart was at peace. He started to make use of this opportunity at once. Spells were set up on a grand scale, and Boundless Sea was stuck in it once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he watched Boundless Sea&rsquo;s decreasing health, He Ming felt some sort of urge he never had before. It was as if he would lose if he failed to finish off his opponent in this wave of attacks. Even if his character&rsquo;s health was still that much ahead, but the thick sense of danger still enveloped around him tightly.</p>
<p>Glory!</p>
<p>The two large letters finally popped up onto the screen. He Ming felt as if he was released from great burden. No matter what happened, he still managed to take this round with a decent outcome. Rullo still had over half of his health.</p>
<p>Fang Rui, who lost, left the stage, but he wasn&rsquo;t dispirited. Although he lost, he saw a miraculous future ahead. If this weren&rsquo;t a formal match, he would definitely continue to shamelessly squat at the computer for another round with the opponent. He wanted to quickly confirm whether this future was possible.</p>
<p>After seeing Fang Rui&rsquo;s face flushed with pride, his teammates saved their thoughts of comforting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that you&rsquo;ve discovered something?&rdquo; Ye Xiu asked. The others weren&rsquo;t surprised at Fang Rui&rsquo;s attitude despite his loss since they had listened to Ye Xiu&rsquo;s interpretation of Fang Rui&rsquo;s sudden adjustment in middle of the match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, do you think it has any future?&rdquo; Fang Rui humbly consulted him. The person before him was the master of all classes. He was proficient in both the Qi Master ad Thief, so he should be able to give out pertinent suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems pretty good, you just have to avoid those sort of disgusting mistakes,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only an accident.&rdquo; Fang Rui took that matter as an exception. At the time, he was so deeply enthralled by his new discovery that he allowed such a careless mistake to occur. Such mistakes wouldn&rsquo;t occur again, so after receiving Ye Xiu&rsquo;s approval, Fang Rui became even more excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really want to investigate it now, who&rsquo;s the next one? Quickly finish the match! I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo; Fang Rui yelled.</p>
<p>Mo Fan stood up, but didn&rsquo;t show any show any reaction towards Fang Rui&rsquo;s shouts. He only walked quietly towards the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk faster!&rdquo; Fang Rui yelled at his back.</p>
<p>Mo Fan&rsquo;s figure distinctly froze, but then, in a very awkward manner, he actually started to walk faster&hellip;</p>
<p>Chapter 1207: Charging Ninja</p>
<p>He Ming, having defeated Fang Rui, let out a breath of relief. It wasn&rsquo;t just relief for this matchup, but the overall situation of the group arena.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Fang Rui, the three All-Star level players had all come up already. That meant that the rest of the group arena only consisted of the rookies they had picked up.</p>
<p>He Ming wasn&rsquo;t underestimating these rookies, but he definitely doubted that they would be harder to deal with than those three All-Stars. He had sent off Fang Rui with quite the lead. With only two rookies left for Happy, Miracle was already on their way to victory, right?</p>
<p>Just as he was basking in his triumph, the opponent&rsquo;s character had appeared on screen.</p>
<p>Deception&hellip; that Ninja that got a red card?</p>
<p>This was the deepest impression Mo Fan had left on people after eight rounds. Apart from that, he hadn&rsquo;t won a single match, so, naturally, people wouldn&rsquo;t pay that much attention to him.</p>
<p>As for He Ming, he had met Deception quite long ago. In the online game, when they were fighting Ye Xiu, Deception had been one of Ye Xiu&rsquo;s helpers.</p>
<p>Yes, helper, that&rsquo;s what He Ming thought. He didn&rsquo;t know all the specifics of what had happened between Deception and Happy.</p>
<p>He remembered this guy. He Ming&rsquo;s impression of Deception stopped there though.</p>
<p>Apart from that, he knew that getting a red card meant he didn&rsquo;t understand the rules of pro matches. Glory wasn&rsquo;t football or basketball. It was very, very rare that someone would manage to violate the rules, never mind get a red card. He had yet to win a match too, so he wasn&rsquo;t all that strong.</p>
<p>A helper of Ye Xiu&rsquo;s who didn&rsquo;t know the rules very well and was average in strength.</p>
<p>That was He Ming&rsquo;s full understanding of Mo Fan, and in this week of preparations, Mo Fan wasn&rsquo;t their main focus. If he had to be categorized into important and unimportant, then he&rsquo;d be thrown to the unimportant side.</p>
<p>Now, this unimportant guy was coming onstage.</p>
<p>He Ming readied himself with his spirits high. From a basic overview, he could tell that Mo Fan was a very patient player, who often relied on ambushes.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; That&rsquo;s Happy for you.</p>
<p>He Ming couldn&rsquo;t help but think.</p>
<p>The match soon began. The map was still Wuchuan Path. There was no point in comparing his speed to a Ninja&rsquo;s, it would definitely be Deception who got there first. This time, He Ming decided not to bother rushing. His Rullo walked over slowly. Wasn&rsquo;t his opponent a very patient player? Then let him wait some more! He Ming was very relaxed.</p>
<p>But soon enough, when he still had some distance to go from the winery in the center of Wuchuan Path, He Ming saw Deception.</p>
<p>What on earth?</p>
<p>He Ming was surprised for a moment. Shouldn&rsquo;t this person have stashed himself in a corner of the winery to observe in silence and wait for a chance to ambush? That&rsquo;s what he had always done before, so how come he&rsquo;s changed his strategy today?</p>
<p>So what if he did?</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t look too much into it. Mo Fan truly wasn&rsquo;t a name that could make him feel pressured.</p>
<p>Deception charged and Rullo met him.</p>
<p>Electric Ring.</p>
<p>He Ming first had Rullo put this skill on himself. Ninjas were very likely to close in with a skill like Shadow Clone. The presence of this skill was often worrying. Afterwards, Rullo fired off a Fireball. Starting with low level skills was practically a universal traditional starting strategy.</p>
<p>Deception quickly changed directions, dodging the Fireball, and his hands then began rapidly moving in front of his chest, forming hand seals. He Ming was stunned for a moment and couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the last match. A Ninja&rsquo;s hand seals were a very exposed way of activating skills because every Ninja skill was triggered through a different set of hand seals. One could figure out the skill through looking at the hand seals. However, since the speed of the hand seals was directly related to mechanical skill and hand speed, if a player was fast enough, then the hand seals would be nothing more than a blur. It&rsquo;d be impossible to tell if they had bent one finger or two and therefore impossible to accurately determine the skill. They could only guess from there.</p>
<p>With a pro player&rsquo;s hand speed, they could all reach that standard. Mo Fan&rsquo;s mechanics were pretty good too. His hands blurred, leaving a few afterimages, then the seals were completed. Instantly, over ten copies of Deception appeared.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Shadow Dance.</p>
<p>His first move was a level 70 skill. If this were the All-Star level player Li Hua, He Ming would feel surprised, but this player was just a rookie who not only failed to earn a single victory in the past eight rounds, he also didn&rsquo;t even know the rules clearly. To He Ming, there was only one way to describe this: childish.</p>
<p>A bunch of shadow clones charged at Rullo. He Ming didn&rsquo;t give ground, and elemental power immediately gathered in Rullo&rsquo;s mind with an Absolute Focus, before instantly casting the level 70 high-level skill: Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire.</p>
<p>The bunch of Deceptions were immediately enveloped in an array of lightning and fire. He Ming let go and went wild, directly having Rullo use a high-level skill to neutralize Deception&rsquo;s high-level skill.</p>
<p>The shadow clones were destroyed one by one under Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire, disappearing into smoke.</p>
<p>Five, four, three&hellip;</p>
<p>He Ming silently counted. Shadow Dance wasn&rsquo;t like Shadow Steps with real and fake forms. It could be said that they were all real forms. When the skill ended or when the shadow clones were killed one by one, the last one left would be the Ninja&rsquo;s real body.</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>He Ming locked onto the last Deception and stopped controlling the Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire. He was preparing to follow up with some new skills, throwing forth a new wave of attacks. Who would have expected that before Rullo even finished casting, the last Deception would be killed just like that too.</p>
<p>How!</p>
<p>He Ming was really shocked this time. If this one was killed too, then that meant there were still clones present. Where were they? Why didn&rsquo;t he see them?</p>
<p>Rullo whirled around, turning his head. After looking at his surroundings, he didn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>He Ming then realized something, but, too late&hellip;</p>
<p>Underground Tunneling Technique!</p>
<p>Deception shot right out of the ground, his ninjato striking Rullo&rsquo;s chin, yet very unrealistically it did not cut his face off, but threw him into the air.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Bird Fall!</p>
<p>Deception curled up in midair, darting higher. When he stretched out his legs again, he directly kicked off of Rullo&rsquo;s shoulders. After using the jump, he then executed a Neck Bind. The rope attached to the hilt of the ninjato had already wrapped itself around Rullo&rsquo;s neck. Deception landed lightly, his arms crossed in front of his chest, binding Rullo behind him and dragging him to the ground.</p>
<p>He Ming, who hadn&rsquo;t thought much of Deception, panicked. These three skills, like a falcon swooping on a rising hare, didn&rsquo;t leave any openings whatsoever. In the previous second he was being ambushed and in the next, he had been bound and thrown to the ground. His character hadn&rsquo;t been killed yet, but the abruptness of the Ninja&rsquo;s assassin-like skills made He Ming&rsquo;s heart leap into his throat.</p>
<p>After falling to the ground, he turned his head and saw Deception rapidly forming hand seals. He didn&rsquo;t have the time to look closely, hurriedly having Rullo roll sideways to a stand. Several streams of water shot out, a Hundred Streams just missing He Ming.</p>
<p>He Ming was just starting to feel relieved when Deception struck with a Flame Cut, ninjato ablaze.</p>
<p>Jump back, back, back!</p>
<p>A skill like Teleportation required too many inputs, so He Ming could only jump backwards. The Flame Cut swept down, almost striking. Rullo jumped thrice before finally stopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How excessive,&rdquo; Ye Xiu exclaimed from the sidelines. To dodge that skill, one jump was enough. He Ming had panicked and made unnecessary actions. The extra two jumps didn&rsquo;t do anything to get him to a safer distance. On the contrary, because of the excessive nature of these actions, he was unable to dodge the next attack.</p>
<p>By the time the extra two jumps were over, Deception&rsquo;s Storm Shuriken had already arrived in front of him. No matter how fast he jumped, he couldn&rsquo;t beat the speed of a skill.</p>
<p>It was too late for He Ming to take back those two jumps. Rullo was sent flying by the Storm Shuriken. Deception charged forwards in pursuit, and threw another Shuriken before using Shadow Clone technique, sending his real body right next to Rullo. Then came a Cicada Shell Double Slash, the force of the two karate chops successively struck Rullo. Rullo hadn&rsquo;t even flown the full distance he was meant to when he got struck down by Deception halfway.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>He Ming was rather confused. Against Fang Rui, he had met a style Fang Rui had never used; against Mo Fan, he also met a fury that had never been displayed by this player in the past eight rounds. Wasn&rsquo;t this person meant to be a player who played dirty, hiding in the shadows, waiting for a chance to strike? How come he had become so fierce when it came to him?</p>
<p>Rullo was once again knocked flat on his back. He hurriedly rolled to a stand, but Deception&rsquo;s attack came once again.</p>
<p>Teleport!</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t think too much, getting his character to pull away first. However, Teleportation didn&rsquo;t actually take the user very far. Just as Rullo landed, he turned to look and saw Deception&rsquo;s hand seals forming constantly, taking one step out and somehow managing to immediately close their distance.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Ground Shrinking Technique!</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Moon-Slaying Sakura!</p>
<p>With one step forward, before even entering attack range, Deception activated the Level 75 high-level skill Moon-Slaying Sakura. Deception&rsquo;s ninjato transformed into broken cherry blossoms, swirling forth. He Ming didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Run? Not possible. Dodge? He had just used his dodge skill.</p>
<p>Ice Wall!</p>
<p>Seeing that the other still had some distance to go, He Ming hurriedly summoned a wall of ice in front of himself. Deception had already arrived by then, and the thin petals imbedded themselves into the wall. Instantly, a crack could be heard, and a hole was made in the Ice Wall.</p>
<p>Though it was just a hole, the Ice Wall counted as having been broken through by the system. Deception didn&rsquo;t avoid it, directly charging forward and shattering the rest of the Ice Wall. His ninjato had stabbed Rullo already and broken cherry blossoms flew by, slashing open flowers of blood. In that moment, it seemed that Rullo was being torn apart.</p>
<p>What on earth was this?</p>
<p>He Ming really, truly, didn&rsquo;t understand. How come, when it came to him, none of the opponents were like what he researched? Against Fang Rui, he was in the lead, he had the advantage, then since Fang Rui didn&rsquo;t use all those new tricks at first, He Ming won.</p>
<p>This time, Mo Fan was different from the very start. Fiercely attacking, relentlessly attacking, not giving a single chance for retaliation. He Ming was an Elementalist. What Elementalists were most afraid of was someone closing in and not giving them any chance to pull away. This time, he couldn&rsquo;t shake the other off at all. What suspense was there left?</p>
<p>Mo Fan finally gained a win. A complete and straightforward win.</p>
<p>Chapter 1208: The Issue of Communication</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! This kid&rsquo;s really playing this match with spirit!&rdquo; In Happy&rsquo;s player area, everyone was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Mo Fan was still that silent, still that uncommunicative, so even though they chose him to go onstage, no one knew how he planned to fight. But this match, he won beautifully. Seeing He Ming&rsquo;s cold face as he came offstage on Miracle&rsquo;s side, it was clear how depressing that match had been for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad at all.&rdquo; Happy&rsquo;s players showered him with praise, but sadly this was the group arena, so for now the victorious Mo Fan had no way of receiving everyone&rsquo;s congratulations. As for how the next battle would play out, no one knew.</p>
<p>Looking at Miracle&rsquo;s player area, they saw their second player standing up.</p>
<p>Jia Xing, Battle Mage, character Prideful Mage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a villain-like name, as soon as you hear it you know he&rsquo;s going to lose!&rdquo; As Fang Rui expressed this, Jia Xing walked onstage.</p>
<p>The map was still Wuchuan Path, and if nothing out of the ordinary happened, the two characters would still meet at the winery at the center of the map. Because, as of right now, neither of them had taken a roundabout route or slowed their, they both rushed right toward the center.</p>
<p>However, as he approached the winery, Jia Xing still hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>He had seen that in Mo Fan&rsquo;s fight with He Ming last round, he had fought a bit differently from his previous appearances. But would he regain his normal style in this battle?</p>
<p>After a moment of thinking, Jia Xing still controlled Prideful Mage to enter the winery more cautiously.</p>
<p>He constantly turned his camera from left to right, treating every corner of shadows as a place where the enemy could be waiting to ambush him.</p>
<p>Where was the opponent?</p>
<p>The crowd knew better than Jia Xing did.</p>
<p>Mo Fan didn&rsquo;t control Deception to hide in one corner. After he arrived at the winery, he first took a circle around outside, and after failing to discover the opponent&rsquo;s character, only then did he enter the winery. He was still moving around, evidently looking for the opponent.</p>
<p>He took an extremely active attitude. Clearly, for this battle, he was using the same new playstyle he had used in the previous battle, preparing to find the opponent and face them head-on. But because this map had this winery at its center, with twisting paths, the two didn&rsquo;t meet so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kid, what&rsquo;s up with him today?&rdquo; Fang Rui asked, slightly confused.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu shook his head. He wasn&rsquo;t clear either.</p>
<p>Last round, Mo Fan changed his normal playstyle. It was unexpected, but looking at the battle situation as a whole, the change he made was very reasonable, because last round his opponent was an Elementalist. Using this sort of active, aggressive, close-up style to attack fit the typical logic.</p>
<p>But in this round, the opponent was a Battle Mage, a class that was very good at direct confrontation, yet Mo Fan still used the same method he had last round. This led people to feel that his adjustment last round wasn&rsquo;t a decision made after seeing the class of his opponent, was it?</p>
<p>The two characters were playing hide and seek in the winery, and the crowd, with their omniscient view, were the most anxious. Especially one time when they were one wall apart, but one went left and the other went right, passing each other by so closely, provoking all sorts of sighs from the audience.</p>
<p>Finally, the two characters met in the lane formed by the gap between two courtyard walls.</p>
<p>Mo Fan was calm, but Jia Xing jumped. He thought that the opponent had been hiding somewhere, only for him to just boldly appear before him like this.</p>
<p>What was going on, Jia Xing already had a general guess. Since we&rsquo;ve met like this, let&rsquo;s just fight!</p>
<p>The lane wasn&rsquo;t very wide. The two characters met, were stunned for a second, and suddenly charged forward.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The Ninja had some long-range skills. As Deception rushed forward, he had already thrown out a Shuriken.</p>
<p>Prideful Mage twisted his body to dodge. His movement didn&rsquo;t slow, and his spear was already lifted.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!</p>
<p>Happy&rsquo;s Tang Rou often used this as a powerful opening move, and Jia Xing felt that it was a suitable move for this current terrain, and so he directly used this powerful skill as he sprinted forward.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a rippling magic aura, Prideful Mage rushed forward with his spear. The sound of his footsteps against the limestone-paved path rang in the air.</p>
<p>In the narrow channel, the magic flow from the Dragon Breaks the Ranks filled the space, and it looked like there was no place for Deception to hide.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Mo Fan turned his camera, and Deception instantly ran toward one of the walls at the side. Jump up, stab ninjato into the wall, use that to jump up again, and Deception was already flying in the air. The Dragon Breaks the Ranks passed below him, and the aura was enough to send his clothes flapping, but it didn&rsquo;t affect his body. Here, he was outside of the attack range of Dragon Breaks the Ranks.</p>
<p>As Deception twisted in the air, his two hands were flying to form seals.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu: Shadow Dance!</p>
<p>Mo Fan didn&rsquo;t hold back, directly using a powerful attack against the opponent. Dozens of Deception&rsquo;s shadow clones chased the silhouette of Prideful Mage behind the Dragon Breaks the Ranks.</p>
<p>But Prideful Mage suddenly jumped up, turning in midair.</p>
<p>Seeing Deception dodge the Dragon Breaks the Ranks so nimbly, Jia Xing immediately stopped the attack. He anticipated that the opponent would immediately try and attack him, so he borrowed his lingering momentum and jumped up, twisted. Magic fluctuated around his spear, and he swung it down.</p>
<p>Shattering Heaven and Earth!</p>
<p>Powerful attack, another powerful attack, Jia Xing also retaliated with a powerful attack.</p>
<p>The shadow clones of the Shadow Dance hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to all attack Prideful Mage when this powerful attack enveloped all of them.</p>
<p>Shadow clones, how much life could they have? They definitely couldn&rsquo;t resist this bold level 75 Battle Mage attack, which produced waves of magic enough to stir a mountain. In an instant, these clones were dissipated into light, leaving not a single one.</p>
<p>Not a single one?</p>
<p>This situation was very similar to when He Ming earlier used Heavenly Lightning Earthen Fire to blast away all of the shadow clones. Not a single one remaining meant that Deception had already hidden somewhere that was out of sight.</p>
<p>Underground?</p>
<p>Prideful Mage&rsquo;s spear already thrusted downward, but no, he wasn&rsquo;t there&hellip;</p>
<p>Everyone saw, Deception was coming at him from behind, using skills like Shadow Clone Technique to instantly send himself to this position.</p>
<p>The ambush of a Ninja was of course silent and stealthy. As soon as Prideful Mage&rsquo;s spear hit nothing, Jia Xing knew that something was wrong, but it was already too late to react, Deception had gotten behind him.</p>
<p>Annihilation!</p>
<p>The Ninja&rsquo;s knock up skill sent Prideful Mage into the air.</p>
<p>And then, Ninjutsu: Flickering Charge!</p>
<p>The rapidly moving silhouette seemed to flash in the air, chasing Prideful Mage with attack after attack. As Flickering Charge was executed, Prideful Mage&rsquo;s body was still floating in the air. He hadn&rsquo;t had the time to fall back down, but he suddenly waved the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding his spear.</p>
<p>A purple shadow flew forth.</p>
<p>This Battle Mage had the Witch&rsquo;s low-level skill Night Cloak.</p>
<p>Night Cloak&rsquo;s Grab effect was extremely good, but Mo Fan&rsquo;s reaction was fast. Deception swiftly jumped backward, and this Night Cloak hit air. But immediately afterward, a burst of something that looked like stardust scattered in front of them, and Deception was unable to dodge it cleanly.</p>
<p>Disperse Powder, another Witch skill.</p>
<p>Using these two instant Witch skills, Jia Xing won back the initiative. The speed-lowering effect of Disperse Powder had a significant impact on the Ninja, who relied on agility.</p>
<p>Jia Xing easily controlled to dodge Deception&rsquo;s follow-up attack, and then he began his counterattack.</p>
<p>Just in this narrow alleyway, the Battle Mage and the Ninja began a fierce confrontation.</p>
<p>The two competed in observation, reaction, hand speed.</p>
<p>Neither of them thought to use some opening to retreat and adjust before coming back. It was as though the entire map were limited to just this little area and leaving would be dying. The two traded blows, both refusing to back down.</p>
<p>But the Ninja class, in terms of style, wasn&rsquo;t entirely suited for this sort of hard, direct battle. Compared to the opponent, he was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But the battle was still that intense. The disadvantage was only evident in the speed at which the health of the two characters decreased. But no one dared to confidently say right now who would win and who would lose. In this sort of confrontation, one slip-up could be seized by the opponent to reach a new high. An advantage right now could be completely turned around by such a high.</p>
<p>This was Miracle&rsquo;s home game, and so there were more supporters of Miracle and Jia Xing.</p>
<p>Right now Prideful Mage had the slight upper hand, but no one dared to relax. They worried, their hearts raced, every clash made them jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a time like this, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for him to adjust his rhythm a bit?&rdquo; At Happy&rsquo;s player area, the players were discussing the situation at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the way he&rsquo;s acting, it looks like he&rsquo;s prepared to fight like this until the end,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Battle Mage seems quite tough, Mo Fan really should&rsquo;ve used his normal playstyle to wear him down,&rdquo; Fang Rui said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Ye Xiu agreed, but the problem was, no one knew what Mo Fan was thinking. Worse, even after he came offstage they still might not get an answer. Lack of communication was always Mo Fan&rsquo;s biggest problem.</p>
<p>At last, this battle ended with Jia Xing&rsquo;s victory. Prideful Mage still had just under a third of his health left, not a bad situation.</p>
<p>Over at Happy, they were sighing. For this battle, Mo Fan&rsquo;s health had lagged behind at the start, but if he had used his normal style for this battle instead of the direct confrontation, he might have had a greater chance.</p>
<p>Watching Mo Fan walk back step by step, Happy&rsquo;s members maintained their silence, all the way until he returned to the player room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; Ye Xiu put simply.</p>
<p>Mo Fan looked at him, didn&rsquo;t say anything and headed back toward his own seat.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu gave Su Mucheng a meaningful look. At Happy, the only one who could have any bit of communication with Mo Fan was Su Mucheng.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng smiled. She twisted her head to look back at where Mo Fan heading back to his seat and called, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit sad that you lost, how come you played in such a rush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mo Fan stopped and looked back, but his gaze landed not upon Su Mucheng, but upon Fang Rui.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a hurry,&rdquo; Mo Fan said.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You useless dim sum! Are you looking for death! Hurry up and kneel!&rdquo; Ye Xiu hit Fang Rui on the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistake, my mistake!&rdquo; Fang Rui was weeping and crying. The others didn&rsquo;t know whether to be angry or amused. This communication issue was really a big problem!</p>
<p>Chapter 1209: Who&rsquo;s Under Pressure</p>
<p>In the group arena, two of Happy&rsquo;s people were down, and Miracle&rsquo;s second player still had a little under a third of his health left. This was a relatively common situation in a group arena. This around 30% health lead wasn&rsquo;t enough to let Miracle relax or have confidence in their victory. They all couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Happy&rsquo;s players, observing their movements.</p>
<p>Happy&rsquo;s third player, Tang Rou, had already stood up. She turned back to place on her seat the copy of Esports Time that the Miracle players had harassed them to take.</p>
<p>Starting from the first player Wei Chen, all the way to Mo Fan, Happy had already sent out five players. What effect did the Esports Time have on their spirits? To be honest, if they hadn&rsquo;t seen Tang Rou putting the magazine down just now, Miracle almost forgot about this whole thing. From those five players, they really hadn&rsquo;t seen any effect at all&hellip;</p>
<p>Was it that Fang Rui and Mo Fan&rsquo;s unusual performances today were provoked by the Esports Time? That possibility would really be a slap in their face.</p>
<p>But no matter what, the next player from Happy was the one at the center of the whole controversy, Tang Rou. There was no way she was entirely unaffected by this? The attacks from Ruan Cheng&rsquo;s article in Esports Time were extremely aggressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way a rookie can take that kind of pressure,&rdquo; He Ming said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip; she seems very calm,&rdquo; Shen Jian said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t be so nervous that she can&rsquo;t even walk?&rdquo; As He Ming spoke, he followed Tang Rou with his eyes as she entered the competitor booth.</p>
<p>The group arena continued, same map, the characters loaded and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wander around inside, let&rsquo;s just meet outside. We&rsquo;re in a hurry.&rdquo; Tang Rou actually first sent a message in the chat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that all about? What &lsquo;in a hurry&rsquo;? Tang Rou never has the habit of chatting during a match, does she?&rdquo; He Ming said with some confusion, only to hear a rattling crash from Happy&rsquo;s player area. Everyone immediately looked over, and saw Fang Rui fallen upon the ground, covered in dust with a depressed expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This this&hellip; this is just too mean, this&hellip;&rdquo; Fang Rui was saying. Miracle couldn&rsquo;t hear clearly, but Happy&rsquo;s players were all laughing. Tang Rou&rsquo;s &ldquo;in a hurry&rdquo; was of course a very pointed comment. No one thought that she would actually tease Fang Rui in such a way! Fang Rui felt overwhelming pressure, these guys were all &ldquo;in a hurry&rdquo; to deliberately push the responsibility of loss onto him!</p>
<p>While Happy was all joyful, Miracle became even more stunned.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>A 30% health lead wasn&rsquo;t considered much, but it couldn&rsquo;t be completely ignored? Happy was clearly in a bad situation right now, but they really seemed to be quite happy, this&hellip; did they have some ace up their sleeve? In a hurry? In a hurry for what?</p>
<p>Miracle&rsquo;s members exchanged looks, no one understood what this was about. Meanwhile, the two Battle Mages onstage had almost arrived at the center of the map.</p>
<p>Tang Rou sent an invitation for a direct fight, but her opponent Jia Xing ignored her. In a situation where a player had the health advantage, they generally wouldn&rsquo;t go to fight the opponent directly, they would prefer to play some tricks, and Jia Xing followed this normal thought process as well.</p>
<p>Tang Rou&rsquo;s Soft Mist, like Deception last round, first took a circle around the winery. Upon failing to discover Prideful Mage, she had no choice but to enter the winery.</p>
<p>A large courtyard with three entrances and exits. Jia Xing was relatively active, not waiting in one place. The two wandered around, and before long they met. Tang Rou&rsquo;s Soft Mist rushed forward without any hesitation, but Jia Xing&rsquo;s Prideful Mage decisively retreated, swiftly finding a shadowy position he had passed earlier from which he could launch an ambush.</p>
<p>One step, two steps, three steps&hellip;</p>
<p>Jia Xing silently counted the rhythm of Soft Mist&rsquo;s approach, his eyes focused on the spot where Soft Mist would appear.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A thunderous sound. The walls of the winery courtyard weren&rsquo;t particularly sturdy. If even a Qi Master&rsquo;s qi could break it, how could it pose any difficulty for the powerful magic aura of a Battle Mage?</p>
<p>Soft Mist directly blasted a large hole in the wall, and from her pose, it was clear that she wanted to cut off the path and intercept Prideful Mage. A lucky hit, for as soon as she came through, she saw Prideful Mage holding his spear, staring intently at the other opening and sneakily hiding.</p>
<p>Happy had so many experts at playing dirty, skilled at waiting, ambushing, and laying traps. Tang Rou, growing up in this sort of team environment, of course, understood these tactics. Seeing Prideful Mage&rsquo;s position, she immediately guessed his intentions.</p>
<p>But would Tang Rou care that much? We meet, so let&rsquo;s fight!</p>
<p>Soft Mist, Dragon Breaks the Ranks, charged toward Prideful Mage.</p>
<p>At this point, Jia Xing had seen Soft Mist breaking through the wall, turning, and rushing toward him without hesitation. He immediately controlled Prideful Mage to dodge. If this little shadowy corner were hit by that Dragon Breaks the Ranks, it would likely collapse.</p>
<p>Tang Rou&rsquo;s rhythm was of course very fast, Soft Mist&rsquo;s spear twisted and chased Prideful Mage, continuing to batter him. Jia Xing wanted to avoid the spear, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the space and could only harden his skin and meet her attacks.</p>
<p>The two Battle Mages were immediately tangled together. Confrontations between players of the same class were both monotonous and fierce, but this time, Jia Xing didn&rsquo;t have the chance to feel any boredom, he only felt the ferocity. Because this was too familiar, he needed to make more calculations. He didn&rsquo;t even have to time to think about too many problems, as Soft Mist attacked too rapidly, too ferociously, he had no chance to plan anything. He could only input controls nonstop, almost unconsciously, all the way until his Prideful Mage fell.</p>
<p>He lost?</p>
<p>Jia Xing finally regained his wits. The battle just now seemed like an empty fog, as though his brain completely stopped turning, and only his hands kept working.</p>
<p>And now, he had already fallen. The word &ldquo;GLORY&rdquo; would not be sent to his screen.</p>
<p>Jia Xing walked out of the player both. How long had this battle taken? He felt lost. He only had one feeling: fast, very fast, extremely fast.</p>
<p>How did it turn out like this? Shouldn&rsquo;t she be&hellip;</p>
<p>Only now did Jia Xing think about how stress-ridden Tang Rou should be. Her performance should have been subpar. But he hadn&rsquo;t felt that at all; Tang Rou&rsquo;s attack rhythm was still as determined as ever.</p>
<p>Jia Xing didn&rsquo;t feel it, and the Miracle members offstage didn&rsquo;t see it either.</p>
<p>The unfortunate trio exchanged looks. If even Tang Rou hadn&rsquo;t been affected by this whole affair, then there was no point in mentioning any of the other players in Happy. The situation they had been relying on to win this match didn&rsquo;t exist at all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what, let&rsquo;s get these two points first!&rdquo; He Ming said.</p>
<p>Shen Jian nodded. He was Miracle&rsquo;s third player for the group arena, the anchor of the team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; He Ming added, unable to relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Shen Jian nodded. He couldn&rsquo;t relax either, and so he didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to say any bold words to settle their hearts. Seeing Jia Xing&rsquo;s dazed expression as he came offstage, Shen Jian&rsquo;s heart started beating more rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; Shen Jian told himself that the opponent was a rookie, that there was nothing to panic about, and at the same time, he tried to get some report from Jia Xing.</p>
<p>Jia Xing, who had been beaten so pathetically that his mind was empty, of course had nothing to talk about. His face showed only an expression of loss, and Shen Jian could only carry his various emotions of suspicion and alarm as he went onstage.</p>
<p>The battle began.</p>
<p>The blank-minded Jia Xing had still made some contribution, knocking away 10% of Soft Mist&rsquo;s health. With that sort of direct fighting earlier, it was inevitable that both sides take some damage.</p>
<p>And so Miracle&rsquo;s advantage in the group arena, starting from the 50% that He Ming had, was now whittled down to only 10%.</p>
<p>10%&hellip;</p>
<p>Staring at this advantage, Shen Jian didn&rsquo;t have much confident. His Striker walked forward, but his heart was jumping. He wasn&rsquo;t a rookie. He had experience in professional battles, but to put all of the pressure of the group arena on him, Shen Jian discovered that he wasn&rsquo;t as strong as he thought he was.</p>
<p>The opponent is a rookie. The opponent has already lost 10% health. The opponent is suffering the heavy pressure of public opinion. None of these reasons were enough to boost Shen Jian&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>A core player was a position, but it was also a responsibility. Every pro player anticipated having this kind of position, but not everyone could take on this kind of responsibility. Sometimes, it was because they didn&rsquo;t have enough ability, such as in old Excellent Era, Shen Jian never had enough ability to become the core player. And now, in Miracle, as an experienced player born in Excellent Era, Shen Jian became a core player for this team alongside He Ming and Wang Ze. but now, with the weight of the group arena upon his shoulders, Shen Jian found that he couldn&rsquo;t calm down. His main thoughts were not about how to achieve victory, but&hellip; what if he lost?</p>
<p>His mental state was a mess, but it wasn&rsquo;t so bad that it affected his basic movement ability. Shen Jian&rsquo;s Striker Lethe quickly arrived at the winery at the center of the map. He didn&rsquo;t directly find Tang Rou to battle. After tumbling into the winery courtyard, he found a place to crouch and wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; Offstage, He Ming was scowling.</p>
<p>Playing dirty? That wasn&rsquo;t Shen Jian&rsquo;s strong point! Before the match, he had never expressed wanting to use such a playstyle.</p>
<p>He Ming was stunned, Wang Ze didn&rsquo;t understand either. These two teammates had no way of knowing the jittery feelings Shen Jian was experiencing onstage, they could only exchange glances.</p>
<p>In the match, Shen Jian sent a message in the chat. &ldquo;Where are you? Come out and let&rsquo;s decide this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Confuse the enemy, hide your true intentions, this was what Shen Jian was thinking. But for those in this field, this sort of dirty playing was really a bit out of place?</p>
<p>&ldquo;124, 131&rdquo; Clean and direct, Tang Rou sent out the coordinates of Soft Mist&rsquo;s position, not dirty at all.</p>
<p>Then, what would Shen Jian do?</p>
<p>The viewers looked over, only to see Shen Jian&rsquo;s Striker Lethe sneak out of his corner, looking like he was really about to run over to the position Tang Rou indicated.</p>
<p>If that was the case&hellip; then what was the point in crouching at the beginning?</p>
<p>Those who had some understanding were all confused by Shen Jian&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this guy playing at?&rdquo; Fang Rui asked, mouth agape. After all, this was one of Ye Xiu&rsquo;s former teammates!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably&hellip; playing dirty?&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to insult me?&rdquo; Fang Rui was unhappy. Dirty playing wasn&rsquo;t this low-level! He refused to recognize this as dirty play.</p>
<p>Chapter 1210: Title is Spoiler</p>
<p>124, 131.</p>
<p>Shen Jian&rsquo;s Striker Lethe headed towards the coordinates mentioned by Tang Rou, but he wasn&rsquo;t moving fast or slow. His wading in the mud and water showed the uncertainty in his heart. When he was almost at the destination, he didn&rsquo;t directly show his face. He searched his surroundings as if he were looking for a good spot to set up an ambush.</p>
<p>His opponent had justly and honorably declared her position, but he was stealthily creeping forward preparing for an ambush. Most people usually despised this sort of dirtiness. Luckily, this was Team Miracle&rsquo;s home ground, so the boos from the crowd were more subdued.</p>
<p>Shen Jian looked around for awhile before finally finding a position that he liked and then sprinted towards it.</p>
<p>No one?</p>
<p>His gaze moved towards the coordinates 124, 131, but there were no signs of Soft Mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You liar!&rdquo; Shen Jian was furious. He felt like he had fallen for a trick. This had to be a trap, yes, a trap. As he lashed out in chat, he immediately had Lethe quickly leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you&rsquo;ve arrived?&rdquo; Tang Rou replied back in chat.</p>
<p>Shen Jian ignored her. Don&rsquo;t even think about using words to distract me, Shen Jian thought, forgetting that he was the one who had started this conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too slow. If I didn&rsquo;t walk around for a bit, the referee would punish me,&rdquo; Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>Shen Jian didn&rsquo;t believe her, but the crowd knew she was telling the truth. After Tang Rou announced her location, Soft Mist stood there waiting the entire time. However, Shen Jian&rsquo;s Lethe kept dilly-dallying. When he had almost reached her location, he started looking for an ambush spot. Tang Rou had waited for quite a while before she had Soft Mist start moving around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way back. Just wait there.&rdquo; Tang Rou said.</p>
<p>Shen Jian was suddenly in a panic. Lethe spun around, his gaze sweeping over his surroundings, searching for Tang Rou&rsquo;s location. The crowd stared blankly at him. Wasn&rsquo;t this supposed to be a fight between two players? From the looks of it, why did it feel like he was playing hide and seek!</p>
<p>Shen Jian didn&rsquo;t just stand there like an honest person. After spinning around twice, he felt like there were too many places for his opponent to come out from. There weren&rsquo;t any ambush spots nearby, which meant that she had run away&hellip;</p>
<p>The home crowd was Team Miracle&rsquo;s, so they endured it once more.</p>
<p>Quite a few people were looking forward to how the show would continue forward though because the escape route chosen by Shen Jian just happened to be Soft Mist&rsquo;s return route. The crowd had a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the situation, so they could see it very clearly.</p>
<p>The two sides finally met face to face. This surprise encounter once again made Shen Jian panic, but Tang Rou didn&rsquo;t even greet him before attacking.</p>
<p>Dragon Breaks the Ranks!</p>
<p>A dragon instantly appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>Shen Jian&rsquo;s Lethe moved backwards to dodge and evaded it. His character glanced around. It seemed like he was searching for an escape route.</p>
<p>The match has already reached this point, and you&rsquo;re still thinking about running away?</p>
<p>How is he planning on playing this match?</p>
<p>This time, the crowd had no answer and boos gradually started coming out. It wasn&rsquo;t that the those who played dirty couldn&rsquo;t accept running away, but those who played dirty weren&rsquo;t this gutless in a direct confrontation either. Running away needed to have a clear tactical intent, but Shen Jian? The crowd couldn&rsquo;t see even a glimpse of a plan. From the start, he had appeared overcautious the entire time. He was now faced with his opponent&rsquo;s spear, yet he was still like this.</p>
<p>Can you win with this sort of attitude?</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A Falling Flower Palm pushed forward. Shen Jian wasn&rsquo;t able to react in time, and Lethe shot backwards. However, Lethe was surrounded by walls on three sides. Lethe slammed into a wall and then rebounded back. Soft Mist&rsquo;s Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart welcomed him and pinned him back to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd wasn&rsquo;t just booing. Angry curses were starting to be thrown out.</p>
<p>Even He Ming and Wang Ze, Shen Jian&rsquo;s former teammates, his two pals after coming to Team Miracle, were also having trouble watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo; He Ming asked Wang Ze. Who could Wang Ze ask? It looked like Shen Jian was the player being pointed at by everyone, fearful and nervous from the pressure. As for Tang Rou&rsquo;s Soft Mist? Her temperament, playstyle, and drive were no different than before. Shen Jian&rsquo;s gaze shifted towards Happy&rsquo;s player area. An Esports Time was quietly sitting where Tang Rou had been sitting at before.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on? Did I give her the wrong one?</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t dare to believe it. The other players on Happy might not be affected, but he had trouble believing that a rookie like Tang Rou would feel nothing from the pressure of the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Tang is playing quite relaxed,&rdquo; Ye Xiu commented on Happy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Would Tang Rou be affected by this pressure? It wasn&rsquo;t just Team Miracle who cared, Happy cared even more. And from this match, it couldn&rsquo;t be said that Tang Rou was completely unaffected because there truly had been some changes.</p>
<p>For example, in the dialogue in this match, the previous Tang Rou wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered with topics unrelated to the match. But now, she could mischievously tease Fang Rui and chat a few words with Shen Jian. This was a change in attitude. She wasn&rsquo;t impatient to prove the public opinion wrong, but rather player in a more relaxed way. With her personality, she might not be able excite her full potential, but controlling and adjusting her emotions purposefully was a more mature transformation.</p>
<p>Shen Jian&rsquo;s cowardice put him in a stifled position. His ten percent health instantly disappeared and then he started falling behind, losing to panic. Under this vicious cycle, he suffered a crushing defeat to Tang Rou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo; He Ming ruthlessly berated Shen Jian. It wasn&rsquo;t like they couldn&rsquo;t afford losing, but in the end, Shen Jian had only been able to take away 20 percent of Tang Rou&rsquo;s health. This sort of trash performance was practically the same as giving away the point. He Ming couldn&rsquo;t understand what had happened to Shen Jian. Why did his playing suddenly take a dive? Their Team Miracle had prepared amply for this match, and seeing that their opponents were at the sharp end of the public&rsquo;s stick, their mentality going into the match had been quite solid. The rookies that joined the Alliance along with Team Miracle might have lost, but they performed very well. On the other hand, it was Shen Jian, their anchor for the group arena, that had lost in such an embarrassing manner.</p>
<p>Shen Jian didn&rsquo;t know how to explain himself. He had been given such a heavy responsibility, but it turned out that he had no confidence with this heavy responsibility. It was truly very shameful. In Team Miracle, he had acted quite arrogant as a capable senior. He didn&rsquo;t want his lofty image to crumble this easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t lose this team competition! We can&rsquo;t be shaven clean by them, can we?&rdquo; He Ming saw that Shen Jian hadn&rsquo;t responded. He didn&rsquo;t say anything more and started encouraging the team for the following team competition.</p>
<p>However&hellip; they had been quite confident about this match, but in the group arena and individual competition, Happy annihilated their forces. The psychological advantage held previously by Team Miracle had disappeared long ago. In particular, each of them hiding a copy of the Esports Time and then giving the copy to their opponents wasn&rsquo;t exactly a good-looking move, yet their method was completely ineffective and might end up being laughed at later. In this round, everyone in Team Miracle felt like they were clowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s team strength is much worse than their individual strength. Their teamwork isn&rsquo;t good. This is our chance.&rdquo; He Ming said.</p>
<p>However, everyone already knew this. He Ming repeating it didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>He Ming didn&rsquo;t know what to do with their downed spirits. In reality, his confidence had been killed too. It was just that he was the team captain, so he kept reminding himself not to show weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be afraid of! At worst, we lose! We&rsquo;re just a new team with new players. Go in with a learning attitude!&rdquo; At this moment, the punk Guo Shao jumped out and yelled. He was still bursting with life, filled with hope towards this following team competition. He actually dared to say something like &ldquo;At worse, we lose!&rdquo; Perhaps no team captain would ever say these words, but that was the truth, and it actually eased the players up quite a bit. Even Shen Jian seemed to have relaxed. He didn&rsquo;t belong to the &ldquo;new players&rdquo; category!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do this!&rdquo; Guo Shao might as well just jump into the crowd and start cheering for his teammates. He attracted quite the attention from the crowd.</p>
<p>The team competition began shortly afterwards. Guo Shao&rsquo;s words had been quite effective. With the attitude of &ldquo;At worst, we lose,&rdquo; Team Miracle&rsquo;s players let loose. But the problem was that once they let loose, they couldn&rsquo;t keep it together. In the end, they were a new team too. They had problems with teamwork because of their lack of experience. He Ming, Shen Jian, and Wang Ze were experienced players, but they weren&rsquo;t experienced as core players. Their ability to keep things together clearly couldn&rsquo;t compare to Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, and Fang Rui, who had all once been top core players in their teams.</p>
<p>Their home map advantage wasn&rsquo;t able to help them. In the end, Team Happy won the team competition, sweeping Team Miracle 10 to 0.</p>
<p>The other matches taking place that same day ended in succession. In the ninth round, an extremely unusual scene appeared. There were unexpectedly 5 perfect wins this round, and all of them were away game victories.</p>
<p>Team Happy versus Team Miracle: 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Team Blue Rain versus Team Conquering Clouds: 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Team Tyranny versus Team Lightly: 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Team Samsara versus Team Bright Green: 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Team Tiny Herb versus Team Seaside: 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Apart from Team Happy and Team Miracle, the other four matches were all strong versus weak team matchups. However, the weak teams had the home game advantage. Not being able to win even a single point was very surprising. The public opinion believed that as the league developed, the disparity between the top teams and weak teams was growing larger and larger. The powerhouses prospered in the current scene, receiving more resources than weak teams and then using these greater resources to further strengthen their team. Under this cycle, the strong teams became stronger, while the weak teams became weaker. The new teams without any strong financial backers seemed to have difficulty breaking through these strong teams. Team Heavenly Swords had initially been looked at highly because of their strong backing, but who would have thought that their boss would be personally taking up the banner. Their expectations for Team Heavenly Swords would have to wait until after this boss lost his interest in playing.</p>
<p>Chapter 1211: Strong Performances</p>
<p>Translator: Nomyummi Editor: Nomyummi</p>
<p>Apart from the five perfect 10-0 wins, the other matches in Round 9 were very orderly, three 2-8 losses and two 7-3 wins.</p>
<p>The three 2-8 losses were the home teams Heavenly Swords, Parade, and Radiant losing to the visiting teams Misty Rain, Void, and Hundred Blossoms respectively. As for the two 7-3 wins, 301 and Royal Style took down Wind Howl and Thunderclap relying on their home field advantage.</p>
<p>In the end, the weaker teams weren&rsquo;t able to pull off any upsets in Round 9. However, 301 and Royal Style, the two mid-tier teams that were on the edge of making it into the playoffs last season, utilized their home field advantage to beat Wind Howl and Thunderclap, rather surprising victories.</p>
<p>After Round 8, Thunderclap had been in second place, but their lead over the lower ranked teams hadn&rsquo;t been that high. With this loss, they immediately slid down to fourth place, while Blue Rain and Tiny Herb with 69 points and 66 points took second and third. Samsara&rsquo;s consistency and dominance once again placed them in their own separate tier. Their point total was 77, 8 points ahead of the second place team. After Thunderclap was Misty Rain in fifth with 59 points, Tyranny in sixth with 57 points, Wind Howl in seventh with 57 points, and then Hundred Blossoms in eighth. After Happy took a huge win over Hundred Blossoms, beating them 9 to 1, Hundred Blossoms adjusted rapidly. After two rounds, they were back on their feet, quickly making their way back to the playoff zone.</p>
<p>After Hundred Blossoms was Void, 301, and Royal Style placed outside of the playoff zone. With Happy winning this round 10 to 0, they moved up one spot from fourteenth to thirteenth, but the distance between Happy and the eighth place Hundred Blossoms was 14 points. The teams in the relegations zone were Seaside and Bright Green. After Round 7, these two teams were locked into last and second to last. The gap between these two teams and the teams ahead of them were pulling farther and farther apart. It looked like there wouldn&rsquo;t be any suspense as for who would be relegated this season.</p>
<p>The post-match reports for Round 9 didn&rsquo;t focus on a single team or person but rather how weirdly orderly the point distribution was. The media really wanted to about the dominance of powerhouses because of the several 10 to 0s, but the problem was that of these five 10 to 0s, one of them just had to be Happy, a truly irksome presence. Happy was without a doubt unrelated to this topic, but they just had to show up at this moment. The issue of dealing with Happy gave the media huge headaches. In the end, it was still Esports Home with the talent. Samsara, Tiny Herb, Blue Rain, and Tyranny were used to describe the untouchable dominance of the powerhouses. On the other hand, Happy was singled out as the representative team of wildly inconsistent and incomprehensible team.</p>
<p>They could crush Hundred Blossoms 9 to 1, but also lose 3 to 7 to Radiant and Parade. Yet after those losses, they could achieve perfect 10 to 0 wins over Heavenly Swords and Miracle. Figure out a team&rsquo;s strength from their win records? In Happy&rsquo;s case, it seemed extremely unreliable.</p>
<p>In these nine rounds, Samsara had obtained the most 10 to 0s with three perfect wins. Next, with two perfect wins, was Tiny Herb and then Happy. But Happy was also among the teams who were annihilated 0 to 10. It was as though Happy just had to stick their nose in everything.</p>
<p>The Esports Home concluded with a serious reminder to all teams in the Alliance: Be wary of Happy.</p>
<p>This sort of spotlight onto them was quickly met with backlash by people such as the Esports Time&rsquo;s Ruan Cheng. The Esports Time was biweekly, so he had no way of immediately writing an article through the Esports Time and could only use his personal blog to express his opinions.</p>
<p>Tang Rou breaking her promise wasn&rsquo;t going to be forgiven so easily by him, but repeating the same thing again and again would tire out the readers. In fact, it might help her through reverse psychology. Ruan Cheng was a master though and had a subtle grasp of the pace. He wouldn&rsquo;t constantly stick in reminders, but he would never forget to raise the topic seemingly by accident at the appropriate time to avoid readers from forgetting about it. Because of Tang Rou, Ruan Cheng had turned into a through and through Happy hater. However, he was still a public figure and had to care about his reputation, so even if he had to paint Happy black, he had to back it up with logic, feigning reason and hiding his individual bias.</p>
<p>As a result, under Ruan Cheng&rsquo;s artful writing, Happy became a shit stick that harmed others without benefiting themselves, supported clearly and logically.</p>
<p>Why did his writing seem so reasonable? Because what Ruan Cheng wrote was really just a reiteration of the Esports Home&rsquo;s negative opinions of Happy in an uglier way. However, due to the influence of his writing style and the push from other journalists who were also unhappy with Tang Rou, Happy was generally viewed in a more negative light.</p>
<p>Two 10 to 0s?</p>
<p>One Heavenly Swords and one Miracle. Both these teams had certain ties with Happy. Snatching all ten points from them could also be considered quite vicious and merciless of Happy.</p>
<p>Some of the sillier comments even took those words &ldquo;vicious and merciless&rdquo; to describe Happy, seeming to have forgotten that any team wanted to win as many points as possible in a competition.</p>
<p>But dsepite these negative comments, Happy&rsquo;s pace became steadier and steadier.</p>
<p>In their tenth round home game versus Royal Style, a 9 to 1 victory.</p>
<p>In their eleventh round away game versus Seaside, Boundless Sea returned to the first time to his old home. The Seaside fans familiar with Boundless Sea saw their team&rsquo;s former symbol walk onto a path never to return under Happy&rsquo;s Fang Rui. Amidst the unrelenting boos from the crowd, Happy wasn&rsquo;t polite and sent away Seaside 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Two huge victories in two rounds. Happy had won 19 points, rising up two places on the rankings currently at eleventh place. Their distance to the playoff zone had shrunk to 10 points. Right now, Team Void was eighth. At the end of Round 9, the fifth place Team Misty Rain performed poorly in Round 10 and Round 11, falling out of the playoff zone at tenth place with 65 points. Even Team 301 was ahead of them.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms continued to perform consistently, winning 7 to 3 against the away team Blue Rain. Yu Feng&rsquo;s departure from Blue Rain had been quite controversial. Many fans thought he was being greedy. He had been one of the three core players of Team Blue Rain. Wanting an even higher position than that was endless greed.</p>
<p>This time, Yu Feng directly confronted Team Blue Rain, proving that he had the qualifications for an even higher position. Although his Berserker lost to Huang Shaotian&rsquo;s Blade Master in the final round of the group arena, Hundred Blossoms had opened poorly. By the time Yu Feng had to face Huang Shaotian, he was only at 30% health. But in the following team competition, Yu Feng became the most eye-catching player. His display of power pierced through the tactical net sown by Team Blue Rain. In the end, Hundred Blossoms won the team competition. Having won 7 points, they now had 71 points, rushing ahead to sixth place on the rankings, leading Tyranny by 1 point.</p>
<p>Blue Rain wasn&rsquo;t the only powerhouse that lost in the eleventh round. Tyranny lost their away game to Thunderclap 3 to 7, putting them at seventh place with 70 points. Thunderclap was third continuing on their radiant path this season. Apart from them, Tiny Herb lost to Void 2 to 8. Through this victory, Void broke into the playoff zone, while Tiny Herb was surpassed by Thunderclap, placing Tiny Herb at fourth.</p>
<p>In fifth place, Team Wind Howl won their away game 8 to 2 against Team Misty Rain, sending Team Misty Rain out of the playoff zone.</p>
<p>As for those outside of the playoff zone, Bright Green and Seaside were stuck in the relegation zone. Lightly, Miracle, Conquering Clouds, and the other low-tier teams had clearly become targets to snatch points from.</p>
<p>The weak teams were of no use to be looked at. Thus, the ups and downs of the rankings depended on the confrontations between the strong teams. Samsara led in first place with 94 points, 13 more points than Blue Rain. Their position this season was practically untouchable. Thunderclap had originally been this season&rsquo;s biggest surprise. After ten rounds, Thunderclap was still stuck in the second echelon teams outside of Samsara, running neck and neck with Tiny Herb and Blue Rain.</p>
<p>Team Wind Howl&rsquo;s momentum this season had been astonishing, but from their performance these eleven rounds, they were like loud thunder but small raindrops Even though they weren&rsquo;t like Happy who would sweep a team and then get swept, their inconsistency was a reality. After Hundred Blossoms&rsquo; first four rounds, they became more and more stable, beating Blue Rain this round. Yu Feng had proven himself. Hundred Blossoms also showed that they had the ability to beat a top team.</p>
<p>Afterwards was Tyranny. No one had any hope for them dominating like last season. Tyranny was determined to keep rotating in their subs to the extent that it was rare for all four heavenly kings to be on stage at the same time. Their win record was also fleeting. When they were facing weak teams, they weren&rsquo;t weak, but facing strong teams, they weren&rsquo;t too strong either. Many were disappointed in them, feeling helpless about the issues of age.</p>
<p>Void relied on their good performances these two rounds to return back to the playoff zone. Their victory over Tiny Herb had boosted their morale considerably. The air around them was very different from before in their post-match conference.</p>
<p>The teams ten points away from qualifying for playoffs were 301, Misty Rain, and Happy. Team 301 was always like this, pacing back and forth in and out of the playoff zone. When the end of the season came, if their luck was good, they would make it to playoffs. If their luck was bad, they wouldn&rsquo;t. As for Misty Rain and Happy, they would be fighting each other in Round 12. This match would determine who would be closer to the playoffs.</p>
<p>From the current trend, Misty Rain had performed poorly two rounds in a row, losing to 301 and Wind Howl. As for Happy? After losing to Tiny Herb in Round 8 and Tang Rou refuse to keep her promise, Happy started taking points like crazy. Over the ninth, tenth, and eleventh round, Happy had unexpectedly took 29 points in total, even beating Samsara in terms of points, who had obtained 27 points in these three rounds.</p>
<p>Happy had matched with Miracle and Seaside, who weren&rsquo;t strong teams, but Royal Style was a mid-tier team with an All-Star watching over. Royal Style even upset the roaring Thunderclap 7 to 3. But facing Happy, Royal Style was swept 9 to 1.</p>
<p>Happy is coming!</p>
<p>The Esports Home highlighted Happy&rsquo;s recent momentum. As for people like Ruan Cheng, who hated Happy, there was not much they could say. Happy&rsquo;s win after win was slap after slap to their faces. They were waiting, waiting for Happy to capsize. That way they would wantonly throw stones at them while they were down.</p>
<p>This upcoming match was looking to be a good opportunity. In Round 12, Happy would be facing Misty Rain, a team with the strength to make it to playoffs. If Happy couldn&rsquo;t pass this obstacle, let alone losing points to their direct competitor, Ruan Cheng&rsquo;s group could directly say that Happy were just paper tigers that could only topple pushovers.</p>
<p>Chapter 1212: The Number One Ninja</p>
<p>Translator: Nomyummi Editor: Nomyummi</p>
<p>November 22nd, Glory Professional Alliance Season 10 Round 12. Happy played their home game against Misty Rain, and once again the television chose to live broadcast Happy&rsquo;s match.</p>
<p>In this round, there were many matches between powerful teams, such as Wind Howl versus Void, Tiny Herb versus Hundred Blossoms, Blue Rain versus Thunderclap and so on. But in the end, they chose to broadcast this match between two teams that currently weren&rsquo;t in the playoff zone. They took into consideration the current situations of these two teams.</p>
<p>After eleven rounds, Happy&rsquo;s claim of aiming for the championship was still treated as a joke, but with their current ranking, people had to notice the potential this team had to make it to the playoffs. With a performance stronger than Samsara&rsquo;s in three consecutive rounds, they finally met a strong team, and everyone was curious as to whether or not Happy could continue their strong performance. Misty Rain had performed poorly in the past two rounds, instantly sliding from fifth place out of the playoff zone, and they urgently needed to regroup. So, the collision of these two teams was a bit more exciting, and was therefore chosen to be broadcast.</p>
<p>The attendance rate at Happy&rsquo;s home games continued to rise. Because of Excellent Era&rsquo;s many years of operation in City H, there was already a strong Glory fanbase. The old Excellent Era shut down and New Excellent Era was in the Challenger League. Many fans continued to follow Excellent Era matches, but many who liked watching professional matches slowly began to watch Happy&rsquo;s home matches. Happy&rsquo;s strong performance in the past three rounds incited even more attention and excitement, and now that they were facing the relatively strong Misty Rain, there was quite a crowd that came to watch the match in-person.</p>
<p>The players were introduced as they came onstage. Misty Rain, on Happy&rsquo;s home turf, actually received a decent amount of applause.</p>
<p>After Misty Rain let go of their Sharpshooter Lu Yining, the twin flowers Shu Keyi and Shu Kexin became part of Misty Rain&rsquo;s main force. Half of Misty Rain&rsquo;s positions were now occupied by females, and they finally became a veritable woman&rsquo;s army. This unique scenery naturally inspired unique attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, the Shu twins are very popular right now! They can receive such a welcome even at an away game.&rdquo; Television commentator Pan Lin noted the current atmosphere of the stadium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their skill is very high,&rdquo; Guest Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>After the away team, the home team players came onstage. In terms of female players, Happy only had one fewer! Su Mucheng and Tang Rou were both part of Happy&rsquo;s main force. Su Mucheng&rsquo;s popularity in City H really didn&rsquo;t need to be mentioned. Her appearance always caused the audience to reach a peak in energy. But Tang Rou&hellip; after the 1v3, her supporters drastically diminished. Never mind neutral audience members, even many of Happy&rsquo;s supporters didn&rsquo;t like to see her anymore. The applause after her introduction was always scattered and lacking, and the atmosphere was so cold that it was awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the welcome received by the home players is even less than what the away players received, this is really&hellip;&rdquo; Pan Lin lamented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tang Rou is very talented, but the way she dealt with this incident was really&hellip;&rdquo; Li Yibo also gave a half-sentence lament.</p>
<p>After the introductions of the two teams, what came next were of course the polite greetings and interactions between the teams onstage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back.&rdquo; Even though she was Misty Rain&rsquo;s captain, Chu Yunxiu didn&rsquo;t follow the custom to shake hands with Happy&rsquo;s captain, Ye Xiu. Instead, she went to her close friend Su Mucheng and gave her a hug.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was left hanging with his hand still extended, smiling awkwardly, but from the side someone suddenly appeared to shake his hand. &ldquo;God Ye, it&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while,&rdquo; Ye Xiu answered, smiling. This small and scrawny man before his eyes was Misty Rain&rsquo;s Li Hua, the current number one Ninja in Glory. He entered Misty Rain in Season 7, appearing on the main roster that year, and that season he and Sun Xiang were the most attention-grabbing rookies. But the styles of these two were exactly opposite, one was bright and eye-catching, charging at the frontlines of battle; the other preferred to lurk in unnoticed shadows, launching sudden attacks when the opponent was defenseless.</p>
<p>That season, Sun Xiang had snatched the title of Best Rookie, and the next year he joined the powerhouse Excellent Era, taking up One Autumn Leaf, a top account in Glory. And then his team was relegated, and failed to fight through the Challenger League, and only now in Samsara this season did he have a strong chance of winning. Sun Xiang&rsquo;s pro career could be said to be extremely unfortunate and frustrating.</p>
<p>And Li Hua, who debuted the same year, had spent all his time working hard in Misty Rain. After his abilities were recognized, the team began working hard to build a character for him. The Ninja Dark Forest was voted into the All-Stars along with Li Hua in Season 8, and again in Season 9. And in this season, Misty Rain&rsquo;s strategic style changed, and experts could all tell that it now revolved around Li Hua. This skinny little man played an extremely major role in Misty Rain. But after shaking hands with Ye Xiu, he backed away and quietly stood to the side. If no one introduced him, it would be hard to imagine that this person was also an all-powerful top player in Glory.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu finally broke apart from her hug with Su Mucheng. She turned to look at Ye Xiu and casually slapped the right palm he was extending. &ldquo;What, you want a hug too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Ye Xiu grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want a hug, then hug!&rdquo; And Chu Yunxiu really came over to give Ye Xiu a hug, just like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome back!&rdquo; she said, patting Ye Xiu&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, in a while you won&rsquo;t be so welcoming,&rdquo; Ye Xiu laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Yunxiu laughed coldly and pushed him away.</p>
<p>To the side, Fang Rui also opened his two arms. &ldquo;Come! The embrace of love,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out. The player is as dirty as his playing.&rdquo; Chu Yunxiu ignored Fang Rui.</p>
<p>The players continued to move, shaking hands with each other down the line. When the Shu twins came to shake Ye Xiu&rsquo;s hand, their feelings were a bit complex. Last year during the Christmas event, they really wanted to tear out the heart of this person in front of them. For this round against Happy, the two were already secretly planning to give this God a proper retaliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, do you regret joining Misty Rain? You should&rsquo;ve come to our Happy!&rdquo; Ye Xiu said as he shook their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ahead of you in ranking,&rdquo; Shu Keyi said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long,&rdquo; Ye Xiu smirked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait and see!&rdquo; The sisters glared at Ye Xiu, not at all afraid.</p>
<p>The greetings were quickly completed. The first players in the individual round stayed onstage while everyone else returned to their player areas.</p>
<p>Happy, Ye Xiu, Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Misty Rain, Li Hua, Dark Forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a coincidence, Senior.&rdquo; The easily-overlooked Li Hua was set up with Ye Xiu again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to learn from you in this match,&rdquo; Li Hua said politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this exchange of meaningless words, Li Hua paused. He clearly still wanted to say something, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the right words. After silently thinking for a while, the judge already declaring that they could enter their player booths, Li Hua finally said a third pointless sentence. &ldquo;Good luck, Senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two headed toward their respective competitor booths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Xiu, Happy once again sends out Ye Xiu for the individual competition&hellip; So far he has almost always appeared in the individual competition. He already has ten consecutive wins, this is the twelfth round,&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, this season, he hasn&rsquo;t lost a single 1v1,&rdquo; Li Yibo said. Right now was Round 12, and Ye Xiu was heading toward his eleventh straight win in his eleventh individual appearance, the answer was clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such a powerful 1v1 ability, why doesn&rsquo;t he anchor the group arena?&rdquo; Pan Lin didn&rsquo;t understand, since that was how most teams set it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably to lessen his burden, Ye Xiu isn&rsquo;t young anymore. Tyranny&rsquo;s already rotating their players,&rdquo; Li Yibo said. In a question of age, Tyranny always had to be mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if Ye Xiu continues with this pattern and rhythm, this season&rsquo;s King of Dueling award will be uncontested,&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; For now, his unspecialized class gives him too great of an advantage. We&rsquo;ll see everyone&rsquo;s professional ability!&rdquo; Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if everyone is able to adjust, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they can beat Ye Xiu if they meet! With his current win streak, even if he loses the next few rounds, there&rsquo;s a good chance that no one can surpass his 1v1 record,&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need someone to hurry and break his consecutive win record first!&rdquo; Li Yibo laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s watch Li Hua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two characters loaded onto the map. This was Happy&rsquo;s home game, so of course Ye Xiu was the one choosing the map. He had already chosen all of the maps with nothing on them, so this time he had to pick one with some terrain features.</p>
<p>This time, Ye Xiu chose the Hillside map. It was still flat with no barriers or obstacles, but the flat surface was slightly tilted, which of course would cause some changes.</p>
<p>The two characters spawned at the two ends of the map, at the same height. Since this was a map with no barriers, the two of course wouldn&rsquo;t try any strategic maneuvers. They both charged straight ahead, at the same time staring at the opponent&rsquo;s position. There was much strategy involved in choosing a position to stand on the Hillside map. Because there was a slope, this would affect many skills and movements like jumping and rolling. To seize the high or the low ground, this was a question that had to be considered.</p>
<p>The two players were both paying attention to this, so they both stayed at the same elevation, neither one gaining an advantage. Ye Xiu didn&rsquo;t launch an attack as soon as he was in range. Lord Grim continued to rush forward all the way until he was in the Ninja&rsquo;s attack range, but even then, Li Hua didn&rsquo;t control Dark Forest to attack, either.</p>
<p>Shining Cut!</p>
<p>Lord Grim suddenly swept forward with his blade, instantly springing forward and greatly reducing the distance between the two.</p>
<p>Li Hua was no longer quiet. Dark Forest waved his hand and a Shuriken was sent flying toward Lord Grim. Next, his two hands were already rapidly forming seals, preparing the next step of attack.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu &ndash; Shadow Dance!</p>
<p>This powerful Level 70 attack saw increasing direct use among Ninjas. It could be used as a main attack, or to hide movements and confuse the opponent. In any case, with a Shadow Dance, a Ninja suddenly had many options available. It didn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be used as a pure attack skill.</p>
<p>Immediately, over a dozen Dark Forests charged at Lord Grim together. As the number one Ninja in Glory, his mastery over this powerful Ninja skill didn&rsquo;t need to be mentioned. The live broadcast cut to Li Hua&rsquo;s camera view, which was constantly switching. It was clear the Li Hua was jumping nonstop between clones to achieve the best possible control over them. The fourteen shadow clones formed an impressive array to surround Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Chapter 1213: A Continuously Updating Record</p>
<p>Pu!</p>
<p>A cloud of purple smoke exploded, and Lord Grim disappeared into it. Facing Dark Forest&rsquo;s Shadow Dance, Ye Xiu had Lord Grim surprisingly throw down the Ninja skill, Smoke Bomb, to counter it.</p>
<p>However, the purple smoke was only a cover; it didn&rsquo;t allow him to turn invisible. Dark Forest&rsquo;s shadow clones charged into the smoke. Li Hua switched his viewpoint around even faster. The purple smoke only lowered his visibility, it didn&rsquo;t make him blind. With so many shadow clones and so many eyes, Li Hua kept on switching between clones until he found Lord Grim soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Li Hua was calm. All of his shadow clones gathered into one spot and marched forward together.</p>
<p>Numerous ninja blades stabbed towards Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Hit!</p>
<p>Surrounded on all sides, Lord Grim had no way of dodging, and the numerous blades pierced into Lord Grim. However, Lord Grim poofed into smoke and became one with the surrounding purple fog.</p>
<p>Shadow Clone Technique!</p>
<p>Li Hua reacted. If not for the Smoke Bomb affecting his vision, with his skill as the Number One Ninja, he could easily distinguish between a fake and a real body. However, he had fallen for it. All of his clones had gathered into one spot, but their attacks only hit a clone.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s his real body?</p>
<p>A purple shadow flashed out from the purple smoke. Because of the closeness in color, the shadow could only be seen by relying on the disturbances in the flow of the smoke.</p>
<p>Witch Skill: Night Cloak.</p>
<p>The group of Dark Forest clones were bound together by the Night Cloak.</p>
<p>Earthquake Sword!</p>
<p>The earth tumbled in the smoke, and a Spellblade Earthquake Sword swept over the bundled together Dark Forest shadow clones, rocking them wildly. A grenade rolled over.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The grenade exploded and the shadow clones poofed one after the other. These clones didn&rsquo;t have much health. After taking heavy damage, they faded away. Lord Grim could finally be seen. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella extended outwards, curving at the top &ndash; an Exorcist&rsquo;s scythe.</p>
<p>Rising Emblem!</p>
<p>A blue ring of light floated above the ground, and the remaining shadow clones rose into the air. Lord Grim rushed forward, sweeping at them with his scythe. The frail shadow clones instantly disappeared. The only one remaining was Dark Forest&rsquo;s real body.</p>
<p>Collapsing Mountain!</p>
<p>The attacks didn&rsquo;t stop as Lord Grim swung his blade.</p>
<p>Li Hua didn&rsquo;t dare fight head on. Dark Forest quickly formed a hand seal and then disappeared.</p>
<p>There was no substitute straw nor a shadow clone left behind, yet to suddenly disappear could only mean&hellip;</p>
<p>With a Collapsing Mountain to quickly drop to the ground, Ye Xiu didn&rsquo;t pause, immediately having Lord Grim leap backwards.</p>
<p>Dark Forest drilled out of the ground, Underground Tunneling Technique.</p>
<p>Lord Grim had leapt backwards, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be enough. However, the sword in his hands suddenly pointed in front of him.</p>
<p>Falling Light Blade!</p>
<p>Lord Grim didn&rsquo;t dodge. When he jumped back, he readied this skill, timing it so that it would clash with Dark Forest&rsquo;s ninja blade.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Dark Forest tumbled back, while Lord Grim was left hanging in the air.</p>
<p>Storm Shuriken!</p>
<p>Dark Forest didn&rsquo;t wait to stand up and threw a Storm Shuriken at Lord Grim.</p>
<p>A sword light flashed. A Sword Draw accurately connected with the Storm Shuriken.</p>
<p>However, the word Storm indicated this shuriken&rsquo;s might. It wasn&rsquo;t something a Sword Draw outpriotized. Storm Shuriken broke through the Sword Draw and stubborn continued onwards.</p>
<p>Moonlight, Full Moonlight Slash.</p>
<p>Two beautiful arcs and two clear rings. Lord Grim quickly used the Ghostblade&rsquo;s two combo slash, and with these three consecutive skills, he was able to knock down the Storm Shuriken.</p>
<p>Lord Grim was still in the air. Dark Forest stood up and attacked.</p>
<p>Ninjutsu &ndash; Flickering Pursuit.</p>
<p>The difficult-to-see shadow arrived in front of Lord Grim in the blink of an eye. One attack, hit. His shadow flickered, and he appeared behind Lord Grim. Another attack&hellip;</p>
<p>Third hit!</p>
<p>Dark Forest&rsquo;s Silver weapon, Sixteen Dark Nights, stabbed silently without light. But this time, the blade didn&rsquo;t strike the body. Lord Grim had grabbed it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t possible to do such fine movements through normal inputs, which meant it was a skill.</p>
<p>Back Throw!</p>
<p>Dark Forest&rsquo;s head crashed into the ground. Li Hua was dumbstruck. He was in disbelief. To be able to grab someone in the middle of Body Pathway Derangement, what type of judgement and mechanical skill did he have?</p>
<p>After falling to the ground, Dark Forest was stepped on by Lord Grim, who fired at his head repeatedly, Punisher!</p>
<p>Dark Forest immediately rolled in an attempt to get up and Lord Grim also jumped back, but Lord Grim was prepared for his roll.</p>
<p>Long ranged attacks used at close range were too fast to dodge.</p>
<p>Dark Forest, who was in mid-roll, was unable to dodge Lord Grim&rsquo;s bullet and was hit.</p>
<p>The damage wasn&rsquo;t high, but&hellip; it stunned. This was a Spitfire&rsquo;s Stun Bullet. Lord Grim calmly chased after him and started attacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsk&hellip;&rdquo; the commentator Pan Lin sighed, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unspecialized&rsquo;s skill options really make it difficult to defend against!&rdquo; Li Yibo said. &ldquo;He has too many similar skills at his disposal. For example, knockup skills, knockback skills, charge skills, skills that every class possesses. However, these classes usually just have one or two of these skills, but he has access to all of them. Just take knockup skills. Every class can get 4 low-leveled ones, but he gets 24. The available options that he has is too much. For the average player, just these 24 knockup skills is enough to juggle them in the air endlessly until death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve never seen him play like that.&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;s playing against pro players, after all. They shouldn&rsquo;t be getting juggled to death. I didn&rsquo;t raise this example to talk about this though. I&rsquo;m pointing out that with so many options, he has practically no cooldowns because most of the time, he can find a similar skill to substitute what he wants. Low-level skills have short cooldowns too. This one&rsquo;s on cooldown, but that one is off cooldown,&rdquo; Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, we understand Coach Li&rsquo;s reasoning. In reality, it isn&rsquo;t his class that&rsquo;s crucial, but the weapon in his hands. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella eliminates the cooldown required for switching weapons, allowing him to freely use whatever class skills he wants,&rdquo; Pan Li said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip; without the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, it&rsquo;s not possible to play in this way.&rdquo; Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>The discussion going on between these two wasn&rsquo;t anything new. Ye Xiu already had eleven consecutive wins. These problems could be seen in each of his wins. Fortunately, Happy&rsquo;s matches weren&rsquo;t always the broadcasted highlight matches. If not, this discussion would be repeated so many times that the viewers would have insects crawling out of their ears.</p>
<p>The Stun Bullet into comboed Li Hua found an opening and used Substitution Technique to escape. But right when he turned around, he saw that Lord Grim was already in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; Li Yibo yelled, &ldquo;Charge, Shining Cut, and then Colliding Stab, what class can use so many movement skills in a row! The distance gained by Dark Forest using Substitution Technique should have completely safe against any class, but Lord Grim was able to use three high-speed movement skills to instantly close the gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pu!</p>
<p>While Li Yibo was chattering, Dark Forest was pierced through by Lord Grim&rsquo;s Colliding Stab and then with a fling, Dark Forest crashed into the mountain wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigh, there&rsquo;s no suspense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This map indeed isn&rsquo;t very suitable for Ninjas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye Xiu is also very cunning. All the maps that he chooses force the other side to have a direct fight with him, however, none of his opponents can defend against the unspecialized&rsquo;s offensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t met another God yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, the Gods are always the anchors in the group arena&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pan Lin were already declaring this as Ye Xiu&rsquo;s victory ahead of time. Reality proved their predictions true. In the end, Li Hua was unable to stop Ye Xiu from continuing with his record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;12 consecutive wins&hellip;&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy won the first round of the individual competition. Ye Xiu&rsquo;s 12 consecutive wins was added to Glory&rsquo;s history books. Not only was he setting this record, he was continuously updating it. Just like what Pan Lin sighed, &ldquo;How many consecutive wins is he going to stop at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Ye Xiu, Happy&rsquo;s Ninja, Mo Fan, went on stage. The map that he chose was incomparably complex. Deception appeared and disappeared like the gods and devils, eventually grinding down the opponent to death. His victory wasn&rsquo;t easy though. In two of his ambushes, the other side was the one who controlled the flow, especially the second time. He was almost burst to death. At this moment, Mo Fan&rsquo;s reason for choosing a Ninja showed. Smoke Bomb, Substitution Technique, Shadow Clone Technique, Ninjas had quite a few escape skills.</p>
<p>After Mo Fan was Su Mucheng. Her artillery fire helped Happy win another match, completing the individual competition with a clean 3 to 0. The strong team Misty Rain seemed unable to stop Happy&rsquo;s recent momentum, which annoyed those like Ruan Cheng who wanted to ridicule Happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys are playing well!&rdquo; Boss Chen Guo led the applause, celebrating their three wins in the individual competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, next up, watch us!&rdquo; Fang Rui stood up and shouted. He often went on stage in the group arena appearing as the lead of the group arena.</p>
<p>Under Fang Rui&rsquo;s lead, Happy won another 2 points in the group arena.</p>
<p>The crowd cheered. Happy was on its way to a 10-0! The map chosen for the team competition was more important, which also meant that the home team had a greater advantage. As Happy improved, their teamwork was becoming better and better. With the individual competition and group arena won, the fans were very confident for the team competition.</p>
<p>The players going up for the team competition were all actively preparing for it, whether that be calming their emotions or stretching their shoulders and fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; Ye Xiu suddenly asked the person next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you joking?&rdquo; Wei Chen turned his head as if he had heard the greatest joke of the century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Ye Xiu chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any cigarettes? Hand me one,&rdquo; Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoking is prohibited&hellip;&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigh, back then was the best&hellip; now we can&rsquo;t even smoke.&rdquo; Wei Chen looked up at the spacious stadium. When he had been competing, there hadn&rsquo;t been such beautiful stadiums nor had there been so many rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Ye Xiu patted his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this old man, this match will be a piece of cake!&rdquo; Wei Chen said, standing.</p>
<p>Chapter 1214: Observer Wei Chen</p>
<p>The players sent up for the team competition walked onto the stage.</p>
<p>Happy &ndash; Ye Xiu, Su Mucheng, Tang Rou, Wei Chen, Fang Rui.</p>
<p>Misty Rain &ndash; Chu Yunxiu, Li Hua, Shu Kexin, Shu Keyi, Feng Xiangming, Bai Qi.</p>
<p>Misty Rain&rsquo;s lineup for the team competition was rather unusual. Their team composition consisted of an Elementalist, Ninja, two Sharpshooters, and a Cleric.</p>
<p>Over the course of Glory history, all sorts of systematic analysis and experimentation had been done. In the early days, there had even been five Blade Master team comps, but these types of team comps quickly faded away. According to the current Glory meta, a team composition should have at least a melee class, a long-ranged class, and a healer with two other classes to build on this base.</p>
<p>But in Misty Rain&rsquo;s team comp, their melee classes weren&rsquo;t pure melee. Whether it was Taijutsu Sharpshooters or a both long and close ranged Ninja, none of these classes were true melee classes, yet this unconventional team composition was Misty Rain&rsquo;s main force. Their tactics revolved around this team comp.</p>
<p>According to past data, Misty Rain&rsquo;s team comp didn&rsquo;t seem to be reliable. Facing strong teams, their team had yet to win a single match. They had even lost their home game against Team 301, a team considered weaker than them.</p>
<p>even those who won, never expressed their disapproval of Misty Rain&rsquo;s innovative tactics. The one with the most persuasiveness was Team Tyranny&rsquo;s Master Tactician, Zhang Xinjie. In their 6-4 match against Misty Rain, Tyranny had lost their points in the individual competition and group arena, but in the post-match press conference, Zhang Xinjie focused more on Misty Rain&rsquo;s performance in the team competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very flexible with lots of variations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Zhang Xinjie&rsquo;s evaluation of Misty Rain&rsquo;s team comp and playstyle. It was very simple, only six words, but was just how Zhang Xinjie spoke. Everyone knew that Zhang Xinjie would never talk about anything without reason. He might not say that something was nine, but if he said it, then it was definitely nine, and not eight or ten.</p>
<p>As a result, Misty Rain&rsquo;s team comp and playstyle led to quite a bit of discussion.</p>
<p>Tactics were never secrets because you had to use them on stage for everyone to see. Thus, many tactics were common among everyone. The difference between strong teams and weak teams was an issue of a team&rsquo;s execution.</p>
<p>The analysis and discussion towards Misty Rain&rsquo;s tactics leaned towards the positive side, which meant their rather poor win record was because of their execution. After all, this was the first season Misty Rain started running this playstyle. They needed time to practice and familiarize themselves with it.</p>
<p>Every opponent each round was a sharpening stone for Misty Rain. However, no team was willing to become their stepping stone. Happy wasn&rsquo;t willing either.</p>
<p>Happy had carefully discussed and analyzed Misty Rain&rsquo;s playstyle in their prepwork. In the end, they arranged this team lineup to counter it. Wei Chen would be appearing for his first time in the team competition in Round 12. His Warlock was undoubtedly a crucial part to Happy&rsquo;s strategy.</p>
<p>Wei Chen, who was sitting in the player booth, wasn&rsquo;t calm. The stadium and the seats, none of these were the same as when he had played competitively back then. Even though he was an experienced old general, in reality, he was new to the modern Glory competition. The seat under his butt felt uncomfortable and the sealed player booth felt stuffy.</p>
<p>A cigarette would be great&hellip; Wei Chen thought to himself, but when he looked around the interior of the player booth, he could clearly see a sign prohibiting smoking. Fuck, this senior won&rsquo;t smoke, but just dangling a cigarette in my mouth is fine, right? Wei Chen felt indignant. He felt out a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth.</p>
<p>The five second countdown passed, and the two teams loaded into the map.</p>
<p>The map was Mud River Peninsula and was split into four sections, linked together by a narrow piece of land. The separation between these four sections could be crossed; they were just a collection of small or large swamps. The center of the map also had a circular swamp. Characters could go into the swamps and not receive damage, but their movement speed would be slowed by 70%. This map was clearly a restrictive map. Apart from the swamps, there were lots of trees that could be used for protection. Happy had clearly chosen this map to restrict Misty Rain&rsquo;s long-ranged classes.</p>
<p>Happy loaded into the northwest corner of the peninsula, while Misty Rain loaded into the southeast corner.</p>
<p>Wei Chen sucked in a deep breath and had Windward Formation set out according to the strategy the team had prepared.</p>
<p>Team Happy&rsquo;s five players split up into three groups as they moved forward. Tang Rou, Su Mucheng, and An Wenyi went straight ahead, while Ye Xiu and Wei Chen circled around from the left and right.</p>
<p>The middle group moved more slowly to match the pace of the two circling from the left and right. The three groups were constantly updating each other with their positions as they advanced.</p>
<p>The team competition maps were much larger than the 1v1 maps, but that didn&rsquo;t mean the two sides would take a long time to find each other. The middle group were gradually starting to see the circular swamps in the central region appearing within their sight, but they were intentionally slowing their pace, so since they had yet to see Misty Rain, they knew that Misty Rain took a roundabout path.</p>
<p>The middle group informed Ye Xiu and Wei Chen, the two on their left and right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, they&rsquo;re on my side&hellip;&rdquo; Wei Chen had been just about to notify them!</p>
<p>Windward Formation was hiding in a shrub on the side. Misty Rain&rsquo;s five characters hadn&rsquo;t scattered and were concentrated in one place, preparing to traverse through the swamps to directly cut across to the southwest region. If they moved along the swamp line, they would get to the rear of Happy.</p>
<p>Too bad they&rsquo;ve been found by this senior.</p>
<p>Wei Chen peeped at them, while delightedly plotting what he should do next. If Happy had been together, then ambushing them while Misty Rain was traversing through the swamps would be the most optimal choice, but since he was alone&hellip;</p>
<p>Wei Chen hesitated.</p>
<p>Even though his Windward Formation had an abnormally long range, that was only relative to his class. Misty Rain had two Sharpshooters, whose natural attack ranges were above Mages. Even with Windward Formation&rsquo;s increased cast range from his weapon Death&rsquo;s Hand, he had no advantage over these two Sharpshooters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misty Rain is forcefully traversing through the swamps. Do you guys think I should attack or not&hellip;&rdquo; Unsure of what to do, Wei Chen asked for the opinion of his teammates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have two Sharpshooters. You won&rsquo;t be able to suppress them!&rdquo; Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealthily place a Death&rsquo;s Door to their side?&rdquo; Wei Chen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Windy Rain&rsquo;s spells will instantly blow it up,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Stealthily placing a Death&rsquo;s Door was a concept that only existed among the normal players. Death&rsquo;s Door made a huge disturbance when cast and required the caster to control it. Pro players could easily deduce the enemy Warlock&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll prepare an ambush at the Half Moon Rock in the 9 o&rsquo;clock position, while you go back on your original path and cut to their rear,&rdquo; Ye Xiu replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably&hellip; about a minute away from the Half Moon Rock, assuming that they directly move in that direction,&rdquo; Wei Chen calculated from Misty Rain&rsquo;s movement speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s enough time. Are you fine?&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problems here,&rdquo; Wei Chen replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t appear in front of them too early,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hahaha, hilarious,&rdquo; Wei Chen replied. He didn&rsquo;t hurry to move his Windward Formation into position. He continued to crouch inside the bush, watching as Misty Rain&rsquo;s five players moved through the swamp towards the southwest corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve passed through.&rdquo; After Wei Chen sent the message, Windward Formation finally left the brush.</p>
<p>Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Situated at the link between the northwest and southwest region, Tang Rou&rsquo;s Soft Mist leaned on the outer edge of the rock with her spear propped up. In just one step, she could launch an attack on any passing characters. Su Mucheng&rsquo;s Dancing Rain leaped to a spot three-quarters of the way up the Half Moon Rock. In one jump, she would be able to reach the top of the rock, letting her suppress the enemies with her firepower from the high ground. An Wenyi&rsquo;s Little Cold Hands didn&rsquo;t need to find an attacking position. He just moved into a position between the two characters to support them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three players each confirmed that they had reached their chosen positions.</p>
<p>Would they succeed in ambushing Misty Rain?</p>
<p>The suspense was unfolding before them. The live crowd and the viewers watching the broadcast waited for the moment to happen.</p>
<p>After Team Misty Rain crossed through the swamp, their movement speed returned to normal, and they quickly advanced forward. Soon, the Half Moon Rock was within their sights. Wei Chen&rsquo;s Windward Formation reached this area one step ahead of them. He once again found an ambush spot in a shrub by the road and observed Team Misty Rain&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve slowed down. They&rsquo;re probably wary of the Half Moon Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve changed direction. They&rsquo;re not heading towards Half Moon Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, they&rsquo;re coming my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re the bait! Go lure them into our ambush!&rdquo; Ye Xiu made a firm decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How evil.&rdquo; Wei Chen cursed, but he also approved of this decision. Windward Formation suddenly scurried out of the bush.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Lower Your Head, None Dare Attack!</p>
<p>Having changed from male to female characters through a backdoor, the Shu sisters immediately fired at Windward Formation.</p>
<p>Windward Formation rolled and crawled frantically, moving in a beautiful S path.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>An incomparably powerful sounding gunshot sounded.</p>
<p>Lower Your Head directly mounted Thunder Snipe and fired a heavy shot amidst None Dare Attack&rsquo;s rain of bullets.</p>
<p>Windward Formation wasn&rsquo;t able to avoid the snipe. Blood spurted from his wound. Both person and blood tumbled forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fierce&hellip;&rdquo; Wei Chen didn&rsquo;t forget to give a remark when he was hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up the good work,&rdquo; Ye Xiu encouraged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the fuck are you?&rdquo; Wei Chen asked. Ye Xiu wasn&rsquo;t among the ones who confirmed they were in position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to help you at any moment,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>Wei Chen turned around to look. Misty Rain had started speeding up, looking as if they wouldn&rsquo;t rest until he died. The two Sharpshooters shot a hail of bullets, putting Wei Chen&rsquo;s reactions to the test. Windward Formation was instantly hit by several bullets.</p>
<p>Fuck, if this was ten years ago&hellip;</p>
<p>Wei Chen&rsquo;s reaction speed and mechanical skill weren&rsquo;t able to keep up. He suddenly realized that he might not be able to complete his mission as bait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Wei Chen immediately called for help.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain leaped onto the top of Half Moon Rock, propped up her heavy cannon, and started firing!</p>
<p>Chapter 1215: Suppression From Map and Skill</p>
<p>Explosive artillery fire headed straight towards the center of Misty Rain&rsquo;s formation. The AoE covered by her attacks could not be ignored. The five Misty Rain players immediately had their characters dodge, instantly pulling their formation apart. They weren&rsquo;t planning on giving Su Mucheng an opportunity to burst them all at once.</p>
<p>As the Misty Rain players avoided the artillery fire, they didn&rsquo;t loosen their attacks towards Windward Formation. They seemed to have no intention of firing back at Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>As a result, Su Mucheng also switched targets. Her dazzling artillery barrage fired towards Windward Formation.</p>
<p>Everyone was struck dumb.</p>
<p>Windward Formation wouldn&rsquo;t take damage from his ally&rsquo;s attacks, and the light from the artillery fire made his figure flicker, appearing and disappearing intermittently. This was Zhang Jiale&rsquo;s famous Hundred Blossoms style.</p>
<p>Team Misty Rain was suddenly unable to effectively locate and attack Windward Formation. The Shu sisters immediately switched targets, and their bullets fired towards Dancing Rain at the top of the Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng didn&rsquo;t retreat. Dancing Rain only dodged the necessary incoming attacks, while taking the attacks that wouldn&rsquo;t affect her much. At the same time, a white light glowed around her. Little Cold Hands, who was hiding behind the Half Moon Rock, had started doing his work.</p>
<p>Without any danger of being attacked and only needing to focus his healing on Dancing Rain, An Wenyi&rsquo;s weaknesses were completely covered up. Under these conditions, An Wenyi&rsquo;s healing displayed an extremely high level of skill. Dancing Rain&rsquo;s health was maintained at a steady state.</p>
<p>Dancing Rain continued to provide cover for Windward Formation.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu realized that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>With the Shu sisters switching targets, Windward Formation was no longer under any pressure. Thus, Su Mucheng could easily switch targets too, yet why was she still protecting Windward Formation?</p>
<p>Absolute Focus!</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu immediately had her Windy Rain activate a skill. Just when she was about to cast a high-level spell, Windy Rain was suddenly entrapped by an array of light. All of her skill icons turned gray, meaning they could not be used.</p>
<p>Spell Shackle!</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu was startled. This was an Elementalist skill. If it had come from the enemy team, then it could only have been from their unspecialized, Lord Grim, and his Myriad Manifestation Umbrella&rsquo;s mage form.</p>
<p>Where was Lord Grim?</p>
<p>Spell Shackle was a silence. It did not stop her character from moving. Chu Yunxiu whirled around, but she couldn&rsquo;t see any signs of Lord Grim.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one possibility&hellip;</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu&rsquo;s gaze locked onto the dazzling light created by Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>The flickering of the light created a facade, falsely making it seem like the covered target was moving. In reality, Windward Formation might not be moving and might actually be casting some sort of powerful spell. Lord Grim had entered the light cover as well and sealed her attacks with a Spell Shackle. His intentions were obviously to protect Windward Formation&hellip;</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu instantly read and understood Happy&rsquo;s strategic intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Focus your fire onto Windward Formation!&rdquo; Unable to attack, she immediately sent down a command in their team channel.</p>
<p>The Shu sisters didn&rsquo;t really understand why they should, but they followed their captain&rsquo;s orders. The two Sharpshooters switched fire back to Windward Formation, but where was he positioned at? The two weren&rsquo;t able to accurately grasp his location.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu felt a bad premonition in her heart. Although the Sharpshooters attacked fast, their coverage was small since they didn&rsquo;t have any AoE skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter!&rdquo; At this moment, she could only take precautionary measures. Windward Formation was most likely casting a spell such as Death&rsquo;s Door.</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu&rsquo;s prediction was absolutely correct. At this moment, an evil aura condensed into Death&rsquo;s Door right in the center of Misty Rain&rsquo;s formation.</p>
<p>The light screen from Dancing Rain&rsquo;s Hundred Blossoms style suddenly dimmed. Misty Rain&rsquo;s players could now see that inside this light screen, Lord Grim had his Myriad Manifestations Umbrella open, shielding Windward Formation.</p>
<p>How did he suddenly get there? It had to be from some instant movement skill like Shadow Clone Technique. But the issue wasn&rsquo;t the process, but rather the result.</p>
<p>Death&rsquo;s Door had been summoned, and it was now starting its work. Black tendrils extended out of the door, grabbing towards Misty Rain&rsquo;s five players.</p>
<p>Yes, five!</p>
<p>Chu Yunxiu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scatter!&rdquo; had been too late. Everyone in Misty Rain was still inside Death&rsquo;s Door&rsquo;s range.</p>
<p>Some were still closer than others though.</p>
<p>Shu Keyi&rsquo;s Lower Your Head stepped back a few times and reached the safe zone. She was the farthest away, being able to escape from the Death&rsquo;s Door with just a few steps. The closest was Li Hua&rsquo;s Dark Forest. However, Ninjas had the most escape skills out of any class! Substitution Technique into Shadow Clone Technique into the Assassin&rsquo;s high speed dash, Shining Cut, Dark Forest was the second to escape.</p>
<p>The remaining three were in a more difficult situation. Being farther away from the safe area than Shu Keyi, their characters weren&rsquo;t able to escape so quickly. All of them were running away and dodging for their lives!</p>
<p>Interrupt Death&rsquo;s Door!</p>
<p>This was the first thing that popped into Shu Keyi&rsquo;s mind. However, Lord Grim&rsquo;s Myriad Manifestation Umbrella being wide open like that was rather discouraging. Shu Keyi tried moving around to adjust Lower Your Head&rsquo;s attack angle, but unfortunately, this wasn&rsquo;t something that could be done in an instant. If she moved left, she would be blocked by the Half Moon Rock. If she moved right, she would be inside Death&rsquo;s Door&rsquo;s range, and she obviously couldn&rsquo;t force her way into there. And if she circled around, by the time she got into position, Death&rsquo;s Door would already be over.</p>
<p>Helpless, Shu Keyi discovered that while she had escaped, there was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>This&hellip;</p>
<p>This had to be planned!</p>
<p>Being able to escape so easily yet unable to attack Windward Formation, Shu Keyi felt like this wasn&rsquo;t luck. This was the enemy team fully utilizing the map and their skills to meticulously squeeze the amount of space available to maneuver.</p>
<p>Li Hua, the second to escape from Death&rsquo;s Door, was in an even more awkward position. He wanted to hurry and break Windward Formation&rsquo;s spell, but he was suddenly in the same predicament as Shu Keyi.</p>
<p>They could only watch as their teammates struggled to escape from Death&rsquo;s Door, while they seemed to be stuck in a crack, unable to move even a single step.</p>
<p>Even if I can&rsquo;t interrupt him, I can&rsquo;t just do nothing!</p>
<p>Li Hua&rsquo;s Dark Forest shot to the left and leapt onto Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>The Number One Ninja&rsquo;s ninjato skills were undoubtedly extremely high. Watching Dark Forest&rsquo;s agility, quickness, and fluidity was a sight to enjoy. The crowd couldn&rsquo;t help but wish that there was no top to reach.</p>
<p>Happy wished for that too, but unfortunately, that wasn&rsquo;t reality. Dark Forest quickly scaled Half Moon Rock, heading towards Dancing Rain.</p>
<p>Facing melee attacks, Dancing Rain could not forcefully take the hits like before. After all, she was a Launcher, a long-ranged class. If the harassment was enough to mess up her aim, then it was equivalent to her being suppressed.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng immediately used Aerial Fire, and Dancing Rain jumped off of Half Moon Rock. Li Hua didn&rsquo;t stop to rest. Dark Forest jumped in midair, attacking Dancing Rain with Flickering Pursuit. But just before he did this, he threw a Shuriken. His target, Windward Formation!</p>
<p>Jumping over the Half Moon Rock, Li Hua found an angle at which he could avoid the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella&rsquo;s shield and directly attack Windward Formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! Too beautiful!&rdquo; the commentator, Pan Lin, yelled in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, outstanding,&rdquo; Li Yibo followed up. Of course, he had to expound on it. &ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s tactical formation is quite remarkable. The two who escaped from Death&rsquo;s Door were stuck between Half Moon Rock and Death&rsquo;s Door, unable to interrupt Windward Formation&rsquo;s cast. Unfortunately, they ignored a point. For Li Hua&rsquo;s Dark Forest, Half Moon Rock can&rsquo;t be considered a cover. Even though it required a bit more time, Li Hua was able to successfully break through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brilliant play,&rdquo; Pan Lin continued to give praise.</p>
<p>As the two praised, the Body Pathway Derangement struck Dancing Rain multiple times, and that Shuriken was more than enough. While it&rsquo;s true that Lord Grim could turn his umbrella around and block it, an opening at the front would appear, and the three escaping from Death&rsquo;s Door definitely wouldn&rsquo;t miss such an opportunity.</p>
<p>Death&rsquo;s Door, interrupted!</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was Happy&rsquo;s home stadium. If not, the cheers and applause from the crowd would have shaken the stadium. The commentators, Pan Lin and Li Yibo, continued to praise Li Hua. As for Li Hua, he discovered that below, Ye Xiu&rsquo;s Lord Grim was running back, waiting for him. Soft Mist, who was hiding behind Half Moon Rock, suddenly charged out, not towards his Dark Forest, but away from the Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Li Hua turned around. To Dark Forest&rsquo;s back was Half Moon Rock. He was completely cut off. He had no idea what the situation behind him was.</p>
<p>Li Hua was startled. Seeing Lord Grim, who had been ready for him, he realized that he had made a mistake.</p>
<p>He had been lured away from his team, and with how the enemy team was prepared for him, they didn&rsquo;t seem to be planning on letting him go back so easily.</p>
<p>This was the enemy team&rsquo;s true goal.</p>
<p>Li Hua understood now. He knew that the effect of him leaving the group was extremely large. Misty Rain&rsquo;s tactics revolved around him. Their team composition consisted of mainly long-ranged classes. Without him filling in the gap, their tactics were useless.</p>
<p>Shit&hellip;</p>
<p>Li Hua looked at Lord Grim, who didn&rsquo;t wait for Dark Forest to land before starting his attacks.</p>
<p>I have to hurry up and get away. Li Hua thought to himself. Then, he heard a crackle as Dark Forest was suddenly lit on fire.</p>
<p>Sacred Fire?</p>
<p>Li Hua watched in astonishment as his skill icons turned gray.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t seen any indication of the fire. This meant that the other side had precisely calculated Dark Forest&rsquo;s fall speed. The instant Sacred Fire burned, Dark Forest would land directly into it.</p>
<p>What type of calculative ability and mastery of timing is this?</p>
<p>Li Hua turned his gaze toward the rear of Half Moon Rock at the Cleric, who had always been viewed as weak.</p>
<p>Chapter 1216: Dark Forest Rock Climbing</p>
<p>This Sacred Fire sealed all of Dark Forest&rsquo;s skills, while simultaneously gluing the mouths of Pan Lin and Li Yibo shut.</p>
<p>Just a second ago, they had been wantonly praising Li Hua&rsquo;s brilliant play, and now the two suddenly stopped talking.</p>
<p>If the two failed to realize Happy&rsquo;s tactical arrangements by now, the two weren&rsquo;t qualified to be professionals. Their awareness towards the situation was more sensitive than the vast majority of people, but they got it wrong and were now in a difficult position.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other in the eye, too embarrassed to say anything.</p>
<p>Li Hua might have been the key to victory, but&hellip; he was the key to Happy&rsquo;s victory, not Misty Rain&rsquo;s. He had fallen into Happy&rsquo;s trap.</p>
<p>The effects of this trap quickly emerged.</p>
<p>Tang Rou&rsquo;s Soft Mist entered the fray and charged towards Team Misty Rain. Wei Chen&rsquo;s Windward Formation didn&rsquo;t flee either, attacking from the sides. Su Mucheng&rsquo;s Dancing Rain bombarded them as well. These two were both using Screen Cannon tactics, coordinating with both sides, attacking here while also helping Ye Xiu over there.</p>
<p>Without Li Hua, the rest of Team Misty Rain was thrown into disorder. Although the three long-ranged classes had fierce offensive prowess, facing Soft Mist&rsquo;s unwavering push, their formation was forced to scatter. Their teamwork was having trouble flowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weaknesses in Misty Rain&rsquo;s tactics have been exposed&hellip;&rdquo; Li Yibo began commentating. He directly jumped to the current situation as if his previous mistake in praising Li Hua weren&rsquo;t his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Pan Lin followed along with Li Yibo&rsquo;s pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li Hua needs to hurry and get back to the others,&rdquo; Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s being pressed hard by Ye Xiu,&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he just lost to Ye Xiu in the individual competition. He doesn&rsquo;t have the mental advantage in a 1v1. What&rsquo;s more, Ye Xiu is also receiving assistance from Su Mucheng and Wei Chen,&rdquo; Li Yibo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Ninjas have the advantage, if they&rsquo;re only looking to escape,&rdquo; Pan Lin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. However, since Happy had this planned out beforehand, then they should have countermeasures prepared. I think Ye Xiu is quite confident that he can force Li Hua to stay here,&rdquo; Li Yibo gradually started waving his banner towards Happy, stealthily reconstructing his image of having acute foresight.</p>
<p>As the two spoke, the Sacred Fire on Dark Forest wore off, but it hadn&rsquo;t been very long since he escaped from Death&rsquo;s Door. The Assassin skill, Shining Cut, could be used again, but his other escape skills such as Substitution Technique and Shadow Clone Technique were still on cooldown, and Li Hua didn&rsquo;t know whether he had the time to wait for them to refresh.</p>
<p>Lord Grim&rsquo;s offensive was ferocious. Su Mucheng and Wei Chen would also help from time to time. In fact, most of their attention was focused on this side. They were only coordinating with Tang Rou to help harass and restrain the other side.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
<p>Li Hua quickly came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>Underground Tunneling Technique!</p>
<p>Li Hua used this skill regardless of the timing. In response, Lord Grim jumped away and blasted the ground.</p>
<p>Dark Forest tunneled to below Half Moon Rock. He had used this skill as an underground movement technique. Although the distance he moved wasn&rsquo;t far, it was enough for him to reach Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Li Hua leaped up and stabbed his ninjato into the rock. Dark Forest began quickly scaling Half Moon rock.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang! Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The gunfire behind him echoed. Lord Grim chased after him with long-ranged attacks, and Dancing Rain had shifted her attention over too.</p>
<p>Li Hua could not just simply move upwards. His movements would be too predictable. As a result, Dark Forest leapt left and right on Half Moon Rock, adding in many irregular horizontal movements as he climbed to make it harder for the enemy side to catch him.</p>
<p>Li Hua prayed that he played well. At this moment, Lord Grim dashed to below Half Moon Rock and jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh..&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd made all sorts of astonished noises.</p>
<p>Lord Grim leaped up and took out a knife&hellip; the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella also had a ninjato form. Their skilled climbing made the crowd curious: Li Hua or Ye Xiu, who was faster?</p>
<p>In this situation, Ye Xiu was obviously faster because he had no obstructions. He could simply move upwards in a straight line. On the other hand, Li Hua needed to dodge attacks and add in horizontal movements. And because Dancing Rain&rsquo;s attacks were AoE, his horizontal movements had to be fairly large, further increasing the amount of distance Dark Forest needed to move.</p>
<p>In practically the blink of an eye, Ye Xiu&rsquo;s Lord Grim reached Dark Forest&rsquo;s height.</p>
<p>Li Hua&rsquo;s heart froze. Today, his heart kept freezing. His heart was going to be frozen stiff at this rate.</p>
<p>He could only clench his teeth and persevere through. He started moving horizontally even more, but because he had to dodge Lord Grim, his movements were much easier to predict for Su Mucheng. As a result, Li Hua had no choice but to start making circular movements. He clearly wanted to get over Half Moon Rock as fast as possible, but in order to do so, he needed to climb downwards from time to time.</p>
<p>Li Hua wanted to cry, but a short moment later, he suddenly realized that at this rate, he could just circle over the Half Moon Rock from the side&hellip;</p>
<p>Being forced to do this was quite tragic, but it was a feasible solution!</p>
<p>Li Hua continued to work hard at it. Suddenly, he heard a motor sound from behind him. He turned around to look and saw Lord Grim flying over with Rotor Wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usually gentle and quiet Li Hua cursed loudly. He was truly under a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>Lord Grim flew in front of him and stabbed a ninjato into the Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Attack him!!!</p>
<p>A loud voice called out to him in his heart. It wanted him to attack this nearby, irksome presence, but his reason stopped him.</p>
<p>Go reunite with your teammates, an even stronger voice called out to him.</p>
<p>It was like there was a devil and an angel in his mind scuffling**! But the winner was quickly decided.</p>
<p>Dark Forest climbed up, but Lord Grim also leapt up, directly towards Dark Forest.</p>
<p>Dark Forest spun around his ninjato, dodging Lord Grim. He stepped on his ninjato and was just about to jump up, when Lord Grim&rsquo;s umbrella turned into a spear. Lord Grim dropped down as his evil spear stabbed upwards&hellip;</p>
<p>In the end, Dark Forest was unable to escape from the spear. All sorts of applause, laughs, and butt related words poured out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Circle Swing!</p>
<p>Lord Grim threw Dark Forest in a circle, smashing him into Half Moon Rock. Then, because of his position, Lord Grim stepped on Dark Forest, forcing him down as he moved up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that do damage?&rdquo; The crowd was curious to why Lord Grim stepped on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still attacking!&rdquo; Someone discovered that as Lord Grim stepped on Dark Forest, he was also jabbing jabbing jabbing with his spear. His target was, of course, Dark Forest&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Dark Forest dropped to the ground with a face covered in blood.</p>
<p>Beaten up&hellip; Dark Forest failed to make it over the wall and was now being beat up violently. However, this tussle helped win him some time. Li Hua was now confident that he could wait for his escape skills to come off cooldown.</p>
<p>The east side darkens, the west side brightens, close a door, another door opens, Li Hua heard comforting thoughts from his heart.</p>
<p>Rock climbing really is a good way to stay alive! Li Hua thought to himself. He even wanted to climb some more, but Ye Xiu wasn&rsquo;t going to give him the same opportunity twice. This time, he attacked even tighter.</p>
<p>Li Hua kept trying. Chu Yunxiu and the others obviously weren&rsquo;t going to wait for Li Hua and do nothing. They were also trying to rush over, but Soft Mist was standing in their way. It really was difficult for these long-ranged classes to break through. After several unsuccessful attempts, Chu Yunxiu decided to have everyone split up and take a roundabout route.</p>
<p>The four from Misty Rain started spreading out and circled around Soft Mist. Tang Rou could only bite onto one person.</p>
<p>However, Tang Rou didn&rsquo;t target anyone. Her Soft Mist suddenly retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Yunxiu suddenly had a realization &ndash; she had made a mistake. By circling around, if they went too far away and Happy couldn&rsquo;t chase them, then&hellip;</p>
<p>Too late. Soft Mist&rsquo;s retreat was a signal. When Misty Rain shrunk back, Happy didn&rsquo;t pressure them. They also withdrew and then focused their efforts onto Dark Forest.</p>
<p>With Soft Mist returning, waving a spear in her hands, and Dancing Rain and Windward Formation pulling back to behind the Half Moon Rock, Li Hua&rsquo;s heart wasn&rsquo;t merely frozen. It was dead.</p>
<p>So those were the enemy&rsquo;s original intentions&hellip; I was too naive!</p>
<p>After wearing him down, they suddenly focused their attention onto him.</p>
<p>Ninjas weren&rsquo;t high-health high-defense classes to begin with. Once Dark Forest was caught up in their wave of attacks, he was quickly washed away. Chu Yunxiu and the others were hurrying over, and at this moment, they had just gotten past the Half Moon Rock.</p>
<p>Everything had been calculated perfectly.</p>
<p>Lord Grim and Soft Mist, the two melee characters, cut straight into Misty Rain&rsquo;s ranks and picked off their healer.</p>
<p>No matter how fierce the three ranged characters attacked, they had no way of forcing the two melee enemies apart. This was their weakness. Compared to melee classes, they lacked knockback and knockdown type skills.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu and Tang Rou ignored the attacks from the three ranged characters.</p>
<p>This&hellip; they&rsquo;re planning on trading!</p>
<p>Those with the knowledge could see it.</p>
<p>Happy had the numbers advantage, so they planned on sacrificing one of their characters for Misty Rain&rsquo;s healer. When one side had the numbers advantage, it was difficult for the other side to do anything about this type of trade.</p>
<p>Misty Rain was helpless&hellip;</p>
<p>By the time their sixth player arrived, this trade had already been completed. Lord Grim and Misty Rain&rsquo;s healer died.</p>
<p>Why Lord Grim?</p>
<p>If a trade was being forced to happen, then Misty Rain would obviously choose to trade for the bigger threat. In the entire Alliance, all nineteen teams would most likely choose Lord Grim in this situation.</p>
<p>But Happy&rsquo;s determination could be seen from this. If they were even willing to trade their strongest player, then they must be extremely confident towards what followed next.</p>
<p>In the end, Team Happy won the team competition.</p>
<p>10-0. Another 10-0. This was Happy&rsquo;s fourth 10-0 this season.</p>
<p>This was an achievement for a top powerhouse. However, top powerhouses being 10-0ed by other teams was very illogical.</p>
<p>Happy&hellip;</p>
<p>Chapter 1217: Voice Chat Rules</p>
<p>10 to 0, this result silenced all those who were hoping to see Happy capsize. Ruan Cheng of Esports Time had come to watch this match in person, but upon seeing this result, he skipped the post-match press conference entirely.</p>
<p>Happy&rsquo;s performance this match was indisputable. Their strategy in the team competition had been tailored to fight Misty Rain, and they were able to build their strategy around the unique features of the map in a beautiful manner. No matter how aggressive a reporter was, they couldn&rsquo;t find anything to criticize Happy with in this match. In the end, reporters had to follow logic. As of now, no one hated Happy enough to attack them out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The press conference ended with a host of congratulations. With these ten points, Happy rose two places on the leaderboard. After twelve rounds, they were now in ninth place, only one step away from the playoff zone, and it was a step that couldn&rsquo;t be smaller, only one point.</p>
<p>Happy was closing in on the eighth place Void, who currently had 71 points. In the eleventh round, they had used their home advantage to defeat Tiny Herb 8 to 2, but in this round&rsquo;s away game they lost to Wind Howl 1 to 9..</p>
<p>A number of people were already looking forward to next round&rsquo;s match.</p>
<p>Round 13, Happy would play their away game against Conquering Clouds, which wasn&rsquo;t any unbeatable team. And Void, meanwhile, would be playing their home game against the team which Happy had just swept, Misty Rain.</p>
<p>If Void wanted to maintain their lead over Happy in the rankings, they needed to have a showing just as strong as Happy&rsquo;s was this round. And the just-finished Happy versus Misty Rain match had been a clear tactical guide in fighting Misty Rain. BOX-1, trapping Li Hua outside of Misty Rain&rsquo;s tactical maneuvers would cripple the team. But strategy was something that everyone knew. The important part was execution. Comparing Happy and Void&rsquo;s next respective opponents on paper, most people anticipated that Happy would surpass Void next round.</p>
<p>But Misty Rain wasn&rsquo;t the only team that Happy had managed to surpass.</p>
<p>After twelve rounds, the seventh place team was the team that had previously been swept by Happy, Hundred Blossoms. They now led Happy by only 3 points. If these two teams had the same points score, Happy would rank above them by virtue of their prior victory. In round 13, Hundred Blossoms would be facing a strong team too, Wind Howl. If they didn&rsquo;t make good use of their home field advantage, it was likely that Happy would surpass both them and Wind Howl. Right now, Happy was accumulating points in a frightening manner.</p>
<p>In round 12, Samsara defeated Radiant 10 to 0, preventing Happy from having the honor of being the only team to have four 10-0 wins. Samsara&rsquo;s performance was as strong as ever.</p>
<p>In addition, Tiny Herb, Tyranny, and Wind Howl all earned high-point victories. But Blue Rain, who had played their home game against Thunderclap this round, had earned a powerful 5 points in the individual competition and group arena, only to lose the team competition. In the battle between two Master Tacticians, this time Xiao Shiqin took the lead.</p>
<p>In the post-match press conference, Blue Rain&rsquo;s Yu Wenzhou took responsibility, but the reporters didn&rsquo;t give him too much blame. Because Yu Wenzhou hadn&rsquo;t made any mistake, he&hellip; it was only because his hand speed wasn&rsquo;t enough, he couldn&rsquo;t issue directions and battle at the same time. After all, against a team with a Master Tactician like Xiao Shiqin, the battle strategies were constantly evolving in complex ways. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to solely rely on team cohesiveness and strategic habits. There needed to be someone directing the team members so that they knew the tactical intentions. Yu Wenzhou&rsquo;s hand speed in the pro circle was indeed subpar, and in this match that required a high hand speed to give directions, he was truly powerless.</p>
<p>And in the post-match press conference, Yu Wenzhou could only helplessly offer these words: &ldquo;The opponent was very smart, accurately pinpointing my weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Typically, for the post-match press conference, the losing team would go first, followed by the winning team. But in this round, both teams tied with 5 points, so the away team went first, then the home team.</p>
<p>When Yu Wenzhou made this statement, Thunderclap was already preparing to leave, but later there was still a reporter who managed to chase down Thunderclap&rsquo;s Captain Xiao Shiqin. Xiao Shiqin personally confirmed that in this round, Thunderclap&rsquo;s strategy was to increase the variability of their fighting, with the intent of forcing Blue Rain into making adjustments. Thunderclap would attack the flaws that appeared when Blue Rain couldn&rsquo;t adjust fast enough, or the flaws revealed by individual people&hellip;</p>
<p>Use complex and variable tactics and put greater pressure on Yu Wenzhou&rsquo;s slow hand speed.</p>
<p>Xiao Shiqin&rsquo;s targeted strategy sparked some controversy. Some people felt that this was just another way of attacking the opponent&rsquo;s weaknesses, and there was nothing wrong with that. But others felt that using tactics to create this effect was low-level and uninteresting. Strategy should display intellect and cleverness, and this sort of method changed that.</p>
<p>Thus, this reignited the calls to allow voice chat in matches. But as soon as those arguments surfaced, there were quickly others who said that if that happened, then trash talk would be spewed nonstop&hellip;</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone&rsquo;s first thought was of a certain other person on Team Blue Rain. His trash talk wasn&rsquo;t especially hurtful, but unrestricted voice chat would be ideal for him.</p>
<p>Once this person was mentioned, this person who had forced the Alliance to specially modify the rules of battle, those calls to open voice chat were weakened. But quickly, other people proposed, what if voice chat was opened just for members of the same team?</p>
<p>A team voice chat could only be used to give directions. There would be no way to launch trash talk attacks.</p>
<p>But there was no way to present this kind of voice chat in a broadcast. The sound of each team chat couldn&rsquo;t be simultaneously broadcast, and cutting back and forth between the two would be unpleasant to listen to. The Alliance had always used text chat up until now so that they could show the teams&rsquo; communications to the audience, and this was also a reason why they never used voice chat in competition.</p>
<p>However, typing instead of focusing solely on putting in combat inputs weakened the intensity of the competition.</p>
<p>At this point, these arguments started surfacing as well. After all, the debate over voice chat had been ongoing for a very long time now. This Blue Rain versus Thunderclap match just showed another problem caused by the lack of voice chat.</p>
<p>Yu Wenzhou was able to survive in the Glory Alliance through his unique methods. The Alliance, for its part, hoped to see competitors of all types. But now, the existence of players like Yu Wenzhou was being strangled.</p>
<p>With Thunderclap&rsquo;s battle results, did that mean that in the future, all teams would use these complex, changing battle strategies to face Blue Rain? After all, this wasn&rsquo;t something that only a Master Tactician could do. Even tactical duels were becoming competitions of hand speed. Was there any intelligence in pro matches anymore?</p>
<p>There were more and more angles of questioning, and the issue rose from just Yu Wenzhou to extend to all of the various teams&rsquo; shot callers. Without voice chat, they were forced to input extra keyboard controls. This wasn&rsquo;t like trash talking, where if you didn&rsquo;t want to say anything you could just not say anything. Issuing orders was a matter of victory or defeat, something that absolutely had to be done. Because of the rule preventing voice chat, they bore a greater burden upon their hands. It was unfair to these players.</p>
<p>The players that directed strategies needed intelligence. But because of the competition rules, hand speed became a factor, even though it shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with tactics. It was completely unreasonable!</p>
<p>The voices of doubt became stronger and stronger, and so the Alliance finally made an official response, saying that they would begin discussion and investigation into the issue of voice chat.</p>
<p>Hearing the Alliance&rsquo;s solemn recognition, many people calmed down. With the calm, the sounds of complaints and mockery quickly came as well. It wasn&rsquo;t long before many people pointed out that, if the Alliance changed the rules again because of this, then Blue Rain would have two people who forced the Alliance to change the rules. Blue Rain didn&rsquo;t acknowledge this interesting fact, but regarding the opening of strategic voice chat, Team Blue Rain was in clear support.</p>
<p>The Alliance needed to do research, so there was no way for a result to appear in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Soon, it was November 29th, Round 13.</p>
<p>Happy played their away game at Conquering Clouds, and didn&rsquo;t disappoint their supporters.</p>
<p>9 to 1, Happy won, Ye Xiu&rsquo;s individual win streak was now up to 12. The 1 point they lost this round was from Su Mucheng&rsquo;s mistake in the individual competition.</p>
<p>And after this round, Happy finally stepped into the playoff zone. Void, who had previously been one place above them, had also done quite well this round, defeating Misty Rain in their home game 8 to 2. It was clear that they had learned from Happy&rsquo;s strategy against Misty Rain in the team competition, causing Misty Rain to eat a big loss in their two consecutive away games.</p>
<p>Happy earned 9 points, Void earned 8, so the one point difference between the two teams was erased. As it happened, both Happy (Xingxin) and Void (Xukong) started with the letter X in their pinyin names, so the next step was to compare order of appearance in the dictionary, in which Happy took the lead.</p>
<p>But at this point people had already realized, in the upcoming Round 14, Happy and Void would be directly facing off against each other.</p>
<p>Hundred Blossoms, who were within range of catching up to Happy, had also done fairly well this round, winning 7 to 3 in their home game against Wind Howl. For now, they still led Happy by one point. And Wind Howl continued their path of ups and downs, some people even summarizing their performance as &ldquo;home game dragons, away game bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for now, this conclusion was a bit reckless. People mostly paid attention to Wind Howl&rsquo;s away game loss to 301, but 301 wasn&rsquo;t any weak team, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be shocking that they could win their own home game. Right now, 301 was in tenth place with 76 points, only 3 points behind Happy and Void. Next round was Happy and Void&rsquo;s battle, so it was very possible that it would be 301 who would surpass them both and make it to the playoff zone.</p>
<p>Wind Howl wasn&rsquo;t so terrible, but their current slippage was undeniable truth. They had now fallen to sixth place, surpassed by Tyranny.</p>
<p>Tyranny, Samsara, and Happy were the three teams that had won 9 to 1 this round. Blue Rain and Tiny Herb had lost their away games 4 to 6.</p>
<p>Blue Rain had lost to Royal Style, and their loss in the team competition once again caused people to pay attention to the issue of voice chat. This battle, Royal Style had definitely learned from Thunderclap and used lively and variable strategies. But over the course of the battle, Blue Rain&rsquo;s loss this time wasn&rsquo;t because of Yu Wenzhou&rsquo;s hand speed. Blue Rain&rsquo;s players didn&rsquo;t need their captain&rsquo;s reminders to respond every time they encountered the slightest change. Master Tacticians were known as such because even if they followed the same general rules for strategies, their tactics would be more complete and effective.</p>
<p>Blue Rain lost to Royal Style, but Tiny Herb lost to Thunderclap.</p>
<p>After losing many points in the individual battles, Thunderclap once again made a comeback in the team competition. Their record in the team battles was as tyrannical as Ye Xiu&rsquo;s in the individual battles. Right now, they had 12 wins and 1 loss; the only difference from Ye Xiu was that their wins weren&rsquo;t consecutive.</p>
<p>Chapter 1218: All-Star Voting</p>
<p>Thunderclap&rsquo;s strength in the team competition guaranteed their strong showing on the rankings. Right now, they were tied with Blue Rain with 90 points. Because the two had tied in their match against each other, their ranking was determined by alphabet, with Blue Rain (Lanyu) in second place and Thunderclap (Leiting) in third.</p>
<p>Samsara led the pack with 113 points, a score so high that people had already lost the desire to try and catch up.</p>
<p>After 13 rounds of competition, they entered the month of December. The yearly voting for All-Stars began with the new season and ended in December.</p>
<p>The earliest votes cast were based on the players&rsquo; performances last season; the strong players in last season&rsquo;s playoffs would gain favor. Then, after entering the rhythm of the new season, one or two stunning plays could invite a lot of votes. Tang Rou was a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>A rookie who had just entered the Alliance, after an exciting 1v2 in the second round, was swiftly pushed into the ranks of the All-Stars. Of course, her beautiful appearance contributed to this as well.</p>
<p>However, after the 1v3 incident and her clear revocation of her word, Tang Rou&rsquo;s popularity instantly died down. Even many of the team&rsquo;s fans couldn&rsquo;t look at her anymore, how much support would she have left from everyone else? Instantly, Tang Rou&rsquo;s name went from daily rising in the All-Star voting to complete erasure.</p>
<p>And right now, the highest-ranked player was still Zhou Zekai. Last season, the team had won in the playoffs, this season they maintained a powerful lead, and Zhou Zekai&rsquo;s performance was indispensable. He led the rankings with no competition.</p>
<p>And compared to last year, the biggest change on the leaderboard was the return of a few names, the most significant of which were the ones who had gone to Excellent Era last season. These three all had their dedicated fans and were immediately pushed onto the leaderboard. Aside from the unwavering support of their loyal fans, there was the effect of their performances this season.</p>
<p>Xiao Shiqin was the most eye-catching of these three. Everyone knew Xiao Shiqin&rsquo;s major contributions to Thunderclap&rsquo;s shocking accomplishments this season. Although Xiao Shiqin wasn&rsquo;t like Zhou Zekai or Sun Xiang, who were core players based on their technical skill, Thunderclap&rsquo;s outstanding performance allowed Xiao Shiqin&rsquo;s tactical skill to shine and draw attention, attracting scores of fans. Right now, on the All-Star voting leaderboard, Xiao Shiqin was in third place, much better than his rankings in previous seasons.</p>
<p>Su Mucheng and Sun Xiang were both ranked around tenth. With their fanbase support and their performance, they hadn&rsquo;t seen any big ups or downs.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to name someone who was only rising more and more rapidly, you&rsquo;d have to say another returning name &ndash; no, strictly speaking, the name wasn&rsquo;t returning. What was returning was the person.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu. Never mind his accumulated popularity from previous years, just looking at his ongoing twelve consecutive individual win record, this kind of player would gain enough attention to be pushed onto the rankings. As he achieved wins round after round, the ballots cast for Ye Xiu only increased. Happy&rsquo;s recent strong performance gave him a boost as well. Right now, Ye Xiu was at number 6 and was still in the process of beautifully rushing upward.</p>
<p>One could see how influential he was just from the recent in-game interest in unspecialized. It got to the point where the Glory developers added a strong reminder in-game, notifying the players who didn&rsquo;t choose a class at level 20 just how difficult their existence thereafter would be. Without naming names, they reminded everyone not to try and imitate a certain person because this certain person was an exceptional player with exceptional talent and an exceptional self-made weapon.</p>
<p>Despite this, the enthusiasm of the players couldn&rsquo;t be stopped. Quite a few players started playing with the equipment editor to try and make a Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, which suddenly caused the prices of level 5 equipment materials to rise.</p>
<p>With some people returning to the leaderboard, others would of course be pushed down.</p>
<p>There was one such person in Happy. Fang Rui changed classes, which his former Thief supporters couldn&rsquo;t accept. The players of his new class, Qi Master, even though they saw that Fang Rui held the All-Star Qi Master Boundless Sea, his Qi Master performance&hellip; to be honest, up through now there was still nothing very convincing about it. As for his recent crawling and rolling Qi Master style, a number of Qi Master players felt that it was disgusting, and it didn&rsquo;t inspire any imitations.</p>
<p>Also kicked off the leaderboard was Hundred Blossoms&rsquo; Zou Yuan. He had been pushed onto the All-Star leaderboard through nostalgia for two years in a row. But now that he was finally gradually bringing out a new character, he was shoved downward by the fierceness of the competition. Unfortunately, he was helpless about this.</p>
<p>Another player squeezed off the rankings was Royal Style&rsquo;s Tian Sen.</p>
<p>Peaceful Hermit, this former pinnacle God-level character. Ever since the All-Stars began, this character had made it to the leaderboard no matter the controller. But finally, because of the team&rsquo;s slipping performance through the years, he vanished for the first time from the top 20.</p>
<p>Regarding this, Peaceful Hermit&rsquo;s current user Tian Sen was extremely helpless. Year after year of hard work, but the team still saw no improvement and hovered at the middle. Now that there were more and more challengers, they were finally kicked off the altar.</p>
<p>Tian Sen and Peaceful Hermit&rsquo;s fall conjured many sighs.</p>
<p>There was another old general pushed off the leaderboard, Tyranny&rsquo;s Lin Jingyan. This old, long-time All-Star finally had his position stolen away.</p>
<p>Tyranny&rsquo;s near-miss of the championship last season had originally garnered much sympathy, and at the start of this season, the ballots for Tyranny&rsquo;s players surged upward. But, after that wave passed, their performance in this new season was factored in. Tyranny was rotating their roster for these matches, and the old veterans, no longer having regular appearances, began to slow in the rankings. The position of Tyranny&rsquo;s Captain Han Wenqing was still relatively stable, while Lin Jingyan had dropped off the rankings. There was Zhang Jiale too, currently at a precarious 23rd place, at high risk of being replaced over the course of December. Just off of the votes, the rankings for many players were very close. A single explosive performance could bring enough ballots to surpass him.</p>
<p>But overall, the changes to the rankings couldn&rsquo;t be called large.</p>
<p>Xiao Shiqin, Su Mucheng, Sun Xiang, and Ye Xiu&rsquo;s returns weren&rsquo;t any surprise. Compared to last year&rsquo;s Lu Hanwen and Gao Yingjie entering the rankings as rookies, this season, there was no such entirely new blood breaking into the rankings. Tang Rou originally had this potential with her explosive performance in the second round and her steadiness thereafter. She was a very strong rookie. But unfortunately, after that 1v3 incident destroyed her reputation, she naturally didn&rsquo;t have much chance in this kind of popolarity voting.</p>
<p>Right now, the one who was in more of a dilemma was the Alliance. The All-Star voting was just for excitement; a good performance onstage could increase votes, but in the end, that wasn&rsquo;t the only determining factor. However, the Alliance&rsquo;s yearly awards were entirely based on the players&rsquo; real performance onstage, based on numbers and statistics.</p>
<p>And from the statistics, among this season&rsquo;s rookies, Tang Rou faced no competition. But when they thought about giving the &ldquo;Best Newcomer&rdquo; award to this player with a ruined reputation, the Alliance felt the pressure would be extremely large. Right now, there was still over half a season to go before these awards were given, but there were already people worrying about this issue, which was a sign of just how outstanding Tang Rou was right now among the rookies.</p>
<p>December was the last month for voting the All-Stars, and looking at the current ballot counts, no final judgment could be made based off the rankings as they entered December. Because more and more players would save all of their tickets until December, waiting until the voting was just about to close so that they could see the entirety of the players&rsquo; performances before casting their votes.</p>
<p>Would December see any player powerfully slaughtering their way onto the leaderboard? This was something to watch when the league reached December. Before, there was also something else to watch in December, the winter transfer window. At that time, the Alliance didn&rsquo;t have as many teams, so when they began in September, the season would be halfway over the time it was December. That was the original reason for why they set the winter transfers in December. But now, the season often wasn&rsquo;t even half over by January. After discussing this for several seasons, in Season 10, the Alliance finally decided to move the winter transfer window to January.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Glory new server opening now had almost no effect on the pro teams. The only ones who were busy were the guild workers of the various large clubs, who before December would have to prepare their strength to enter the new server to compete for resources and advertise for the club.</p>
<p>Happy now already had its own official guild department. After half a year of development, the personnel organization was already finalized. And to a new guild like Happy, the opening of this new server was beyond important. In the old servers or in the Heavenly Domain, Happy was constantly playing catch-up, but in a new server, everyone was starting at zero, so they had a greater chance at achieving an advantage.</p>
<p>After Wu Chen organized the work for the new server, he solemnly gave Chen Guo the list of people who would be expanding in the new server. Boss Chen was generous, knowing how crucial the work in the new server was, gave the new server employees additional bonuses with a flourish of her pen.</p>
<p>As of now, the guild department was relatively well-developed, and Happy&rsquo;s R&amp;D department had expanded slightly. Finding technical researchers was difficult, but didn&rsquo;t all of the big teams have to deal with this? The R&amp;D would sometimes experience changes of personnel, and sometimes people would leave their jobs.</p>
<p>When Chen Guo failed to find enough suitable R&amp;D candidates, she started paying particularly close attention to this area, and her efforts weren&rsquo;t wasted. In November, there was a small adjustment at Thunderclap, and an R&amp;D researcher left his job for personal reasons. Chen Guo instantly pounced on him, but this person&rsquo;s personal reason was that he wanted to return to his home city to work, and his home city unfortunately was not City H. Chen Guo had no way of satisfying that requirement, and so she could only watch with her eyes wide open as this rather skilled R&amp;D researcher returned to his home City K and entered Hundred Blossoms.</p>
<p>The second time, it was Royal Style whose personnel was changing, with two R&amp;D researchers leaving one after the other. Chen Guo made some inquiries, and after confirming that it wasn&rsquo;t for a reason like &ldquo;returning home&rdquo; that they had no way of satisfying, she approached them in-person in City B.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Guo&rsquo;s actions were truly swift and fierce. Heavenly Swords was in the same city as Royal Style, but by the time they began to approach them, one of them had already reached an agreement and signed with Chen Guo. With one of them already taken, Lou Guanning of course couldn&rsquo;t try and pull some evil trickery, but the remaining one didn&rsquo;t want to live modestly with Happy and cleanly slammed down a checkbook. After Chen Guo knew, she didn&rsquo;t have any words. Being able to get one researcher was good enough, and she could only hope that the person they got wouldn&rsquo;t have any regrets after learning that he&rsquo;d missed the opportunity to enjoy the riches of Heavenly Swords.</p>
<p>Although from the looks of it, this new R&amp;D researcher who had now been at Happy for ten days, Wang Sen, seemed quite at ease.</p>
<p>Chapter 1219: Lord Grim&rsquo;s Counter</p>
<p>December 6th. Glory Professional Alliance Season 10 Round 14. Team Happy greeting the visiting challengers Team Void.</p>
<p>This was a confrontation between two direct competitors. In Round 12, it was because of this reason that the Happy versus Misty Rain match had been chosen to be broadcast. However, this time, the broadcast chose Wind Howl versus Thunderclap. Reportedly, when the internal esports broadcast team had their meeting, the commentator Pan Lin expressed his opposition towards broadcasting Happy&rsquo;s match. Pan Lin&rsquo;s partner, Li Yibo, also had the same opinion.</p>
<p>This reasoning was very pompous, but even though Pan Lin hadn&rsquo;t explicitly stated the true reason, everyone knew what it was. Wasn&rsquo;t it because they were afraid of being slapped in the faces again after misreading the situation in another Happy match?</p>
<p>But then again, Team Thunderclap&rsquo;s tactics were top-tier too! Just take that round where the complex and changing tactics forced Yu Wenzhou to make such a statement. Could these two partners see through that? In the post-match interviews, those experienced Glory reporters hadn&rsquo;t noticed it. They hadn&rsquo;t noticed it until Yu Wenzhou&rsquo;s grudging comment. Only then did they ask Xiao Shiqin for verification.</p>
<p>The level of the commentators need to improve&hellip;</p>
<p>Constantly getting slapped in the face was embarrassing for the broadcast team too, but there was no one better to choose. After all, to be a commentator and guest duo, just having knowledge wasn&rsquo;t enough, the two needed to be compatible. Commentating required speaking eloquently at an appropriate pace. Zhou Zekai and Huang Shaotian were extremely skilled players with far more knowledge of the game than Pan Lin and Li Yibo, but could those two become a commentator duo? Could they? Could they?</p>
<p>Compatibility was the most important.</p>
<p>Right now, Pan Lin and Li Yibo formed their best commentator duo.</p>
<p>As a result, the Happy versus Void match was not chosen to be broadcast.</p>
<p>Team Void&rsquo;s core still revolved around their Ghostblade duo. Their new rookie last season, the Exorcist Ge Caijie, cemented his position even further, becoming the two Ghostblades&rsquo; most reliable partner. As for Team Void, the team put in great efforts to upgrade Ge Caijie&rsquo;s Exorcist character, Blue Exorcist.</p>
<p>When Team Void heard that Team Royal Style was shifting around their characters and that people from their R&amp;D department had left, Team Void had been very excited. Team Royal Style may have only been a mid-tier team, but their R&amp;D department was at the forefront of all things related to Exorcists. Their Peaceful Hermit did not have the votes to make it into this season&rsquo;s All-Stars at the moment, but his lack of votes was mainly because of the team&rsquo;s poor win record. In terms of raw stats, Peaceful Hermit still stood as the King of Exorcists.</p>
<p>Team Void wasn&rsquo;t heroic enough to directly purchase Peaceful Hermit, but hiring two experienced members from their R&amp;D team would be excellent too.</p>
<p>But when Void made their move, they were stunned when they learned that one of the two R&amp;D team members had already gone to Happy and the other to Heavenly Swords. Void had been just one beat too slow, missing this opportunity for two long-awaited helpers. With their cheeks were streaked with tears, they could only rely on their current R&amp;D team to continue developing their Exorcist.</p>
<p>Their Blue Exorcist was a bit weak, but their player Ge Caijie didn&rsquo;t complain. In the current state of the Alliance, where rookies nowadays were fickle and demanding, this was a rare sight. Ge Caijie had a maturity and composure that exceeded his young age.</p>
<p>In the first round of the individual competition, Void sent out this second-year rookie. His win record this season in the individual competition was exceptional. Out of 12 matches, he had 10 wins and 2 losses.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for Ye Xiu&rsquo;s 12 consecutive wins, Ge Caijie would have been the player with the highest win rate. In this match, the number one and number two in 1v1s would be clashing. The match was filled with topics to talk about as soon as it began. In comparison, the opening for the Thunderclap versus Wind Howl game was very ordinary and dull. Team Thunderclap didn&rsquo;t have anyone too noteworthy for their individual competitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senior, I hope to learn from you.&rdquo; The respectful Ge Caijie didn&rsquo;t forget his manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;ll be the one to change up our win rates,&rdquo; Ye Xiu replied. It could be seen from his words that he had paid quite a bit of attention to this rookie. He at least knew that in 1v1s, Ge Caijie was second only to himself.</p>
<p>The countdown finished, and the two characters loaded into the map.</p>
<p>Happy&rsquo;s home game. Ye Xiu&rsquo;s choice of maps was in the same style as always. The two characters didn&rsquo;t dally around and directly headed towards the center of the map.</p>
<p>Lord Grim used long-ranged attacks to initiate. Ge Caijie&rsquo;s Blue Exorcist evaded them, while swinging his arms, throwing the scythe in his hands.</p>
<p>It was just an ordinary Spirit Guidance without any additional talismans, clearly meant as a probing attack. Ge Caijie didn&rsquo;t let down those who praised his steadiness. He didn&rsquo;t immediately rush in to take the initiative. Although it was unanimously held that the Exorcist was the counter of the unspecialized, what happened when Royal Style faced Happy? Tian Sen impatiently had Peaceful Hermit set out to fulfill his mission as Lord Grim&rsquo;s counter, and the match ended with Royal Style losing to Happy 1 to 9. The two didn&rsquo;t face each other in the individual competition, and in the team competition, Peaceful Hermit seemed to be the ill-fated one and was the first to be killed.</p>
<p>Exorcists were only counters in theory. To prove this theory, real results were necessary. Ge Caijie believed that Ye Xiu was more familiar than anyone else about why Exorcists were considered Lord Grim&rsquo;s bane. There was no way Ye Xiu would not be on guard. Before Ge Caijie began, as the one widely considered as a counter to his opponent, he had to be ready to face an opponent who was at his 120%.</p>
<p>Lord Grim easily dodged the Spirit Guidance scythe, but Ge Caijie immediately used Spirit Guidance again, having the scythe return to him and attack Lord Grim from behind. Lord Grim didn&rsquo;t even look back before being sliced into smoke.</p>
<p>Shadow Clone Technique!</p>
<p>The real body flickered to a position several units forward. Along with an arc of cold light, Lord Grim instantly arrived in front of him with a Shining Cut.</p>
<p>Blue Exorcist had just thrown out the weapon in his hands with Spirit Guidance, so he couldn&rsquo;t even parry it with an attack of his own. However, Exorcists were a class that didn&rsquo;t need their weapon to utilize their skills. He pinched with his hands, and a talisman appeared, letting out thin strands of cold qi. Blue Exorcist jumped back while pressing the talisman towards Lord Grim.</p>
<p>Ice Talisman was an ice element skill with freeze effects. This skill could not be ignored. Lord Grim, who had been pressing forward fiercely, had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>The Ice Talisman failed to hit its target and shattered into fine pieces. Blue Exorcist pinched his hands again, and a new talisman appeared.</p>
<p>Fire Talisman!</p>
<p>Fire after ice. Blue Exorcist didn&rsquo;t leave any gaps between his two talisman attacks. His rhythm and skill linking was immaculate.</p>
<p>Retreat again?</p>
<p>Impossible. Ye Xiu hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about the scythe flying back. Dodging to left seemed to be the most logical course of action, but&hellip; if he did that, Blue Exorcist would simply conjure another talisman and throw it there, forcing him into a position with nowhere to run.</p>
<p>As a result, Ye Xiu chose to continue pressing forward!</p>
<p>Colliding Stab!</p>
<p>Lord Grim used a Berserker skill to quickly cover some distance. The Fire Talisman wasn&rsquo;t like the Ice Talisman. Forcefully taking the hit was bearable. Ge Caijie clearly wasn&rsquo;t prepared for Ye Xiu&rsquo;s choice of action. Lord Grim stabbed Blue Exorcist and continued forward, pushing them away from the returning scythe. Then, he rolled to the right.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lord Grim was struck by the Fire Talisman and his body was set ablaze, taking damage over time.</p>
<p>The scythe returned to Blue Exorcist&rsquo;s hands. All Ye Xiu got was damage from Colliding Stab, which wasn&rsquo;t as heavy as the damage from Fire Talisman. It was better than nothing though.</p>
<p>Sky Strike!</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella changed forms and slashed upwards.</p>
<p>Ge Caijie&rsquo;s heart jumped, but not much. He placed the scythe in front of him and blocked the Sky Strike. Then, he pushed out and threw a Lightning Talisman.</p>
<p>Lord Grim jumped back to dodge it. Blue Exorcist swiped with his scythe, and a blue light rose from the ground. A Rising Emblem threw Lord Grim into the air.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lord Grim quickly adjusted himself while in the air and fired an Anti-Tank Missile at Blue Exorcist. Blue Exorcist was just about to follow up, but was forced to back away. Lord Grim relied on the recoil from it to shoot back and threw a grenade at the same time.</p>
<p>After several quick exchanges, neither side had lost much health or won any big advantages. Compared to normal, being able to fight evenly with Ye Xiu&rsquo;s Lord Grim was very rare. But now, many people had higher expectations of Ge Caijie.</p>
<p>Exorcists were considered to be counters to Lord Grim because of their new Level 75 skill. However, Ge Caijie had yet to use it.</p>
<p>Was he waiting for a more opportune moment?</p>
<p>Everyone understood the logic, but they weren&rsquo;t as patient as Ge Caijie. They wanted Blue Exorcist to hurry up and use it.</p>
<p>How could finding an opportunity be so easy though? A careless usage wouldn&rsquo;t get the desired effects. It would just be wasting the skill, and Ge Caijie would no longer have the threat of it anymore. And Ge Caijie could clearly sense that Ye Xiu was being very wary of this skill. Some of his decisions carried this sort of vigilance. The might of a counter could already be seen! It wasn&rsquo;t just as simple as using a powerful skill to make the opponent kneel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really have patience!&rdquo; Even Ye Xiu couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for an opportunity.&rdquo; It seemed like Ge Caijie also couldn&rsquo;t resist chatting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can be certain of that,&rdquo; Ge Caijie said.</p>
<p>When he said these words, Blue Exorcist&rsquo;s scythe swept up and then down, while his other hand readied another talisman. Not to Ge Caijie&rsquo;s surprise, Ye Xiu didn&rsquo;t dare use something as simple as parrying to defend. Lord Grim jumped back.</p>
<p>Spirit Guidance!</p>
<p>The scythe that was swinging down suddenly flew out from his hands. Lord Grim hadn&rsquo;t jumped far back enough.</p>
<p>But Ye Xiu was able to pull some distance away. At this moment, he seemed quite relaxed. His Myriad Manifestations Umbrella opened up, ready to shield against the attack. The instant the two weapons were about to clash, Ye Xiu noticed Blue Exorcist&rsquo;s left hand quickly touching the scythe.</p>
<p>Not good!</p>
<p>Ye Xiu knew the situation wasn&rsquo;t good, but it was too late to make a different move. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella and the scythe collided. Talisman energy swiftly moved up the scythe handle, linking the two weapons together. The energy moved through the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. When the light suddenly blossomed, a faint &ldquo;封&rdquo; (Seal) character could be seen.</p>
<p>Exorcist Level 75 skill: Seal Talisman.</p>
<p>Effect: Seal the targeted equipment for one minute.</p>
<p>Chapter 1220: Title is Spoiler</p>
<p>The Seal Talisman had no damaging effect, but it brought this one minute of status effect.</p>
<p>What did one minute mean in Glory?</p>
<p>A 1v1 duel where one side was much stronger than the other would generally end within one minute. When the two sides were relatively evenly matched, then it would depend on the players&rsquo; individual habits and styles, so time duration wasn&rsquo;t a good statistic to keep track of. Still, assuming the characters met in direct confrontation, it would usually take over 3 minutes to determine victory.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu, in his individual matches, typically played with this kind of rhythm, and this match with Ge Caijie was the same. After they had each tested the waters, the two of them began fierce combat.</p>
<p>Talismans were the Exorcist&rsquo;s unique method of combat. They either directly used the talisman to attack, or they would attach the talisman onto their weapon, causing the weapon to have certain damage bonuses or effects based on the talisman. In fact, they could attach the talisman to the weapon and then use Spirit Guidance to throw away their weapon, turning it into a long-range talisman attack.</p>
<p>Just now, Ge Caijie had, at the very last moment, suddenly slapped a talisman onto his scythe, causing his attack to have a talisman effect. But whether it was ice or fire, Lord Grim had successfully parried and the attack hadn&rsquo;t landed, so the talisman couldn&rsquo;t have dealt any damage. But the talisman that Ge Caijie had used was the Seal Talisman.</p>
<p>The Seal Talisman was used on equipment. With this attack, Lord Grim&rsquo;s parry actually sent to Ge Caijie the target he wished to attack.</p>
<p>It all sounded very simple.</p>
<p>However, when the Spirit Guided scythe shot out toward the opponent&rsquo;s parry, he had to activate the talisman in the instant just before they made contact. The difficulty of such control was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Ye Xiu was hit. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was sealed and was now unusable.</p>
<p>It was unusable, which meant that the equipment stats would be temporarily deducted from the character, as though the character hadn&rsquo;t equipped this equipment at all. And for the equipment that had special additional effects, these effects would also all be eliminated.</p>
<p>For now, sealing the weapon or sealing the shoes were viewed as the most worthwhile ways of using this skill.</p>
<p>Most of a character&rsquo;s attack power came from the weapon, and most of a character&rsquo;s movement speed came from the shoes. These two equipments, from ordinary players to the professional circle, were always prioritized, because they each decided a character&rsquo;s advantage in one particular attribute.</p>
<p>Sealing the weapon was like pulling out the opponent&rsquo;s fangs; sealing the shoes was like breaking the opponent&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>And now, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was sealed. For Lord Grim, it wasn&rsquo;t just a matter of pulling out his fangs. The shapeshifting ability of the umbrella, after being hit by the Seal Talisman, was also eliminated.</p>
<p>The Exorcist was said to be the counter to Lord Grim exactly because of this reason. The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella&rsquo;s greatest characteristic could be eliminated by the Exorcist.</p>
<p>The Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was the true source of the headache that the professional circle felt toward Ye Xiu and Lord Grim. And now, in front of Ge Caijie, this problem was eliminated. During this one minute, Lord Grim held in his hand an unchanging weapon that had no bonus attributes at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully done!&rdquo; Even Ye Xiu couldn&rsquo;t help but express his admiration of Ge Caijie&rsquo;s exciting action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Ge Caijie answered, but his playing wasn&rsquo;t polite at all. He had to use this one minute properly. The Seal Talisman had a cooldown of 7 minutes, there was no way it could be used a second time in an individual battle. This was also why Ge Caijie had been so cautious in the beginning. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to waste this skill.</p>
<p>The scythe was swiftly swung down again, and his other hand was already preparing another talisman at the same time. This was the technique that any high-level Exorcist player should have; putting the talisman on the weapon first and then attacking was what an ordinary player would do. Pro players needed to begin their attack first, and only when they felt their attack was a sure hit would they suddenly attach a talisman. This way, they could conserve their talismans and also allow variation in their attacks.</p>
<p>The scythe flashed down, but there was already another flash before his eyes.</p>
<p>Sword Draw?</p>
<p>Ge Caijie had seen very clearly, when he had applied the seal, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella was in sword form, and now it could only use sword-type skills.</p>
<p>However, without weapon attributes and just relying on the skill itself, whether the damage or the speed or the priority or so on, they would all decrease drastically. A skill like this could be completely ignored.</p>
<p>Shatter!</p>
<p>Blue Exorcist didn&rsquo;t even dodge. This Sword Draw, whether it hit another attack or it hit himself, it would break into shattered fragments of swordlight. It wasn&rsquo;t even worth defending against &ndash; without weapon attributes, it was too small and weak.</p>
<p>Ge Caijie was sure of this. But when the light of the sword hit his body, significantly faster than his own attack, Ge Caijie realized that something was wrong.</p>
<p>A sealed weapon essentially had an attack speed of zero. Even the famously quick Sword Draw shouldn&rsquo;t have this kind of speed now&hellip;</p>
<p>Ge Caijie had no time to think of anything &ndash; Blue Exorcist&rsquo;s body was already inadvertently thrust backward.</p>
<p>This was the momentum from the Sword Draw! But by Ge Caijie&rsquo;s calculations, in this situation, there was no way for the Sword Draw to have this kind of power&hellip;</p>
<p>Did he&hellip;</p>
<p>There was only one possibility!</p>
<p>Ge Caijie watched, eyes wide, as Lord Grim waved his hand and that Myriad Manifestations Umbrella smoothly shifted into spear form and a Dragon Tooth chased toward him.</p>
<p>How could this be?</p>
<p>Ge Caijie was utterly stunned. Unable to dodge this Dragon Tooth, he was hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be that surprised, do you?&rdquo; Ye Xiu said. A Sky Strike leapt out, sending Blue Exorcist into the air.</p>
<p>But as expected of the most stable and calm player of the new generation, even when he was shocked, he quickly steadied his heart. The midair Blue Exorcist swiftly used a talisman and swung his scythe with Spirit Guidance.</p>
<p>Lightning Talisman!</p>
<p>When the scythe hit the ground carrying this talisman, lightning instantly flared around the scythe. Lord Grim had no way of continuing to attack Blue Exorcist from this position, he could only dodge first.</p>
<p>Blue Exorcist hit the ground, the Spirit Guided scythe had already returned to his hand. He turned and stared at Lord Grim over there, and more accurately, the Myriad Manifestations Umbrella that was in Lord Grim&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Myriad Manifestations Umbrella, spear form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&hellip; isn&rsquo;t the one from before&hellip;&rdquo; Ge Caijie saw through what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. You guys throw around the word &ldquo;counter&rdquo; so much, if I didn&rsquo;t make any preparation, wouldn&rsquo;t that just be too dumb?&rdquo; Ye Xiu chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two Myriad Manifestations Umbrellas&hellip;&rdquo; Ge Caijie was a bit speechless. It wasn&rsquo;t that he hadn&rsquo;t thought of such a possibility before, but wasn&rsquo;t Happy relatively poor? This Silver weapon, even though the R&amp;D departments of the various teams hadn&rsquo;t figured out how it was made, they all understood that this was definitely a high-cost item. A Silver weapon like this, with Happy&rsquo;s conditions and grassroots background, there was no way they could make a backup copy, was there? If they only made one to counter the Exorcist&rsquo;s Seal Talisman, that was rather wasteful. But on the other hand, even if the Seal Talisman hadn&rsquo;t managed to stop him, wouldn&rsquo;t this at least greatly increase the burden on Happy? To make an extra copy of such a high-cost weapon, who knew how many fewer Silver equipments the other characters now had? In that regard, this at least had some use in suppressing Happy.</p>
<p>Just as Ge Caijie was thinking all of this, he heard Ye Xiu speak. &ldquo;Yup, two Myriad Manifestations Umbrellas, one level 70, one level 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ge Caijie froze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using a level 5 weapon to fight is really a struggle! So I was very anxious seeing you holding back for so long. Next time be more bold, come up and directly use a Seal Talisman, I&rsquo;ll let you stick it right on,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said.</p>
<p>With that, Ge Caijie could only laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>So this guy had just casually used a level 5 weapon to play around with him, this was really&hellip;</p>
<p>But was Ye Xiu always using the level 5 weapon earlier? Ge Caijie didn&rsquo;t believe it. A level 5 weapon, he definitely would have noticed that something was wrong with the damage dealt. So Ye Xiu, in reality, had secretly switched his equipment at some point, just like how later when he swapped back the real umbrella after the false one was sealed, which Ge Caijie hadn&rsquo;t noticed at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like this Seal Talisman being able to hit you was also an opening you purposely left,&rdquo; Ge Caijie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selling you an opening was just as difficult as finding an opening on you,&rdquo; Ye Xiu admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, then why&hellip;&rdquo; Ge Caijie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know soon enough,&rdquo; Ye Xiu said, as Lord Grim charged forward.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ge Caijie knew soon enough.</p>
<p>He now knew just how much Ye Xiu had restrained himself when playing earlier, all because of the existence of the Seal Talisman. Ge Caijie now had regrets. If he just hadn&rsquo;t used the Seal Talisman and saved this threat as a deterrence, this battle might have been much easier! And no? The Seal Talisman was tossed out without achieving its effect, and an unrestrained Ye Xiu was truly too terrifying&hellip;</p>
<p>Ge Caijie parried for his life, but before him, even God-level players had fallen one after another to Ye Xiu&rsquo;s Lord Grim. Ge Caijie found that he couldn&rsquo;t do any better than them. He had only lasted earlier because of his class, because his class had a skill that the opponent feared.</p>
<p>The Exorcist was truly Lord Grim&rsquo;s counter, but in order to serve as a true counter, the skill had to be effective! When the skill didn&rsquo;t achieve its effect, the counter melted into scattered clouds. After all, this was an ultimate move that could only be used once in seven minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, if I didn&rsquo;t make you use up that Seal Talisman, fighting you would&rsquo;ve been so tiring!&rdquo; As Ye Xiu spoke, Lord Grim had already sent the final attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand&hellip;&rdquo; Gai Caijie answered. Blue Exorcist, under an attack that couldn&rsquo;t be resisted, fell.</p>
<p>First battle of the individual round, Happy won. Ye Xiu had now won 13 consecutive individual battles.</p>
<p>Was he using this sort of method to announce his powerful return? Some people discussed this possibility.</p>
<p>But that was too cheap, wasn&rsquo;t it? What sort of top core player would play in the individual competition instead of the group arena? Some people thought this way.</p>
<p>It was true. Every team&rsquo;s best player, like Zhou Zekai, like Huang Shaotian, like Wang Jiexi, they all appeared in the group arena to try and win those greater 2 points. They might occasionally appear in the individual competition, but none of them would treat the individual competition as their main battleground like Ye Xiu did.</p>
<p>And so, just like this, he continued his win streak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the strong bullying the weak!&rdquo; some people sighed, indignant.</p>
<p>The feelings were complex. Was this evading or was this exploitation? If it was the strong bullying the weak, what did that make those powerful veterans whom Ye Xiu had defeated?</p>
