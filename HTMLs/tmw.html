<p>Chapter 0771: Emblem of Fire</p>
<p>Spirit cruisers were commonly seen in the 12 Empyrean Heavens. After all, not every warrior was proficient in spatial dimension laws or had the ability to do Void Transference.</p>
<p>If they needed to make long-distance space travel, they could only rely on spirit cruisers, using the arrays in the spirit cruiser to tear the void.</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it incredulous that he would encounter a spirit cruiser. He vaguely felt that he had stepped into the 12 Empyrean Heavens. The number of warriors in the 12 Empyrean Heavens numbered like the number of sand in the Ganges river, but when it came to the space around the 12 Empyrean Heavens, the number of spirit cruisers were extremely few in number. He found it hard to believe that he encountered a spirit cruiser as he reached the end of the rope.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the spirit cruiser had taken the initiative to fly towards Yi Yun. The spirit cruiser released an intangible energy that enveloped Yi Yun, slowly pulling Yi Yun towards itself...</p>
<p>At such a close distance, Yi Yun was able to see the spirit cruiser in its entirety. It was in the shape of a shuttle, and was light gray in color. In the middle of the spirit cruiser, there was a striking fiery red emblem. It was a burning flame.</p>
<p>This is probably the emblem of the faction that owns the spirit cruiser...</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not resist, allowing that energy to pull him towards the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>In his present situation, resistance was futile. He did not know what sort of people were on the spirit cruiser, but he would take things one step at a time.</p>
<p>In the spirit cruiser, Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was a lot more richer and Yi Yun was isolated behind a light curtain. His mind was in a trance-like state, and he looked like he was in a coma.</p>
<p>But in fact, Yi Yun's perception was using the Purple Crystal's vision to pass through the light curtain, as he radiated it everywhere.</p>
<p>Vaguely, Yi Yun began to hear someone discussing about something.</p>
<p>Their language was different from the Tian Yuan world's, but it was quite similar to the language used by the Azure Yang Lord tens of millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had to use the fluctuations in their mental processes to barely understand the context of their conversation.</p>
<p>"Where did this young man come from?" A middle-aged man asked with a deep voice as he looked at Yi Yun who was bound by a light curtain.</p>
<p>"Just now, space around the Hundred Wraiths black hole tore apart, causing a small spatial storm. We came to investigate the situation and found this person. He was severely injured, so we saved him. It's unknown if he was injured by the spatial storm..."</p>
<p>Replying the middle-aged man was a girl dressed in purple clothes. Her voice was clear and pleasant to the ears.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man shook his head and said, "This young man's cultivation level is only at the Yuan Opening realm. If he were to be swept up into that sort of storm, he would have long been dead. You wouldn't even see his corpse, much less save him. He is probably a drifter in space. Maybe his spirit cruiser malfunctioned and was lucky enough to be saved by you. Also...Fengling, you are just too kind. It's best not to save strangers like these by bringing them onto the spirit cruiser. You have no idea what sort of person he is. Our mission is to patrol the Hundred Wraiths black hole. The spatial node it seals connects to a sealed world, a world that is one of routes of retreat for our Luo clan. It's especially important now, so remember our mission."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man glanced at the purple-dressed girl with a deep, meaningful look before he turned around and left.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I will be careful next time." The girl nodded. She took a glance at Yi Yun, and after confirming that he was still unconscious, she left.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was still immersed in white light. He felt empty-headed, and was slowly recovering his strength in his half-awakened state. He opened his eyes a few times and saw the warriors on the spirit cruiser. Many of them wore a flame mark on their right breasts.</p>
<p>The Luo clan and that purple-dressed girl...</p>
<p>Recalling the middle-aged man's words, he figured that the black hole he had encountered was probably called the Hundred Wraiths black hole, and it sealed a spatial node.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man even said that the spatial node connected to a sealed world.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, that 'sealed world' was the world where the Tian Yuan world resided. Due to the existence of the eternal whirlpool, that was indeed a sealed world.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had used a spatial node from the Tian Yuan world to travel to where he was. According to the Azure Yang Lord's memories, the world where the Tian Yuan world resided, was a vessel used to seal a Demon God. The number of spatial nodes connected to the 12 Empyrean Heavens were extremely few in number. There might only be one or two.</p>
<p>That was to say that by using this fixed spatial node to travel to the 12 Empyrean Heavens, it would always take him to a particular region in the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>And the Luo clan they were mentioning...</p>
<p>Yi Yun recalled this name, as he could not help but make some connections.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of years ago, the Tian Yuan world's seal was released because of the Azure Yang Lord. With that, one or two spatial nodes appeared, then naturally, people from the 12 Empyrean Heavens could use those spatial nodes to travel to the Tian Yuan world.</p>
<p>However, as there were very few spatial node, the number of 12 Empyrean Heavens warriors, who went to the Tian Yuan world, were extremely few in number.</p>
<p>And thinking back to the strange girl he met in the Tai Ah Divine City...</p>
<p>That Luo Huo'er, she couldn't be from the Luo clan, right?</p>
<p>However, upon careful thought, it did not seem like a coincidence. As there were only one or two spatial nodes, the spatial node linked two fixed spots, this region in the 12 Empyrean Heavens and the Tian Yuan World.</p>
<p>If this fixed exit was in the Luo clan, then it was not surprising that the Luo clan would use the hidden Tian Yuan world as a route of retreat.</p>
<p>Back then, when Yi Yun separated from the elvish girl, she had indeed said that she came to the Tian Yuan world to seek refuge.</p>
<p>In the Tai Ah Divine City, she was a mystery for she never displayed her true strength.</p>
<p>The Tai Ah Divine City had three rolls of honor, the Heaven, Earth and Man. She was only ranked first in personal wealth, on the Man roll of honor.</p>
<p>As for the Earth roll of honor which ranked people's battle rankings, as well as the Heaven ranking, which ranked the killing of desolate beasts, she had never appeared on them.</p>
<p>People guessed that Luo Huo'er had extraordinary strength, but she never showed it. She only brought a little maidservant named Dong'er with her, fooling around all day in the Tai Ah Divine City.</p>
<p>Although she looked as though she did nothing decent, the Tai Ah Divine City Elders treated her well, because of her mysterious and powerful background.</p>
<p>Her identity was a mystery, and even the Tai Ah Divine City City Lord did not know who she was. The person, who had introduced her into the Tai Ah Divine City, was extremely powerful and seemed like a big shot.</p>
<p>But now to think of it, this so-called "big shot" was probably a steward sent from the Luo clan to the Tian Yuan world.</p>
<p>It was very normal for a super clan, who used a hidden world as a form of retreat, to arrange for a steward to pave the way.</p>
<p>When the family clan was in trouble, and with their survival at stake, the family's children could hide in this small lower realm and remain incognito. As such, they would be naturally safe.</p>
<p>If their family clan was destroyed, then their family's descendants could still pass on their heritage. This was the role of the Tian Yuan world in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>When the Desolate race invaded the Tai Ah Divine City, the Luo clan did not do a thing. They chose to leave.</p>
<p>It was then when Yi Yun separated from Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>The beast horde that Shepherd Boy led to invade the city would have been trivial for the Luo clan. If they acted, they could have destroyed all the desolate beasts, but they did not choose to do so. This was probably because they were facing enemies that were pursuing them.</p>
<p>By recklessly showing power from the 12 Empyrean Heavens, they would greatly increase the risk of being discovered by their enemies. Hence, the family clan had ordered for them to leave the Tai Ah Divine City while keeping a low profile.</p>
<p>Chapter 772: Thousand Fey</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser shuttled through the cosmos, but although it traveled at a high speed, in the vast cosmos, it felt as though it was not moving. It was like a dead branch floating in water in an extremely quiet fashion.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had already arrived in this spirit cruiser for several hours. When he woke up again, he realized he was sleeping on a soft depression. Below him was a thick mat. It was unknown which spirit beast's feathers the mat was made of. It was extremely soft, and he was covered in a cotton quilt which was very warm.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun was already fully awake, but was only extremely weak. Having consumed his blood essence and then using power his body could not withstand, he had received a energy backlash. Following that, after entering the spatial storms, most of his meridians were severed, so his present situation was truly wretched.</p>
<p>If an ordinary warrior were in Yi Yun's situation, it would be a question if they could even recover from those injuries. It was very likely to cause lingering problems in the future, affecting their martial paths.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal Origins, allowing him to constantly absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi to repair his body. Furthermore, his body was a perfect Yang body, so he was not afraid that he could not join his meridians back up. He did not need to worry about this at all.</p>
<p>The only problem was Yi Yun having to spend a period of time being weak.</p>
<p>Inside Yi Yun's Dantian, the injuries the Draco First True Gold avatar and Demon God puppet received were much lighter, especially the Demon God puppet with a strong vitality. It nearly did not lose any of its combat strength. Yi Yun estimated that once he recovered 30&ndash;40% of his strength, he would be able to control the evil energy. Then, he would be able to summon the Demon God puppet, and not be afraid of losing control of it. This way, he would have the means to protect himself.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was only worried about Lin Xintong. Having been caught up in the spatial vortex, it was unknown where Lin Xintong had gone.</p>
<p>"Eh, you have awakened?"</p>
<p>At this moment, a girl about 13&ndash;14 years of age with a round face walked into Yi Yun's resting room. Her skin was white and she had rosy cheeks. She looked very cute.</p>
<p>The girl made a pot of tea after entering the room. Her dressing looked like she was a maid servant, but of course, that pot of tea was not prepared for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have woken up...Thank you for saving me."</p>
<p>Yi Yun said sincerely. If not for this spirit cruiser, he would probably be floating in space for 7&ndash;8 years, slowly recovering his injuries by absorbing minute amounts of Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Although 7&ndash;8 years was considered a very short period of time for Yi Yun's lifespan, but time was very precious in the first half of Yi Yun's martial path.</p>
<p>Warriors had long lifespans, easily a hundred thousand years or a million years. However, they could only improve their cultivation realms fastest in their youth, when their life's potential was at its fullest.</p>
<p>Many warriors would do it in one go and rush to the highest cultivation realm they could. Once their potential was exhausted at a particular realm, or if they encountered a bottleneck, then they would be stuck in that realm. In the hundreds of thousands of years in the future, their cultivation level realm would, at best, improve by one full realm. Unless they encountered a stunning opportunity, nothing surprising would happen.</p>
<p>The 7&ndash;8 years was not something Yi Yun could afford wasting.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's words, the maid servant began to giggle. "The way you speak sounds so funny."</p>
<p>The maid servant felt as though she had discovered a new continent. Having arrived in the 12 Empyrean Heavens for the first time, Yi Yun did not know the 12 Empyrean Heavens's language well. He could only use the memories of what the Azure Yang Lord used back in the Great Empress mystic realm; hence, the sentences he said were broken and sounded weird. But because of that, he was made fun of by this maid servant who still had a young child-like heart.</p>
<p>"If you want to thank, thank my Missus. She was the one who saved you," The maid servant said, but suddenly thought of something, before carrying on. "My name is Tao'er. Stay here and rest. Our spirit cruiser will probably take another 4&ndash;5 days before returning."</p>
<p>Seeing the maid servant carry the teapot away, Yi Yun hurriedly called out to her to stop her. "That...Miss Tao'er, I wonder where your Missus is. I want to meet her and thank her in person."</p>
<p>Having been saved by others, meeting them personally to thank them was courtesy, besides the crux of the issue was...Yi Yun wanted to gather news about Lin Xintong.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun and Lin Xintong attained the third stage of the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra', Yi Yun and Lin Xintong had already begun developing a vague sense of telepathy between themselves. At distances very close to each other, they could vaguely sense each other's presence.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun could not sense her at all. Without a doubt, Lin Xintong was not on the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>But even so, Yi Yun wanted to ask the Missus the maid servant talked about. He wanted to hold on to the unlikely hope of being able to find Lin Xintong's whereabouts.</p>
<p>"That isn't necessary." The maid servant nonchalantly waved her hand. "To speak the truth, our Missus might have saved you, but it's just a trivial matter for her. She wouldn't put her mind on it. My Missus is busily cultivating, and has many important things to do. I believe our Missus will not have the time to meet you."</p>
<p>After the maid servant said with a giggle, she turned around and left.</p>
<p>Seeing the door close, Yi Yun sighed. Indeed, in his present state, he was like a refugee. He was injured from top to bottom. Tao'er's Missus saved him only out of the kindness in her heart. As for thinking highly of him, that was impossible.</p>
<p>It was a question whether he would be able to meet the Missus while the spirit cruiser was out on a mission for 4&ndash;5 days. And even if he met her, she would most likely not help him find Lin Xintong.</p>
<p>"Xintong...nothing must happen to you."</p>
<p>Lin Xintong's nomological insight might be inferior to his, but her cultivation level was similar to his. Since he was fine passing through the spatial turbulence, Lin Xintong should be fine...</p>
<p>Yi Yun tried to consoled himself, and began to meditate. He was severely wounded, so he needed to take the opportunity to recuperate.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser sailed through the cosmos, and the Luo clan seemed to be carrying out a mission. There were people entering and exiting the spirit cruiser on a daily basis.</p>
<p>After all, in the territory of others, Yi Yun did not probe what they were doing. He only stayed in the room, as if he had been forgotten. In the next few days, only Tao'er would occasionally appear in his room, to retrieve something or bring Yi Yun some spirit food.</p>
<p>As time went by, Yi Yun became rather familiar with the maid servant.</p>
<p>Although Tao'er was a 14&ndash;15 year old maid servant, she was already at the peak of the Purple Blood realm and was about to break through into the Yuan foundation realm. Compared to the young elites in the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, she was already nearly a grade above them.</p>
<p>The maid servant wasn't a scheming person. She told Yi Yun many things, and from their conversations, Yi Yun slowly had a general idea of the 12 Empyrean Heavens, or at least, he knew which of the 12 Empyrean Heavens he was in.</p>
<p>Back when Yi Yun planned on heading to the 12 Empyrean Heavens, he wanted to go to the Yang God Empyrean Heaven the most.</p>
<p>The Yang God Empyrean Heaven was the hometown of the Azure Yang Lord, where he rose up, becoming one of the 72 Divine Lords of the Yang God Empyrean Heaven. Finally after being betrayed by his beloved woman, he lost his position as Divine Lord. He was then severely injured, affecting his cultivation level greatly. It could be said that he was left with nothing.</p>
<p>The Yang God Empyrean Heaven buried the Azure Yang Lord's ambitions, and made him obsess over it. Even though the Azure Yang Lord met the ancient Great Empress, and fell in love with her, he never got rid of the obsession regarding the Yang God Empyrean Heaven. Only at his death, did he see through it all.</p>
<p>However, when the Azure Yang Lord slightly opened up the Tian Yuan world's seal, revealing one or two spatial nodes. This spatial node linked not to the Yang God Empyrean Heaven, but the—</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>Chapter 773: Luo Clan, Fire Cloud State!</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Fey!</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a deep breath. Yi Yun had roughly read through information regarding the 12 Empyrean Heavens from the records left behind by the Azure Yang Lord.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was given this name because the rulers were from members of the Fey race.</p>
<p>There was a lot of Fey race of different forms. Their species numbered in the thousands, with all sorts of bloodlines!</p>
<p>And the Fey race was a race that valued bloodlines the most. The ones with strong bloodlines were born to be kings! The ones with weaker bloodlines were born to be mediocre, or even be tagged as slaves.</p>
<p>Yi Yun recalled that Jiang Xiaorou's father was likely from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. After all, the Tian Yuan world's spatial node led to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Or it should be said that Jiang Xiaorou's father was a member of the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>And it was because of this that he left such a powerful bloodline for Jiang Xiaorou.</p>
<p>"I wonder which exact race Jiang Xiaorou's father is..." Yi Yun muttered to himself. Jiang Xiaorou was born in a lower realm, and without the Fey race's inheritance, she could not develop the power of her bloodline. Instead, it should be said that Jiang Xiaorou's blood line was constantly in a sleeping state, yet to be awoken. Compared to the long lifespans of the Fey race, the present Jiang Xiaorou was probably an infant.</p>
<p>Even though Jiang Xiaorou was so weak, her worshiping at the divine bone altar caused the Sacred Spirit that defended the Desolate race to descend, personally approving of Jiang Xiaorou.</p>
<p>In fact, the Sacred Spirit which protected the Desolate race was a Fey beast from the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>In the battle with the Black-armored Demon God, only Jiang Xiaorou could withstand the possession of the Sacred Spirit.</p>
<p>Finally, Jiang Xiaorou's bloodline was coveted by the Black-armored Demon God. He lay a mark on Jiang Xiaorou's body so as to obtain her bloodline.</p>
<p>If Jiang Xiaorou's father was said to be a member of the Fey race, then everything could be explained.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun thought of this, he subconsciously looked at Tao'er and could not help but size her up.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old girl could be said to be like a lotus bud, looking exquisite and cute.</p>
<p>Being sized up by Yi Yun suddenly, Tao'er's face blushed as she fell into panic. "You..why are you looking at me this way."</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled. "Sorry, it was a rash action on my part. I was actually suddenly thinking about Miss Tao'er's name. Are you related to the peach (tao) tree?"</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, plants could become Fey. For example, peach trees were plants that could very easily cultivate into a Fey.</p>
<p>Peach trees were spiritual. In the mortal world, there were thousand-year-old peach trees that were used to ward off evil spirits.</p>
<p>Besides, in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, many peach trees could absorb the spiritual energies of the Heaven and Earth, transforming into young girls.</p>
<p>In response to Yi Yun's question, Tao'er spat out her tongue and said softly, "No. I'm human and my natural talent is very ordinary."</p>
<p>"I see..." Yun'er nodded. He noticed that Tao'er's face looked slightly lost. The position humans had in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was quite awkward.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was ruled by the Fey race, and the Fey race were born with powerful bloodlines, so they had an advantage over the Human race. Furthermore, with the number of humans in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven being fewer in number, they were naturally disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Hence, humans did not enjoy a good status in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, for example Tao'er. She was not only human, her talent was also not outstanding. Under normal circumstances, she would not be able to lead a good life. For Tao'er to become a maid servant of a large clan was already a pretty good outcome.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yi Yun traveled along with the spirit cruiser until it began to make its return voyage. Very suddenly, the Missus who saved Yi Yun appeared in Yi Yun's room.</p>
<p>This Missus looked like she was 16&ndash;17 years old, but of course for warriors, when they broke through to a very high cultivation realm at a young age, they could maintain their 16&ndash;17-year-old appearances for several years, so appearance could not be used as a reference for age. Even Yi Yun himself looked like a 16&ndash;17-year-old youth.</p>
<p>The girl was dressed in a purple dress. Her eyebrows were smoky, and her eyes were like water. She looked like she had a special kind of temperament.</p>
<p>Was she a member of the Fey race?</p>
<p>From the purple-dressed girl's body, Yi Yun could sense an aura different from humans.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the Human and Fey race could coexist peacefully, however, most of the powerful figures in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven were from the Fey race.</p>
<p>"Thank you to this lady for saving this lowly one. I wonder what this lady's name is?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun cupped his fists and thanked the purple-dressed girl from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>"Luo Fengling." The purple-dressed girl answered tersely and simply. "You come from a lower realm?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's proficiency in the language of the 12 Empyrean Heavens was not well-practiced, so it was easy to tell.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded in admission.</p>
<p>"From which lower realm? Roughly where is the spatial node?" The purple-dressed girl asked again.</p>
<p>Hearing the purple-dressed girl inquire, Yi Yun hesitated slightly. He decided to hide the matter that he came from the Tian Yuan world.</p>
<p>Previously, he had heard the purple-dressed girl say that the world the Tian Yuan world resided in was an important route of retreat for the Luo clan, mainly because the Tian Yuan world was hidden and difficult to be discovered.</p>
<p>Even if the route of retreat was not considered highly confidential, the Luo clan naturally did not want too many people to know. After all, they seemed to be at war with an unknown faction. In the intense battle in the past, even Luo Huo'er, a direct descendant had been evacuated to the lower realm, indicating how powerful their opponent was.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, if Luo Fengling knew that he came from the Tian Yuan world, then to prevent information from leaking, what if she put him under house arrest?</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was seriously injured, and had no way to protect himself.</p>
<p>"Miss Luo, this lowly one comes from an obscure small planet. The planet's martial civilization is limited, and as there's lacking heritage in spatial dimension laws, this lowly one isn't proficient in it. While traveling to the 12 Empyrean Heavens, a spatial storm was encountered, losing my way. If you want to ask me where the spatial node is, this lowly one does not know really know." Yi Yun lied.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling nodded. Yi Yun was clearly a inconsequential warrior from the lower realm. Luo Fengling did not care about much he said, so she naturally did not have the mind to doubt him.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun coming from the Tian Yuan world, Luo Fengling did not think of it. She did not believe Yi Yun could pass through the Hundred Wraiths black hole's Tian Yuan world spatial node.</p>
<p>"What's your name?" Luo Fengling asked again.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun."</p>
<p>"Alright, Yi Yun. My Luo clan is currently enrolling foreign races as disciples. Previously, my Luo clan experienced a massive war and suffered heavy casualties, so it is in need of revitalizing its strength."</p>
<p>"I am attached to the Luo clan's Fire Cloud State! The Fire Cloud State disciples came out venturing actually to search for non-Luo surname bearing disciples with superior qualifications to get them to join the Fire Cloud State!"</p>
<p>"You just came from a lower realm to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, and since you do not know your way or anyone, be it heritage or resources, it would be difficult for you to obtain them. Joining a large faction is a good choice."</p>
<p>"In my opinion, for you to single-handedly have the ability to come from a lower realm to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven means that your cultivation foundation is considered acceptable. Your body was nearly in shambles, yet your life force hung on. Furthermore, in the past few days, you have actually recovered greatly, surprising me. If you wish, you can join my Fire Cloud State and become an external disciple!"</p>
<p>"However, I need to warn you that although my Luo clan beat our opponents in the previous war, we only forced them into retreat. It is unknown when they would make a comeback. When that happens, you might be involved in the war, and your life might be left up to fate. You have to consider carefully if you want to join my Luo clan's Fire Cloud State."</p>
<p>Chapter 774: Mt. Fengling</p>
<p>After all the missions were completed, the Fire Cloud State's spirit cruiser shot out a beam of light, tearing through the void open. Following that, the spirit cruiser entered the spatial vortex and completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser was a massive object. Back when Yi Yun was sucked into the spirit cruiser, he estimated it to be dozens of miles long.</p>
<p>It was unknown how many refining masters were needed to produce such a massive star fortress. Furthermore, the cost was definitely extremely exaggerated. And for such a massive spirit cruiser to tear space in one strike to do spatial transference required vast amounts of energy. The relics that provided this energy was also a huge expense.</p>
<p>These thoughts flashed past Yi Yun's mind. Having first arrived in the 12 Empyrean Heavens, he could only use certain external objects to roughly estimate the gap between the factions in the 12 Empyrean Heavens and the Tian Yuan world.</p>
<p>Yi Yun eventually opted to join the Luo clan as it was very beneficial for him. His body was in a terrible condition, so he needed a large faction's protection to slowly recover his Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Space was torn open as the spirit cruiser successfully completing its Void Transference.</p>
<p>Through the cruiser's window, all he saw was an endless red sea of clouds. He had previously heard Tao'er introduce this sea of clouds to him. It was said that this mass of clouds had existed for hundreds of millions of years and had never dissipated before. The name of the Fire Cloud State was because of the rolling red clouds.</p>
<p>In the midst of the endless red sea of clouds floated a giant planet.</p>
<p>The planet was blue in color, and about 80% of the planet's surface was ocean. There was a dark red continent in the middle and was the so-called Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State actually occupied a planet. All the seas on this planet, including the red clouds surrounding it was the territory of the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at this planet, it looked about a few thousand miles in diameter, roughly the same size as his home planet, Earth. In the vicinity of the planet, there were a large number of Fey beasts shuttling through the sea of clouds.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the vast size of the world, these Fey beasts were much larger than the desolate beasts Yi Yun encountered in the Divine Wilderness.</p>
<p>Yi Yun saw a golden fish about 500 kilometers long. Its shape was that of a fish, but it had dragon whiskers by its mouth. Every time it opened its mouth, it would suck and expel red clouds, like a volcano eruption. However, this was just its breathing.</p>
<p>Other than that, there were feathered creatures with colorful feathers. They were gigantic pythons with single horns that resembled either dragons or snakes. The dragon horses that pulled spirit boats were endless in number.</p>
<p>In comparison, although the spirit cruiser Yi Yun was on was massive in size, it appeared inconspicuous when placed in such a backdrop.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser began to slow down. The closer they were to the Fire Cloud State, the more amazed Yi Yun became. Although he had heard from Tao'er describe this to him, it was not as shocking to see it for himself.</p>
<p>Compared to the Tian Yuan world and the Divine Wilderness, the Fire Cloud State was so much more flourishing.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State could not be considered big, as it was much smaller than the Tian Yuan world, however, in the Fire Cloud State, there all sorts of floating immortal mountains, immortal palaces, spirit statues, spirit cruisers, etc. They seemed endless and was a dazzling sight.</p>
<p>And the experts here were barely countable.</p>
<p>In the Tian Yuan world, Heaven Ascension realm warriors were already a dominating force, but in the Fire Cloud State, they were considered nothing much.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun rode on the spirit cruiser, it went straight to the middle of the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>There were endless immortal mountains here, and each immortal mountain was nearly ten miles high. Such tall immortal mountains had immense weight, but through the support of arrays, they were floating in mid air. Such acts were impossible in the lower realms.</p>
<p>After the spirit cruiser flew past an immortal mountain, Yi Yun, together with Tao'er and Luo Fengling took a small spirit boat that was deployed from the mothership, finally landing on the top of that mountain.</p>
<p>This immortal mountain was one that belonged to Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>Over the days, Yi Yun had learned from Tao'er that Luo Fengling was an influential figure amongst the younger generation in the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was from the Fire Cloud State's Heaven Fire Hall which gathered all the top talent amongst the younger disciples in the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>Of course, there were quite a number of such geniuses, numbering more than a hundred. Luo Fengling was one of them, and her position amongst the hundred or so elites was above average.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling's advantage would be her young age. She was about Yi Yun's age.</p>
<p>Now, Luo Fengling was at the perfect-Yuan Opening realm, higher than Yi Yun by a minor realm. She still had a long way to go and had a promising future.</p>
<p>And for the older core disciples in the Heaven Fire Hall, their ages ranged in the hundreds. For warriors in the 12 Empyrean Heavens with long lifespans, they were still considered juniors despite being a few hundred years old.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun disembarked the spirit cruiser, accompanying Yi Yun were three other young disciples, two man and a woman. They wore differently and had different cultivation levels. These three people were the new disciples the spirit cruiser had recruited from the various smaller worlds.</p>
<p>Back then, the spirit cruiser had gathered about a hundred people, but only three of them were chosen by Luo Fengling. Including Yi Yun, there were four prospective disciples.</p>
<p>"The mountain beneath your feet is called Mt. Fengling and was named after me. From today onwards, the four of you will be my followers!" Luo Fengling spoke simply. "I'll first introduce myself. I'm Luo Fengling, a disciple of the Fire Cloud State's Heaven Fire Hall!"</p>
<p>"Amongst the younger generation in the Fire Cloud State, there are two halls, namely the Heaven Fire Hall and the Earth Fire Hall. To put it plainly, the Heaven Fire Hall are personal disciples!"</p>
<p>"Every Heaven Fire Hall disciple has a mountain for themselves. The entire Fire Cloud State has a total of 108 Heaven Fire mountains, which also mean 108 Heaven Fire Hall disciples. The number is fixed so only the lost of one would another be replaced!"</p>
<p>"Every Heaven Fire Hall disciple can recruit external disciples as stewards. When comparing steward disciples to other external disciples, it is easier for them to obtain resources from the Fire Cloud State's Luo clan. At the same time, they have to do some miscellaneous chores."</p>
<p>As Luo Fengling spoke, the few steward disciples exchanged glances and nodded.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fire Hall disciples were elites of the Fire Cloud State's younger generation. These elites main task was to cultivate, and with them in charge of a mountain, there were definitely many chores to handle.</p>
<p>On a mountain, there was all sorts of chores like resource allocation, the feeding of Fey beasts, the planting of herbs that needed people manning them. These matters naturally could not be done by the Heaven Fire Hall disciple themselves, so there was a need for people to serve these Heaven Fire Hall disciples.</p>
<p>That was the job of steward disciples.</p>
<p>In fact, steward disciples was just a great job. They could follow a Heaven Fire Hall disciple, and at times, obtain resources the Heaven Fire Hall disciple did not use. That itself was a great benefit for them, so many ordinary disciples yearned to become steward disciples.</p>
<p>"On Mt. Fengling, there will be many chores, but similarly, there will be greater opportunities. As long as you dedicate yourselves to cultivation, I will not treat you badly. In the future, if you display good cultivation talent, I would nominate you into the Earth Fire Hall. When you enter the Earth Fire Hall, you would be considered a true disciple of the Luo clan! Are all of you agreeable to that?"</p>
<p>As Luo Fengling said, she scanned the four.</p>
<p>There was nothing disagreeable about this matter. The other three yearned it greatly and even Yi Yun nodded his head slightly. His priority was to heal his injuries, and did not mind where he was as long as it was safe. As a steward disciple, he would be inconspicuous so his safety would not be a problem. Mt Fengling was considered expedient.</p>
<p>Chapter 775: Green-eyed</p>
<p>Yi Yun and the other three people agreed and chose to stay on Mt. Fengling. Luo Fengling was not surprised with their choice, as without any exaggeration, it was a good deal that numerous people dreamed of, so how could they refuse her offer?</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Fengling suddenly glanced at Yi Yun. "You cultivate in pure Yang laws, right?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a perfect Yang body, but as he had suffered severe injuries, leaving most of his meridians severed, his pure Yang body was not obvious. But even so, Luo Fengling could sense Yi Yun's attainment in pure Yang laws, hence, motivating her question.</p>
<p>After all, the Luo clan focused on fire elemental laws, which had its similarities with pure Yang laws.</p>
<p>"Yes," Yi Yun nodded.</p>
<p>"Alright! Although I'm in charge of Mt. Fengling, I do not really deal with the chores at all. I need to enter reclusive cultivation to prepare for the Luo Divine Hall's test. A typical reclusive cultivation of mine would be a year or two, so there will be many matters on Mt. Fengling that will be your responsibility. Yi Yun, since you are proficient in pure Yang laws, you should have some sense of fire-elemental materials. I'll put you in charge of the procurement of materials and the management of Mt. Fengling's material storehouse.</p>
<p>"As for Sun Lie, Dong Hu and Bai Wei, you will be in charge of rearing the Fey beasts. On Mt. Fengling, there are many Fey beasts, and they need to be let out to pasture and fed on a daily basis. This shall be your responsibility!"</p>
<p>Luo Fengling nonchalantly gave them instructions and was about to enter reclusion!</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not mind Luo Fengling's order, but was slightly surprised by the "Luo Divine Hall" Luo Fengling mentioned.</p>
<p>Make preparations for the Luo Divine Hall's test?</p>
<p>Fire Cloud State had two halls that took in young disciples—Heaven Fire Hall and Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fire Hall was already considered the highest, as for the Earth Fire Hall, even though it was a secondary, those in it were still official disciples. In comparison, Yi Yun would just be an exterior disciple, and considered titular. Only by being outstanding would he be promoted to the Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Luo Divine Hall was on a much higher level than the Heaven Fire Hall or Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not help but ask, "May I know what is the Luo Divine Hall test that Senior Luo mentioned?"</p>
<p>"Oh?" Luo Fengling's eyebrows knitted slightly. Typical exterior disciples would hold their breaths when they saw her, and during any intereaction, they would only receive instructions and not dare probe further. She did not expect Yi Yun to ask a question that had nothing to do with what she had instructed. Furthermore, from his appearance, he did not seem to fear her.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling answered Yi Yun, "The Heaven Fire Hall is where the most elite disciples from the Fire Cloud State gather. As for the Luo Divine Hall, it is the place where the top geniuses of the entire Luo clan gather. The Luo clan is extremely massive, and my Fire Cloud State is just one out of 196 states of the Luo clan. And above the 196 states, there is the Luo Divine Empyrean Capital occupied by the Luo clan's royalty! This Luo Divine Hall is in the Empyrean Capital, a sacred land all disciples from the various states look forward to!"</p>
<p>When Luo Fengling said those words, she revealed a trace of longing. Entering the Luo Divine Hall was always Luo Fengling's dream.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was secretly horrified hearing this. 196 states? Along with the Luo clan's royalty...how massive was it!?</p>
<p>With so many states, and with each state having at least a hundred personal disciples, the competition was clearly immense.</p>
<p>Then Luo Huo'er...Could she be in the Empyrean Capital?</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know Luo Huo'er's actual identity in the Luo clan. According to what she said, the faction she was in was facing a disaster. As a direct descendant, she had been specially given protection and had been evacuated to the Tian Yuan world. Then, Luo Huo'er's identity had to be something special.</p>
<p>Just the number of disciples in the peripheral 196 states was a massive number, so it was unlikely for the Luo clan to give all of them special protection.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun could not ask Luo Fengling about Luo Huo'er. He could not explain how he knew of Luo Huo'er, and if it involved anything confidential, he might encounter trouble.</p>
<p>After Luo Fengling finished speaking, she ignored Yi Yun. She was in a rush for time, eager to begin her reclusive cultivation in a chamber.</p>
<p>"This reclusion of mine would take at least a few months. If you encounter any problems in your cultivation, you can ask me after I'm done with my reclusion to which I'll answer you. Right, this relic is for you. It is good for healing your wounds!"</p>
<p>As Luo Fengling spoke, she flicked her finger, sending a crystalline relic towards Yi Yun which he caught.</p>
<p>The relic was warm and moist to the touch. Before Yi Yun had the chance to look at it, Luo Fengling had already disappeared.</p>
<p>And after Luo Fengling left, Sun Lie, Dong Hu and Bai Wei cast their gazes at Yi Yun simultaneously.</p>
<p>Their gazes had a malevolent hint in them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's job was to manage the material storehouse. The materials collected by Mt. Fengling were naturally very valuable, so during while managing all of this, even some less important materials would be of immense value for them.</p>
<p>The advantages of being in charge of the material storehouse as well as procurement was obvious.</p>
<p>It was definitely a gravy train.</p>
<p>As for them, their main task was to feed the Fey beasts!</p>
<p>Feeding the Fey beasts, letting them pasture and cleaning the beast pens was hard work. Other than hard work, there was no benefit to it.</p>
<p>The differences between the jobs were huge!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Luo Fengling had even thrown a relic at Yi Yun for him to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>Looking at the relic in Yi Yun's hand, the crystalline relic exuded a warm glow like jade. It was definitely a relic of superior grade.</p>
<p>This was a relic refined by the Luo clan, so even if Luo Fengling did not mind it, its value was immense for them.</p>
<p>After all, in the 12 Empyrean Heavens, there were a lot of mortals as well as warriors who lived in the lower echelons. They were born in the 12 Empyrean Heavens and with their ordinary backgrounds, they could not receive much resources. The competition they faced was greater than those faced in the lower realm, and at times were even worse off than the lower realm warriors!</p>
<p>They were naturally envious when they saw Yi Yun getting such a good job and having a relic in hand!</p>
<p>"I say, Kid! You come from the lower realms, right?" Just from listening to Yi Yun speak, they could roughly guess that Yi Yun was not an original resident of the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at the person speaking. His eyes were slender and he had dark skin, he looked like the kind of person who refused to suffer any losses. His name was Sun Lie.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not respond and could not be bothered with such people.</p>
<p>Sun Lie chuckled and licked his lips, "Kid, it's useless even if you don't admit it. You probably came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven just recently. The lower realms you come from is a land of savages. The strength of warriors there are negligible. Being able to come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven makes you a general amongst dwarves."</p>
<p>With him saying this, a youth beside him, who had a stocky build, roared with laughter. His name was Dong Hu.</p>
<p>"Kid, why are you so seriously injured? Were you beaten the moment you came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven? Hehe! The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven isn't like your hometown. In your hometown, you can walk anyway you like, but in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, you have to crawl. Being too arrogant will get you beaten, just like your present situation."</p>
<p>"However, getting beaten is a good thing. At least it will open your eyes. The environment we grew up in is not something you can imagine. So Kid, let this young lord take a look at that relic in your hand."</p>
<p>Chapter 776: Establishing Authority</p>
<p>Dong Hu was eyeing the relic in Yi Yun's hand. He naturally was not afraid of the injured Yi Yun. Even if Yi Yun was not injured, he was not afraid of him since he had three people on his side. Furthermore, Dong Hu had grown up in a Fey race tribal clan that was located in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Although the clan's bloodline was average, members of the Fey race had naturally stronger bodies than humans, what more Yi Yun who came from a lower realm.</p>
<p>As for whether this matter would result in Luo Fengling's unhappiness, Dong Hu was not worried.</p>
<p>A person like Luo Fengling was dedicated to cultivation. She came out of reclusion once every one or two years, and she what she pursued was her entry into the Luo Divine Hall, becoming a powerful figure in the Luo clan. Compared to Luo Fengling's martial path, the matters between them, steward disciples, were completely trivial, so why would she care about it?</p>
<p>Even if Luo Fengling came out of reclusion, they might not even be able to meet her. And even if they met her, it was impossible for Yi Yun to complain to her. Has it ever occurred where a court maiden complains to the emperor after a fight amongst court maidens?</p>
<p>There were always competing interests between disciples in a sect, it was extremely common. Dong Hu even wanted to take a slice of Yi Yun's pie—the responsibility over the procurement of fire-elemental materials—in a bid to obtain some benefits.</p>
<p>"Kid, it's your first time here in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Since you do not know your way or anyone, you will be easily bullied. If not for that, you would not have been beaten up badly. I propose that you follow me and be my subordinate. I'll promise your protection." Dong Hu said with a chuckle. If this kid fell for it, he could help him feed the Fey beasts and leave the good procurement job for himself. He naturally did not mind protecting Yi Yun in that case.</p>
<p>In a faction like the Fire Cloud State, being alone was not easy. Taking in some minions allowed him to slowly prosper.</p>
<p>"Be your subordinate?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun played with the relic in his hand. In fact, Yi Yun did not care too much for the relic Luo Fengling gave to him. If he was an ordinary late-stage Yuan Opening realm warrior, he would have cured most of his wounds by using this relic.</p>
<p>However, be it in terms of cultivation technique or nomological insights, including his Yuan foundation or Dao Seed, they were incomparable to an ordinary warrior.</p>
<p>The more powerful a warrior was, the stronger their vitality, so it was more difficult for them to suffer injuries. Correspondingly, once they were injured, the cost of recovery was also greater.</p>
<p>Such a relic could not have much effect on the heavy injuries Yi Yun had suffered.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's recovery mainly relied on the Purple Crystal. For the past few days, he had relied on the Purple Crystal to heal himself on the spirit cruiser, so he had already recovered a bit of his strength.</p>
<p>Although he had recovered a bit of his strength, Yi Yun could not use Yuan Qi to do battle. This was because the moment he used it, his meridians would be activated, causing a relapse from his old injuries. He might get a thrilling experience by using a move or two, but Yi Yun would have to pay a greater price after that, so it was not worth it.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun did not care about the relic, he did not plan on giving it to these villains.</p>
<p>"Your name is Dong Hu (Winter Tiger), I guess you were a tiger that gained sentience?" Yi Yun rebutted, causing Dong Hu's face to stiffen. Immediately following that, his expression turned ugly.</p>
<p>The Fey race was split into three major categories—Heaven Fey, Earth Fey and Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fey was the nobility of the Fey race. There were very few Heaven Fey in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, so they typically established large family clans, large sects or kingdoms.</p>
<p>For example, the Luo clan was a Heaven Fey.</p>
<p>All Heaven Fey species had a long history. Noble blood flowed in their bodies which could be traced to primordial powerful figures of the Fey race. However, the richness in their bloodline differed considerably amongst offspring from different families.</p>
<p>If one's bloodline was rich enough, they could awaken the powers of the primordial Fey race as they matured. This would then be no trifling matter.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fey were a higher level of existence in the Fey race. Their appearances tended to resemble humans. The babies they gave birth to were in the shape of human infants, so other than the difference in bloodline, they looked almost identical. Only very few members of a species with sufficiently powerful bloodlines could transform into an Ancient Fey. That would be their final combat form.</p>
<p>The second Fey race species was the Earth Fey, a species far inferior to the Heaven Fey.</p>
<p>They were actually originally beasts or plants. After experiencing a sufficiently long period of growth by absorbing the essence of the Heaven and Earth, they could suddenly achieve sentience one day. Slowly, they could cultivate in the Dao, eventually taking on human form.</p>
<p>They had equivalent intelligence as humans and were considered half-human and half-Fey.</p>
<p>As Earth Fey bred, their numbers grew greatly, slowly resulting in the Earth Fey species.</p>
<p>The born offspring of Earth Fey would usually have beast-like characteristics. For example, the infant would have fangs, claws, fur, tails, etc. By slowly cultivating, they would completely transform.</p>
<p>Members of the Earth Fey had an innate inferiority complex when facing members of the Heaven Fey.</p>
<p>But compared to humans, they would have an innate sense of superiority.</p>
<p>The bodies of Earth Fey species were significantly stronger than human bodies, but...Their perception was inferior to humans. To put it bluntly, their intellect was worse than humans, so in terms of the creation of heritage, learning cultivation techniques or matters regarding nomological insights, they were inferior to humans.</p>
<p>The final third race, the Ancient Fey, were actually ancestors of the Heaven Fey species. They came into being from the condensation of Heaven and Earth essence right at the beginning of the Universe's formation. They were the first lives in the Universe, and were an existence that approached natural gods.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey had interesting legends to them. For example, Fey race legends speak of ancient Fey dragons or Bai Ze.</p>
<p>They could also produce offspring, but their ability to reproduce was dismal. The Ancient Fey were originally few in number, so as time went on, they turned nearly extinct.</p>
<p>Hence, when talking about the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, only the Heaven and Earth Fey were typically mentioned.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State's Heaven Fire Hall and Earth Fire Hall's classification also came from a result of the Heaven and Earth Fey.</p>
<p>Dong Hu's family clan belonged to an Earth Fey species. Furthermore, his ancestor was a tiger, who lived tens of thousands of years in the woods, that achieved the Dao.</p>
<p>This was not supposed to be a history worth flaunting, and not only did Yi Yun allude to Dong Hu's humble origins, he even used the words "tiger that gained sentience" instead of "tiger achieving the Dao".</p>
<p>This was implying that they as members of the Fey race, they were analogous to the spirits found in supernatural novels written by humans, so there was no way he could tolerate this.</p>
<p>Dong Hu was infuriated, while the girl named Bai Wei beside him began chuckling. As she laughed at Dong Hu's origins, she put on a look as though she was watching a good show, anticipating how Yi Yun would put an end to this matter.</p>
<p>Was Yi Yun not afraid of death? Why did he dare to offend Dong Hu and Sun Lie despite being so seriously injured? In the Luo clan, battles between disciples were usually intense.</p>
<p>Dong Hu gave a nasty look after he was mocked by Bai Wei. As he looked at Yi Yun, he said ferociously, "You lowly human, you even come from a lower realm. You have no rights to mock my ancestor. This is the first time I, Dong Hu, came to the Fire Cloud State. I have all this power but with no way to show for it. Today, I shall use you to establish my authority!"</p>
<p>As Dong Hu spoke, he grabbed at Yi Yun. His body was large and muscular, and the hair on his body was extremely thick. He looked just like a tiger!</p>
<p>The Earth Fey species may have poor perception, but their physiques far exceeded humans'. Especially with Dong Hu's ancestor being a tiger that achieved the Dao, his physical strength was extremely terrifying!</p>
<p>As he watched Dong Hu charge at him, Yi Yun retreated and in an instant took five steps back.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had recovered slightly, he did not dare to freely fight with others because it might cause his old injuries to relapse.</p>
<p>Against Dong Hu's claw, Yi Yun circulated energy to his Dantian. "Whew!"</p>
<p>A beam of light shot out from Yi Yun's Dantian, straight at Dong Hu!</p>
<p>This beam of light was Yi Yun's Draco First True Gold avatar.</p>
<p>Yi Yun himself was injured so he could not fight, but he had recovered a minimal amount of strength. He could already barely use the Draco First True Gold avatar. As for the more powerful Demon God puppet, Yi Yun was afraid he would lose control of the evil energy, so he did not summon it out.</p>
<p>As for the recognizing the Draco First True Gold avatar by Dong Hu and company, it was something he did not need to worry about. If it was a Draco First True Gold in its most primordial state, there might be some well-learned members of the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven who could recognize it. However, Yi Yun's Draco First True Gold had already metamorphosed into a body of flesh and blood. In addition to the Azure Yang Lord's refinement for tens of millions of years, even if weaker mighty members of the Fey race saw it, they might not be able to recognize the material of the avatar.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Dong Hu did not even manage to make out the beam of light, but he did not lose his offensive momentum.</p>
<p>"Bam!"</p>
<p>Dong Hu's claw grabbed at the Draco First True Gold avatar's chest, but before he could feel triumphant, he felt like he had grabbed a divine piece of metal. The force from his claw could not tear apart the Draco First True Gold avatar's defenses.</p>
<p>"What is this?"</p>
<p>Dong Hu was alarmed. At this moment, the Draco First True Gold avatar punched Dong Hu straight in the face.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful Dong Hu's body was, he was inferior to a divine material like Draco First True Gold. This punch resulted in a horrifying cracking sound.</p>
<p>Dong Hu's vision turned black as his legs went limp. The immense momentum caused the tiles beneath him to crack, as he sunk into the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh? Such a hard head?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also slightly surprised. He believed that the Draco First True Gold avatar could smash Dong Hu's skull to pieces with that punch. Even if the Fey race possessed a strong vitality, he would have to be bedridden for a month or two. He never expected that in that punch, the Draco First True Gold avatar felt an immense resistance. Dong Hu's head could definitely be used as a hammer.</p>
<p>But even so, Dong Hu was in a daze from being hit by the punch and his mind was momentarily vacant.</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar leaped up at that moment and jumped right in front of Dong Hu, sending him a flying kick!</p>
<p>This kick landed on Dong Hu's face!</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar's leg was too hard, so it smashed Dong Hu's nose bridge in. Like a sandbag, Dong Hu's massive body was sent flying by the Draco First True Gold avatar with a kick. But suddenly, the Draco First True Gold avatar grabbed the flying Dong Hu's ankle and smashed him down into the ground!</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>There was a resounding explosion as Dong Hu's entire body was smashed deep into the ground. Many of his joints were broken, and he suffered ruptured organs and severed meridians. His injuries were probably not much lighter than Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, ah!"</p>
<p>Dong Hu screamed in the pile of rubble. Sun Lie and Bai Wei, who were watching by the sidelines, turned pale. They did not expect the sudden turn of events. The severely injured Yi Yun's Dantian, who looked as though he was at Death's doorstep, had suddenly produced a malignant star that flew out of his Dantian, brutally beating Dong Hu in the process.</p>
<p>"What is this thing? Is it a puppet or what?"</p>
<p>Chapter 777: Avatar? Puppet?</p>
<p>"What...is this thing..."</p>
<p>After being brutally slammed to the ground by the Draco First True Gold avatar, Dong Hu's back was being held down under the Draco First True Gold avatar's foot, causing him to spew blood out from his mouth.</p>
<p>Bai Wei and Sun Lie's eyes were staring straight at the Draco First True Gold avatar that had suddenly appeared. He looked exactly like Yi Yun, with the only difference being the pale gold robe he wore. His skin looked like it had a metallic texture to it, somewhat different from Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>"Avatar?"</p>
<p>Bai Wei's tiny mouth opened as she found it extremely astonishing.</p>
<p>"How can it be an avatar? It has to be a puppet." Sun Lie said with an ashen face.</p>
<p>There were many similarities between avatars and puppets, for example, they could both be used to kill enemies. There were also many puppets that were manufactured to look extremely lifelike, and there were unsurprising cases where it would look identical to its master.</p>
<p>An avatar could also look exactly identical to the original body, but there were two essential differences between avatars and puppets.</p>
<p>The first difference was strength and growth potential. A avatar's strength was largely determined by one's true body. Their nomological insights were identical, and the avatar could grow, cultivating like the true body. In contrast, the moment a puppet was refined, its strength would be fixed. At best, there could be some slight modifications in the future.</p>
<p>The second difference was the difference in importance between an avatar and a puppet. An avatar's soul sea had a soul split from the warrior's original body; as for a puppet, it had at best a spiritual imprint.</p>
<p>The loss of an avatar would deal a major blow to the original body's soul sea, and might even affect the person's future success.</p>
<p>As for the loss of a puppet, it was actually just the lost of a treasure. With sufficient wealth, it was considered nothing.</p>
<p>Sun Lie believed Yi Yun had summoned a puppet, mainly because an avatar, which had the ability to grow, required extremely valuable materials. It was difficult to find them, and it was extremely difficult to refine one!</p>
<p>The more valuable the materials, the longer it would take to refine an avatar. Typically, it needed a mighty senior to spend a long period of time to refine an avatar.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun's Draco First True Gold avatar, it was refined by the Azure Yang Lord personally. After the Azure Yang Lord died, it had been refined in the God Advent Tower's arrays for tens of millions of years!</p>
<p>Sun Lie absolutely refused to believe that such a precious item would come into the possession of a warrior from the lower realm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strength of the Draco First True Gold avatar was too powerful, so Sun Lie could not accept that it was a junior's avatar.</p>
<p>"Puppet? Even if it's a puppet, it's so powerful!"</p>
<p>As Bai Wei rolled her eyes, she looked at the Draco First True Gold avatar with intense jealousy, she coveted it greatly!</p>
<p>She had looked down on Yi Yun from the very beginning. Although her ancestor was a white peony that achieved its Dao, she felt a sense of superiority when she saw humans in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, especially humans from the lower realm. She thought of them as bumpkins with poor backgrounds.</p>
<p>Now, she was naturally stunned to suddenly see a bumpkin nonchalantly produce a powerful puppet that was refined with superior techniques.</p>
<p>There were such good things in the lower realm? To refine such a puppet would definitely consume a lot of resources, yet this bumpkin had managed to obtain it.</p>
<p>It was a true waste of a treasure for a bumpkin to possess such a good item. Why wasn't it hers?</p>
<p>Bai Wei felt an imbalance in her mind, she was even thinking of means to obtain this puppet.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dong Hu was still screaming on the ground. Having been beaten down to the ground by a human, he gnashed his teeth because it was too shameful.</p>
<p>"Little bastard, don't you fall into my hands..." Dong Hu's mouth was full of blood and his nose had collapsed in, but he still squeezed out those malicious words from the gaps in his teeth.</p>
<p>The tiger species was a very aggressive species, they were the kind who would refuse to take soft stance even if they were beaten to a pulp.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun raised his foot and ruthlessly stepped on Dong Hu's neck, preventing him from producing another sound.</p>
<p>"Gee, this ground sure is hard."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun stepped on Dong Hu, he began to comment on the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's ground.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could tell that Mt. Fengling did not augment itself with too many arrays, yet this mountain was extremely firm. It was much firmer than the Tian Yuan world. If not, the Draco First True Gold avatar's nonchalant throw would definitely have sent Dong Hu deep underground, and not just cause a human-shaped crater.</p>
<p>Other than that, the space here was more stable. A move that could tear through the void in the Tian Yuan world was not even able to distort space here.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, if the battle between Heaven Ascension realm warriors was considered, they could cause the world to tremble while fighting in the lower realm, bringing chaos to their universe.</p>
<p>But in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, their battle would appear ungaudy. It wouldn't differ much from a battle between Yuan foundation realm realm warriors.</p>
<p>"A large world born out of the chaos during the beginning of the Universe is indeed different." Yi Yun said with amazement, but the strength in his foot did not loosen at all.</p>
<p>"It ends here!" Sun Lie spoke out. The species he belonged to had relations with Dong Hu's species, so the two knew each other. "Kid, what are you doing? By brutally beating a fellow disciple, aren't you afraid of being punished by the Fire Cloud State?"</p>
<p>The competition between Fire Cloud State disciples was intense, but if someone publicly killed a fellow disciple, it was a serious crime.</p>
<p>Sun Lie put forward the idea of a possible lashback in order to threaten Yi Yun, but Yi Yun took no such nonsense. While still stepping on Dong Hu's neck, he said, "I have to stop because you say so? Who do you think you are!? Previously, when Dong Hu wanted to make a move on an injured me, you were standing by the side, deriving pleasure as though you were watching a show. Now, you suddenly thought of the Fire Cloud State's rules? What a joke."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun spoke, he finally lifted his foot. "Alright, since you want to stop me, then you can take his place to lie down here!"</p>
<p>Towards Sun Lie and Bai Wei, Yi Yun had no plans on letting them off. They were no different from Dong Hu, the only difference was that Dong Hu had acted first.</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar began walking towards Sun Lie and Bai Wei.</p>
<p>The duo's expressions immediately turned ugly. They had witnessed the abilities of the Draco First True Gold avatar, and since they were on Dong Hu's level, they were definitely no match for the Draco First True Gold avatar.</p>
<p>"Human, don't you think that you can do anything you want because of a puppet. You were lucky to find a puppet in an ancient ruin, but a puppet can't grow. In time to come, it will have to be abandoned!"</p>
<p>"The tides will change, now that you have offended all of us, when your puppet can't keep up with our strength, you will suffer a miserable end!" Sun Lie threatened Yi Yun, hoping that this method could scare Yi Yun off. However, Yi Yun only sneered and nonchalantly said to the Draco First True Gold avatar, "Beat him down."</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>The ground behind the Draco First True Gold avatar exploded, as he transformed into a pale gold beam of light and charged at Sun Lie!</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar was extremely fast, so it instantly appeared in front of Sun Lie!</p>
<p>Sun Lie's pupil's constricted. With a flip of his right hand, a large saber appeared. An intense flame burning on the blade as he slashed at the Draco First True Gold avatar. He also cultivated fire-elemental laws, and it was this reason that made it easier for him to enter Fire Cloud State!</p>
<p>"Die!" Sun Lie roared but the Draco First True Gold avatar only lifted its right arm.</p>
<p>"Dang!"</p>
<p>An arm directly blocked Sun Lie's blade!</p>
<p>Chapter 778: Beating into Submission</p>
<p>Sun Lie was also from a Fey race that was known for its strength. However, his saber strike that used all his strength had failed to even lacerate the Draco First True Gold avatar's body of flesh.</p>
<p>Even the Black-armored Demon God had previously failed to take down the Draco First True Gold avatar, so what more Sun Lie?</p>
<p>"You!"</p>
<p>Sun Lie was alarmed and at this moment, the Draco First True Gold avatar had sent a punch straight into Sun Lie's abdomen. With a quivering jerk, Sun Lie's body bent like a shrimp.</p>
<p>The gastric juices in Sun Lie's stomach spewed out from the blow, it was an excruciating pain.</p>
<p>"Little bastard!" Sun Lie cursed. Despite being beaten into such a wretched state, he refused to concede defeat. It was completely unacceptable for members from these Fey race species that enjoyed a strong sense of racial superiority to submit to a human from the lower realm.</p>
<p>Hearing Sun Lie's invective, Yi Yun, who was standing far away, pricked up his eyebrow. This sort of person just needed to be beaten into submission.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood motionless while the Draco First True Gold avatar began giving Sun Lie a brutal beating.</p>
<p>Although Sun Lie resisted, he was no match for the Draco First True Gold avatar. The saber in his hand was forcefully taken away by the Draco First True Gold avatar, and with a wipe from the avatar's pale gold palm, pure Yang Yuan Qi devoured all the flames on the saber!</p>
<p>"Bam! Bam! Bam!"</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar sent out numerous punches, each one striking at Sun Lie's abdomen. In a matter of seconds, Sun Lie went from spewing out gastric juices to blood.</p>
<p>With another strike from an elbow into Sun Lie's back, Sun Lie felt as though his spine had fractured as he went limp and crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar grabbed Sun Lie's ankle and with a throw, flung him on Dong Hu's back.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>Dong Hu let out a tragic scream as he and Sun Lie were piled together in a heap.</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar placed his foot on Sun Lie's back as Sun Lie's body jerked abruptly. The blood spewing out from his mouth was like a fish blowing bubbles. Dong Hu, who was below him, suffered likewise. He felt that the Draco First True Gold avatar's foot was about to break both their backs.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Draco First True Gold avatar made a flip with his hand, and retrieved a lance of unknown origin. He did not use the lance head, but the lance pole to smash the two of them at the same time!</p>
<p>Although Fire Cloud State banned the killing of fellow disciples, it was a gray area when it came to beating each other to a near cripple.</p>
<p>Having sustained serious injuries, they would have to recuperate for a year or so, definitely affecting their future cultivation.</p>
<p>This way, their ambitions and aspirations would become bursting bubbles. There was no need to talk about entering the Earth Fire Hall, they might even be kicked out because of poor performance.</p>
<p>"Stop...Stop beating..."</p>
<p>Dong Hu groaned. Sun Lie's body was also twitching all over, no longer bold enough to keep up with his invectives.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun only waved his hand, making the Draco First True Gold avatar stop.</p>
<p>Following that, Yi Yun looked at Bai Wei.</p>
<p>Bai Wei immediately turned pale, "I...I'm not saying anything at all. What do you want? As a man, even if redress has to be sought for any grievance, are you not even going to spare women?"</p>
<p>"Women?" Yi Yun gave a scornful laugh, "You are only a spirit monster. Even if you were really a woman, I will never hesitate to act against any provocations directed at me. But there was one thing you said right, I will seek redress for any grievance!"</p>
<p>As Yi Yun spoke, the Draco First True Gold avatar briskly came in front of Bai Wei and sent a slap at her!</p>
<p>Bai Wei screamed. The Draco First True Gold avatar's slap was extremely fast, so even if Bai Wei could not block it, with her strength, she could have at least reacted and fought back.</p>
<p>However, she did not do so. Sun Lie and Dong Hu, who were stronger than her, had been beaten up brutally because of their resistance.</p>
<p>With a loud slap, Bai Wei was sent flying by the Draco First True Gold avatar!</p>
<p>Bai Wei slammed heavily into the ground. Her face swelled up, but compared to Dong Hu and Sun Lie, her injuries were the lightest.</p>
<p>However, Bai Wei felt immense humiliation from being slapped by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>With a hand covering her face, she groaned while lying on the ground. She could not do anything to Yi Yun because the puppet was too terrifying.</p>
<p>If she could steal the puppet, then she would obtain a power boost to her combat power. As for that human, he would be nothing at all, allowing her to knead him as she wished.</p>
<p>Bai Wei could not help but have such thoughts.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked indifferently at Bai Wei, Sun Lie and Dong Hu.</p>
<p>He knew that although they verbally appeared to submit to him, they still hated him deeply in their hearts. However, with the Fire Cloud State's rules, Yi Yun could not really kill the three of them because he would end up suffering heavy punishment.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not take the matter of having a grudge with the fellow three disciples to heart.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State was just an expedient place for Yi Yun to recuperate from his wounds. As for Dong Hu and company, they were trivial to him. They were all at the Yuan Opening realm, and was not much different from Yi Yun. Compared to Tian Yuan world warriors at the same level, Bai Wei, Dong Hu and Sun Lie were indeed much stronger, but the gap between the trio and Yi Yun was too great.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun came from the Tian Yuan world, he not only had the Purple Crystal, but he had also entered the Great Empress mystic realm and the Pure Yang Sword Palace, obtaining the top heritage from the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>And the three Fey race members in front of him were just Earth Fey from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It was not incorrect to label them as low class Fey race.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number of geniuses in the 12 Empyrean Heavens or the number of experts there were, a few Earth Fey members that came from remote tribal clans would just be demolished by Yi Yun as the gap between them was too great.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun recovered from his injuries, the three of them would not even be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>With a thought, the Draco First True Gold avatar transformed into a stream of light and disappeared into his Dantian.</p>
<p>After taking a glance at the trio, Yi Yun turned around and left.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not plan on staying in the Fire Cloud State for long. He remembered the kindness Luo Fengling showed him by saving him. In the future, when he left the Fire Cloud State, he would look for an opportunity to repay her kindness.</p>
<p>However...since it was the Luo clan, Yi Yun was also planning on going to the royal capital.</p>
<p>The Luo clan could be said to be a clan, but it had established its own nation. Firstly, Yi Yun wanted to see Luo Huo'er, and secondly, if possible, Yi Yun wanted to find Jiang Xiaorou's father.</p>
<p>Various factors seemed to indicate that Jiang Xiaorou's father was in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Jiang Xiaorou had grown up alone and had suffered all her life. If he could help Jiang Xiaorou find her father, it would fulfill a wish of Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The next morning, moments after dawn, Mt. Fengling was still covered with a dense fog.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was dressed in azure-colored clothes, looking clean and simple. He sat cross-legged in the valley, enjoying the tranquility of the early morning in the mountains as well as expirating Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Mt. Fengling was considered an excellent spiritual ground. Recuperating here allowed him to obtain double the results with half the effort.</p>
<p>The relic Luo Fengling gave Yi Yun had already been eaten by him. What surprised Yi Yun was that the relic's effect was much better than he expected.</p>
<p>The moment the relic entered his abdomen, it transformed into a warm flow that flowed to his every limb. Despite his meridians being severed, the energy in the relic could strangely flow along them.</p>
<p>Chapter 779: Recovery Relic</p>
<p>Damaged meridians were very difficult for warriors to fix. The reason was because repairing the damage required the absorption of energy, but with the meridians severed, the pathways for energy flow were also severed. This resulted in a vicious cycle; hence warriors would typically take a long time to recover from their severed meridians. It could even affect their future cultivation. If their meridians were severed and their Dantian destroyed, then it was almost equivalent to having their cultivation crippled. They would then return back to being a mortal.</p>
<p>With this recovery relic, it nearly shortened half the time it needed for Yi Yun to recover, pleasantly surprising Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Luo Fengling's relic has helped me quite a bit..."</p>
<p>Yi Yun murmured to himself but he knew that as a steward disciple of the Fire Cloud State, Luo Fengling would not have given him a very precious relic. The best relics were of course kept for Luo Fengling herself.</p>
<p>But even so, this relic's effects gave him a surprise.</p>
<p>"It probably has to do with the difference in materials used for relic refinement in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven..."</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew very well that when comparing the Tian Yuan world to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, other than the difference in Desolate Heaven technique heritage, the main reason would be the great difference in the materials used in the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>The Desolate beasts found in the Tian Yuan world and the Divine Emperor were on a completely different level compared to the Fey beasts that lurked in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's mountains and lakes.</p>
<p>For example, the Desolate race's Sacred Spirit was a Fey beast that came from the 12 Empyrean Heavens. It had grown up in the lower realm which was an inhibition to its natural talent. But even so, it had become the guardian of the Desolate race. All the Primordial True Spirits and primordial species in the Divine Wilderness were subservient to the Sacred Spirit!</p>
<p>It had lived for tens of millions of years and even after being killed by the Black-armored Demon God, its corpse was coveted by the Sovereign of the Eventide. He wanted to steal it to increase his own cultivation realm, indicating how valuable the Sacred Spirit's corpse was.</p>
<p>However, if the Desolate race's Sacred Spirit was placed in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, then it would not have been anything spectacular.</p>
<p>Many Fey beasts in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was hundreds or even thousands of times stronger than the Desolate race's Sacred Spirit!</p>
<p>What sort of results would happen when these Fey beast's Fey bones or Fey cores were refined into relics? Even without any refinement, just grinding the Fey bones to powder and eating them might show wonderful effects!</p>
<p>As the best cook could not produce anything without grain, even the relics left behind by the ancient Great Empress in the Great Empress mystic realm were refined using the bones of desolate beasts in the Divine Wilderness. Similarly, they were incomparable to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's relics.</p>
<p>Hence, although Yi Yun obtained a large number of relics from the God Advent Tower, their main usage was to maintain the God Advent Tower's arrays.</p>
<p>"The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Fey bone materials sure are impressive. Speaking about that, isn't it my job to be in charge of the material storehouse? No wonder this job was coveted by Bai Wei, Dong Hu and company. If one isn't honest, it is indeed easy to reap a lot of benefit."</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun walked towards the material storehouse.</p>
<p>In fact, the top materials stored in Mt. Fengling were carried by Luo Fengling personally. Whatever stored in the material storehouse were just common materials.</p>
<p>These materials were rich in variety, and the material storehouse had a dedicated accounts book. The procurement of every material and warehousing were well-documented in it.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun walked to the material storehouse, he suddenly caught a whiff of a faint aromatic fragrance of relics. This gave him a thought as he traced the fragrant smell of the relic.</p>
<p>Yi Yun came to a elegant little courtyard, and in there, there was a 14&ndash;15-year-old girl refining relics.</p>
<p>Tao'er?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slightly surprised. The person refining relics was Luo Fengling's maid servant, Tao'er.</p>
<p>The relic-refinement process could not be disturbed, so Yi Yun stood in his spot and watched silently.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tao'er was in full concentration. Her tiny face was glowing red, and her forehead was covered in beads of sweat.</p>
<p>Beside Tao'er, there was a tiny red cauldron that was spinning.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the relic-refining tools used were slightly different from the Tian Yuan world. In the Tian Yuan world, they used disk arrays, but here, the main tool was a relic cauldron.</p>
<p>On the surface of the tiny cauldron, there were runic engravings that looked simple as they glowed with different intensities. All the materials were placed inside the cauldron, and by surrounding it with Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, the materials were repeatedly refined.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not help but open his Purple Crystal's energy vision.</p>
<p>Be it the Tian Yuan world or the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique, as a Desolate Heaven Master, the most important thing was energy control.</p>
<p>And in his energy vision, Yi Yun could clearly see every detail in Tao'er's control of energy.</p>
<p>However, Tao'er was only a Desolate Heaven apprentice, and was only a beginner. She learned the most superficial Desolate Heaven techniques, so be it her hand seals or energy control, she was only very average.</p>
<p>The Fey bones and herbs in the cauldron were also the most common of materials. All of this could be seen just from the energy flow they emitted.</p>
<p>But even so, Tao'er' was extremely careful with her every move. It could even be said that she was trembling with fear. More beads of sweat oozed out of the pores on her face, but despite being extremely meticulous, the Yuan Qi blob in the cauldron was beginning to spin out of control.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could see everything clearly through his energy vision; hence, despite him not knowing the hand seals of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, he could tell through the Purple Crystal that Tao'er had made many mistakes in her hand seals.</p>
<p>Indeed, moments later, with a "Peng" explosion, all the materials in Tao'er's cauldron went up in smoke. The Fey bones were shattered and the bone ash flew out.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they were all low level materials, so the explosion was not very powerful. It just blackened Tao'er's little face and disheveled her hair.</p>
<p>"I failed the refinement again. I failed the refinement again." Tao'er did not care about her disheveled hair as she looked completely frustrated and depressed. "Tao'er, can you be any dumber!? How many times have you failed?"</p>
<p>Looking at the material dregs in front of her and the toppled cauldron, tears could not help but well up in her eyes.</p>
<p>As a human, she was easily marginalized and despised in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Most resources were controlled by the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. If a human wanted to gain success in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, they had to put in greater amounts of effort.</p>
<p>However, Tao'er's talent was not good enough to gain special attention from the major factions for nurturing. She was just a maid servant, but because of her kind heart, she had been taken in by Luo Fengling. However, she could not rely on Luo Fengling all the time, since she was meant to serve Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>She knew that Luo Fengling's goal was to enter the Luo Divine Hall. It was located in the Luo clan's royal capital, a place where top geniuses in the Luo clan gathered. If Luo Fengling were to enter the Luo Divine Hall, she would also accompany her. The geniuses there would also bring their attendants. These attendants also had many things to do, so if she was too useless, she would be causing trouble for her Missus in everything she did. It would then be better for her not to accompany Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Tao'er could not help but clench her tiny fist. "Tao'er come on, you can do it. You can't hinder Missus. You can definitely do it."</p>
<p>Unknowingly, she said out the words in her heart verbally.</p>
<p>After saying that, she suddenly came to realize that someone was standing behind her. Turning back, her face blushed.</p>
<p>"Brother...Brother Yi..."</p>
<p>Tao'er spat out her tongue and was somewhat perplexed. She had failed in her relic refinement and had been muttering to herself. All of that was quite disgraceful, so having all of that seen by Yi Yun naturally made her feel distressed.</p>
<p>Chapter 780: Luo Clan Desolate Heaven Technique</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, have you been here for long?" Tao'er asked with a blushed face.</p>
<p>"Uh...I just came." Yi Yun lied as he noticed Tao'er's awkwardness.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." Tao'er easily believed Yi Yun's words as she obviously heaved a sigh of relief. "Brother Yi, it seems as though you look much better now?"</p>
<p>Tao'er was not able to sense Yi Yun's energy flow, but she had guessed from the color on Yi Yun's face.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had been heavily injured prior to this. All his were organs ruptured, so if it were any ordinary person, they would have been dead. Tao'er did not expect Yi Yun to look so much better so quickly. This recovery speed was truly impressive.</p>
<p>"Yea, Senior Luo gave me a recovery relic which was quite useful." Yi Yun answered her casually.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Tao'er smiled, as though she was happy because of Yi Yun's words. "The Fey pills or relics refined by the Luo clan are extremely famous, especially in the Luo clan's royal capital. The best Desolate Heaven Masters in the Luo clan are there. They seldom provide their services, but if they were to refine some impressive relic, even the supreme mighty figures in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven would travel personally to obtain one from them!"</p>
<p>Tao'er mentioned this pridefully. Although she was human, she was still a member of the Luo clan and felt pride over the Luo clan's might.</p>
<p>However, there were few humans in the Luo clan. Furthermore, amongst the humans, one was weaker than the other, making them completely incomparable to the Fey race in the Luo clan. Although the upper echelons of the Luo clan had announced that members of the Human and Fey race were equal, it was still extremely difficult to implement it in practice.</p>
<p>There were many places in the Luo clan where the humans were ostracized and bullied. It was understandable because in a warrior's world, the weak were naturally bullied.</p>
<p>And it was because of this reason that Tao'er felt such a natural affinity with Yi Yun who was also human.</p>
<p>Since everyone was human, they were all in the same boat.</p>
<p>"Oh? The Luo clan has impressive attainments in the Desolate Heaven technique?"</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard what Tao'er said, he recalled how Luo Huo'er focused on the Desolate Heaven technique back in the Tai Ah Divine City.</p>
<p>Back then, Luo Huo'er's Desolate Heaven technique was extremely good, but...when she competed against Yi Yun in energy control, she had lost to the Purple Crystal-possessing Yi Yun. It caused Luo Huo'er to go into a fit of rage.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, the Desolate Heaven technique Luo Huo'er used in the Tai Ah Divine City was likely to be different from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>The quality of the desolate bones materials was bad, while the hand seals and Desolate Heaven technique heritage was different.</p>
<p>With these differences, Luo Huo'er had to nearly start from scratch, but even so, she had managed to master the local Desolate Heaven technique quickly.</p>
<p>And it could be said that the Tai Ah Divine City's Desolate Heaven technique was something Luo Huo'er learned when she had nothing better to do while hiding in the lower realm as a fugitive. She could not use the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique that she was proficient in as she would not be able to explain its origins. It could also risk exposing her identity.</p>
<p>Her Desolate Heaven technique, which she had learned in her free time, had complied with the lower realm's rules, yet she was able to defeat and dominate the Tai Ah Divine City's elites in the Desolate Heaven technique. She only failed to match the energy control extraordinaire, Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"No wonder she was so unhappy back when I beat her." Yi Yun muttered and smiled to himself.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er came from the 12 Empyrean Heavens, and was a direct descendant of the Luo clan. She was like a proud little cat, feeling superior over the lower realm's Tai Ah Divine City warriors. She believed that the lower realm Desolate Heaven technique she learned in her spare time was enough to dominate everyone else.</p>
<p>In Luo Huo'er's heart, the people in the lower realm should have surrounded her, praising her for her beauty and peerless talent. Unfortunately, amongst this bunch of bumpkins, Yi Yun, who did not share the same thoughts as her, had appeared. His control of energy had defeated Luo Huo'er, something completely unacceptable for her. It resulted in her flaring up.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not help but recall how Luo Huo'er had tried to entrap him after she had lost to him in energy control. Just thinking of how she ended up falling for her own trap could not stop the corner of Yi Yun's lips from curling up.</p>
<p>He reflected on how time had truly flown. Who knew that more than ten years later, they would both appear in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, since your body isn't well yet, drink some medicinal porridge. It's made from spirit grain I grow myself." Tao'er took out a pot of porridge from her room and said with pride.</p>
<p>In Mt. Fengling, she had a lot of miscellaneous chores to do, so there was no time for her to cultivate. One of her chores included preparing spirit food for Luo Fengling who was very particular about her daily three meals. Most of the dishes were cooked by Tao'er, so despite having a low cultivation level, she was quite good when it came to cooking.</p>
<p>Tao'er scooped a bowl of medicinal porridge for Yi Yun. Just from the fragrance alone was enough to make one drool.</p>
<p>Not only did this bowl of porridge use spirit rice, but it also used a lot of herbs. It was very beneficial to the body when consumed.</p>
<p>After thanking her, Yi Yun drank a mouthful of the porridge. Iindeed, it tasted excellent, and the moment the medicinal porridge entered his stomach, it transformed into a warm energy that made Yi Yun feel extremely comfortable.</p>
<p>However, Tao'er did not join him in eating the porridge. She faced her small cauldron and began working on her Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>The originally red hot cauldron had cooled down by now, returning to its original black color. It did not look like a particularly good relic cauldron and was probably very cheap. As for the materials, she tried to ration whatever she had.</p>
<p>Nurturing a high level Desolate Heaven Master required large amounts of valuable materials for practice. It was a huge expense; hence, if one didn't come from a famous institute of learning, it was very difficult to succeed as a Desolate Heaven Master.</p>
<p>Tao'er came from a poor background and not only her, even Luo Fengling was not considered to have come from a good background in the Luo clan before she showed her talent. She had relied on her hard work to come so far. An example of Luo Fengling's diligence was how eager she was to enter reclusive training the moment she returned.</p>
<p>Tao'er understood her own situation very well. She knew it was impossible for her to be a top Desolate Heaven Master, nor did she have such ambitions. She only wanted to keep up with her Missus. She wanted to be able to help whenever her Missus was refining relics. She would be satisfied if she did not cause trouble for her.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun watched Tao'er refine the relic, he noticed that there were a collection of books nearby. A few books were even flipped open. Taking a look at them, they recorded Desolate Heaven technique hand seals in them.</p>
<p>This was a Desolate Heaven technique heritage from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Of course, the Desolate Heaven technique heritage Tao'er got to come into contact with were the most basic of techniques, so there was no need to keep them confidential. Hence, the books were just casually placed there, allowing Yi Yun to take a cursory look.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not help but pick up a book and began flipping through it.</p>
<p>His body had yet to recover, so it was impossible to cultivate. Since he had the free time, he felt that taking a look at the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique was quite a good choice.</p>
<p>Since the Luo clan's attainment in the Desolate Heaven technique was impressive, then in the Luo clan's royal capital, there would definitely be top Desolate Heaven technique heritage. If he had the chance to learn them, with the Purple Crystal's help, Yi Yun would easily be an excellent Desolate Heaven Master.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun continued on reading, he opened up his energy vision on a whim. As he read the book, he would match the information in it to Tao'er's Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>Chapter 781: Guidance</p>
<p>The Desolate Heaven technique Tao'er studied was extremely superficial and easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, understanding it did not mean being able to do it. It was like a perfect circle drawn in a book. It may look simple, but replicating it with one's bare hands was difficult. It was a problem resulting in the poor control of one's hand.</p>
<p>Likewise, the difficult part of the Desolate Heaven technique was precisely the control of energy. Although the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique's heritage was far better than the Tian Yuan world's, the basic steps needed for the Desolate Heaven technique were the same.</p>
<p>Like the Tian Yuan world's Desolate Heaven technique, there were three steps, namely—</p>
<p>The first step, energy extraction. The second step, controlling the energy seal. The third step, forming the relic itself.</p>
<p>The first step was the basics in which the energy within the Fey bones was extracted bit by bit. Many Fey bones contained great amounts of energy, making them more difficult to control. As a result, it was not easy to handle them as one pleased. If one was not thorough with extracting the energy, not only would it be a waste of materials, but the Fey bone relic would also not be refined properly.</p>
<p>As for the second step's creating and controlling the seals, it was even more complex as there were too many hand seal techniques. There was already no lack of hand seals in the Tian Yuan world, so in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the number of the Desolate Heaven technique hand seals were as many as the stars in the sky. Different elemental Fey bone energy had corresponding hand seals that best suited the energy in question. If one failed to do it well, one could easily end up dissipating the energy that they had worked hard extracting, resulting in an explosion.</p>
<p>As for the final step, forming the relic. It was relatively easier, but on the condition that the first two steps were done perfectly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this ease was relative. There were also many techniques when it came to forming the relic, and each technique had different effects.</p>
<p>Since the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique had its similarities with the Tian Yuan world's Desolate Heaven technique, and how Yi Yun's perception was pretty good, Yi Yun was able to quickly understand the techniques described in the book. As he compared the book's information with Tao'er, Yi Yun quickly realized that Tao'er was barely able to complete each step..</p>
<p>Tao'er's cultivation level was limited, so it was very difficult for her to control the energy flow in the Fey bones. This caused flaws to occur during her relic refinement.</p>
<p>And the more careful she was with the seals, the more Tao'er was unwilling to abandon them. Noticing that the cauldron of materials were about to be refined into a mess, Yi Yun estimated that an explosion was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>"Tao'er, abandon the three seals you formed, now!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly spoke out, giving Tao'er a fright. The three seals on her hand had been painstakingly formed by her. Although she did not manage to control it perfectly, it was already a pretty impressive feat for Tao'er. She was about to diligently refine the three seals into the relic, but Yi Yun had told her to abandon them.</p>
<p>How could she be willing to?</p>
<p>Furthermore...in Tao'er's impression, Yi Yun had just come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven from a lower realm. How could he know anything about the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven techniques? That should be impossible...</p>
<p>Realizing that Tao'er was momentarily dumbfounded, Yi Yun repeated, "Follow my instructions and abandon them." Yi Yun's words were very decisive. "The three seals you condensed have a total of seventeen structural defects. If you mix them into the relic, not only will it not increase the efficacy, but it will also cause the energy to turn chaotic!"</p>
<p>Seventeen energy defects?</p>
<p>Tao'er was surprised. Even she did not know how many energy flaws there were in the seals she had condensed, but Yi Yun had managed to instantly count all of them? This...</p>
<p>Tao'er found it a bit unbelievable, but she knew that the seals she condensed were very poor in quality. As such, the chances of her refining a successful relic was extremely low. And with Yi Yun informing her of that, Tao'er decided to harden her heart and believe Yi Yun. She might as well follow his instructions as a last resort.</p>
<p>With her hand relaxing, the three energy seals that had just been condensed were abandoned by Tao'er.</p>
<p>"Heaven Eminence seal, abandon!"</p>
<p>"Fire Willow seal, abandon!"</p>
<p>"Sun Moon seal, abandon!"</p>
<p>"Earth Howl seal, abandon!"</p>
<p>"Disperse all the mentioned seals and refine them again!"</p>
<p>At this moment, there were colorful seals flying above Tao'er's cauldron. The marks Yi Yun mentioned had all been painstakingly condensed by Tao'er, but with a single instruction from Yi Yun, she had to disperse them and refine them again from scratch.</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>Tao'er was beginning to hesitate as she felt that her remaining Yuan Qi was likely insufficient for her to condense those seals again.</p>
<p>However, the resoluteness in Yi Yun's instructions made her subconsciously listen to him.</p>
<p>Tao'er gritted her teeth and destroyed all the seals Yi Yun mentioned.</p>
<p>"Pa! Pa! Pa!"</p>
<p>The energy seals exploded into a beautiful rain of light. Although it was very pretty, Tao'er's tiny face was like a prune as she felt her heart ache for them.</p>
<p>"Form the Heaven Eminence seal again. Extract twice the energy from before!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun began to guide Tao'er, but this time, she had to extract twice the energy from before, right from the onset.</p>
<p>Tao'er swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Twice the energy? She could barely control the normal amount of energy, wouldn't twice the energy end up exploding?</p>
<p>"Follow my instructions. The energy flow on your right index finger, supress it!"</p>
<p>With the Purple Crystal's energy vision, Yi Yun was able to see clearly every strand of energy Tao'er was controlling. Yi Yun could tell if there were any defects in each and every seal, and if there were any, where the defects were. He could even predict what the results of the defects were or whether it would cause the relic to explode or not.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun guided Tao'er, he would also immediately point out her errors or inadequacies.</p>
<p>"Stabilize your hand. Increase the energy output. Now's the time. Form the seal!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's tone was not to be doubted, causing Tao'er to follow his instructions to a T. Finally, when her hands folded, the energy condensed together to form a beautiful blue seal that floated in mid air.</p>
<p>This was a "Heaven Eminence seal"!</p>
<p>The "Heaven Eminence seal" was a seal that Tao'er found extremely difficult to condense throughout her Fey bone relic refinement process. It also happened that all the relics Tao'er needed to refine required this seal, so it vexed her greatly.</p>
<p>But now, with this extremely beautiful "Heaven Eminence seal" floating in front of her eyes with blue light shimmering, Tao'er found it unbelievable. Although she was bad at condensing the "Heaven Eminence seal", she was still able to recognize the quality of the "Heaven Eminence seal" when she formed it. It was definitely better than any "Heaven Eminence seal" she had ever condensed before. And even more critically, this "Heaven Eminence seal" had twice the energy from before, so the efficacy as a result of using this in the relic would naturally be much better!</p>
<p>"This is condensed by me?"</p>
<p>Tao'er muttered to herself as she was momentarily dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"Don't be distracted. Next, Sun Moon seal!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun had singled out seven of Tao'er's seals from before to be redone. The reason was because the quality of the seven seals Tao'er had condensed was too terrible. If they were forcefully used to condense the Fey bone relic, it would cause a chain reaction and end up disintegrating all the materials.</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>Having been alerted by Yi Yun, Tao'er had a rude awakening. She hurriedly continued her remaining seals. She knew that she could not be distracted when employing the Desolate Heaven technique. If she were to shatter such a perfect Heaven Eminence seal due to her distraction, she would definitely be too deep for tears.</p>
<p>But why did this Brother Yi understand the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique so well that he could immediately point out her flaws?</p>
<p>Chapter 782: Relic Qualities</p>
<p>Tao'er did not know how Yi Yun had managed to do it. Although she was limited in various ways, she knew that being able to accurately pinpoint her every mistake she made during her control of energy was an extremely difficult task.</p>
<p>Only Desolate Heaven technique grandmasters with rich experience, who often interacted with their disciples, would have been able to achieve this feat of guiding their disciples so well.</p>
<p>If it was any ordinary Desolate Heaven Master, or even any young genius from the Luo clan, they would only be good at the Desolate Heaven technique, but lacked the experience to guide others. They might not be able to find the flaws during the energy controlling process, much less guide others in real time during an actual execution of the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>Every advice Yi Yun gave hit the nail on the head. Tao'er was not a dumb person to begin with, so under his guidance, she began to complete seals that were considered very difficult for her. When she saw the seals that she previously found extremely difficult condense in front of her, Tao'er became more and more excited, her face glowed red with excitement.</p>
<p>Just a bit more, almost got it!</p>
<p>When all the seals were completed, these seals gathered together in a central core, finally condensing together. With a flash of light that looked like a dream-like color, the seals finally coagulated to form a relic the size of a longan.</p>
<p>"Boop!"</p>
<p>The relic fell into Tao'er's hand. It still contained the warm flow of energy within it, making it somewhat scalding to the touch.</p>
<p>As Tao'er held this crystalline relic and felt the warmth it exuded, she felt as though she was in a dream.</p>
<p>This was condensed by me?</p>
<p>Tao'er's heart began to thump loudly. Having joined the Luo clan a long time ago, she had some experience about the judgment of a relic's quality. She was sure that not only had this relic been successfully refined, but it was also very well done.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, there was a comprehensive evaluation ranking for relics. The same kind of relic was ranked based on the outcome of the refinement, and went from poor, ordinary, refined, outstanding, excellent, to spiritual emergence!</p>
<p>The higher the level of the relic, the harder it was to create a higher quality one. For example, the relics used by supreme mighty figures were already extremely valuable at the ordinary quality. Refined qualities were extremely rare.</p>
<p>But if it were a low level relic such as the one Tao'er refined, a typical genius Desolate Heaven Master would be able to produce it at the outstanding quality.</p>
<p>Low level relics could at best be of the outstanding quality, while the qualities, excellent and spiritual emergence were exclusive to high level relics.</p>
<p>Especially for spiritual emergence quality, it meant that the relic had evolved a spirituality in it to the point of it being able to absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi and self-cultivate. This quality was something low level relics could not possess.</p>
<p>Tao'er judged that the relic she had just refined was somewhere in between the quality of ordinary and refined.</p>
<p>This was a quality that she found unthinkable in the past. After all, she could not even refine a poor quality, she would usually end up exploding the cauldron, turning the materials to ashes!</p>
<p>For her to be able to produce a relic in one go that even exceeded the ordinary quality?</p>
<p>It was something Tao'er found unbelievable. As she thought over it, it was indeed possible. Her final seal was done in one fell swoop, and it was because of this that allowed her to have sufficient Yuan Qi to support her to the very end. Furthermore, a few key seals were done with twice the amount of energy, so it was natural that it would have a good quality!</p>
<p>Tao'er could not help but look at Yi Yun. Her eyes were filled with amazement and puzzlement, and even a sense of reverence.</p>
<p>Every since she began learning the Desolate Heaven technique, all she obtained was frustration and dismay. She did not wish to leave her Missus, but her background caused her to experience struggles on her Desolate Heaven technique journey. But today, under Yi Yun's help, she had managed to take a big step forward.</p>
<p>How could she not feel reverence for Yi Yun after he had given her such a huge opportunity?</p>
<p>"Brother...Brother Yi, how did you do it. Do you know the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique?"</p>
<p>In Tao'er's excitement, she could no longer speak properly.</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head and said, "Not really, but...aren't your books placed beside you?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun waved the book in his hand. These low level Desolate Heaven technique methods were not confidential, so any Luo clan disciple could freely read through them.</p>
<p>And it was true that Yi Yun had managed to know what seals Tao'er had formed through his reading of the book. Using his energy vision, he was able to make the correct judgment to guide Tao'er.</p>
<p>Back when he just arrived in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, Yi Yun would have been floating in endless space for a very long time, wasting his time, if not for having been saved by Luo Fengling. And during his journey in the spirit cruiser, it was Tao'er who took care of him while his physical condition was terrible.</p>
<p>This gave Yi Yun a very good impression of this hardworking maid servant. Noticing how Tao'er was making many detours in her Desolate Heaven technique, he decided to guide her on a whim.</p>
<p>After hearing what Yi Yun said, Tao'er was completely dumbfounded. She blinked her large eyes, as though the Yi Yun in front of her was like a prehistoric divine beast.</p>
<p>He was able to guide her just from reading the book?</p>
<p>Tao'er's cultivation level was only at the peak of the Purple Blood realm, many realms lower than Yi Yun. Due to the difference in realms, it would naturally result in different perception, insight and learning speed. What took Tao'er months to painstakingly learn, a higher level warrior could learn in days.</p>
<p>But even if the difference in cultivation level was acknowledged, it shouldn't have been to the point of being able to easily guide her after flipping through a Desolate Heaven technique book. Furthermore, his guidance was perfect, allowing herself to refine a Fey bone relic that exceeded ordinary in quality.</p>
<p>Tao'er gaped her small mouth, unsure of what to say. She could not help but take the book from Yi Yun's hands, wondering if it was the same book she read.</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, you must be a very good Desolate Heaven Master, right?"</p>
<p>Tao'er was in a daze for very long before she asked. She guessed that back when Yi Yun was in the lower realm, he must have been a top Desolate Heaven Master in his world.</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled and said, "Not really. I mainly spent my time on cultivating. I do want to learn the Desolate Heaven technique, but due to a lack of time, what I have learned is limited."</p>
<p>Yi Yun waved his hand. Ever since he came out of the Cloud Wilderness, he had been engaging in non-stop cultivation. Be it the threat from Shen Tu Nantian or the appearance of the Black-armored Demon God, they all gave Yi Yun a great sense of pressure.</p>
<p>Under the threat of life and death, how could he have the time to study the Desolate Heaven technique?</p>
<p>Now that he was in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, Yi Yun suddenly felt like he could relax.</p>
<p>Without a threat, he could lead a comfortable life, focusing on his cultivation, pondering over the laws and improve his cultivation realms.</p>
<p>After living a stressed life for so long, such a peaceful life was a kind of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also thankful that he did not spend too much time on the Desolate Heaven technique. After all, the Tian Yuan world's Desolate Heaven technique, even the ancient techniques, were far inferior to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's. Now that he had come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the Desolate Heaven technique he came into contact with actually meant rebuilding what he had learned from the past.</p>
<p>Upon hearing what Yi Yun said, Tao'er was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>He was so good despite only learning it so superficially?</p>
<p>Tao'er muttered to herself and suddenly felt frustrated. The gap between them was too huge.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could tell what was on Tao'er's mind, so he said, "Your cultivation has just begun. I'll need to recuperate in Mt. Fengling anyway, so I can also study some of the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique. Since I have nothing to do these days, if there is any need, I can still help you with your energy control problems."</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said this, Tao'er was overjoyed. "Really? Thank you Brother Yi!"</p>
<p>Chapter 783: Injury Recovery</p>
<p>This was the first time peace and quiet was restored to Yi Yun's life ever since he left the Tai Ah Divine City. Every day he would wake up and sit on Mt. Fengling in the morning where he would watch the rising fog in the mountains and meditate.</p>
<p>At noon, he would return to his cabin, and on a table in the cabin, there would be spiritual food awaiting him, specially cooked by Tao'er.</p>
<p>On Mt. Fengling, Tao'er was only responsible for Luo Fengling's meals, but since Luo Fengling was often in reclusion, it resulted in Tao'er having nothing to do most of the time. Being able to cook about a dozen meals a year was already considered a lot for her.</p>
<p>The reason why Tao'er studied the Desolate Heaven technique was partly because she wanted to accompany Luo Fengling and go far with her in the future, and partly also to produce even better spiritual food.</p>
<p>While cooking spiritual food, if one knew the Desolate Heaven technique, they could process the ingredients, releasing all the beneficial Yuan Qi inside the food. It would result in the food being more easily absorbed and purer in energy.</p>
<p>Now, because of Yi Yun, Tao'er's talent in cooking could once again shine. Tao'er put in a lot of effort for Yi Yun's meals, because a master like Yi Yun was not easily found even if she tried looking.</p>
<p>Over the days, Yi Yun indulged in feasts. The spiritual food cooked by Tao'er was not only good for replenishing his Yuan Qi, but they were also extremely delicious.</p>
<p>Hence, even though Yi Yun had long reached the state of not needing to eat, he would ease himself during lunchtime for the spiritual food prepared for him. He spent nearly an hour a day to enjoy the meal slowly.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun had mostly recovered from his injuries due to the spiritual and medicinal food, as well as the Purple Crystal's conditioning. Even Yi Yun himself was surprised at the speed at which he recovered.</p>
<p>He originally thought that he would take months to recover, but now, only half a month had passed since he was rescued by Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>And when it came to recuperation, it was always the hardest in the beginning. The closer one was to a full recovery, the faster the healing would be as there were more meridians that had recovered and joined up.</p>
<p>Yi Yun estimated that in a couple of days, he would fully recover from his injuries, reaching his peak state.</p>
<p>After a spiritual food lunch, Yi Yun would browse through the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique manuals in the afternoon and give Tao'er pointers. This was extremely helpful for Tao'er as the days went by.</p>
<p>However, the Desolate Heaven technique books Yi Yun had access to were the basics of basics.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, Yi Yun had completed reading all the Desolate Heaven technique books he had access to. The only booka lacking were the ones that contained ruly high-level and profound methods.</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, those Desolate Heaven technique books are placed in the Fire Cloud State's library. If you can become a Earth Fire Hall disciple, you can borrow even more books."</p>
<p>As days went by, Tao'er was more and more impressed by Yi Yun's freakish talent in the Desolate Heaven technique. She also believed that being only be able to read those basic books was extremely unworthy of Yi Yun's talents.</p>
<p>"Oh? Earth Fire Hall..."</p>
<p>Yi Yun faltered slightly. In the Tian Yuan world, he did not have any time to study the Desolate Heaven technique, but now in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, he had plenty of time.</p>
<p>A warrior's life was extremely long while Yi Yun's life had only just begun. The Purple Crystal made learning the Desolate Heaven technique extremely easy, an opportunity people yearned but had no chance at it. If he did not use it properly, it would be a great waste.</p>
<p>The Luo clan's heritage was noted for its Desolate Heaven technique. Ignoring everything else, just the recovery relic Luo Fengling gave Yi Yun was enough to interest Yi Yun greatly.</p>
<p>That relic was naturally not very valuable, but the energy it contained could still heal his wounds by passing through his severed meridians.</p>
<p>What about a recovery relic that was even greater in value? It would be unimaginable how effective it would be for healing injuries.</p>
<p>Tao'er had also mentioned before that true top level relics were even coveted by the 12 Empyrean Heaven's supreme figures and divine lords.</p>
<p>If he could refine such relics, then be it for personal usage or to exchange for treasures, it would be extremely useful for his martial path.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not care too much for the Fire Cloud State's Earth Fire Hall, but it was the beginning of his martial path in the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>Even though Yi Yun believed that he had unlimited potential, he was at present, just a Yuan Opening realm junior from a lower realm, as such, he had to take one step at a time. The Fire Cloud State's Earth Fire Hall was just his first step.</p>
<p>Besides, Yi Yun also planned on going to the Luo clan's royal capital. Becoming a core disciple of the Fire Cloud State was also one of the conditions he needed to fulfill in order to go there.</p>
<p>"How do I become a Earth Fire Hall disciple?" Yi Yun asked.</p>
<p>"Oh this, wow. For others it might be difficult, but it will definitely not be difficult for Brother Yi. Each of the 108 mountains of the Fire Cloud State has a chance to apply for an examination opportunity every year. Our Mt. Fengling has not used the chance this year, so we can just apply for it now."</p>
<p>"When the time comes, someone from headquarters will come here to test all the steward disciples and miscellaneous chores disciples. You just need to meet their requirements. As for the examination, there will be many topics. As long as someone is sufficiently excellent in any one aspect, they would become a Earth Fire Hall disciple."</p>
<p>"As for the Luo clan, it places greatest importance on a person's strength and Desolate Heaven technique talent. Being good at any of these two would make you be valued greatly by the Luo clan. When you take the examination, you just need to pass the Desolate Heaven technique alone. Brother Yi, you will definitely easily pass it."</p>
<p>When Tao'er knew that Yi Yun planned on becoming an Earth Fire Hall disciple, she was very delighted. As a maid servant, she was actually also a miscellaneous chores disciple and shared the same position as Yi Yun. However, as Tao'er had a close relationship with Luo Fengling, she had an extraordinary status in Mt. Fengling.</p>
<p>For example, the application for the Earth Fire Hall test was typically submitted by the mountain's owner, but Luo Fengling was frequently in reclusion, so the authority to submit the application was delegated to Tao'er.</p>
<p>Tao'er was extremely efficient. By night time, she had submitted the application to the Fire Cloud State's main mountain.</p>
<p>And following that, the Fire Cloud State's main mountain sent a Fire Cloud Decree.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud Decree was naturally not only for Yi Yun, but also for every steward disciple in Mt. Fengling. It also included Tao'er in the scope of the examination.</p>
<p>The decree was delivering by a ten thousand-year-old fire crane. When it flew above Mt. Fengling, it opened its mouth, exploding the decree scroll in mid air that revealed a series of text.</p>
<p>"Three days later, Earth Fire Hall examination! All Mt. Fengling disciples are free to join!"</p>
<p>Upon seeing this row of text, the Mt. Fengling's miscellaneous chores disciple, especially Dong Hu, Bai Wei and Sun Lie, were alerted to it, immediately causing excitement in Mt. Fengling.</p>
<p>There were about twenty miscellaneous chores disciples in Mt. Fengling, and most of the miscellaneous chores disciples had spent a long period of time here, so they knew the difficulty of the Earth Fire Hall examination. They knew that they were likely to fail, so they did not feel excited about it.</p>
<p>But Dong Hu, Bai Wei and Sun Lie were new to Mt. Fengling. They believed that being miscellaneous chores disciples in Mt. Fengling was a waste of their talent, believing that they had sufficient talent to become a higher level disciple. They only lacked the chance.</p>
<p>And now, the chance had befallen them. They did not know why there was this opportunity, but they believed it was time for them to show their prowess, so how could they not be excited?</p>
<p>Chapter 784: Fairy Black Bamboo</p>
<p>Over the past few days, a majority of the miscellaneous chores disciple in Mt. Fengling spent their days as per usual. After all, despite it being an opportunity, the application for such an examination could be done once a year, so it was not considered rare.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was even calmer. He would follow his morning routine of meditating in the mountains, having a good meal at noon, and then enjoy a leisurely life in the afternoon by reading books and giving Tao'er pointers.</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, the Earth Fire Hall examination is nearly here. All the cultivation grounds of Mt. Fengling have been occupied by the newcomers, Dong Hu, Bai Wei and company. Are you not going to cultivate?" Tao'er could not help but ask.</p>
<p>The main cultivation ground was located where Mt. Fengling's spirit root was, but that was naturally used by Luo Fengling. There were a few remaining cultivation grounds left, but they were snapped up by the other miscellaneous chores disciples.</p>
<p>There was fierce competition amongst the disciples in the Luo clan. Basically, whoever had the ability would be the one to enjoy the resources. As for Yi Yun, he spent his days without competing for these cultivation grounds, he did not even take a look at them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled and said, "My meridians have just been healed, so there's no hurry."</p>
<p>The path of martial arts was difficult and long. Many geniuses worked very hard, so although Yi Yun was not as maniacal as Luo Fengling, he was never one to slack on his cultivation.</p>
<p>He only rested for a few days because of the injuries to his meridians, and while doing so, enjoy a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's explanation, Tao'er spat out her tongue, "Then, was the application submitted too hastily?"</p>
<p>"Not really, it's just nice."</p>
<p>Yi Yun's meridians had just recovered and his body was flowing with Yuan Qi. The feeling of energy filling his entire body felt extremely good.</p>
<p>For warriors, after they were accustomed to powerful strength, they would find it very uncomfortable when they were suddenly weakened.</p>
<p>Three days later, above the Fire Cloud State mountains, there was a loud resounding shrill, as a red beam streaked across the mountains.</p>
<p>Everyone on Mt. Fengling looked up and saw a red dot the size of a pigeon's egg in the sky. But in a blink of an eye, this red dot expanded rapidly and when it dropped towards Mt. Fengling, the red dot transformed into a 20&ndash;30 feet fire crane. Its two talons were as sharp as blades, so when it landed, it sliced through Mt. Fengling's mountain rock like tofu.</p>
<p>When this crane spread its wings, it was wide enough to cover an elephant completely. Its feathers looked like they were on fire, making it look quite pretty.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that the Luo clan's ancestors was a divine beast related to fire and because they had inherited its bloodline, it was very common to see fire-elemental Fey beasts in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>If the fire crane in front of him was placed in the Tian Yuan world, it might be inferior to the Desolate race's Sacred Spirit, but it would definitely be one of the most powerful desolate beasts that ruled the Divine Wilderness.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's mountain rock beneath its claws were much stronger than the lower realm. Although it was not difficult to split it apart, just the fire crane's falling momentum was enough to slice it apart, showing how sharp the fire crane's claws were.</p>
<p>Standing on the fire crane was a woman with a voluptuous figure. She was dressed in black, and there was a black veil covering her face. She looked cold and distant, making her look at odds with her sultry figure.</p>
<p>On the woman's right breast, there was a black fire emblem. It indicated that she was one of the heads of the Luo clan's Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>This woman looked young, but she was actually thousands of years old.</p>
<p>Even without using his energy vision to probe the black-dressed woman's Yuan Qi fluctuations, he could still sense that she was extremely powerful.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming." Tao'er stuttered. She did not know who this woman was or what her status was, but she knew that there would definitely be no harm bowing.</p>
<p>The black-dressed woman floated down from the fire crane's back and used a pair of cold eyes to sweep across all the people present. Her voice was extremely cold too, as she said, "Those participating in Mt. Fengling's examination this year, are they all here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are." Tao'er answered respectfully.</p>
<p>And behind Tao'er, there were a few miscellaneous chores disciple that had spent more than ten years on Mt. Fengling who were able to recognize the black-dressed woman.</p>
<p>Although Tao'er represented Luo Fengling on many matters regarding Mt. Fengling, in terms of experience and knowledge, she was inferior to those experienced people that had been around.</p>
<p>"It's Fairy Black Bamboo."</p>
<p>Someone transmitted his voice privately.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo had achieved the Dao as a black bamboo. She did not share the Luo name, but enjoyed immense reputation in the Fire Cloud State. She usually disliked dealing with people, so for her to have such an impressive reputation, the only reason, other than her powerful strength, was because of the examinations she presided over. All of them were extremely harsh without any exceptions.</p>
<p>It even led to many disciples suffering serious injuries because of the examinations she presided over.</p>
<p>"Forget it. Since it's Fairy Black Bamboo, then let's not join in the fun..."</p>
<p>There were a few people on Mt. Fengling who wanted to try their luck. They hoped that they could become miscellaneous chores disciples in the Earth Fire Hall but were now having second thoughts.</p>
<p>Even if a more generous head from the Earth Fire Hall presided over an examination, their chances were already extremely slim, what more Fairy Black Bamboo. Not only would they fail, but they might also be severely injured.</p>
<p>"Alright." The veiled woman lightly scanned everyone including Yi Yun. At this moment, there were people retreating backwards in jitters. As for Dong Hu and company, they were desperately trying to squeeze forward. They pushed the other miscellaneous chores disciples behind, hoping to leave an impression on Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Noticing Dong Hu, Bai Wei and Sun Lie's excitement and anticipation, the other miscellaneous chores disciple mostly had a look of pity. Everyone, who just came to the Fire Cloud State, usually were filled with ambition, thinking that they were amazing. But very soon, they would suffer a setback and learn where they stood in this world.</p>
<p>No one alerted Dong Hu and company. These miscellaneous chores disciples did not have a harmonious relationship, so they only wished to see others suffer.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nonchalantly stood behind Dong Hu and company. As everyone else chose to collectively give up, there were only four people left participating in the examination.</p>
<p>The four people were all newcomers, so the scene immediately turned slightly odd.</p>
<p>Just the four of us?</p>
<p>Dong Hu was stunned momentarily, and found it slightly weird. However, before he had time to ponder over it, Fairy Black Bamboo asked, "Do you have any questions regarding the examination's rules?"</p>
<p>Naturally, Dong Hu and company did not know the rules, but they did not know where to begin when Fairy Black Bamboo asked them if they had any doubts.</p>
<p>Instead, Bai Wei rolled her eyes as a nefarious thought came to her. She asked, "Fairy, I want to know if puppets are allowed during the examination?"</p>
<p>When she asked this question, Bai Wei gave Yi Yun a glance. It had a hint of mockery in the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>"Puppets are external objects. Unless one is skilled in the Dao of puppets, allowing them to use puppets refined by themselves, puppets cannot be used!"</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo's words were within Bai Wei's expectations. How could an examination allow someone to rely on external powers? Yi Yun's puppet was naturally not refined by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>And of course, that was true. The Fire Cloud State naturally had a way to judge if a puppet was refined by the user himself, and for Yi Yun's Draco First True Gold avatar, it was actually refined by the Azure Yang Lord.</p>
<p>"Then there are no more questions!"</p>
<p>Dong Hu laughed out loud as he rubbed his fists. Previously, the three of them had nursed a grudge after being brutally beaten up by Yi Yun's puppet. Now they had a chance to settle scores.</p>
<p>Chapter 785: Sparring</p>
<p>Actually, when Dong Hu and company noticed the other miscellaneous chores disciples shrinking back in fear, they had also guessed that the Earth Fire Hall examination would be very difficult. However, so what if it was difficult? Wasn't the path of martial arts about facing difficulties?</p>
<p>They were recruited after the Luo clan experienced a great war in a bid to replenish their numbers. In the past tens of thousands of years, the Luo clan did not hold such a mass recruitment of disciples that spanned hundreds of planets. They were the ones who shone out of the hundreds of planets.</p>
<p>Dong Hu, Bai Wei and Sun Lie were eager to try, but at this moment, Yi Yun was observing Fairy Black Bamboo. He found it interesting that Fairy Black Bamboo clearly cultivated in fire-elemental laws, but the feeling she gave, or the aura she had, felt extremely cold like ice. Could fire-elemental laws be cultivated in this manner? It was truly strange.</p>
<p>"Since there are no objections, I shall announce the details of the examination. Firstly, I'll talk about my Earth Fire Hall. There are about a total of a thousand people. And the disciples that participate in the examination in the Fire Cloud State come from not only the steward disciples from the 108 mountains, but also from exterior disciples that number even more. There would be more than 100,000 in total.</p>
<p>When Fairy Black Bamboo said this, even Dong Hu and company, who were brimming in confidence, felt their necks shrink and their hearts beat furiously like a drum.</p>
<p>Yes, as steward disciples from the 108 mountains, they were actually considered the lucky ones to be chosen from amongst the exterior disciples. That alone numbered a few thousand.</p>
<p>And even more disciples, who were not qualified to become a steward disciple of the Heaven Fire Hall, were allocated all across the Fire Cloud State. These people made up the majority of the exterior disciples.</p>
<p>Earth Fire Hall only numbered in the dozens, so the competition was intense.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo carried on, "The Earth Fire Hall's examination has two types. The first is to accompany me to the Earth Fire Hall's Relic Hall and undergo a Desolate Heaven technique assessment! The other is an assessment of strength which can be done here! Any charms, pills or puppets not refined by yourself, as well as external powers, are not to be used. Those, who are inadequate, it is best you quit early. Do not have any hopes of luck for you will be wasting my time."</p>
<p>"Now, which examination would you choose?" Fairy Black Bamboo asked.</p>
<p>"Strength assessment!"</p>
<p>"The second one!"</p>
<p>Dong Hu and company spoke out. The Desolate Heaven technique assessment was extremely difficult, resulting in very few people being able to enter the Earth Fire Hall through the Desolate Heaven technique assessment. Furthermore, they did not know the Desolate Heaven technique too.</p>
<p>After Dong Hu was done speaking, he looked at Yi Yun. A teasing smile hung on his face as he waited for Yi Yun to make his choice.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo also looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun rubbed his chin. The test of the Desolate Heaven technique needed traveling to the Relic Hall? Indeed, the usage of the Desolate Heaven technique needed materials, array platforms, relic cauldrons and various other tools. Having the examination out in the open would affect the performance of some Desolate Heaven technique apprentices.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was indifferent as he did not care about the differences these external conditions brought.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not like trouble. An examination on the spot was easier, so he said, "I'll also have the strength assessment."</p>
<p>Be it the strength assessment or the Desolate Heaven technique assessment, Yi Yun did not mind any of them.</p>
<p>However, with him saying that, Tao'er was stunned. Brother Yi chose the strength assessment? Wasn't Brother Yi supposed to participate in the Desolate Heaven technique assessment?</p>
<p>Brother Yi's Desolate Heaven technique would definitely not be a problem, but in terms of strength...Brother Yi just recovered from his injuries, so is it really fine for him to have his strength assessed?</p>
<p>At that moment, Tao'er naturally did not dare say a word. Fairy Black Bamboo was already continuing on. "Alright, if everyone is having a strength assessment, it will save time. Report your bone age, and show off your strength in front of me. It can be nomological insights or sparring against each other. Things like cultivation techniques you cultivate can also be showcased as you please. As long as you attract me in any single aspect, you will have the qualification to carry on."</p>
<p>The Earth Fire Hall did not have any explicit examination format. The examiners were given free reign on the assessments, and for that, the examinations Fairy Black Bamboo presided over were always simple and brutal.</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it a refreshing method of assessment when he heard this. It was considered truly primal. He even believed that there would be a specially built array that they had to pass.</p>
<p>"We can spar against each other?" Dong Hu's eyes lit up. He liked sparring a lot.</p>
<p>He was not proficient showcasing his nomological insights or cultivation techniques. As a member of the tiger species, he excelled in physical strength. The tiger species themselves acknowledged that they were inferior when it came to laws.</p>
<p>However, sparring was playing to his strengths.</p>
<p>He immediately looked at Yi Yun, his two eyes looked like a hunting dog that had seen its prey. This was a Heaven-given opportunity!</p>
<p>"Fairy, what happens if we injure the other party when sparring?" Dong Hu grabbed his knuckles and asked.</p>
<p>"The sword is blind, it is inevitable if one is injured because of a lack of strength." Fairy Black Bamboo said coldly, but what she said made Dong Hu feel a sense of exuberance. Fairy Black Bamboo had implicitly said that it was fine even if he caused injuries.</p>
<p>In the upcoming assessment, he wanted to sever Yi Yun's meridians and cause Yi Yun's old injuries to relapse, putting him in bed for half a year.</p>
<p>"Brother Hu, you want to fight Junior Brother Yi? I think I should be the one."</p>
<p>Noticing that Dong Hu wanted to fight Yi Yun, Sun Lie became anxious. Yi Yun was a human from the lower realm, and all his meridians were severed half a month ago as though he was about to die. Now, Yi Yun had probably not fully recovered from his injuries, so how could he give the chance of revenge to Dong Hu?</p>
<p>What if Yi Yun was crippled by Dong Hu, wouldn't he not have the chance to beat Yi Yun up?</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Sun, Senior Brother Hu, both of you are close in strength, so both of you would be excellent sparring partners and can put up a nice fight. This little sister of yours is weak, so leave Junior Brother Yi to me."</p>
<p>Bai Wei interjected, in a bid to vie for Yi Yun too. This was the first time Yi Yun heard them refer himself as "Junior Brother Yi".</p>
<p>The three people competed over Yi Yun mostly due to having a grudge with Yi Yun. This was naturally obvious to the miscellaneous chores disciple and Tao'er.</p>
<p>Many people gave Yi Yun odd looks, unsure how Yi Yun had made the three of them his enemies.</p>
<p>The trio being at odds against Yi Yun was clearly a disadvantage for him. And from the way the trio looked, they would definitely not go easy on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun spoke. He did not look at Dong Hu and company but asked Fairy Black Bamboo, "If it's sparring, how do we win the qualification?"</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo said, "The final person standing will win the qualification if they end the fight fast enough."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo answered. It was simple and brutal, but everyone was dumbfounded hearing this. It was not the final person who won, but the final person standing. This meant that the victor had to beat everyone down?</p>
<p>"Got it." Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>Dong Hu and company were also surprised. This meant that the three of them still had to fight one another.</p>
<p>The way the three of them looked at each other also turned strange. They were competitors too! Dong Hu and company had their hidden techniques and now, they were planning on revealing them.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, they had to first get rid of Yi Yun!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, let's do it!" Dong Hu shouted as he suddenly attacked.</p>
<p>The bones in his body began to crackle as his figure increased in size. The clothes on his upper body had all burst, while his facial muscles turned distorted. His appearance became ferocious as tiger stripes began to appear on his body!</p>
<p>Chapter 786: Snow-like Flying Sabers</p>
<p>Hu! Hu! Hu!</p>
<p>In addition to his body's transformation, Dong Hu's palms also transformed into tiger claws and they attacked with a rustling wind. Mixed in the wind from his palms was a faint tiger's roar.</p>
<p>Dragons descended from clouds, while tigers leaped from winds. The moment Dong Hu attacked, he had used all his strength. His tiger claws were like a palm leaf fan, that sent out a wind that was extremely overbearing in strength. A simple slap of his could shatter boulders, so hitting a human would definitely shatter a human's bones and sever his meridians.</p>
<p>Many of the Fey race would produce body features of their ancestors in battle. By stimulating the power of the Fey race's bloodline, they could augment their combat strength. Previously, in the battle between Dong Hu and the Draco First True Gold avatar, the Draco First True Gold avatar was too dominating, resulting in Dong Hu being immediately smacked down. He didn't even have the time to stimulate the power in his bloodline.</p>
<p>Without any explanation, Dong Hu had attacked Yi Yun. However, he was pissed when he saw Yi Yun's expression. He wanted to see fear and panic in on Yi Yun's face, but Yi Yun's calm look irritated him greatly.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at Dong Hu's palms that were about to strike him, he wiped the interspatial ring on his right hand. Swish! Swish! Swish! A few cold beams of light flew out of Yi Yun's interspatial ring.</p>
<p>These few flying sabers immediately met Dong Hu's palms after they appeared.</p>
<p>The flying sabers looked nondescript, but they were extremely fast.</p>
<p>Phew! The cold beam tore through the void and went straight for Dong Hu's palms.</p>
<p>Dong Hu also noticed the few flying sabers. They were considered speed-based weapons and usually lacked strength. How much power could an insubstantial saber contain?</p>
<p>Dong Hu's tiger claws had extremely strong defense and they were also the weapon of his choice. He planned on smacking the flying sabers into smithereens before shattering Yi Yun's bones with a smack!</p>
<p>However, when Dong Hu hit the flying saber, there was only a dull thud. A tiger claw immediately turned bloody.</p>
<p>This small flying saber was too sharp!</p>
<p>Yi Yun remained expressionless. His Thousand Snow saber array was a top saber array even in the 12 Empyrean Heavens. Every flying saber came from the same source. His consciousness and Yuan Qi were all attached to every flying saber, so how could the attacks be weak?</p>
<p>Dong Hu had underestimated him and had been overconfident.</p>
<p>Dong Hu's expression turned ugly while he tended to his injured tiger claws. The sabers were too sharp. In order to clinch victory, he had to dodge the flying sabers and attack Yi Yun's body!</p>
<p>"Roar!" Dong Hu roared angrily as a phantom tiger a hundred feet in size appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>
<p>Yi Yun wiped his interspatial ring once again, causing more than a hundred cold beams to appear.</p>
<p>Upon seeing so many cold beams, Dong Hu's pupils immediately constricted.</p>
<p>How can there still be so many!?</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had stretched out his hand and waved, "Go!"</p>
<p>More than a hundred cold beams attacked Dong Hu who no longer had time to attack. He could only resist.</p>
<p>However, even as he used all his strength to resist, the flying sabers still left multiple bloody lacerations on his body.</p>
<p>"There are so many flying sabers!" Dong Hu began to feel fear. He found it a struggle to cope with more than a hundred flying sabers.</p>
<p>"However, to control so many flying sabers, it will definitely be a drain on his consciousness and Yuan Qi. This kid probably can't last long!"</p>
<p>As Dong Hu resisted the flying sabers, he comforted himself, hoping to hold out after this wave of attacks.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Dong Hu realized that there were even more cold beams around Yi Yun's body! They were all flying sabers, and together with the ones Dong Hu was facing, there was a total of 999 flying sabers.</p>
<p>Nearly a thousands flying sabers formed Yi Yun's Thousand Snow Domain. In an instant, the temperature plunged as the sky seemed to be filled with dancing snowflakes. Dong Hu was completely enveloped by the snowstorm with no strength to resist.</p>
<p>This beautiful scene was like the snowfall in the mountains, but in it contained a fatal killing opportunity.</p>
<p>In the Thousand Snow Domain, every flying saber's trajectory was different, but they perfectly combined into a ceaseless saber formation array. Even if one side was broken, this hole would be immediately mended.</p>
<p>Dong Hu believed that this saber array would be extremely draining on the consciousness and that Yi Yun could not last long doing so, but he never expected that not only was he able to manage it, but the number of flying sabers was also increasing!</p>
<p>Seeing the endless flying sabers accelerate, Dong Hu immediately felt his scalp go numb. He was initially struggling to resist, but as more and more lacerations appeared on his body, Dong Hu's energy began to wane. His reaction speed also slowed down.</p>
<p>As a result, the dense snowflakes of the Thousand Snow saber array immediately opened up more wounds on his body. The white snow mixed with red blood appeared as Dong Hu struggled in the saber array.</p>
<p>Dong Hu came from the tiger species so his physical strength was far superior to others. However, as his body gradually became dyed with blood, his motions began to retard. The tiger stripes and fur on his body were turning into a mangled mess from the lacerations.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's saber array did not lessen in any way, instead, the flying snow appeared to become more and more aggressive.</p>
<p>Dong Hu wanted to break through the saber array to attack Yi Yun, but he could not get out of it. It was as though he was trapped in a blizzard. Yi Yun's consciousness was controlling every single flying saber, so how could he allow Dong Hu to leave it?</p>
<p>A thousand flying sabers suddenly became one as it struck Dong Hu straight in the chest.</p>
<p>"Bam!"</p>
<p>Blood splattered as Dong Hu's right chest was completely penetrated. His body was sent flying by the flying sabers as he made a resigned roar before his massive body collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>His body was already riddled with hundreds of holes. Even a tiger's body could not withstand such injuries.</p>
<p>After penetrating Dong Hu's chest, the 999 flying sabers did a turn in direction and lodged themselves in a mountain rock.</p>
<p>"Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!"</p>
<p>Blood stained the mountains, while the flying savers lodged themselves in the rock. Around Dong Hu's fallen body were numerous shiny sabers.</p>
<p>This scene sent a shudder down people's spine, especially Tao'er. She subconsciously opened her mouth wide. She never expected this elder brother, who always looked so mild and polite, would be so fierce and terrifying in battle!</p>
<p>However, there was no doubt that the flying saber array was extremely beautiful despite the fatal killing intent it possessed. It merged skill and power together like a form of art. And Yi Yun, who controlled the saber array did not even take a step from the beginning to the end. It was truly like the saying of devising strategies in a command tent to kill enemies in a thousand miles.</p>
<p>This was a vast difference compared to Dong Hu who used his strength and body to engage in brutal battle.</p>
<p>"This saber array..." Many miscellaneous chores disciple were staggered after seeing this battle. The difference was too great. As a human, Yi Yun was no doubt a top expert!</p>
<p>"Is Dong Hu alright? He wouldn't die, would he...?"</p>
<p>Some people worried for Dong Hu. Although killing an opponent in a fair assessment would result in a lesser punishment, there would still be one.</p>
<p>"It's fine. Dong Hu doesn't seem to have any crucial points harmed."</p>
<p>Amongst the miscellaneous chores disciple, there were some with good eyesights. The flying sabers appeared to fill the sky, but when they landed on Dong Hu's body, they would avoid his heart, brain, death points and other crucial spots. The 999 flying sabers were controlled with great precision in a terrifying manner!</p>
<p>For the tiger species with immense vitality, as long as they did not receive consecutive strikes on their crucial spots, they would not die even if Yi Yun beat them till they were rid of their skin. Of course, being bedridden was certain.</p>
<p>Chapter 787: There is no medicine for regret</p>
<p>Although Fairy Black Bamboo remained expressionless when she saw what Yi Yun had done, she was very astonished deep down. She knew how immense one's energy control needed to be in order to control the saber array in such a manner. Every single one of the 999 flying sabers were augmented with energy, and it was because of this energy that allowed the flying sabers to be controlled so freely.</p>
<p>And to say that the saber array had avoided Dong Hu's critical points was imprecise. To be precise, the saber array had attacked every spot on Dong Hu's body except the critical points!</p>
<p>Dong Hu's injuries were not as simple as superficial wounds. Many of his meridians had been severed!</p>
<p>These severed meridians would not result in any fatalities, but it was extremely difficult to recover from them.</p>
<p>This young man is very interesting!</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo evaluated in her heart. As a member of the Fey race, the Luo clan was not sympathetic to the weak. Other than disallowing deliberately killing fellow disciples, the Luo clan would tacitly allow the competition of resources and cultivation techniques amongst the disciples.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo was similar too. She was cold and indifferent and disregarded life. One could know just from examining the examinations she presided over. Many disciples would not only fail, but also be seriously injured.</p>
<p>And it was now that Fairy Black Bamboo began to pay notice to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>From the moment Yi Yun made his move to defeating Dong Hu, only several seconds had passed.</p>
<p>At this moment, he stretched out his hand for a move.</p>
<p>"Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!"</p>
<p>The 999 flying sabers flew out of the mountain rock and returned to Yi Yun's side while dancing randomly.</p>
<p>Following that, Yi Yun's gaze landed on Sun Lie and Bai Wei.</p>
<p>He remembered Fairy Black Bamboo's words. To win the qualification, he had to be the last one standing.</p>
<p>Dong Hu was down, so these two would naturally have to go down!</p>
<p>Upon coming into contact with Yi Yun's gaze, Sun Lie and Bai Wei immediately felt their hearts sink while their faces turned pale.</p>
<p>The moment the Thousand Snow saber array appeared, they had been staring with widened eyes. Upon seeing Dong Hu fall, they knew that Yi Yun was definitely not a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Now, the way Yi Yun stared at them made them feel as though they were the lambs that were unable to put up a fight.</p>
<p>"Wait...Wait!"</p>
<p>Bai Wei hurriedly asked for a time out as she looked at Fairy Black Bamboo, hoping for her to stop the examination. The situation was apparent now. Yi Yun's strength clearly far exceeded the three of them.</p>
<p>However, Fairy Black Bamboo did not say a word as she completely ignored Bai Wei's gaze. It meant — the examination continues!</p>
<p>Before the examination began, Fairy Black Bamboo had said that those that lacked the ability were to quit early so as to not waste her time. Upon deciding to take the examination, they had to be prepared to be seriously injured!</p>
<p>Those miscellaneous chores disciple who knew of Fairy Black Bamboo's infamy had withdrawn early on obediently, while the trio were filled with ambition because they were new. They thought highly of themselves and eagerly participated in the examination thinking it was an opportunity, so how could they quit?</p>
<p>Since they had made the choice, there was no way they could ask for it to be stopped midway. Hence, Fairy Black Bamboo completely ignored Bai Wei's gaze.</p>
<p>"There's no other way out!"</p>
<p>Bai Wei clenched her teeth and stood together with Sun Lie.</p>
<p>"The rules did not say we can't fight together. Let's attack at the same time. One person will pin down the saber array while another will attack his body!" Sun Lie hurriedly transmitted his voice.</p>
<p>After having seen Dong Hu's outcome, the duo were already lacking confidence. This human was ruthless. It was unknown how long it would take to recover from such lacerating wounds.</p>
<p>"Alright! You restrain the saber array, I'll attack his body!" As Bai Wei said, she directly attacked.</p>
<p>The Thousand Snow saber array was too terrifying, so Bai Wei admitted that she was definitely no match. As for Yi Yun's body, she believed that it was still injured and had yet to recover. As a human, his body shouldn't be too strong, right?</p>
<p>Especially with Yi Yun appearing like a warrior that was adept at mental manipulation, the weakness of this kind of warrior was probably his body.</p>
<p>At this moment of time, Bai Wei could no longer care if her judgment was accurate or not. Her only choice was to attack Yi Yun's body. It was the only chance for victory!</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Wei rush out, Sun Lie's expression changed. That woman!</p>
<p>He did not dare withstand the Thousand Snow saber array, but since Bai Wei had already attacked, he could only bite the bullet. If he did not, it was equivalent to giving Yi Yun a chance to beat them all down.</p>
<p>Sun Lie gritted his teeth as he charged at Yi Yun's Thousand Snow saber array.</p>
<p>"Ao woo!"</p>
<p>Sun Lie let out a long howl that didn't seem human. A layer of black fur appeared on his body as his back began to bend, as though his spine was a bow.</p>
<p>His four limbs landed on the ground as fangs appeared from his mouth. His eyes turned green and in a blink of an eye, he had turned into a werewolf.</p>
<p>Sun Lie did not have any hope at tearing the saber array apart. He just wished to last a little longer. When Bai Wei defeated Yi Yun, there would be no one controlling the saber array, so it would fail without needing him to attack.</p>
<p>Seeing Sun Lie head towards the saber array and Bai Wei charging at him, Yi Yun naturally guessed at their intentions. However, he did not summon the Thousand Snow saber array to protect himself. Instead, he waited for Bai Wei's arrival.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun! I'll be returning you this slap!" Bai Wei remembered deeply the humiliation of being slapped by a human in the first time in her life, and for that, she wanted to return it to Yi Yun a thousand times over.</p>
<p>Numerous flower petals appeared from her body. They looked extremely pretty, but their edges were as sharp as blades. Not only did she want to return Yi Yun a slap, but she also wanted to disfigure Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Seeing the sky-filled petals whistling at him, a beam appeared in Yi Yun's eyes as he slowly raised his hand and tapped gently while facing the flower petals.</p>
<p>Doop!</p>
<p>As though it was the sound of water droplet dripping, a blast of air spread out. The flower petals that filled the sky were immediately disturbed by the blast. This scene looked like there was an invisible water surface filling the sky, with those flower petals seemingly land on the water surface. Following that, they bobbed as a result of the water ripples.</p>
<p>While bobbing up and down, the flower petals that filled the sky quickly withered at a visible speed!</p>
<p>Withering concept!</p>
<p>Even without relying on the Death Soulwood, Yi Yun's demonstration of his Withering concept was enough to deal with Bai Wei.</p>
<p>The moment the Withering domain appeared, an aura of death emanated. The sharp and matchless flower petals were unable to withstand the force of the death.</p>
<p>No matter how many new flower petals Bai Wei sent out, the moment they entered the Withering concept's domain, they rapidly deccelerated. In front of Yi Yun, it was as though they instantly experienced a life of drying up and withering before being blown by the wind into the mud and rocks on Mt. Fengling, eventually turning to dust.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Bai Wei turned aghast. What was going on?</p>
<p>If it was about Yi Yun fighting Dong Hu from before, she might have felt fear when he used the saber array to defeat Dong Hu because it was a move she could understand. It was just flying sabers and mental control.</p>
<p>But now, a simple tap of Yi Yun's finger, with him not appearing to use much energy, he had immediately dissipated her flower swords. Before she struck, her momentum had been dissipated!</p>
<p>"It's time for you to fall too!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a step and instantly appeared in front of Bai Wei. A palm that was augmented by the Withering concept hit Bai Wei's abdomen!</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>Bai Wei's body quaked as instantly, she felt an energy filled with silent death rush into her Dantian. It was consuming her Yuan Qi, youth and even life!</p>
<p>This was an immensely terrifying power that made people despair. After being struck by Yi Yun's palm, she felt as though she had lost all meaning to life.</p>
<p>Chapter 788: Gaining Recognition</p>
<p>Bai Wei slammed to the ground. The single hit from Yi Yun's palm looked extremely light. Bai Wei did not fly out too far away, but what followed was a shocking scene.</p>
<p>People saw strands of white hair on Bai Wei's head. There were even wrinkles that began to appear on Bai Wei's face.</p>
<p>This is...</p>
<p>Everyone stared with widened eyes as they felt a chill shudder down their backs!</p>
<p>Previously, they were already astonished to see the Thousand Snow saber array lacerating Dong Hu till he had no undamaged spot on his skin, but they did not have this shuddering fear. It was as though Bai Wei's life had been stolen away by Yi Yun's single strike!</p>
<p>The Withering concept used by Yi Yun could indeed devour the vitality of the victim, and could only half their life spans.</p>
<p>However, against Bai Wei, whose strength was massively inferior, just a simple Withering strike was enough to cripple of Bai Wei's potential. That would also breach the rules of the organization.</p>
<p>The Luo clan encouraged competition amongst disciples, but it did not encourage maliciously crippling or killing fellow disciples. Hence, Yi Yun had shown mercy with this strike.</p>
<p>But even so, it caused Bai Wei's vitality to suffer. It required a long period of nursing to recover and to slowly remove the wrinkles on her face.</p>
<p>However, Bai Wei was unaware of this, she was even unaware of what had happened to her body. Only when she saw the other miscellaneous chores disciples looking at her in disbelief did she realize that something had happened to her body.</p>
<p>"Your face..."</p>
<p>Tao'er covered her mouth and could not bear but say. The moment this was said, Bai Wei immediately touched her face. For warriors, there was no need for mirrors, a scan of their perception was sufficient to inform them of their body changes.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>Bai Wei let out a sharp scream. As a woman, despite being member of the Fey race, she still cared for her beauty deeply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, youth implied potential. It implied how much one could achieve in the future.If she was old, what future did she have?</p>
<p>Bai Wei was completely distraught from shock. Her heart was on the brink of collapse, unsure if she could recover or not.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Sun Lie's body was shaking all over.</p>
<p>He wanted to plead with Yi Yun, and even thought of just lying on the ground without getting up. That would make Yi Yun be literally the last person standing.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Sun Lie was in the middle of the saber array. Just a momentary lapse of concentration caused more than a dozen flying sabers to stab into his body!</p>
<p>Sun Lie's defenses were much weaker than Dong Hu. He relied on a wolf's speed and agility, but with the flying sabers hitting him, his motions immediately turned retarded. Following that, a large swath of flying sabers hit Sun Lie!</p>
<p>"Bam! Bam! Bam!"</p>
<p>A powerful impact caused Sun Lie to fly up before he slammed heavily into the ground with blood splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>At this moment, the only person left standing was naturally only Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Instantly, the entire venue turned silent.</p>
<p>The saber array had eliminated two people, while one palm strike was sufficien to push Bai Wei to the brink of mental collapse. Not only had Yi Yun won, he had won at a sufficiently fast speed as requested by Fairy Black Bamboo!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun was ruthless!</p>
<p>When the other miscellaneous chores disciples saw how Yi Yun was being targeted by the trio, they sensed that there was a feud between them.</p>
<p>With the premise of a feud, it was necessary to be ruthless.</p>
<p>In addition, Yi Yun was ruthless in his attacks but he did not violate any of the Luo clan rules. It was something that gave people the creeps.</p>
<p>This person was not somewhat to be trifled with!</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, be it competition or murder, they were more intense than the Tian Yuan world. Compared to humans, the Fey race was even more savage.In order to rob or kill, humans had to find a reasonable explanation to do so, but the Fey race was more direct. They robbed and killed as they wished.</p>
<p>In such a situation, if one was submissive and did acts of kindness, it was more likely for them to be bullied. They might even die without knowing why. Only those who were vicious and decisive could lead a better life. They were even respected or revered.</p>
<p>As a human, Yi Yun would be discriminated in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, but because of today's defeating of three people, and in such a brutal manner, no one dared to despise his identity as a human.</p>
<p>The strong were respected no matter where it was.</p>
<p>"This human will be entering the Earth Fire Hall?"</p>
<p>People discussed in whispers. With the strength Yi Yun had shown, it was definitely sufficient for him to enter the Earth Fire Hall. Be it the saber aray or the odd law, just any one of them was sufficient to qualify him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun did not appear to have used his true strength against Dong Hu and company. It was hard to tell how much hidden strength he still had.</p>
<p>This made many Mt. Fengling miscellaneous chores disciples look at Yi Yun with eyes of jealousy and enviousness. Yi Yun was destined to have a bright future, an entity with a completely different fate as them. So what if they were members of the Fey race while Yi Yun was a human? Strength was everything.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at Fairy Black Bamboo and waited for her reply.</p>
<p>Previously, Fairy Black Bamboo had said that by quickly defeating the other three, the person would win the qualification to carry on.</p>
<p>The words "carry on" implied that Fairy Black Bamboo might still have prepared another round of assessment.</p>
<p>"What was the law you used at the end?" Fairy Black Bamboo suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"Withering!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun answered tersely.</p>
<p>It was nothing to tell others what sort of law it was. The only thing that needed to be concealed was the moves from the nomological transformations and the energy trajectories of the law.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's answer, the surrounding miscellaneous chores disciples were somewhat stunned.</p>
<p>Law of Withering? A simple palm strike caused the flower petals to wither to dust...</p>
<p>It sounded incredible. The Fey race disciples present had inferior nomological comprehension compared to humans. It was natural for them to be astonished when they suddenly heard of such a rare but profound law.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Mt. Fengling miscellaneous chores disciples, even Fairy Black Bamboo, who had lived for thousands of years, had yet to seen such a law displayed by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The nomological Great Dao were numerous in number. This law was learned from the Dao Tree's leaf. It was a Dao Tree that formed at the beginning of Chaos, when the Universe was still in its infancy. The laws of the Dao Tree was an embodiment of the Universe's truth. And the Withering concept Yi Yun gained insight into was deduced from that moment of the Dao Leaf dropping from the Dao Tree.</p>
<p>"Withering? Interesting."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo nodded her head slightly. Her nodding was an extremely rare act of admiration.</p>
<p>"Alright, you have passed the examination. From now on, you are an Earth Fire Hall disciple!"</p>
<p>A single sentence from Fairy Black Bamboo was enough to determine Yi Yun's status.</p>
<p>He passed?</p>
<p>Yi Yun faltered slightly, but he was not surprised. This was because the energy control and nomological concepts he revealed was sufficient. There was no need to participate in any further assessments. As for Fairy Black Bamboo, who was accustomed to saving time, decided to skip this procedure.</p>
<p>"Follow me. I'll bring you to the Earth Fire Hall to obtain your identity token."</p>
<p>As Fairy Black Bamboo said, she floated away.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not excited after becoming an Earth Fire Hall disciple. It was something that was within expectations.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Tao'er and said, "I'll be heading to the Earth Fire Hall first. Once I've settled in, I'll come back to Mt. Fengling."</p>
<p>Chapter 789: Fire Cloud State Main Mountain</p>
<p>Luo Fengling's Mt. Fengling was a distance away from the Fire Cloud State's main mountain and this distance was not just filled with wilderness. Along the way, Yi Yun saw a few countries along with various mountain ranges and rivers, as he followed closely behind Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyesight was excellent, so even though he was flying high in the sky, he could clearly see how people led their lives in these countries.</p>
<p>He saw bustling cities with street hawkers lining the sides of crowded streets. Of course, there were martial houses, bodyguard escort services established in them too. From the looks of it, they did not look much different from the mortal world in the Tian Yuan world.</p>
<p>The only difference was the numerous Fey race in the cities that had yet to complete their human manifestations. These members of the Fey race had tails or fur on their bodies. Some even had human faces but Fey bodies.</p>
<p>"The Fey race has mortals too?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun asked Fairy Black Bamboo as he looked at the Fey race who clearly were average in strength. His impression of the Fey race was similar to that of spirits found in legendary novels. Members of the Fey race who lacked strength could manifest themselves as humans?</p>
<p>"Yes." Fairy Black Bamboo was still flying ahead of Yi Yun. Despite the strong winds blowing, it did not lift her veil at all. "First generation Fey race are animals or plants who achieve their Dao to become Fey after absorbing the world's essence, so they are naturally powerful. However, their offspring might not inherit their strength. Many Fey race bloodlines would become diluted over time. Eventually, it will make them ordinary and mortal. Such bloodlines would result in the birth of several Fey race mortals. Their strength is probably around the strength of humans at the body tempering stage.</p>
<p>"Although the Fey race values bloodlines, and a Fey race with a powerful bloodline will be stronger, there are always exceptions to anything. Some Fey race with normal bloodlines might, for various reasons or special opportunities, slowly strengthen themselves. They might even end up stronger than Fey race with powerful bloodlines.</p>
<p>As she thought highly of Yi Yun, Fairy Black Bamboo patiently explained to Yi Yun to clear his doubts.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is."</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. A powerful Fey race having offspring with normal bloodlines was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>However, just like how people of ordinary birth were able to become a peerless Great Emperor, normal Fey race could also become mighty.</p>
<p>"It looks like although the 12 Empyrean Heavens has many mighty figures, there is no lack of mortals too. Not everyone is strong."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun pondered over it, they arrived at Fire Cloud State's main mountain.</p>
<p>Seeing Fire Cloud State's main mountain, Yi Yun was still somewhat shocked despite having been mentally prepared.</p>
<p>This mountain was not like any ordinary mountain which towered high into the sky. It was not considered tall, just about 100,000 feet tall. However, the land it covered was vast. It looked like it was a country itself.</p>
<p>On the mountain peak, there were long stretches of palaces as well as large spirit produce farms and herbal gardens. At this moment, the flowers were in full bloom, making it look like a colorful sea of flowers.</p>
<p>The melting of the snow on the mountain rushed down the mountain peak; it was not a tiny water stream, but a roaring river. The mountain was so massive that the melted snow could form massive rivers!</p>
<p>By the mountainside, the massive river was truncated, forming hundreds of waterfalls that had 10,000 feet drops. They roared down like charging white dragons, striking the rock beneath with tumultuous rumbles!</p>
<p>"This is Fire Cloud State's main mountain? It's huge!"</p>
<p>The number of palaces Yi Yun saw was nearly uncountable. Furthermore, in between the palaces stood numerous towering ancient trees. They looked spectacular and from the scale of the palaces, it was no problem for 100 million people to live in them!</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's rock was much stronger than the lower realm. Hence, in order to construct such a palace complex would require immense riches. Only a warrior's world was able to make constructions of such terrifying scale.</p>
<p>"There are so many palaces, can they all be inhabited?" Yi Yun could not help but ask. He knew that the number of mortal Fey race in the Fire Cloud State probably numbered above 10 billion, but the real Luo clan disciples were few in number. It seemed unlikely that all these palaces could be inhabited.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo said lightly, "The palaces are divided into many types. Other than the palaces of the Elders and deacons, the palaces below are where the Earth Fire Hall disciples stay. Every Earth Fire Hall disciple would be given their own palace complex.</p>
<p>"In the Fire Cloud State, there is no lack of mortal Fey that organize their own countries. However, the palaces these Fey emperors of these mortal Fey countries live in can't even compare to a Earth Fire Hall disciple's palatial residence."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo said with a calm voice, but what she said shocked Yi Yun.</p>
<p>It was equivalent to saying that a palace every Earth Fire Hall disciple was assigned was bigger and more luxurious than a mortal's palace!</p>
<p>Of course, the luxury did not refer to material objects like gold and silver, but mostly arrays for cultivation. All sorts of treasures, vessels, and the palace's construction material like timber and stone were all refined from valuable materials.</p>
<p>In the Fire Cloud State, every Heaven Fire Hall personal disciple was given a mountain, so although the Earth Fire Hall disciples were slightly inferior, they were still given palaces!</p>
<p>There were more than a thousand Earth Fire Hall disciples which made it equivalent to more than 1000 palaces that were gathered together!</p>
<p>Adding the palaces owned by the Elders, deacons and the law-enforces, they form the Fire Cloud State main mountain's complex!</p>
<p>Upon noticing Yi Yun's expression, Fairy Black Bamboo said, "Do you think there are too many palaces? Actually, that's not true. The Luo clan has existed for nearly 100 million years. It has waxed and waned over this period, but it still managed to survive through the times. Although the Fire Cloud State's history is shorter, it also has 50 million years. Even if it takes 10,000 years to build a palace, there would be an accumulation of 5000 palaces. So constructing such a palace complex is very easy."</p>
<p>When Fairy Black Bamboo said this, Yi Yun drew a gasp. Yes, with a hundred million years or fifty million years of history, it was something easily mentionable, but to truly experience it, the length of time was almost impossible to imagine.</p>
<p>Over such a long period of time, a faction's foundation and accumulated strength would reach a terrifying stage.</p>
<p>This palace complex was just a microcosm. The cost to constructing it was inevitably high or it would not have been able to withstand the tens of millions of years of elements. With so many palaces and so few disciples, allocating one palace to each Earth Fire Hall disciple was not considered an extravagant matter. If the palace was not used, it would only sit idle after all.</p>
<p>It was no wonder the miscellaneous chores disciples like Dong Hu, Bai Wei and Sun Lie were so eager to become Earth Fire Hall disciples.</p>
<p>They came from small tribal clans, and the moment they became Earth Fire Hall disciples, it could be said to be reaching the heavens in a single bound!</p>
<p>After all, it was the Fire Cloud State, the Luo clan's Fire Cloud State!</p>
<p>Ignoring the Fire Cloud State's Elders, just the Earth Fire Hall disciples already enjoyed a status much higher than a mortal Fey country's emperor. This could be judged from the amount of resources consumed by the Earth Fire Hall disciples' residence.</p>
<p>From mortals to warriors, it was like heaven and earth. This chasm-like gap was something that could not be closed just because of having the title of emperor! Just think about the difference in lifespans that differed by thousands of times, what more the difference in strength.</p>
<p>Chapter 790: Spirit of the Earth Fire</p>
<p>When Yi Yun stood in front of the opulent palace complex assigned to him, he felt as though he had transformed into a princely aristocrat.</p>
<p>Be it in the Tian Yuan world or the Divine Wilderness in the past, although Yi Yun enjoyed a very high status in the past, his standard of living was extremely simple, nothing like the luxurious life that was awaiting him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up at the plaque placed hanging the palace doors. On it, were the three words written in large font — "Hua Yun Palace". What a coincidence that his palace's name also had the word "Yun".</p>
<p>On Fire Cloud State main mountain, there were 2000 palaces prepared for the Earth Fire Hall disciples, nearly twice the number of disciples. As one of the 2000 palaces, Hua Yun Palace had been left vacant for very long.</p>
<p>At this moment, in front of Yi Yun stood two rows of servants. They were a mix of young men and women.</p>
<p>They were responsible for the daily maintenance and cleaning of Hua Yun Palace as well as serving Yi Yun's daily needs.</p>
<p>Compared to the Heaven Fire Hall disciples, the number of servants the Earth Fire Hall disciples had were not fewer in number. The only difference was the servants having a lower cultivation level. Yi Yun had many servants in front of him, but they were all at the Mortal Blood realm which made them equivalent to mortals.</p>
<p>"In the future, this Hua Yun Palace will be your place of residence. This is your disciple token and the Earth Fire Hall's information booklet."</p>
<p>As Fairy Black Bamboo spoke, she waved her hand, sending a stream of light into Yi Yun's hand. It was an interspatial ring.</p>
<p>Anything handed to Earth Fire Hall disciples were stored in interspatial rings.</p>
<p>"Do you have any other questions?" Fairy Black Bamboo asked.</p>
<p>Yi Yun hesitated slightly as he considered his choice of words. Finally, he said, "Senior, this disciple wants to know what is the fastest way of entering the Luo clan's royal capital?"</p>
<p>Having existed for 100 million years, the Luo clan's foundations were nearly unimaginable. Just a single Fire Cloud State had immense resources, it was sufficient to deeply shock Yi Yun when he saw the immensity of the Fire Cloud State main mountain.</p>
<p>However, a state of the Luo clan was definitely inferior to the royal capital!</p>
<p>The Luo clan's royal capital was indeed a place so vast with brilliant prospects that it allowed much to be accomplished.</p>
<p>"Oh? You want to enter the Luo clan's royal capital?" Upon hearing Yi Yun's question, a glint flashed in Fairy Black Bamboo's eyes. She understood the overtones in Yi Yun's question, so she asked, "Why? Do you think the Fire Cloud State is too small for your growth?"</p>
<p>When Fairy Black Bamboo said this, her eyes turned sharp, causing Yi Yun to falter slightly. With a smile, he said, "That is not what this disciple meant."</p>
<p>It was not true that Yi Yun believed the Fire Cloud State was insufficient for his growth. In fact, with the Fire Cloud State's heritage, it was more than enough for a Yuan Opening realm warrior like him.</p>
<p>However, the higher one went in life, the less one would detest the largeness of the stage they were standing on. If he could go to the Luo clan's royal capital, Yi Yun would definitely not give up the opportunity. There were naturally better opportunities there compared to the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>"I know what you are thinking. It is good to have such ambition, but do not aim for more than you can handle. You only beat three new miscellaneous chores disciples at Mt. Fengling. Do you think that with that, you are qualified to enter the Luo clan's royal capital? You should know that the owner of Mt. Fengling, where you came from, Luo Fengling is also striving hard to enter the Luo clan's royal capital. Furthermore, she is one of the best amongst the Heaven Fire Hall disciples. There are 196 states in the Luo clan, with numerous people like Luo Fengling. All of them share the same goal, cultivating hard without even a breather in a bid to enter the royal capital. Do you think you can beat all of them?"</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo did not mince her words, living up to her harsh and demanding reputation. Many miscellaneous chores disciples had failed the examinations she presided over. Besides ending up severely injured, they were also dealt a heavy blow to their confidence.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo was such a person. Young people, who did not know where they stood after having a bit of ability, would usually suffer a huge setback from taking her examinations.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not respond to Fairy Black Bamboo's sharp retort with any arrogant discourse. He only said, "What Senior said is true. This junior has no intentions of belittling the Fire Cloud State, but this junior believes that Fire Cloud State disciples who do not aim to enter the Luo clan's royal capital would forever be stuck in the Fire Cloud State. I believe that even the Fire Cloud State does not want to nurture such disciples, am I right?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's words, Fairy Black Bamboo's eyebrows pricked up. "You sure are confident. You are right, the Fire Cloud State wishes to nurture people that can leave the Fire Cloud State, becoming figures who have nature at their beck and call in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. By saying this, do you think you are capable of doing that?"</p>
<p>Every word from Fairy Black Bamboo was aggressive, but Yi Yun did not lose his stand because of her. He said, "The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven is filled with the strong, so to have nature at one's beck and call is naturally not simple. This junior does not know what his strength is worth in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, but everything needs to be vied for. What does Senior think?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was steady with his words, with each one of them filled with confidence without any arrogance. Finally, Fairy Black Bamboo stopped aggressively questioning Yi Yun.</p>
<p>She shook her head and said lightly, "The royal capital is like a deep pool of water. The moment you enter the royal capital, you will inevitably set foot into its deep depths. Do not think that just the possession of some talent will allow you to flourish and prosper. The moment a big wave comes, your cultivation level is like a tiny boat in the waves, highly probable of capsizing in the big wave."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo suddenly said something deep and meaningful, stunning Yi Yun slightly.</p>
<p>The royal capital was like a deep pool of water?</p>
<p>From the sound of it, it did not only seem to be referring to the myriad of geniuses and intense competition in the royal capital. She was implying something deeper.</p>
<p>Since Fairy Black Bamboo did not intend to elaborate on it, Yi Yun did not probe any further. He secretly kept it in mind.</p>
<p>At this moment, Fairy Black Bamboo said again, "Read the Earth Fire Hall's booklet. If you obtain the recognition of the Spirit of the Earth Fire, I can arrange for you to enter the royal capital, but it will depend on your own skills as to whether you are able to."</p>
<p>"According to the Earth Fire Hall's rules, by passing my examination, you are considered an in-name disciple of mine. Twenty days later, it will be when the Spirit of the Earth Fire burns most strongly. You just need to look for me when the time comes!"</p>
<p>"Spirit of the Earth Fire?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun hesitated for a moment before saying, "Yes, Senior, this junior shall remember."</p>
<p>After Fairy Black Bamboo was done speaking, she floated away.</p>
<p>She left Yi Yun alone holding the interspatial ring gently in his hand.</p>
<p>The servants were still standing by the side, awaiting Yi Yun's instructions.</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a glance at them. These servants were mostly chosen from mortal Fey. The male were barrel-chested and muscular, while the females were either pure and pleasant-looking or had enchanting and sensual faces.</p>
<p>The number of servants that resided in Fire Cloud State main mountain probably numbered in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>For mortal Fey, being able to enter the Fire Cloud State main mountain to serve the god-like strong was naturally a heartfelt desire and also an opportunity for them. Hence, the servants chosen by the Fire Cloud State were the most outstanding mortal Fey in terms of appearance and build. Those that failed in the looks department were barred from entry.</p>
<p>Yi Yun waved his hand and dismissed them, "Take your leave."</p>
<p>"Yes." The group of servants retreated with their backs bowed. This made Yi Yun chuckle to himself. This sure felt like leading a royal life.</p>
<p>Chapter 791: World Stone</p>
<p>In the inner sanctums of Hua Yun Palace, Yi Yun sat at an old-fashioned Chinese square table that could sit eight. He was looking through the items in the interspatial ring.</p>
<p>The front of the token was engraved with the words "Fire Cloud Earth Fire Token" and on the back was the word "Luo" written in ancient 12 Empyrean Heavens script.</p>
<p>There was a simple set of clothes, a uniform that all Luo clan Earth Fire Hall disciples wore.</p>
<p>There was nothing special about these items but a round stone attracted Yi Yun's attention.</p>
<p>This stone was crystalline and exuded a strange energy fluctuation. Just holding it in hand made his meridians seem to pulse.</p>
<p>World Stone?</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew of this stone. Back in Heaven Martial City, the siblings, Ah Niu and Ah Yu, had taken a World Stone to the Li Fire Sect in the hopes of selling it. They were nearly scammed by the Li Fire Sect before Yi Yun bought the World Stone from them, resulting in a conflict with the Li Fire Sect.</p>
<p>The World Stone was an ore that was created at the beginning of the Universe or the formation of a world.</p>
<p>The Universe was in a state of Chaos to begin with, and in essence, Chaos was energy. As the energy transformed into Yin and Yang, it also split Heaven and Earth apart, resulting in Wind, Rain, Thunder and Lightning, eventually giving rise to all living creatures.</p>
<p>However, not all Chaos energy could transform into Yin and Yang or the five elements. Some energy would condense together, forming Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>Chaos Stones were priceless treasures. This was because it recorded the beginnings of the Universe, the trajectories of Origins energy made it contain the most profound laws.</p>
<p>Weaker than Chaos energy was World energy. They were diluted from Chaos energy, so despite them deviating from the Origins, they were still valuable.</p>
<p>World energy evolved into the 12 Empyrean Heavens, turning into the Three Thousand Worlds.</p>
<p>Similarly, not all World energy could evolve into everything in a world. There would also be some energy that eventually condensed into World Stones.</p>
<p>The value of World Stones were much inferior to Chaos Stones, but they could still be used as a precious treasure for cultivation.</p>
<p>In the large Universe the 12 Empyrean Heavens formed, there were many worlds. Each world's birth would leave behind World Stones.</p>
<p>And even now, in the infinite Universe, there were new worlds evolving or emerging.</p>
<p>Similarly, there were old worlds collapsing or being destroyed, turning into endless energy.</p>
<p>So the production of World Stones could be said to be endless.</p>
<p>In the 12 Empyrean Heavens, World Stones were valuable mining resources fought by major factions. The stones that were mined could be used as currency, allowing one to purchase priceless treasures.</p>
<p>For example, the valuable relics refined by the Luo clan royal capital's Desolate Heaven masters would eventually be auctioned off in exchange for World Stones.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State provided each disciple a World Stone in the form of a salary. In accordance with the Luo clan's rules, every Earth Fire Hall was given one World Stone a year.</p>
<p>"This World Stone is better in quality than the one I obtained in the Tian Yuan world. Back then in the Tian Yuan world, World Stones were extremely rare treasures. Most people could not even recognize it. Even the shopkeeper of the Li Fire Sect shop failed to recognize it."</p>
<p>"However, in the 12 Earth Fire Hall, World Stones are plentiful. As the Large Worlds experience the long passage of time, they undergo life and death. Every birth of a new world would result in the formation of World Stones. It would become a large mineral deposit that can be mined. The numbers wouldn't be small, so every Earth Fire Hall disciple can be given one a year."</p>
<p>With a thousand Earth Fire Hall disciples, that meant a thousand World Stones in a year. Along with the Heaven Fire Hall disciples and the various Elders, the number of World Stones consumed a year would at least number ten thousand.</p>
<p>So many World Stones were just part of the normal operating expenses of one of the Luo clan's states, the Fire Cloud State. If this was in the lower realm, it was simply unimaginable.</p>
<p>As for the World Stones, that was just a portion of the resources the Luo clan consumed.</p>
<p>With such resources and conditions, along with heritage that was hundreds of times better, it was no wonder the mighty figures produced in the 12 Empyrean Heavens far exceeded the lower realms.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun put away the World Stone. He began to read through the booklet which introduced the Earth Fire Hall's rules and the perks of being a Earth Fire Hall disciple.</p>
<p>One of the perks included the most important thing — Spirit of the Earth Fire.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why the Earth Fire Hall was given its name had much to do with the Spirit of the Earth Fire beneath the Earth Fire Hall. The Spirit of the Earth Fire was actually a Earth Fire Spirit. This Fire Spirit had existed for hundreds of millions of years, and had been quietly burning in the Earth Fire Hall's main mountain.</p>
<p>"Spirit of the Earth Fire..."</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Earth Fire had two months a year when it burned most intensely. Whenever that happened, many Earth Fire Hall disciples would mine its fire, using the Spirit of the Earth Fire to refine their bodies, meridians and acquire insight into fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>The Fey race was naturally inferior to humans in nomological insight, but some powerful Fey with noble blood had a natural affinity with particular laws. And the Luo clan's bloodline happened to be associated with fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>Now, there were still a few days left before the Spirit of the Earth Fire burned at its strongest, so Yi Yun ignored all of this. He took over the World Stone and placed it in front of him to absorb it.</p>
<p>The World Stone contained the purest world energy, so with the Purple Crystal in Yi Yun's body, it allowed him to absorb the world energy at a speed many times faster than typical warriors.</p>
<p>Wisps of energy were absorbed by Yi Yun, slowly expanding Yi Yun's Yuan foundation and nourishing the Dao Seed as well as the divine tree planted in it.</p>
<p>An unknown period of time passed as all the energy contained within the entire World Stone was absorbed cleanly by Yi Yun. Not a single ounce of energy was wasted. The energy had nourished Yi Yun's body and was now flowing in his meridians.</p>
<p>"Young master."</p>
<p>A voice was heard from outside the door, making Yi Yun open his eyes.</p>
<p>Although he had been immersed in cultivation, he had split off a bit of his consciousness to monitor the outside world.</p>
<p>As his consciousness was projected outside the door, Yi Yun sensed an aura of a person at the Mortal Blood realm.</p>
<p>"Come in," Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>The door was pushed open as a beautiful girl dressed in green walked in. This girl looked no different from a human, but the only thing that betrayed her race was a furry tail on her back that wriggled around.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's memory was extremely good, so he had some impression of this girl. Her name was Hu'er, one of his servants.</p>
<p>"Young master, the most intense burning period of the Earth Fire Hall's Spirit of the Earth Fire has only ten days left. In accordance with Young master's wishes, Hu'er is here to inform you." Hu'er's voice was sleek and soft. Although she was still young, the natural charm of the Fox race was already in an inchoate state. If this was a mortal world, it was sufficient to make kings of countries fall head over heels for her. They could even forgo their country for this beauty. This girl was still a fox pup, but if she had sufficient strength, even powerful warriors would be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>However, this level of charm did not affect Yi Yun in any way.</p>
<p>"I got it." Before Yi Yun absorbed the World Stone, he had transmitted his voice to these servants to pay attention to matters regarding the Spirit of the Earth Fire.</p>
<p>Chapter 792: Fire Spirit Palace</p>
<p>Yi Yun was very interested in the Spirit of the Earth Fire. Previously, in the lower realm's Fallen Star Gate, he had absorbed a pure Yang spirit. Back then, the pure Yang spirit was being devoured by an injured Golden Crow species. Yi Yun managed to kill the Golden Crow species and finally used the Purple Crystal to absorb the pure Yang spirit . Yi Yun's pure Yang body had much to do with the pure Yang spirit.</p>
<p>Now in the Fire Cloud State, there was this Spirit of the Earth Fire which aroused Yi Yun's curiosity. He wanted to know the differences between the Spirit of the Earth Fire and the pure Yang spirit.</p>
<p>"I'll be going now." Yi Yun stood up. With the World Stone's energy completely absorbed, even Yi Yun's Dao Tree had grown taller. It was even more lush with leaves.</p>
<p>From the late-stages of the Yuan Opening realm, he was already approaching perfection.</p>
<p>The girl, Hu'er, looked at her new master in astonishment. She had met him twice in total. The first time she saw him, she found him extremely powerful and was like a sharp blade. Now weeks later, her master had grown even stronger. The aura he exuded was as deep as the ocean, making it seem extremely amazing.</p>
<p>The Earth Fire Hall was located at the peak of the main mountain, so from afar, the grandiose building appeared to stand in mid air because of the mist that shrouded it.</p>
<p>The Earth Fire Hall's area was hundreds of times bigger than Yi Yun's Hua Yun Palace, and likewise, was many times bigger than a city in the mortal world.</p>
<p>"The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven sure is filled with amazing places." Yi Yun could not help but sigh. Having first come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, just the Fire Cloud State alone had widened Yi Yun's horizons.</p>
<p>By then, Hu'er had already prepared a mount for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun came to the Earth Fire Hall, he was also assigned a fire-elemental bird as his mount. It was an Inferno Gold Condor whose plumage was completely gold in color. Its sharp talons seemed like two burning flames. When it stood up, it was about the height of a person and when it spread its wings, its wingspan was about ten feet wide.</p>
<p>This Inferno Gold Condor was a common bird seen in the Fire Cloud State, but it was relatively new to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>As he stepped onto the Inferno Gold Condor, it flew straight up into the clouds, passing over palace after palace. From afar, Yi Yun looked at the main hall of the Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Soon, with a condor's screech, the Inferno Gold Condor landed in a wide square. Here, the square were carpeted with tiles engraved with flame emblems. The Inferno Gold Condor, which could crush boulders with a swipe of its claws, landed heavily on the square, but it did not leave the slightest mark.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun jumped off the Inferno Gold Condor, it gave out a long screech and flew up. In a blink of an eye, it disappeared into the clouds.</p>
<p>"This is the Earth Fire Hall..." Yi Yun looked at the palace in front of him.</p>
<p>Just the square along was staggering. Its edges seemed to connect to billowing clouds.</p>
<p>The square was bustling with people. From time to time, birds would land with their masters. Yi Yun learned from the booklet from before that other than the Spirit of the Earth Fire, the Earth Fire Hall also held numerous martial arts manuals. There were also armories, elixir storehouses here too in the Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Being able to freely access the Earth Fire Hall was a great perk for the Earth Fire Hall disciples. This also showed how immense the resources the warriors in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this was only limited to the Earth Fire Hall disciples. If it was the Luo clan's royalty, it was unknown how much top resources they enjoyed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun headed to the Earth Fire Hall's entrance. He had been in the main mountain for almost two months, but this was the first time he came to the Earth Fire Hall. As he proceeded, he sized up the place and observed his surroundings.</p>
<p>Before coming, Hu'er informed Yi Yun that the Spirit of the Earth Fire was located in the middle of the Earth Fire Hall, so as Yi Yun observed, he walked straight towards the Earth Fire Hall's center.</p>
<p>"That junior brother in front, please hold on. May I know if you are Junior Brother Yi Yun?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately stopped in his footsteps when he heard the sudden shout.</p>
<p>He looked over and saw two unfamiliar faces who had called out to him.</p>
<p>The man and woman duo did not look too old. The man was below the age of thirty and he looked burly in his animal hide clothing. The girl looked like she was 16&ndash;17 years old. She was dressed in pink short robes, with white boots on her feet. Her hair was tied up into a bun, while her watery eyes flickered. She looked petite and cute.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun had went into reclusion the moment he came to Earth Fire Hall, so he did not know the duo.</p>
<p>"Master Black Bamboo told us that we have a new junior brother. We have seen images of you." The girl's voice was very light and pleasing to the ears, as though it was the beautiful sounds of a hundred larks. She sized up Yi Yun with a look of curiosity without concealing her taboo act. A girl like her was unworldly and pure, so she did not have the concept of shyness.</p>
<p>"We are also Master Black Bamboo's in-name disciples. My name is Man Dao and she is Yun Qiao'er," the man said.</p>
<p>"Oh, so it's Senior Brother Man Dao and Senior Sister Yun, nice to meet you," Yi Yun politely greeted back.</p>
<p>Upon hearing herself being called Senior Sister, Yun Qiao'er immediately turned excited. As she was young and was junior in ranking, being suddenly addressed as Senior Sister by someone who entered the tutelage later was something fresh to her. Her tiny face immediately turned excited and flushed red. Instantly, she became fond of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"From the looks of your direction, you are also heading towards the Fire Spirit Palace. How many times have you been there?" Yun Qiao'er asked.</p>
<p>The place where the Spirit of the Earth Fire was stored was known as the Fire Spirit Palace.</p>
<p>"This is my first time here," Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>"Oh? You are only coming here for the first time? We have already come here thrice." Yun Qiao'er spoke in a lively manner. "This Spirit of the Earth Fire only burns at its peak for two months a year. We have to take advantage of this time to mine the fire to refine our bodies and gain nomological insight. How can coming here once be enough?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled slightly. "I was busy prior to this."</p>
<p>"But there are only ten days left. What a pity..." Yun Qiao'er was still finding it a shame for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Man Dao said by the side, "Alright, Junior Brother Yi has his own considerations. Junior Brother Yi, since this is your first time here, you can follow us. The Earth Fire Hall is massive, so it's easy to get lost."</p>
<p>"That's good." Yi Yun did not object.</p>
<p>Between the duo, Man Dao was a man of few words, while Yun Qiao'er kept chattering nonstop. From her, Yi Yun learned quite a lot about the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven as well as matters regarding the Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>The duo found interest in Yi Yun because they were surprised how Yi Yun became a Earth Fire Hall disciple so quickly after coming from a lower realm. This was even revealed in a slip-up by Yun Qiao'er.</p>
<p>People from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had the impression that people from the lower realms were savages, so it was impressive if a 'savage' could attain such achievements.</p>
<p>Yi Yun constantly smiled while listening. Having just come to the Earth Fire Hall, he was unfamiliar with the place and people. Hence, it was still quite interesting to have the duo explain things to him.</p>
<p>"The Spirit of the Earth Fire is extremely abstruse. It is said that during the birth of the world where the Fire Cloud State resides, the lands naturally produced a first wisp of fire. It was a manifestation of the most chaotic fire-elemental laws. However, the exact profoundness of it cannot be described by words. You will need to witness it yourself, Junior Brother Yi." As Yun Qiao'er said, she revealed a cute smile. "That's the Fire Spirit Palace in front!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked forward and saw a magnificent door erected. There was a plaque that had the words "Fire Spirit Palace" engraved on it. The three words were like leaping flames. Just taking an additional glance at it made one's eyes seem to burn.</p>
<p>"—Luo Tianjun."</p>
<p>The mark indicated that the three words were inscribed by Luo Tianjun. The three words he wrote contained an intense nomological and Yuan Qi fluctuation. It also made one find it hard to peel their eyes away from it.</p>
<p>"Luo Tianjun. I wonder who he is in the Luo clan..."</p>
<p>Yi Yun muttered to himself and was secretly amazed. Just the three words left behind contained a profound principle. This person, Luo Tianjun, was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>"Proceed with the registration over there and when you obtain an identity token, you can enter," Yun Qiao'er said while pointing to a giant Spirit Mastiff lying by the door.</p>
<p>The Spirit Mastiff was covered in silver fur and was massive. It lay there motionless, so if Yun Qiao'er did not point it out, Yi Yun would not have sensed that it was a living thing.</p>
<p>Before they came in front of the Spirit Mastiff, there were already a few people in the midst of registration.</p>
<p>The person in front was dressed in spirit silk clothes. A white fur cloak that looked oily smooth rested on his shoulders, making him look rather resplendent. He came before the Spirit Mastiff and politely said, "Lord Mu Ao, I am Yang Zishan from Ling Xiao Palace and am here to register."</p>
<p>Behind Yang Zishan, there were a few people who dressed similarly. All of them were graceful in bearing, like scions in the mortal world.</p>
<p>Upon seeing these people, the chatty Yun Qiao'er immediately fell silent. Man Dao also slowed down his pace as his expression turned awkward.</p>
<p>The duo appeared to deliberately stood a distance away before their registration, as though they were waiting for Yang Zishan and company to be done with their registration.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could tell that Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao seemed afraid of Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan slowly turned his head behind and after seeing Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er, he revealed a smile that did not look like a smile. He said, "Isn't this Man Dao...How is it? Have you recovered from the injuries sustained during your gamble fight with me? You are coming to the Spirit Fire Palace to mine for fire so soon?"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan did not give Man Dao any face.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yang Zishan's words, Man Dao's expression turned ashen.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Man Dao, do not fall for his tricks. If you were to fight him in a gamble while in a fit of rage, you will still lose." Yun Qiao'er hurriedly tugged at Man Dao whose face had flushed red.</p>
<p>Seeing Man Dao being tugged by Yun Qiao'er, Yang Zishan immediately revealed a cold sneer. At this moment, he turned his eyes onto Yi Yun who was standing beside Yun Qiao'er. He asked curiously, "This is the first time we have met. Who are you?"</p>
<p>The Earth Fire Hall had a thousand disciples, but with a warrior's memory, they could naturally recognize everyone. Hence, it was very striking to see a fresh face in Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, you can ignore him." Yun Qiao'er hurriedly told Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Oh? That means you are also a disciple of Fairy Black Bamboo?" Yang Zishan sized up Yi Yun and said, "I am a disciple of Elder Heaven Scorpio. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>Although Yang Zishan sounded polite, his eyes had a hint of aggression.</p>
<p>Yi Yun lightly clasped his fists and said, "Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, Elder Heaven Scorpio does not have good relationships with our master, so you must be careful of Yang Zishan. He has been in the Earth Fire Hall for a long period of time. His cultivation level has already reached the late-stages of the Heaven Ascension realm and is much more powerful than us!" At this moment, Man Dao's Yuan Qi transmission rang in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>Chapter 793: News of Luo Huo'er</p>
<p>"Oh? The late-stages of the Heaven Ascension realm?"</p>
<p>A strange glint flashed in Yi Yun's eyes. A person at the late-stages of the Heaven Ascension realm was an entire large realm above him!</p>
<p>If this was the Tian Yuan world, an opponent one entire large realm above him was nothing. For example, the Sovereign of the Eventide, Yi Yun could have easily killed him without using his avatar or the Demon God puppet.</p>
<p>But here in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, what would be the outcome if he fought a person at the late-stages of the Heaven Ascension realm, one full realm above him?</p>
<p>Yi Yun had no idea. Although he was confident in his strength, he was not one to put on a supercilious act. The strength of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's geniuses was still an unknown to him. It was impossible to know without any probing attempts.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan had already entered the Fire Spirit Palace, and it was Yi Yun and company's turn to register.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Zishan leave, Man Dao said in a straightforward manner, "Junior Brother Yi, sorry about that. I made a fool of myself in front of you."</p>
<p>It was naturally an inglorious matter having lost a gamble fight with Yang Zishan. Of course, this had to do with Man Dao's cultivation level being lower than Yang Zishan's.</p>
<p>Man Dao was a person with a fiery temper to begin with. When he previously had a conflict with Yang Zishan, he was provoked, and having lost his reason, he made a bet that cost him three World Stones.</p>
<p>This made Man Dao feel the pinch in his heart for a long period of time.</p>
<p>"Victory and defeat are both common in battle. Losing once is nothing. However, Senior Brother Man Dao, you mentioned that our master, Fairy Black Bamboo, and Elder Heaven Scorpio are at odds with each other?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Man Dao said with a nod. "Our master is only a few thousand years old. She became an Earth Fire Hall Elder in the past hundred years, allowing her to preside over the Earth Fire Hall's examinations. Our master's examinations are strict and tough, so the disciples that come out of it naturally aren't bad. The only thing is that it hasn't been a long time since she took in disciples, so not only are there few disciples in number, but the amount of time for them to cultivate is also not much either. So in the Earth Fire Hall, we are considerably weak."</p>
<p>"In fact, this has all to do with factionalism..."</p>
<p>"Factionalism?" Yi Yun was surprised.</p>
<p>"That's right. Actually, it has nothing to do with trivial figures like us. It has to do with the power-struggle amongst the Luo clan's royal family. You probably didn't know, but in the past hundred years, the Luo clan fought a huge war. The stage of war even went all the way to the royal capital and the Luo clan was nearly wiped out. Although the Luo clan eventually won, His Majesty, the Luo Emperor suffered serious injuries in the war, so there are plans for succession."</p>
<p>"The few royal offspring that were designated for succession were evacuated during the war, but they were summoned back when the war was near its end. And the two most eligible people to inherit the throne are Prince Crimson Firmament and Princess Purple Spirit. They have each established their own factions."</p>
<p>"Our master is subordinate to Prince Pingnan, and Prince Pingnan is a close associate of Princess Purple Spirit. And since Elder Heaven Scorpio is a subordinate to Prince Crimson Firmament, they are naturally at odds."</p>
<p>A power-struggle between the royal offspring for the succession to the Luo empyrean throne?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised to hear this as he asked, "Senior Brother Man Dao, you mentioned that the royal offspring, who were designated for succession, had been evacuated during the war. How many people were evacuated during the war?"</p>
<p>"How many could they evacuate? Just two." Man Dao answered matter-of-factly. "Choosing a route of retreat isn't easy. Furthermore, evacuating the successors to ensure the continuation of the bloodline is only reasonable. However, if the entire royal family were to be evacuated, then how can they count on the Luo clan's army to continue fighting the war?"</p>
<p>What Man Dao said was very reasonable.</p>
<p>Typically during the fall of a dynasty in the mortal world, only the princes were evacuated under the escort of loyal subjects. Many emperors would remain in the royal capital to be martyred.</p>
<p>If the emperor along with the entire royal family were to escape, how could they expect their subordinates to fight for them?</p>
<p>"In that case, could Princess Purple Spirit be Luo Huo'er?"</p>
<p>No wonder Fairy Black Bamboo had said that the royal capital was like a deep pool of water. After entering the royal capital, he would be swept up in the storm, and with his own cultivation level, it was easy for him to capsize.</p>
<p>So it had to do with the power struggles over the royal throne!</p>
<p>The throne of the Luo clan was extremely revered. It meant being a true overlord; what's more, an overlord of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It was completely incomparable to the lower realms!</p>
<p>Ignoring the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, even for a family clan in the Tian Yuan world, the succession of power was usually preceded by bloody storm-like tests. The throne of the Luo clan could only be more so.</p>
<p>As low-level disciples, they were automatically placed into a faction according to their masters' allegiance. This was similar to mortal countries in which an examination candidate would automatically become a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the examiner.</p>
<p>"Then what is the current situation regarding the struggle over the royal throne? Who has the upper hand?" Yi Yun asked using a voice transmission.</p>
<p>He wanted to know what situation Luo Huo'er was facing during this power-struggle.</p>
<p>Man Dao laughed and said, "I have no idea too. It's a matter regarding the royal offspring, something we aren't qualified to concern ourselves with. It's better if we enter Fire Spirit Palace."</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave up seeing that he could not get anymore new information. It sure was a coincidence. After having come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, he had taken Fairy Black Bamboo's examination, resulting in him becoming related to Luo Huo'er once again.</p>
<p>However, Luo Huo'er was now a successor to the Luo clan's royal throne, while he was just a new disciple in the Earth Fire Hall. One of them was in the Luo clan royal capital, while the other was in the Earth Fire Hall's Fire Spirit Palace. The distance that separated them was huge.</p>
<p>"Lord Mu Ao." Yun Qiao'er shouted with a clear voice while kneeling down.</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned his gaze towards the Spirit Mastiff and could not help but feel curious.</p>
<p>This Spirit Mastiff did not seem like a living thing. He could not sense any breathing from its body, but its long silver fur and massive body made people feel a sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan and Yun Qiao'er had both addressed this Spirit Mastiff as "Lord", but it was unknown if this Spirit Mastiff was a desolate beast or a Fey race.</p>
<p>The moment Yun Qiao'er finished her sentence, Yi Yun felt a cold aura sweep across his body. In a trance, he felt as though he saw the Spirit Mastiff open its eyes that revealed a pair of pupils. Not only did they appear as though they had experienced the eternal passage of time, but they were also looking at him. However, on closer inspection, the Spirit Mastiff was still motionless. Its eyelids did not even move, much less open its eyes.</p>
<p>This cold feeling also disappeared when he snapped out of the trance, but Yi Yun still felt like there was an eye staring at him from above.</p>
<p>He could only vaguely sense this penetrating gaze, but he could also sense that it was observing him.</p>
<p>"Alright, the registration is done. Let us go in." Yun Qiao'er and company were clearly experiencing the same feelings as Yi Yun; however, since they had been here thrice, they were already used to it. Yun Qiao'er looked forward to the mining of the fire, so she eagerly went ahead of them.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun, you have to be careful!" Yun Qiao'er's pleasant lark-like voice came from the front.</p>
<p>By the time Yi Yun passed through the Fire Spirit Palace's door, he understood why Yun Qiao'er warned him to be careful.</p>
<p>From the outside, the Fire Spirit Palace looked no different from any other palace. However, upon passing through the door, there was only a ladder that reached down far beyond what the eyes could see. The two sides of the ladder had two bean-sized flames that stretched deep down into the deepest depths of darkness.</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er's figure flashed in front before she quickly disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>"The Spirit of the Earth Fire is at the bottom of the main peak." Man Dao said by the side.</p>
<p>Chapter 794: Mining Fire</p>
<p>On the way down the ladder, Yi Yun could still sense the persistence of the watching eye, but he simply ignored it. As he looked at the mountain rock that lined both sides of ladder, he noticed the rock was dark red in color, as though it had been baked red by flames over eons. The texture felt like glass, and they were warm to the touch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were several ancient arcane symbol engraved on the mountain rock. These symbols, like the mountain rock, seemed to have existed from its initial birth. Just touching it allowed one to sense a primitive aura from eons ago.</p>
<p>If there was sufficient time, just cogitating these symbols would result in benefits.</p>
<p>"These are array formations," said a waiting Yun Qiao'er, who had slowed down her speed to wait for them. She had noticed Yi Yun stroking the runic symbols along the way.</p>
<p>"Are these used to suppress the Spirit of the Earth Fire? Or are these energy-gathering arrays?" When Yi Yun heard that they were array formations, he only thought of two possibilities. Array formations engraved in the Fire Spirit Palace were possibly either used to gather Heaven Earth Yuan Qi or used to confine the fire-elemental energy to prevent the energy from dissipating.</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er shook her head and said, "No, it's not."</p>
<p>"Then what is it used for?" Yi Yun was somewhat intrigued.</p>
<p>"We don't know either. Too much time has passed, so maybe it is sealing something," Yun Qiao'er said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked down into the darkness. What was sealed beneath the deep depths at the bottom?</p>
<p>It was unimaginable what could have been sealed since time immemorial or the person who had sealed it...</p>
<p>For ordinary warriors, just descending this ladder was extremely difficult. However, for Yuan Opening realm warriors, this ladder was nothing.</p>
<p>When they reached the end of the ladder, their surroundings were suddenly revealed to their eyes. It was a vast hall, and the roof was a few hundred feet away from the bottom. And in the hall, there was a magma pond.</p>
<p>The magma pond was extremely wide. Red-hot magma was bubbling on the surface and occasionally leaping high into the air. Even at a distance from the magma pond, a rolling heat wave surged at them. Warriors, who lacked the requisite cultivation levels, would be burnt to a crisp just by standing here.</p>
<p>It was even likely for Yuan Opening realm warriors to get poisoned by the toxic flames if they spent too much time here.</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao had just began mining the sacred fire to temper their bodies and gain insights into fire-elemental laws, so their tolerance towards the toxic fire was not considered strong. Just standing there for a moment caused Yun Qiao'er's face to glow red. As for Man Dao, his forehead was covered with a fine layer of sweat.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun, in order to resist the toxic fire here, you need to constantly circulate your Yuan Qi, so it is extremely draining. Typically, people can't last here for long so they will have to leave. This is your first time here, so you might not be accustomed to it. Let's hurry up and..." As Yun Qiao'er spoke, she heard Yi Yun take a deep breath.</p>
<p>She turned her head over, only to be astonished to find that not only was Yi Yun withstanding the toxic fire, but there was also not even a droplet of sweat on his face.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a pure Yang body to begin with. Pure Yang could be said to be the flames that resided in the stars, it was a level higher than fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>Just a pure Yang body was nothing much in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, but Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal. With the Purple Crystal naturally absorbing the toxic fire, it would convert the toxic fumes into pure energy that flowed through Yi Yun's body. And in certain ways, by standing here, instead of feeling discomfort, Yi Yun actually felt mentally and physically refreshed.</p>
<p>"I cultivate in pure Yang laws." Yi Yun rubbed his chin and explained when he saw Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao look at him.</p>
<p>When Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao heard this, they were even more baffled. If pure Yang laws could easily resolve toxic fire, then what sort of pure Yang laws were they? Wasn't Yi Yun from a savage-like lower realm?</p>
<p>Despite being puzzled, they did not directly ask Yi Yun the mysteries of what he cultivated. After all, it involved his secrets.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun, that in front is the Spirit of the Earth Fire and can only be described as extraordinary. The toxic fire produced by the magma here can't even compare to 10&ndash;20% of the Spirit of the Earth Fire."</p>
<p>Tracing Man Dao's gaze, Yi Yun looked at the white flower in the middle of the magma pond. Of course, it was not a flower but a dancing flame.</p>
<p>In the magma burned a white flame, which was none other than the Spirit of the Earth Fire!</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Earth Fire was purer than the pure Yang spirit Yi Yun had absorbed in the lower realm by more than a thousand times or even ten thousand times!</p>
<p>Although it was just a plume of fire, the energy contained within was enough to raze the Tian Yuan world to the ground.</p>
<p>"The Spirit of the Earth Fire has existed since the birth of this land. Unless the land is destroyed, it will never extinguish." Man Dao followed up.</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Earth Fire was a manifestation of the Heaven and Earth fire-elemental laws and the fusion of fire-elemental laws. The Spirit of the Earth Fire's existence was extremely special, so it was no wonder Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er was surprised by Yi Yun's lack of fear towards the toxic fire.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan and company, who had arrived before them, had already occupied a corner to mine the fire.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan used both his hands to form a seal, and then using his Yuan Qi, he split off a bean-sized fire spark from the Spirit of the Earth Fire, before bringing it in front of him.</p>
<p>It could be seen that just this tiny fire spark was producing heat waves in front of him. If not for using Yuan Qi to isolate the heat wave, the fur cloak on him would definitely have been burnt to a crisp.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan looked at the fire spark with a serious expression. He used Yuan Qi to carefully envelop the fire spark before opening his mouth.</p>
<p>Sou! The fire spark that was enveloped by Yuan Qi immediately flew into his mouth. Following that, Yang Zishan immediately sat down to meditate. Large amounts of hot vapor emitted from the top of his head. As he tightly closed his eyes, Yang Zishan's body produced intense Yuan Qi fluctuations. Clearly, he was in the midst of absorbing the fire spark and gaining insight from it.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was powerful, but he was also dedicated in his cultivation. Although he had noticed Yi Yun and company arrive, he did not distract himself by looking them in the eye.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Zishan successfully mine the fire, Man Dao grunted unpleasantly before saying, "Let us begin too. Junior Brother Yi, look at how it is done by us. Do not attempt it too easily. The Spirit of the Earth Fire is extremely dangerous."</p>
<p>Yi Yun and the duo each took a spot. There were dozens of Earth Fire Hall disciples standing around the magma pond mining the fire. As Yi Yun observed them, he realized that the fire sparks they mined were even smaller. After they absorbed it, they would usually grimace in pain. In comparison, Yang Zishan was indeed much more at ease.</p>
<p>Although Man Dao was displeased with Yang Zishan, the fire spark he mined from the Spirit of the Earth Fire was just the size of a sesame seed. And just accomplishing this covered his forehead with sweat. Slowly, he pulled the fire spark in front of him.</p>
<p>The burning heat wave was something he could barely withstand.</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er also sat on the ground as she began to concentrate on the fire mining.</p>
<p>After looking around him, he realized through his observations that mining fire was indeed very difficult.</p>
<p>One needed to use Yuan Qi to separate a portion from the Spirit of the Earth Fire. If too much was isolated, the warrior might not be able to control it, causing the fire spark to explode. The toxic fire might end up causing a backlash, resulting in outcomes that ranged from feeling discomfort to being severely injured.</p>
<p>Hence, all the warriors were extremely careful when they mined the fire. Even Yang Zishan did not dare mine much. As for Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao, the amount they mined was even lesser.</p>
<p>Chapter 795: Fire-Spirit Transmutation</p>
<p>In the successful mining of fire, one's cultivation level and strength were non-trivial factors; however, the greatest factor was determined by one's understanding of fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>The deeper one's understanding in fire-elemental laws, the easier it was to mine the fire.</p>
<p>And the easier it was to mine the fire, the more fire-elemental energy could be obtained. This would then allow a person's understanding towards fire-elemental laws to deepen and turn more profound, as well as steadily strengthen one's cultivation level!</p>
<p>Hence, the Earth Fire Hall disciples' fire mining of the Spirit of the Earth Fire became something extremely important. The strong would become stronger, while the weak would become weaker.</p>
<p>In fact, not only Earth Fire Hall disciples came here, but even Heaven Fire Hall disciples would also occasionally make the trip here to mine for fire.</p>
<p>At this moment, amongst all the disciples mining fire, Yang Zishan was the one that had the deepest understanding of fire-elemental laws. The fire spark he mined was the biggest and he was also the fastest to absorb it amongst everyone present.</p>
<p>That bit of fire spark had sunk into his Dantian and had been mostly absorbed by him.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er. Man Dao was at a critical stage of his fire-mining process, so he was sweating profusely and persisting with great effort.</p>
<p>Although he could barely persist on, Man Dao steadily refined the Earth fire, eliminating the chaotic energies from it, so as to make it easy for absorption.</p>
<p>If this went on, Man Dao would succeed in his fire mining in about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Beside Man Dao, Yun Qiao'er's speed was slightly slower. The young lady's cultivation level was lower than Man Dao's to begin with, so it was a struggle for her as she barely held on. Her face was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>Seeing the barely persisting Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er, a teasing smile suffused from the corners of Yang Zishan's lips. It was as though he was waiting for something.</p>
<p>At this moment, the few Earth Fire Hall disciples beside Yang Zishan were also done with their fire-mining. They had become Earth Fire Hall disciples for quite some time now, so although they were considered lackeys of Yang Zishan, they were not much weaker than Man Dao in terms of strength. Anyone who could enter the Earth Fire Hall was no ordinary person.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan, why have you stopped? With Senior Brother Zishan's strength, mining another eight or ten times wouldn't even be a problem! Hahaha!" An Earth Fire Hall disciple that followed Yang Zishan around said to him with a smile.</p>
<p>The number of times one could mine fire was a close reflection of one's strength. At Man Dao's strength, he could at best do it three or four times, while Yun Qiao'er could only manage fewer. Two or three times would be her limit.</p>
<p>As for Yang Zishan, mining seven or eight times was indeed not a problem.</p>
<p>"Ha, I'll continue mining for you to see. Speaking about it, I happened to learn a new technique the past few days. I made a tiny improvement in fire-elemental laws, so let me show it to all of you."</p>
<p>"Alright, please broaden my horizons!" The Earth Fire Hall disciples said in unison. Many of them were Elder Heaven Scorpio's disciples, a result of his long tenure at Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan chuckled and suddenly looked at Man Dao. Targeting at the tiny bit of fire spark in front of Man Dao, he shouted, "I'll let all of you see my new technique. Come, fire!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan grabbed out at the air towards the fire spark in front of Man Dao!</p>
<p>The flickering fire spark, which was originally in front of Man Dao, suddenly began to vibrate intensely after Yang Zishan made a telekinetic grab at it!</p>
<p>The fire spark turned erratic as though it was being strongly attracted by a force. It began flying towards Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Man Dao, who was in the midst of desperately refining the Earth fire, suddenly opened his eyes. His forehead was covered in bean-sized sweat droplets. He watched the Earth fire that he was nearly done refining being snatched away by Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>"Yang Zishan, you!"</p>
<p>Man Dao stared with a furious gaze. Refining a fire spark consumed a great deal of Yuan Qi. Yet, it had been snatched away by Yang Zishan just as it was almost done refining! So how could Man Dao not be enraged?</p>
<p>He could only mine three or four times per trip to the Fire Spirit Palace because he would end up drained of all his Yuan Qi by the end of it. Now, the fire spark had been snatched by Yang Zishan after he had finished consuming Yuan Qi needed for one fire-mining attempt. It was equivalent to wasting one chance of his, so how could he take this lying down!?</p>
<p>But at the same moment his anger flared, Man Dao also turned shocked. The Earth fire that he was almost done refining was equivalent to having a mark imprinted by him. It would have made it much easier for him to control the fire spark than Yang Zishan, but even so, it had still been snatched away by Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>This meant that Yang Zishan's control over Earth fire far surpassed his.</p>
<p>"Trying to snatch my Earth fire, dream on!"</p>
<p>Man Dao was a hot tempered person, so he could not tolerate such acts. He grabbed at the Earth fire that had yet to float far away. It was situated closer to Man Dao, and along with him having refined it previously, his grab should in principle allow him to easily bring it back.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, a layer of red mist emitted from Yang Zishan's palm. It was like rolling red smoke that enveloped the fire spark, segregating Man Dao's nomological force from the Earth fire.</p>
<p>Following that, the Earth fire in Man Dao's hands seemed to gain an intelligence. It started flying towards Yang Zishan on its own accord, as though it had its own consciousness and knew how to make a choice.</p>
<p>"Fire-Spirit Transmutation!"</p>
<p>Standing not far from Yang Zishan, an Earth Fire Hall disciple's eyes lit up upon seeing this scene.</p>
<p>Many disciples who were planning on continuing mining for fire stopped at this moment to watch the struggle.</p>
<p>Fire-Spirit Transmutation was to endow flames with a little spirituality, allowing the fire to seem to possess life. This was an extremely difficult to master fire-elemental law. From the looks of it, Yang Zishan's mentioning of his tiny improvement in fire-elemental laws referred to Fire-Spirit Transmutation!</p>
<p>This wasn't a 'tiny improvement', it was basically a qualitative leap in fire control!</p>
<p>Once the flame possessed some spiritually, then be it controlling the flame for an attack or the manipulation of the flame, there would be nothing in comparison!</p>
<p>Fire-Spirit Transmutation...The bastard, Yang Zishan, sure had the skills!</p>
<p>Man Dao clenched his teeth. This form of nomological fire control far exceeded his, so it was no wonder Yang Zishan dared to snatch his fire.</p>
<p>Having a flame that he had mostly refined snatched away made Man Dao aggrieved, but what could he do? Refining Earth fire in the Fire Spirit Palace was meritocratic. It was not against the rules to snatch the flames of others, and you could only blame yourself for being weak if it happened to you.</p>
<p>However, under normal circumstances, nobody would deliberately snatch the flames of others. This was something that did not benefit oneself, but Yang Zishan and Man Dao were at odds with each other, or to be precise, Elder Heaven Scorpio and Fairy Black Bamboo were at odds with each other. The factional struggles were passed down from Elders to disciples!</p>
<p>"Haha, Man Dao, you sure are down on your luck to meet me today. Don't think of mining any bit of fire sparks. If you are indignant about it, have a gamble fight with me!"</p>
<p>While competing with Man Dao over the control of the flame, Yang Zishan was still able to distract himself by speaking. As for Man Dao, he was sweating bullets, so it was immediately clear who had the upper hand.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan suddenly looked at Yun Qiao'er. The Earth fire in front of her was about 60&ndash;70% done, and she could barely persist on.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan grinned and shouted, "Fire, come!"</p>
<p>He used his other hand and grabbed at the air, causing the Earth fire in front of Yun Qiao'er to immediately be snatched by Yang Zishan. The second Earth fire also began floating towards Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>Chapter 796: Fire, come</p>
<p>"Ah!" Yun Qiao'er exclaimed as she widened her black eyes. She watched helplessly as she lost control of the Earth fire that she had painstakingly refined. It was already flying towards Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>"My Earth fire!"</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er turned anxious as she hurriedly circulated her Yuan Qi in a bid to summon the Earth fire back, but she was much weaker than Man Dao, so how could she compete with Yang Zishan?</p>
<p>"You...You..." Yun Qiao'er nearly became a weeping beauty. She had just joined the Earth Fire Hall, only a few days earlier than Yi Yun, so she had never experienced such bullying before. The intense competition between Earth Fire Hall disciples far exceeded Yun Qiao'er's expectations.</p>
<p>"Yang Zishan! Do you still consider yourself a man after bullying a young lady?" Man Dao angrily cursed Yang Zishan, having realized he could neither control his flame nor help Yun Qiao'er.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan guffawed and said, "Man Dao, why are you saying such retarded words? In a warrior's world, there is only the weak and strong. When has there been a consideration between men and women? If you are weak, shut up and take a good beating. Saying such words that are no different than a shrew shouting abuse on the streets will only make people look down on you."</p>
<p>Once Yang Zishan said this, the surrounding Earth Fire Hall disciples began to laugh heartily.</p>
<p>The factional battle in the Luo clan had always been intense. Although the Luo clan knew of the situation, they ignored it and allowed this to proceed. After all, only competition gave birth to the strong.</p>
<p>"Come over!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan tapped at the Earth fire Yun Qiao'er refined, causing the second Earth fire to also seem to have a mind of its own.</p>
<p>The two Earth fire fire sparks were already completely under Yang Zishan's control.</p>
<p>He joined his hands together, merging the fire sparks together. It went from fire sparks to a small flame.</p>
<p>This small flame slowly floated towards Yang Zishan. It was already completely out of Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er's control.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Man Dao, I..."</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er was close to tears. She was naturally aggrieved having been bullied in such a manner. This was a flame she had painstakingly refined. There was only a short period of time the Spirit of the Earth Fire burned at its strongest every year. Missing it would greatly affect her cultivation progress.</p>
<p>Man Dao nearly crushed his teeth from his gritting. He hated himself for being useless. He had always treated this newly arrived junior sister as a true younger sister. He had taken care of her, hoping that she would not be bullied in the Earth Fire Hall, but now, he had implicated her.</p>
<p>At this moment, the small Earth fire flame was already in Yang Zishan's hands.</p>
<p>After snatching Yun Qiao'er's flame, Yang Zishan looked at Yi Yun. He said with a teasing tone, as though he was a cat playing with a mouse, "This newly arrived Junior Brother Yi, aren't you going to mine for fire? Why don't you try mining a plume once?"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan's mockery caused all the Earth Fire Hall disciples around him to burst out into laughter. His intentions were clear — with him here today, none of Fairy Black Bamboo's disciples were to mine for fire. If Yi Yun were to mine for fire, it would naturally be snatched away.</p>
<p>"Hey new kid, mine one."</p>
<p>"Come on, do your best at mining. Do not stand on ceremony!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan's junior brothers began booing as they poked fun at Yi Yun. From their point of view, Yi Yun was likely worse than Yun Qiao'er, so he was naturally nothing to speak of in front of Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this situation, Yi Yun only smiled. He did not begin to mine the fire but instead said, "I'll just take a look first. There's no hurry."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Hearing Yi Yun say such self-mocking words as though he was humiliating himself, Yang Zishan's junior brothers all laughed hysterically.</p>
<p>This new kid sure was a wonder. It was inconceivable for him to say such words considering the circumstances. He even said that there was "no hurry"?</p>
<p>Man Dao's face was already red. To be bullied this badly, he really wanted to charge up and engage in a huge battle.</p>
<p>However, he knew that the three of them put together was no match for Yang Zishan alone.</p>
<p>After grasping 'Fire-Spirit Transmutation' laws, Yang Zishan enjoyed a qualitative leap over his control over Earth fire. A sneer suffused on his lips as he looked at Man Dao who was full of killing intent.</p>
<p>"You want to fight? You can choose to have a gamble fight with me. I'll give you a handicap of a hand!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan knew that even though Man Dao was a hot tempered and simple-minded person, Man Dao would not be stupid enough to bet with him again after having lost a gamble fight with him previously. After all, the stakes were not small, something Man Dao could not afford to lose.</p>
<p>Hence, he deliberately provoked Man Dao by giving a hand's handicap!</p>
<p>With this said, the surrounding Earth Fire Hall disciples around Yang Zishan immediately began to boo.</p>
<p>"This trash. Even if Senior Brother Zishan gives him a handicap of a hand, he would definitely not dare accept it."</p>
<p>"With just this bit of guts, if I had any say, he should just honestly go home and be a farmer!"</p>
<p>The bunch of Earth Fire Hall disciples began to sneer sarcastically. Man Dao clenched his fists tightly, causing the veins on his fists to bulge. At this moment, he was like a simmering volcano!</p>
<p>He was feeling hate, but he could still endure it!</p>
<p>He knew very well that after Yang Zishan gained insights into Fire-Spirit Transmutation, his strength had improved greatly.</p>
<p>In the previous gamble fight, Man Dao became deeply aware of the differences in their strength. He had not made any significant improvements recently, so if he were to truly battle Yang Zishan, he would still likely lose despite a handicap!</p>
<p>If he lost another match, not only would he lose all his possessions, but he would also be ridiculed by Elder Heaven Scorpio's disciples. He would be mocked for his stupidity and how he overestimated his strength. If that happened, his confidence would be destroyed.</p>
<p>He had to bear with the humiliation he received today. He could not suffer in the future because of a fit of anger.</p>
<p>As Man Dao was being ridiculed while Yun Qiao'er looked pitiful, Yang Zishan was mostly done refining the Earth fire in his hands.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was a person who liked to make his power felt. In front of his junior brothers, and in front of his enemies, he showed off with boundless enthusiasm. Hence, he spared no effort to use 'Fire-Spirit Transmutation' laws. Although it was draining on his Yuan Qi, it also allowed him to refine the Earth fire at a faster speed.</p>
<p>In less than a minute, Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er's Earth fire was about 80% refined by him.</p>
<p>Of course, Yang Zishan did not do it with great ease. 'Fire-Spirit Transmutation' was extremely draining on the body, but thankfully, as long as he refined this Earth fire, the energy within it would replenish his stamina, allowing him to continue mining for fire.</p>
<p>Noticing how things were pretty much over and that staying behind was only inviting humiliation on themselves, Man Dao gritted his teeth and said, "Let us go! Junior Brother Yi, I'm sorry. I wanted to bring you here to mine for fire and show it to you how it is done but we ended up meeting my enemy. Not only did I not teach you how to mine for fire, but you also can't mine it now."</p>
<p>Man Dao sighed. Even a girl like Yun Qiao'er was not spared by Yang Zishan, what more Yi Yun? As disciples of Fairy Black Bamboo, there was no hope for Yi Yun to mine for fire under Yang Zishan's watchful eyes.</p>
<p>He planned to protect Yi Yun and Yun Qiao'er, but with the way things had played out, he was truly a failure.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun shook his head and did not wish to leave. Instead he said, "Senior Brother Man Dao, Yang Zishan's Earth fire is almost done refining."</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>After a momentary shock, he turned to look at Yang Zishan. In order to play up his ability, Yang Zishan had worked hard at using 'Fire-Spirit Transmutation' laws, making the speed at which he refined the Earth fire double, so it was nearly 90% done.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was about to swallow the Earth fire into his stomach!</p>
<p>Man Dao did not know why Yi Yun made such a hanging sentence. He was waiting for Yang Zishan to finish refining the Earth fire? What else could they do other than watch Yang Zishan show off?</p>
<p>At the moment Man Dao was pondering over Yi Yun's words, Yang Zishan was done refining the Earth fire.</p>
<p>With a laugh, he opened his mouth and was about to swallow the Earth fire. He did not even bother wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>The Earth fire was already in the bag.</p>
<p>At this moment, a wicked smile suffused on Yi Yun's lips. He had waited so long, all for this moment.</p>
<p>He looked straight at the Earth fire that was about to be swallowed by Yang Zishan. With a thought, he interfaced his spiritual energy with the Purple Crystal, and targeted the plume of Earth fire.</p>
<p>Weng!</p>
<p>The Earth fire suddenly quivered. Having been attracted by the Purple Crystal's power, it came to a halt immediately.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan's mouth had just closed, but because of the Earth fire stopping, it caused him to only swallow empty air.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was stunned as he did not know what had happened to the Earth fire. As for the other Earth Fire Hall disciples around him, they were also momentarily stunned. What was the profound reason behind Yang Zishan's failure at swallowing the fire?</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun stretched out his hand and gently waved at the Earth fire.</p>
<p>"Fire, come!"</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>With a howl, the flame in front of Yang Zishan tore through the void. It flew hastily towards Yi Yun, like a rabbit that had escaped from its cage.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan stared with widened eyes. What was going on?</p>
<p>Chapter 797: Taste of One's Own Medicine</p>
<p>The Earth fire flew at an astonishing speed away from Yang Zishan as he instantly lost control over it. The turn of events alarmed Yang Zishan. He came to the Spirit Fire Hall for fire-ming every year in his long tenure at Earth Fire Hall, and he had done so numerous times, but he had never encounter such a situation!</p>
<p>Regardless of how much he powered his spiritual energy, he could not stop the Earth fire from escaping his grasp. Only after several seconds did the plume of Earth fire gradually come to a stop.</p>
<p>And when the Earth fire stopped, it caused Yang Zishan's face to sink completely.</p>
<p>He saw a youth garbed in clothes only newly recruited Earth Fire Hall disciples would wear. The youth had nonchalantly stretched out his palm, while the plume of Earth fire stably stopped above it, burning in absolute silence.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan, this..."</p>
<p>The other Earth Fire Hall disciples were stunned. At this moment, they were able to tell that the flight of the Earth fire was obviously not done deliberately by Yang Zishan, it had been stolen by that new disciple from the Black Bamboo faction!</p>
<p>They had been cheering for Yang Zishan over his ostentatious moves, but they never expected that in a blink of an eye, before he was done flaunting his skills, he had a taste of his own medicine!</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan must have been careless. As the Earth fire was done refining, he relaxed and lowered his spiritual control, allowing the rascal to take advantage."</p>
<p>As a veteran in the Earth Fire Hall, Yang Zishan's talent was top class in the entire Earth Fire Hall, if not, those people would not have chosen to be his lackeys.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was outstanding, and had even grasped "Fire-Spirit Transmutation" laws. But this made it even harder for them to believe that a veteran like Yang Zishan would lose to a newcomer. Furthermore, the other person appeared to be...human!?</p>
<p>"Your name is Yi Yun?" Yang Zishan stared. He had previously heard Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er mention Yi Yun's name, and originally believed that Yi Yun was Man Dao's lackey, so he did not even look at Yi Yun straight. He never expected to fail miserably at an easy task of absorbing the Earth fire at that instantaneous moment.</p>
<p>It was true that his spiritual control was at its most relaxed state the moment he was done refining the Earth fire, but even so, this kid should not have the ability to snatch the Earth fire that was already in his hands.</p>
<p>"Why ask when you already know?" Yi Yun gently stretched out his index finger as the tiny flame began to burn silently above his finger tip, like any ordinary flame.</p>
<p>At this moment, Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er, who were standing beside Yi Yun, were staring with widened eyes. Just like the other Earth Fire Hall disciples, they were watching at the tiny plume of fire burning above Yi Yun's finger tip with looks of disbelief.</p>
<p>Was this really a flame separated from the Spirit of the Earth Fire? Why did it appear so obedient?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was obvious that Junior Brother Yi Yun came from the lower realm, so how could he have mastered such profound laws?</p>
<p>Although they had no clue what was going on, Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er felt their pent-up anger released when they saw Yang Zishan's expression. Yang Zishan definitely never expected a newly recruited disciple to be able to snatch his Earth fire.</p>
<p>Man Dao laughed out loudly. "Yang Zishan, didn't you previously say that newly-recruited Junior Brother Yi should 'try mining a plume once'? This is the first time our newly-recruited Junior Brother Yi has come to the Fire Spirit Palace and it is also his first time mining for fire!"</p>
<p>Man Dao kept repeating 'newly-recruited Junior Brother Yi', and deliberately emphasized 'newly-recruited' as an attempt to figuratively smack Yang Zishan in the face.</p>
<p>Weren't you being awesome? But didn't you end up getting cleaned up by a newly-recruited disciple?</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er was also one who did not spare her words when reason was on her side. Having been bullied to near tears, how could she pass the opportunity to ridicule?</p>
<p>"Ze Ze Ze, didn't all of you just tell Junior Brother Yi to 'not stand on ceremony'? Now Junior Brother has went according to your wishes and really didn't stand on ceremony. Shouldn't all of you be happy? Speaking of which, why are all your faces looking so bad now? Are you sick?"</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er's words were harsh to the ear, stabbing at Yang Zishan where it hurt him the most. Yang Zishan's face turned ashen.</p>
<p>"Fine! Fine! It's indeed true that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers, to be able to rob me of my flame at the instant I finished refining my Earth fire, that sure is some talent!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan was a person who liked to make his power felt. Having suddenly smacked in the face by Yi Yun just as he was flaunting his powers was something he found intolerable.</p>
<p>He came from a prominent family and had outstanding talent. Even in the Earth Fire Hall, he was the center of attention. All of this was something he enjoyed greatly, but now, he had suffered in the hands of a disciple who had just come into contact with Earth fire. At this moment in time, Yang Zishan felt a hundred times more humiliated than what Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er felt moments ago.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan, show him something good!"</p>
<p>"This guy only caught you by surprise, he has no abilities!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan's lackeys immediately roared out.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan's expression turned grim. He knew deep down that Yi Yun was not one to be trifled with, but he already had a tiger by the tail, so he had to persist on. He planned on using all his strength and push all his insights in fire-elemental laws to the extreme!</p>
<p>"Ha!" Yang Zishan roared out loudly as all the joints on his body produced snapping sounds. Small scales suddenly began appearing on his face, and his pupils turned spindle-shaped.</p>
<p>Snake!</p>
<p>Yang Zishan's ancestor was a python that had achieved its Dao. Furthermore, he had ancestors with fire python bloodlines, so Yang Zishan had a natural affinity with fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>"He is transforming just like that?" Man Dao was stunned. Yang Zishan was really going all out!</p>
<p>For Yang Zishan to transform in order to snatch Earth fire from Yi Yun, it clearly showed how powerful a rival Yi Yun was. He could only snatch the Earth fire from Yi Yun by giving his all. He could only be appeased by doing so, or this matter would become a disgrace the rest of his life.</p>
<p>"Ah&ndash;"</p>
<p>A hissing sound that did not sound human at all came from Yang Zishan's thoracic cavity. His body was burning in flames as he aimed at the flame above Yi Yun's finger and suddenly tapped.</p>
<p>Fire-Spirit Transmutation!</p>
<p>A violent and dominating Yuan Qi surged into the Earth fire floating above Yi Yun's palm.</p>
<p>"Hu! Hu! Hu!"</p>
<p>The flame began to dance erratically as though it had been given a spirit by Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>Around Yang Zishan, many disciples had their eyes lit up.</p>
<p>It was still Fire-Spirit Transmutation! By giving the flame some spirituality, it would naturally bias itself to the person who had given it a spirit, Yang Zishan!</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, since he was young disciple that recently arrived, how could he possess fire-elemental laws as profound as Fire-Spirit Transmutation?</p>
<p>"Fire, come!" Yang Zishan roared as he forcefully grabbed at the fire plume in Yi Yun's hand.</p>
<p>The flame began to dance violently as though it was about to fly out of Yi Yun's grasp.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the dancing flame as a tiny sneer suffused from his lips.</p>
<p>Fire-Spirit Transmutation that gives the flame a spirit?</p>
<p>If you could truly bestow the flame life, allowing this flame to turn into Fey, then the Purple Crystal would be powerless against it since the Purple Crystal could not control energy that possessed life.</p>
<p>However, bestowing life was equivalent to creating an intelligent creature, so how could it be that simple? Even peerless mighty figures lacked this ability. Only the Universe, with its infinite energy could produce life over hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Now, it was just a trace of spirituality that was forcefully augmented by Yang Zishan. It was equivalent to Yang Zishan's will, so for this Yi Yun did not care for it at all.</p>
<p>Spiritual energy burst forth from the Purple Crystal!</p>
<p>"Extinguish!"</p>
<p>The hand Yi Yun that held the Earth fire suddenly made a grip!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With an explosion, Yang Zishan's consciousness contained within the flame was destroyed with Yi Yun's grip.</p>
<p>Having his split-off consciousness wiped out, Yang Zishan grunted as his face suddenly turned pale.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun spread out his hand again as the Earth fire plume burned silently as usual above Yi Yun's palm.</p>
<p>In Yang Zishan's eyes, the flames danced, as though they were mocking him. This made his expression turn extremely ugly.</p>
<p>And beside Yang Zishan, the Earth Fire Hall disciples that had cheered on Yang Zishan were like roosters grabbed by the neck. They were lost for words.</p>
<p>How did he do it?</p>
<p>Yang Zishan had transformed and used Fire-Spirit Transmutation laws. It looked extremely powerful, while Yi Yun did not seem to unleash any powerful laws, so how did he destroy Yang Zishan's Fire-Spirit Transmutation?</p>
<p>"This guy is a freak!" An Earth Fire Hall disciple murmured. Despite being reluctant, he had to admit the facts. Yi Yun had just entered the Earth Fire Hall and was already this powerful during his first fire-mining. These Earth Fire Hall disciples had all experienced their first fire-mining. Back then, they had to be extremely careful and had made repeated attempts. Some even failed several times before succeeding.</p>
<p>But for Yi Yun, now only was he mining for fire as though he was picking cotton, he had even directly snatched a plume of Earth fire from Yang Zishan. It was inconceivable.</p>
<p>Chapter 798: Fire-elemental Laws</p>
<p>At this moment, Yang Zishan's face sank so low that it appeared like a falling water droplet. Having transformed and having used "Fire-Spirit Transmutation" was already pushing his limits. It consumed a great deal of his Yuan Qi and with his consciousness and will that he attached to the Earth fire being wiped away, not only did Yang Zishan feel an energy deficit, but he also felt a dull pain in his mind.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he appeared extremely relaxed... Yang Zishan hatefully looked at the fire plume in Yi Yun's hand and knew that he had embarrassed himself greatly today. If he continued to stay here, there was no way he could win back any face and he would even have to continue enduring Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er's ridicule.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan gritted his teeth and said softly, "We won't be fire-mining today. Let us go!"</p>
<p>Having said that, Yang Zishan flicked his sleeves and left.</p>
<p>The disciples of Elder Heaven Scorpio looked at each other. They had to leave before they even began mining for fire?</p>
<p>However, the moment they saw Yi Yun looking at them with a faint smile that did not look like a smile, they felt their hearts jump from the wicked look he had.</p>
<p>"Let's go. Even if we manage to mine any fire, it will be snatched by him. Senior Brother Zishan can't even protect his Earth fire after using Fire-Spirit Transmutation, so it will be pointless even if we tried."</p>
<p>"Waiting here stupidly will just be an embarrassment. Who knew that this newly recruited disciple would be this powerful. Since we are inferior, sigh..."</p>
<p>These disciples shook their heads and sighed before they left.</p>
<p>Although they could not mine for fire today, there were still ten days left and Yi Yun could not be constantly here. Everyone would spend at least a few days to consolidate the results of their fire-mining, so they could always come again.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo had only become an Earth Fire Hall Elder relatively recently, so she did not have many disciples under her. As for Elder Heaven Scorpio, he was one of the Elders with the largest faction and had numerous disciples under him.</p>
<p>The competition between warriors in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was intense. Everything depended on strength. As Fairy Black Bamboo's disciples were few in number, they were often marginalized and oppressed. Although Man Dao had joined the Earth Fire Hall for quite a period of time, this was the first day he managed to vent his anger and be elated.</p>
<p>Seeing Yang Zishan and company leave in a hurry, Man Dao laughed loudly from behind, "Scramming so quickly? What happened to all the majesty from before!?"</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er also laughed and said, "With my Junior Brother Yi Yun here, it's best you don't come to Fire Spirit Palace, or you will only make a fool of yourself!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun watched as Elder Heaven Scorpio's disciples left. Before Yang Zishan took his leave, his snakelike eyes looked at him with a vicious gaze, as though he had been stared at by a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew Yang Zishan hated him completely, but he did not mind. His goal was the Luo clan royal capital. Even the Heaven Fire Hall was not his goal, so an Earth Fire Hall disciple was naturally not worth his attention.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Fire Spirit Palace was half-empty. The remaining Earth Fire Hall disciples did not have Elder Heaven Scorpio as their master so although they did not leave, they were somewhat flustered as they looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>No one knew if Yi Yun would snatch their Earth fire from them. This was not something that could be faulted on in the Earth Fire Hall. Whoever had the strength could naturally use their strength to bully others.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at the dancing fire plume in his palm. In the pale redness was a slightest bit of whiteness in it. Even though it was enveloped in Yuan Qi, looking at it still allowed him to sense a tremendous amount of energy contained within the tiny fire plume.</p>
<p>It was unknown what would happen if he absorbed such a pure fire-elemental energy.</p>
<p>Yi Yun casually sat down beside the magma pond and faced the bubbling red magma and the hot gases that surged at him. Despite the hot gases being able to bake a warrior to death, Yi Yun appeared indifferent and at ease.</p>
<p>He opened up his mouth and the fire plume immediately appeared like it had life in it. It immediately beelined into Yi Yun's mouth.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun begin to absorb his Earth fire without giving them a second look, the other worried Earth Fire Hall disciples finally relaxed. From the looks of it, Yi Yun was not a perverse tyrant.</p>
<p>They could continue mining for fire, but even though Yi Yun paid no attention to them, they still tacitly distanced themselves from him by retreating to another corner of the magma pond.</p>
<p>"We can continue fire-mining." Man Dao said to Yun Qiao'er.</p>
<p>They quietly sat somewhere relatively far from Yi Yun, both as a way to stand guard for him as well as leave him a quiet space.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The moment the Earth fire was absorbed into his abdomen and him closing his eyes, Yi Yun immediately felt a raging heat explode in his body. It was as though his Dantian was consumed in burning flames.</p>
<p>If he was a person who was being exposed to fire-elemental laws the first time, absorbing such an Earth fire plume was no different from throwing himself into a fire for grilling. Furthermore, it was a grilling that began from the organs, so it was obvious how excruciating painful it would be.</p>
<p>This was a flame formed at the birth of a new world. It contained a trace of the world's will when it was first born. And it was this will that made the Earth fire become so ferocious. When warriors absorbed the Earth fire, not only would they experience a burning sensation from the Earth fire's energy, but their minds would also experience the impact of the world's will.</p>
<p>In this state of suffering, one had to remain concentrated and calm. One had to guide the Earth fire to refine one's body and also meditate over this trace of will and the fire-elemental laws. The absorbing of Earth fire was much more difficult than fire-mining.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, not only did he have a pure Yang body, but he also had the Purple Crystal. When this heat blasted out in his body, it made him feel extremely comfortable!</p>
<p>The Earth fire's heat surged out madly from his Dantian, spreading to every corner of his body. The vicious fire toxins were directly absorbed by the Purple Crystal, leaving behind the purest fire-elemental nomological energy.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's meridians were repeatedly being tempered as though it was being struck by a hammer. Although he had recovered from his serious injuries from before, he still had hidden injuries left behind in his meridians. It needed gradual nourishments to be healed completely, but now, under the impact of the Earth fire, all the hidden injuries in his meridians were healed.</p>
<p>At this moment, his meridians were like glass that had been tempered clean of its impurities. The hidden injuries disappeared as his meridians turned crystalline. Furthermore, they became increasingly tough.</p>
<p>A fire-elemental will that appeared at the birth of a world embedded itself into Yi Yun's mind. Instantly, he felt as though he was immersed in a gaseous mass that was extremely cold. Darkness surrounded him.</p>
<p>His internals were extremely hot, but his external body was extremely cold.</p>
<p>This extreme contrast was difficult to bear.</p>
<p>And at this moment, it was as though his Dantian could no longer withstand such a flame. The gaseous mass suddenly contracted before exploding!</p>
<p>Extreme heat was born from extreme cold, and it filled everything with a fire cloud after the explosion!</p>
<p>Yi Yun sensed a white light flash before his eyes as he immediately opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"That was..."</p>
<p>It was likely a scene from the first birth of the Fire Cloud State. This Spirit of the Earth Fire was that ray of extreme heat that was born in the extreme cold right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Extreme Yin gives birth to Yang, extreme Yang gives birth to Yin...</p>
<p>Yi Yun recalled the scene from before and immediately thought of Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo clearly cultivated fire-elemental laws but her aura was icy-cold.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a pure Yang body, so he was extreme Yang, but when he duo cultivated with Lin Xintong in the Great Empress Heart Sutra, what Lin Xintong gave him was extreme Yin energy. By mixing and blending between pure Yin and Yang, they complemented each other.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt that the scene he just saw seemed to introduce another side of fire-elemental laws to him.</p>
<p>He was surprised to learn that absorbing a tiny fire plume had not only mended his meridians, but it had also given him new insights into fire-elemental laws, astonishing Yi Yun. The Spirit of the Earth Fire was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>Chapter 799: Yuan Opening Perfection</p>
<p>With his pure Yang body and Purple Crystal, Yi Yun absorbed the tiny fire plume at an extremely rapid pace.</p>
<p>It could even be said that the bit of fire Yang Zishan had refined was not even enough for his absorption.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun devoured all the energy in the Earth fire, he felt unsatisfied. Immediately he cast his eyes on the white flame burning silently in the middle of the magma pond.</p>
<p>Spirit of the Earth Fire! Before this, Yi Yun had seen how the others had mined for fire, so now, it was time for him to mine it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun reached out his hand and made a grab. His Yuan Qi formed a claw in mid air as it extracted a small fire plume. Typically when Yuan Qi approached the Spirit of the Earth Fire, it would experience a terrifying energy repulsion, but with the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun was able to control his Yuan Qi claw with extreme precision.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's mining of fire could only be described as easy. The Earth fire he mined was much bigger than the one Yang Zishan mined from before. Others would usually only mine a tiny fire spark, but what Yi Yun mined was a fire plume the size of a pinky.</p>
<p>Actually, Yi Yun's limit was far more than that, but one had to slowly chew during a meal. There was no need for him to swallow too much, as it would be more difficult for digestion.</p>
<p>However, just this tiny bit of fire rendered many people speechless when they saw this.</p>
<p>He could really devour such a powerful plume of Earth fire?</p>
<p>Before they had the time to think any further, Yi Yun opened his mouth and directly swallowed the Earth fire.</p>
<p>Without taking a break, Yi Yun immediately embarked on absorbing his second Earth fire after his first.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, many people gulped. He swallowed it just like that? That appeared too simple, so simple as though he was just eating a peanut. It was no wonder he could snatch the Earth fire from Yang Zishan. From the looks of it, this youth's affinity with fire-elemental laws far exceeded others.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt as though there was magma bubbling in his body. The bubbling heat waves blasted every corner of his body, allowing his bones and meridians to be repeatedly tempered.</p>
<p>Boiling steam poured out of every pore on Yi Yun's body as it enveloped him within.</p>
<p>If a warrior without sufficient strength stood beside Yi Yun, he would have been instantly vaporized by the steam. His flesh and bones would be reduced to flying ashes.</p>
<p>In the rolling red mist, Yi Yun had his eyes tightly closed. His skin exuded a redness while his meridians and blood vessels were clearly visible. Furthermore, one could clearly see the pulsing flow in Yi Yun's vessels.</p>
<p>During a tempering process, a blacksmith would strike at piece of a metal hundreds of times, sending sparks everywhere. And through that, a magnificent sword would slowly emerge from a red-hot piece of metal.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was such a metal that was being tempered. His meridians were becoming tougher and as the impurities in his blood and body were expelled with the mist, Yi Yun felt his Yuan Qi becoming even purer.</p>
<p>Exhale, inhale. The surrounding Yuan Qi was flowing without end into Yi Yun's body before it carried on being refined by the Earth fire.</p>
<p>The Purple Crystal was also helping Yi Yun in his absorption. An ordinary warrior could only absorb about 50% of the Earth fire's energy, but Yi Yun could even convert the fire toxins into energy, absorbing them all.</p>
<p>Not a single bit of this tiny cluster of flames was wasted by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's breathing became slower and slower, and every breath he took was like a whale sucking in air. He could take in a tremendous amount of Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>His bones also turned transparent like glass, as it revealed a translucent crystalline texture.</p>
<p>The surrounding Yuan Qi was absorbed by Yi Yun, leaving a vacuum behind. Even the fire toxins in the magma pond were being absorbed by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Boom! Inside Yi Yun's body, it was as though there was a raging river that was rumbling like thunder.</p>
<p>Both Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er heard the noise.</p>
<p>They opened their eyes and traced where the sound came from and finally saw a red mist lingering around Yi Yun's body. Furthermore, the mist were constantly spinning like a cyclone. As for Yi Yun, he was located in the eye of the storm.</p>
<p>The cyclone became more and more intense that even the Yuan Qi from the other corners of the Fire Spirit Palace was absorbed by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Those Earth Fire Hall disciples that had distanced themselves immediately opened their eyes in astonishment despite being in the midst of absorbing the Earth fire. They then looked at Yi Yun with expressions of extreme shock.</p>
<p>What was he doing?</p>
<p>This cyclone quickly reached dozens of feet high. If a cyclone was on a water surface, it could suck up large amounts of water to form a pillar, and was known as a water spout.</p>
<p>And now, with the cyclone above the magma pond, it was sucking up large amounts of magma, forming a thick magma pillar. It looked completely shocking!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yun Qiao'er gasped quietly, "The Spirit of the Earth Fire!"</p>
<p>Everyone saw it. The rapidly spinning mist was slowly approaching the Spirit of the Earth Fire and fire sparks from the Spirit of the Earth Fire were constantly being absorbed into the mist.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body was like a bottomless pit. It constantly absorbed as though it was a melting pot that could absorb even more Earth fire.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The other Earth Fire Hall disciples also heard the rumbling noises coming from Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a loud screech, the rolling clouds dispersed as a shimmering gold figure flew out. It spread out its wings, as though it was blocking out the sky.</p>
<p>It was a three-legged Golden Crow!</p>
<p>And below the Golden Crow, a Nine Neonate flew up from below. Its nine heads appeared from time to time in the red mist in an extremely astounding manner!</p>
<p>The two Aspect Totems were also being tempered!</p>
<p>The appearance of the Aspect Totems was fleeting, and suddenly, all the red mist disappeared.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood up with a satisfied look. Unlike before, his skin was much more supple. His entire being gave a feeling of harmony and perfection.</p>
<p>Man Dao was the first to react as he looked at Yi Yun with astonishment. "Junior Brother Yi Yun, you are already at the Yuan Opening perfection. You are almost entering the Heaven Ascension realm!"</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er opened her tiny mouth as she was both shocked and envious. "Junior Brother Yi Yun, you just absorbed an Earth fire once and you have improved so much!"</p>
<p>At the Yuan Opening realm, every increment was not simple. Previously, they could sense Yi Yun's cultivation level and although it was at the late-stages of the Yuan Opening realm which was closing on perfection, it still required a long period of cultivation to make that final step.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun had only mined for fire once in Fire Spirit Palace, and achieved perfection during the process of absorbing Earth fire.</p>
<p>And from the phenomenon that appeared from before, Yi Yun's Yuan Opening perfection was atypical. It was a true perfection with not a single flaw. This made people feel a sense of flawlessness and perfection in him.</p>
<p>"This is really..." Man Dao's expression was as though he could not embody his feelings in a sentence. He had come to the Fire Spirit Palace numerous times, and although his strength was gradually rising, he had never experienced what Yi Yun had done — rising to the next realm in one go just using Earth fire.</p>
<p>"Sigh, it's really exasperating to compare with others!" Man Dao said as he shook his head. He was a sincere and honest man by nature, but he had a lot of pride in him. However, in front of Yi Yun, he was in full admiration.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun...I'm already embarrassed calling you junior brother!" Yun Qiao'er looked at Yi Yun with sparkles in her eyes.</p>
<p>"It was nothing much. I was already not far from the Yuan Opening perfection realm previously. And apparently I'm quite adept at absorbing Earth fire, so I managed to break through in one fell swoop."</p>
<p>Yi Yun checked his body. The meridians that had been severed due to the spatial storms had not only fully recovered, but they had also turned as clear as crystal.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know how strong he had become and was actually yearning to fight someone in real battle to test his true strength.</p>
<p>Chapter 800: Meeting Black Bamboo</p>
<p>During the process of his breakthrough, Yi Yun only spent a short two hours to absorb the Spirit of the Earth Fire, but the amount of Earth fire he had absorbed was more than the combined amount others absorbed over months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the moment he made the breakthrough, the cyclone that spun around the Spirit of the Earth Fire resulted in Yi Yun absorbing large quantities of Earth fire energy. Hence, there was no need for him to continue fire-mining for the day.</p>
<p>"This Spirit of the Earth Fire sure is arcane. Compared to the lower realm, the 12 Empyrean Heavens has countless arcane lands! Just the Fire Cloud State alone contains a large number of opportunities that are very beneficial for my current realm."</p>
<p>Yi Yun was able to experience the scene of the Spirit of the Earth Fire being born along with the Large World, but he could not see clearly through the lingering fog.</p>
<p>However, he sensed that he had already built a foundation in fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>After warriors increased their cultivation realms, the speed at which they could comprehend laws became faster. With the possession of the Purple Crystal Origins and the cultivation of pure Yang laws, Yi Yun cultivated fire-elemental laws at an extremely fast rate.</p>
<p>Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er were also done absorbing. Their nomological insights were limited so they were unable to absorb too much Earth fire at one go.</p>
<p>"Are you also planning on leaving?" Yi Yun asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. The next time Junior Brother Yi Yun plans on coming, remember to call us along." Yun Qiao'er hurriedly said.</p>
<p>She did not need to be worried about being ostracized or bullied if she came with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Although Fairy Black Bamboo held a weaker position in the Earth Fire Hall, no one would bully someone who was strong enough. The strong could in turn be the ones bullying, so who be dumb enough to charge up to get humiliated?</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>After leaving the Fire Spirit Palace, Yi Yun sensed the gaze that had locked onto him disappear the moment he exited the door.</p>
<p>The huge Spirit Mastiff was still lying motionless by the entrance. The moment the invisible eye disappeared, Yi Yun took a glance at the Spirit Mastiff.</p>
<p>It did not even move its eyelids.</p>
<p>"Don't bother looking at it, Lord Mu Ao has stayed guard here in the Fire Spirit Palace for tens of millions of years. No one has seen it open its eyes before." Man Dao said.</p>
<p>At this moment, he faltered before saying, "Master Black Bamboo is aware that we have come out. She wants us over."</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er immediately turned uneasy. "Us? Why is Master looking for us?"</p>
<p>Ever since he came to Earth Fire Hall, Yi Yun had not seen Fairy Black Bamboo again. He never expected to be summoned all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo's palace was located on the mountainside, built on a towering peak that appeared like bamboo that pierced the skies. Looking from afar, clouds shrouded it, giving it a very sharp bearing to it. It was rather similar to Fairy Black Bamboo's cold personality.</p>
<p>Three Inferno Gold Condors landed in front of the palace that was surrounded by bamboo. Even the palace was made of bamboo.</p>
<p>A single glance gave the impression that there were countless green swords embedded into the ground.</p>
<p>"This is only my second time here." Man Dao said.</p>
<p>"This is my first." Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>"Me too. Master rarely summons her disciples." Yun Qiao'er was somewhat afraid. Her impression of Fairy Black Bamboo did not go past the examination she had taken. Back then, she had suffered quite a bit.</p>
<p>The three people came before the palace, and very quickly, a humanoid bamboo joint the height of a human's palm walked out. Its body was bamboo and its head was a bamboo leaf, but it wore clothes in a decent fashion.</p>
<p>Coming before the trio, it gestured a "come with me" before it turned around and went in.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was quite surprised seeing this. However, Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao appeared to be accustomed to it. Clearly such small Fey that had yet to fully transform was commonly seen in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>The bamboo person brought them through the palace. Along the way, they encountered many black bamboo planted in the courtyard. As Yi Yun and company walked past them, they would sway with the wind and rustle their leaves as though they were greeting Yi Yun and company.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was quite secretly amazed. These bamboos clearly had a spirit in them. They were likely the bamboo that grew around Fairy Black Bamboo when she achieved her Dao, and had been brought here by her.</p>
<p>The bamboo person left after leading them to a pavilion where Fairy Black Bamboo was waiting for them.</p>
<p>The trio saluted and said, "Greetings Master."</p>
<p>"There's no need for such pointless niceties. Feel free to take a seat. I don't have those rules here." Fairy Black Bamboo said.</p>
<p>The pavilion's interior was lined with bamboo mats with a wooden qin placed on it. Fairy Black Bamboo was sitting in front of the qin on the bamboo mat.</p>
<p>"All of you just went to the Fire Spirit Palace to mine for fire?" After Yi Yun and company sat down, Fairy Black Bamboo looked at Yi Yun and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er and Man Dao looked at each other in the eye and were stunned. Their Master already knew? Did she know of the things that had happened?</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded and said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He recalled how there was the ever-present eyes when he entered or departed the Fire Spirit Palace; hence, he was not surprised that Fairy Black Bamboo knew of the ongoings. That eye was likely an existence that protected the Fire Spirit Palace.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo gave a deep, meaningful glance at Yi Yun before saying with a smile, "It was the Temple Spirit of the Fire Spirit Palace that informed me. Yang Zishan is already at the Heaven Ascension realm, yet you were able to snatch the Earth fire from him. That surprised me greatly! Later on, absorbing the Earth fire and elevating yourself to the Yuan Opening perfection realm was even better."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo had a cold personality, so for her to praise Yi Yun repeatedly indicated how pleased she was with his performance.</p>
<p>Increasing his cultivation realm was nothing, but to be able to beat down Elder Heaven Scorpio's arrogance was something that delighted Fairy Black Bamboo somewhat. Despite having an indifferent and aloof personality, Fairy Black Bamboo still did not enjoy the feeling of being repressed over the years.</p>
<p>After all, Fairy Black Bamboo had only entered the Earth Fire Hall for a relatively short period of time, resulting in her disciples to always be at the disadvantage. It was indeed remarkable for them to turn the tables this once.</p>
<p>"Tell me, what reward do you want." Fairy Black Bamboo said.</p>
<p>In the Fire Cloud State, the competition between disciples was not only permitted, but they were also rewarded by their masters. Of course, that was assuming they won. If they lost, not only was there no reward, but they might also be punished. For example, Yang Zishan had his Earth fire snatched by Yi Yun and he had suffered a spiritual injury. For this, Elder Heaven Scorpio would not only not stand up for him, but he would also punish Yang Zishan!</p>
<p>This was the Luo clan's tradition!</p>
<p>Upon hearing Fairy Black Bamboo suggesting a reward, Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er looked at Yi Yun with envious eyes, especially Man Dao. He had been in the Earth Fire Hall for several years, so he knew that the number of times Fairy Black Bamboo appreciated her disciples were few and far between. Furthermore, Yi Yun had only come here for less than two months.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo was an Elder of the Earth Fire Hall, so there was no lack of resources she had. Just anything she gave was enough for them disciples to enjoy.</p>
<p>"Cultivation technique, elixirs, weapons. What do you want. Just go ahead and tell me." Fairy Black Bamboo said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun pondered for a moment before saying, "Master, you should know that this disciple came from a lower realm. Despite coming to the Fire Cloud State and having temporarily settled down, there is one thing that is constantly on this disciple's mind."</p>
<p>"Oh? What is it?" Fairy Black Bamboo was still as refreshing and light as ever when she asked slowly.</p>
<p>"This disciple passed by the Hundred Wraiths black hole on his way to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven and happened to encounter a spatial storm, resulting in serious injuries and the losing of consciousness. Later on, this disciple was saved by Heaven Fire Hall disciple, Miss Luo Fengling's spirit cruiser. But actually back when this disciple was swept up in the storm, there was another girl accompanying this disciple whose whereabouts are still unknown..."</p>

<p>Chapter 801: Prince Pingnan</p>
<p>Yi Yun had always been worrying over Lin Xintong, but as the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was too large and space seemed infinite, it was impossible for him to locate Lin Xintong with his strength alone.</p>
<p>Now with Fairy Black Bamboo mentioning a reward, Yi Yun immediately raised the matter.</p>
<p>"There's such a thing?" Fairy Black Bamboo was surprised before she frowned, "The space around the Hundred Wraiths black hole is weird and unpredictable. No one knows where the spatial storm that swept the both of you would lead to. Although I am an Earth Fire Hall Elder, trying to find a person in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven is like searching a needle in a haystack."</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Fairy Black Bamboo paused before asking, "That girl, who is she to you?"</p>
<p>"She is this disciple's Dao partner and her name is Lin Xintong." Although Yi Yun had yet to marry Lin Xintong, in their hearts, they were each other's Dao partner.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo frowned slightly, "I assented to giving you a reward, yet you make the request for me to look for your Dao partner. For this matter, I can only try my best to gather news for you. Don't have your hopes up. Finding a person in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven is just too difficult."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo's personality was like a bamboo. It was aloof but since she had given her word, she would definitely do her best to keep it.</p>
<p>"Thank you Master." Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>At this moment, a bamboo person walked into the pavilion and quickly came in front of Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo lowered her head as though she was listening to something.</p>
<p>Following that, she raised her head and said, "A guest of honor is coming, so take your leave first."</p>
<p>Guest of honor?</p>
<p>Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er immediately stood up. For Fairy Black Bamboo to term the person a guest of honor, it was probably someone above the level of an Elder of the Earth Fire Hall. They did not know who it could be.</p>
<p>Yi Yun also planned on leaving together with Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er. However, after a moment of thought, Fairy Black Bamboo said lightly, "Yi Yun, stay behind."</p>
<p>Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er were stunned and again felt extremely envious.</p>
<p>Letting Yi Yun stay behind at such a time indicated how much Fairy Black Bamboo appreciated Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun sat down on the bamboo mat once again, while Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er took their leave.</p>
<p>The moment the duo stepped out of the palace, they felt that the light from above was casting a large shadow over them.</p>
<p>Following that, a gigantic Fey beast with a dragon head and turtle body gradually descending from the clouds. The clouds seemed to hastily make way for it as they dispersed. Light was completely blocked out, turning the day into night.</p>
<p>The turtle shell that covered its entire body seemed like a divine metal that had formed naturally from absorbing the essence of the heaven and earth. It was dark gold in color and gave a very heavy feeling.</p>
<p>Its dragon head was raised high up and it looked extremely massive. Looking from afar, it looked like a floating island in the sky, a shocking scene.</p>
<p>Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er were members of the Fey race, so they could immediately sense the terrifying aura of the Fey beast.</p>
<p>Baxia! One of the sons of the dragon!</p>
<p>The true Baxia was a legendary primordial Fey beast. The one in front of them was impossible to be the pureblood primordial Baxia, but it it definitely had an extremely pure bloodline of Baxia or it would not have been able to grow into such a massive and suppressive Baxia body!</p>
<p>It was one of the top noble existences amongst Fey beasts.</p>
<p>"Using Baxia as a mount? Who is this person...?"</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er muttered to herself. Just being under Baxia's body made her want to pay homage to this Fey beast. It was a result that came from a higher level Fey race's bloodline.</p>
<p>The person who could use this as a mount was definitely impressive.</p>
<p>"Baxia carries an immortal mountain on its back, and there is a pavilion on the immortal mountain!" Man Dao suddenly exclaimed in a low voice. He said it softly because there was an ancient emblem painted on the pavilion. It was like a shimmering flame.</p>
<p>"It's the emblem of the royal family."</p>
<p>Man Dao drew a gasp. This meant that the person riding Baxia was a member of the Luo clan royalty!</p>
<p>Royal family?</p>
<p>Yun Qiao'er was stunned. She had not joined the Luo clan for long, much less have any contact with the royal family. People from the Luo clan royal family were like gods to her.</p>
<p>And for someone to have such a mount, even if they were from the royal family, they had to have a certain status in it. As for them, they were only ordinary disciples of the Earth Fire Hall, a division of the Fire Cloud State, which was one of the 196 states of the Luo clan. The person riding on Baxia was an elusive existence to them.</p>
<p>Man Dao enviously said, "A person from the royal family has come to our Fire Cloud State, and Junior Brother Yi Yun is able to meet such an important figure. If he gains the favor of this important figure, just a little help from him would result in Yi Yun's meteoric rise!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing Man Dao's words, Yun Qiao'er could only nod her head without much thought. They were still working hard to enter the Heaven Fire Hall, but for Yi Yun, entering the Heaven Fire Hall was already something extremely easy. Now, he could even get to know an important figure from the royal family. Of course, the envy was unwarranted. They could only blame themselves for not being strong enough.</p>
<p>The two of them did not dare to take flight with the Inferno Gold Condors. Even if they wanted to, the Inferno Gold Condors were trembling under the presence of Baxia, afraid of even taking flight.</p>
<p>Man Dao and Yun Qiao'er retreated to a distant corner as they looked at the immortal mountain on Baxia's turtle shell.</p>
<p>There were nine scantily-dressed beauties with snow-white skin holding silk in their hands as they floated down from the ornate pavilion on the immortal mountain.</p>
<p>Behind the nine girls, a tall white-robed man began descending as he took strides on thin air.</p>
<p>His clothes were embroidered with a bright red vermilion totem, and his aura was thick and intense.</p>
<p>The Luo clan had outstanding bearing and looks regardless of their sex. This white-robed man was also no exception. Although he was tall and well-built, he gave off an elegant feeling. He was like a scholar with an elegant bearing.</p>
<p>"Whew! Whew!"</p>
<p>Two black-robed figures appeared to the left and right of the white-robed man. Their facial features were a blur as there was a layer of smoke concealing them.</p>
<p>They were the white-robed man's guards.</p>
<p>At this moment, Fairy Black Bamboo had already come to the entrance of the palace to welcome them. Yi Yun accompanied her by the side.</p>
<p>In Fairy Black Bamboo's palace, other than those black bamboos and bamboo people, she did not have any other servants. Hence, the only person standing beside her was Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Looking at the Baxia above him, Yi Yun was also astonished. His heart jumped again when he saw the two black-robed people with fuzzy looks.</p>
<p>These two black-robed people were also members of the Fey race. Their aura gave a baffling feeling, so even though he could see them with his naked eyes, it was as though they did not exist.</p>
<p>"Black Bamboo greets Prince Pingnan." Fairy Black Bamboo bowed slightly while Yi Yun slightly faltered. Prince Pingnan?</p>
<p>Before entering the Fire Spirit Palace to mine for fire, he had heard Man Dao say mention of how the two royal offspring were vying for the throne that was to be handed down by the Luo Emperor in the Luo clan royal capital. One of them was Prince Crimson Firmament, while the other was Princess Purple Spirit. Yi Yun had basically confirmed that Princess Purple Spirit was Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>As for Prince Pingnan, he was on Luo Huo'er's side. Many princes and princesses were destined to have no chance with the throne, so they would choose to follow one of the heirs apparent. Although they would not be able to become the Luo Emperor in the future, they could still be conferred the title of King without any problems.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan and Luo Huo'er were under the same camp, while Fairy Black Bamboo was a subordinate of Prince Pingnan.</p>
<p>Chapter 802: Intent</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the elegant man, he did as what Fairy Black Bamboo did and gave a salute. "Greetings to the prince."</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan glanced at Yi Yun and did not think too much about him as he continued speaking to Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>"Fairy, you don't have to be so polite. I happened to be free enough to come to the Fire Cloud State, so I took the opportunity to drop by and meet you. Your bamboo wine here is extremely fragrant and is a rare gourmet wine. Ordinary people can't even get a taste of it, so I wonder if a person like me has the chance to take a sip?" Prince Pingnan said with a smile.</p>
<p>His attitude towards Fairy Black Bamboo was extremely humble, surprising Yi Yun slightly.</p>
<p>As an Earth Fire Hall Elder, Fairy Black Bamboo's status was naturally far inferior to Prince Pingnan. For her to be thought of so highly by him impressed the talent she had.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that Fairy Black Bamboo had only cultivated for a relatively short period of time and that she had only recently become an Elder of the Earth Fire Hall. Having been recognized by the upper echelons, she would be promoted quickly in the future.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo had a promising future, yet Elder Heaven Scorpio dared to target Fairy Black Bamboo. There was no other reason than because they were from different factions. They were destined to fight. Furthermore, the day Prince Crimson Firmament inherited the throne, it would greatly affect Fairy Black Bamboo's future in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo smiled slightly and said, "It has already been prepared for the prince."</p>
<p>"That's great." Prince Pingnan clapped his hands once and said with a laugh.</p>
<p>He spoke very casually and did not have the airs of a prince, it was as though he was speaking to an old friend when he spoke to Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>As Prince Pingnan and Fairy Black Bamboo were speaking, the dragon-turtle behind Prince Pingnan suddenly flashed a golden brilliance, and following that, the gigantic dragon-turtle as large as an island shrunk in size rapidly. Its shape also began changing, and eventually, it transformed into a middle-aged man dressed in dark gold robes.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was stubby, with a genial smile on his face, and by the ends of his mouth, there were two long dragon whiskers.</p>
<p>As for the immortal mountain the dragon-turtle was carrying, it had flown off from the turtle's back and transformed into an enchanted treasure the size of a fist and then kept inside the stubby middle-aged man's body!</p>
<p>Yi Yun drew a gasp seeing this. First, a large dragon-turtle was able to transform into a person, and secondly, even the immortal palace it carried was an enchanted treasure. If any of these were placed in the Tian Yuan world, they would have been simply incredible.</p>
<p>"Uncle Dragon also likes drinking wine, so let's all enjoy it together!"</p>
<p>Although the dragon-turtle was Prince Pingnan's mount, Prince Pingnan was still very respectful to his "Uncle Dragon".</p>
<p>"Haha, I love drinking wine." The stubby middle-aged man said as he followed Fairy Black Bamboo into the palace. As for Yi Yun, he followed them by the side. Be it Prince Pingnan or the stubby middle-aged man, none of them paid any attention to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>This was understandable. They only treated Yi Yun as Fairy Black Bamboo's disciple or follower. Indeed, the duo needed to pay any attention to his identity.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Moments later, in Fairy Black Bamboo's bamboo building, Prince Pingnan, the stubby middle-aged man and Fairy Black Bamboo sat around an antique round table.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo sat carefully at the position meant for subordinates in a very upright manner. However, the stubby middle-aged man had already begun gulping down wine from the jug he held in his hands.</p>
<p>"Haha, the flavor is really good." The stubby middle-aged man praised with a chuckle.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was naturally standing behind Fairy Black Bamboo and listened to the trio's conversation.</p>
<p>"I wonder what Your Highness Pingnan is here in the Fairy Black Bamboo for?" Fairy Black Bamboo asked.</p>
<p>Previously, Prince Pingnan had mentioned that he happened to drop by since he was on the way, but Black Bamboo knew that with his status, he definitely did not come to the Fire Cloud State on a whim but because he had work to do.</p>
<p>"I came here under the orders of Her Highness Xuanhou." Prince Pingnan drank a mouthful of bamboo wine and said slowly.</p>
<p>"Her Highness Xuanhou?"</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo faltered momentarily. Xuanhou was Princess Purple Spirit's birth mother.</p>
<p>"Haha, there's nothing I can do. Princess Purple Spirit is capricious by nature. From the looks of it, she doesn't have her mind set on inheriting the throne, so the person who is really anxious is Her Highness Xuanhou."</p>
<p>There was a saying that a mother's worth was determined by her children, so Xuanhou was naturally anxious when it came to Princess Purple Spirit's struggle for the throne.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo said, "Princess Purple Spirit is still young, so her disinterest in power struggles is considered normal. In the future, when Princess Purple Spirit grows up, she will naturally turn for the better. Speaking of which, what decree did Her Highness Xuanhou give?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't call it a decree, but for the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial, Her Highness Xuanhou is paying great attention to it. As you should know, our Luo clan had fought with the sinkhole, and suffered great losses, with many Luo Divine Hall disciples falling! Now, our Luo clan needs to nurture large numbers of the younger generation to slowly recover our strength. For this upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial, His Majesty has even given the sacred decree that he would take out a few precious artifacts from the Divine Treasure Palace and heavily reward Luo clan disciples with excellent results!"</p>
<p>"As you know, His Majesty is about to abdicate the throne and the fight for the throne between Princess Purple Spirit and my elder brother, Crimson Firmament, is getting more intense. His Majesty would make his decision based on various small details. Besides, the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial is no trivial matter. Since His Majesty places so much importance in it, Her Highness Xuanhou naturally does not want to lose!"</p>
<p>"So that's the way it is..." Fairy Black Bamboo understood. For the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial, Emperor Luo had personally decreed it and even offered treasures from the Divine Treasure Palace. That was not something to be scoffed at. Anything that was placed in the Divine Treasure Palace was the best out of the best supreme-grade items. Ignoring the disciples from the various states, even princes needed to have sufficient talent and be outstanding enough to enjoy a minor portion of the resources held in Divine Treasure Palace.</p>
<p>After the huge war, the Luo clan had suffered heavy losses, so using a portion of the Luo clan's accumulated resources to develop its strength was reasonable. This was indeed an opportunity for the younger Luo clan generation, one that came less than once in a hundred thousand years. If they managed to grasp it, they could really enjoy a great deal of valuable resources and enjoy a meteoric rise and have a bright future ahead of them.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan then said, "Black Bamboo, as you know, my elder brother, Crimson Firmament, is already 3500 years old. His subordinates have already be around for about 3000 years. And his birth mother, Her Highness Luohou had entered the harem tens of thousands of years earlier than Her Highness Xuanhou. Furthermore, Her Highness Luohou's family possesses an ancient Fey bloodline, so her faction is equally large!</p>
<p>"As for Princess Purple Spirit, although her talent is equal or even better than my elder brother, Crimson Firmament, she is still young. Princess Purple Spirit nearly lacks any power herself, and relies fully on Her Highness Xuanhou. At the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial, it is indeed the best opportunity for my elder brother, Crimson Firmament, to exhibit his prowess. If his men were to account for a majority of the spots, Princess Purple Spirit and Her Highness Xuanhou would look bad regardless of the reason. It might even affect His Majesty's decision about the heir.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo nodded in response to what Prince Pingnan said. She said, "Your Highness Pingnan, you are right. However for the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trial, I too am limited and won't be of much use. I can only do my best to nurture the disciples under me and send them to give it a try."</p>
<p>"Alright, we just need to do our best. For this trip, I have gone to three states and have brought some resources to do a last-minute push. Let's hope it will be a little effective. Black Bamboo, tell me. Who in the Fire Cloud State is up to it?"</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan placed his cup of wine down and began to cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Chapter 803: Receiving the Nomination</p>
<p>Black Bamboo said, "Your Highness Pingnan, in recent years, the Fire Cloud State has been doing waves of heavy recruitment, but although many are recruited, the quality is just average. The ones who are likely to excel at the Luo Divine Hall trials from the Fire Cloud State are still those core disciples from the Heaven Fire Hall, such as Tianshi, Ranyu and Guluo. Just the amount of time they have cultivated in the Heaven Fire Hall has exceeded sixty years."</p>
<p>"These few people, especially Tianshi, are very famous. In recent years, Tianshi has done the Fire Cloud State proud during exchanges between disciples from the Fire Cloud State and the surrounding Luo clan states. He has been praised by Marquis Fire Cloud on several occasions."</p>
<p>Marquis Fire Cloud was the person who had authority over the Fire Cloud State. In the 196 states of the Luo clan, each state had a marquis in charge of it.</p>
<p>There was competition amongst the different marquises as well. The Fire Cloud State was considered average amongst the 196 states, so during any martial arts exchange, the Fire Cloud State's results could only be said to be satisfactory. However, Tianshi was usually the one who stood out from the flock. Even amongst the 196 states, he was first class.</p>
<p>"I know about Tianshi..." Prince Pingnan slightly sighed, "We even get wind about him in the royal capital, such as how Tianshi's attainments in the fire-elemental laws are outstanding and that even against other geniuses, he can leapfrog levels and defeat them!"</p>
<p>Although Prince Pingnan was praising Tianshi, he was not pleased at all. This was because Tianshi was not under their camp. This also meant that the stronger Tianshi was, the stronger the enemy was.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not only limited to Tianshi. Even Ranyu and Guluo could be considered as leaning towards Prince Crimson Firmament if they had to forcefully trace the relation trees. The reason was very simple. These people had been cultivating in the Heaven Fire Hall for sixty years and when was Princess Purple Spirit born? It wasn't even as long as those who had joined the Heaven Fire Hall!</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit had become a heir apparent entirely based on her talent. Of course, Xuanhou's family background wasn't weak either. In order to help Princess Purple Spirit vye for the throne, many geniuses from her family had been sent into the Luo clan to help Princess Purple Spirit stabilize her footing.</p>
<p>The succession of the throne did not only consider talent. It also looked at heritage and prestige. It needed to see if people were willing to follow the heir. Hence, be it Princess Purple Spirit or Prince Crimson Firmament, they were recruiting more disciples and incorporating them into their own factions.</p>
<p>"Talk about those disciples that recently joined the Heaven Fire Hall." Prince Pingnan said.</p>
<p>Most of the older disciples of the Heaven Fire Hall were under Prince Crimson Firmament's camp. After all, back at that time, Prince Crimson Firmament was the most likely heir apparent. Who didn't want to associate themselves with such a mighty force? If he became Emperor in the future, they would easily enjoy success in the future.</p>
<p>And once the allegiance was formed, betrayal was no longer an option. If one were to betray mid way, neither side would be pleased having a betrayer in their camp.</p>
<p>Only new Luo clan disciples had the choice to choose between the two heirs.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo said, "If we are talking about new disciples, then there is no way to compare them with older disciples. The cultivation time is just too short and they would be greatly disadvantaged when it comes to aspects like laws. If you insist on new rookies, Luo Fengling is considered a good one. She has pretty good talent and has only entered the Heaven Fire Hall for five years. She is hardworking in her cultivation, but it is hard to tell what results she would get when she joins the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo shook her head. The Luo Divine Hall trials were held once every sixty years. Only Luo clan disciples below the age of a hundred years old could participate.</p>
<p>Many Luo clan disciples would usually need to cultivate for seventy or eighty years for them to be able to stand out during the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Nearly a century's worth of accumulation was no trifling matter.</p>
<p>Of course, the Luo Divine Hall trials were not a simple test of strength. Those at a younger age would be at an advantage during the final evaluation, but its advantage was inferior to nomological insights and cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>"Are there no more other new disciples?"</p>
<p>Now with Xuanhou in desperate need to expand her forces, Prince Pingnan did not expect new disciples to be able to obtain any amazing results in the Luo Divine Hall trials. However, since new disciples and old disciples were not judged on the same criteria, it was still possible to gain the attention of the upper echelons by showing their latent potential even if they did not perform well. This would augment Princess Purple Spirit's prestige as well.</p>
<p>"There are many disciples that can be considered but I doubt any of them will be worthy in Your Highness Pingnan's eyes. However, if Your Highness Pingnan does not want to limit it to the Heaven Fire Hall, I have a good candidate to recommend from the Earth Fire Hall."</p>
<p>"Earth Fire Hall?"</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan was slightly stunned when he heard the name Earth Fire Hall.</p>
<p>In his point of view, the Earth Fire Hall only had second-tier disciples. It was difficult for elites from the Heaven Fire Hall to attain much at the Luo Divine Hall trials, what more Earth Fire Hall disciples.</p>
<p>He frowned and said, "There is actually an Earth Fire Hall disciple that can do well at the Luo Divine Hall trials? Who is it?"</p>
<p>Black Bamboo smiled and said, "I don't dare to guarantee that he will do well, but in the entire Fire Cloud State, ignoring Tianshi, Guluo and those Heaven Fire Hall disciples that have cultivated for sixty years or so, this person is the best choice amongst all new disciples. He happens to be in front of Your Highness Pingnan."</p>
<p>As Black Bamboo said that, she looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan as well as "Uncle Dragon" beside Prince Pingnan also turned to look at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan was somewhat taken aback. He never expected that the inconspicuous young man behind Fairy Black Bamboo was so highly recommended by her.</p>
<p>"He is the best candidate amongst new disciples?"</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan sized up Yi Yun and asked, "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"This lowly one is Yi Yun." Yi Yun said as he clasped his fists.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun..." Prince Pingnan pondered for a moment and at this point, Fairy Black Bamboo had already informed Prince Pingnan about what Yi Yun had done during the fire-mining process from before through a voice transmission.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan was quite surprised hearing this. "Oh? There was such a thing? To be able to gain the recognition of the Spirit of the Earth Fire despite having just entered the Earth Fire Hall, and even managed to snatch the Earth fire from a senior Earth Fire Hall disciple. That is indeed not bad."</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan nodded. Actually, a figure like Yang Zishan was completely inconsequential in Prince Pingnan's eyes. Yang Zishan was just an Earth Fire Hall disciple and was considered nothing compared to a top genius like Tianshi.</p>
<p>Hence, the reason why Prince Pingnan used the words "not bad" to describe Yi Yun was because he was still young and had yet to cultivate for three decades, so he had a promising future.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, if we wait another sixty years with you cultivating under me during that period, you might be able to obtain pretty good results at the Luo Divine Hall trials when you approach the age of a hundred years old. It is a pity that you have to participate in it when you have yet to fully mature. However, the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials are too important. The succession of the throne would probably happen before the next Luo Divine Hall trials. I have to use whatever men I have, so I'll give you a nomination spot. Just do your best!"</p>
<p>After Prince Pingnan said that, he stopped looking at Yi Yun and continued chatting with Fairy Black Bamboo. Yi Yun was indeed too young. It was exceedingly rare for someone to achieve anything during the Luo Divine Hall trials at the age of thirty. There were very few who could do that even in the entire history of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>Chapter 804: Notice</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan left after spending only a day at the Fire Cloud State. Time was precious to him as he still had two other states to visit.</p>
<p>And on the second day of Prince Pingnan's departure, a notice appeared on Fire Cloud State's main mountain's peak.</p>
<p>It was just a notice made of a thin piece of paper, but it was like a heavy stone that had been thrown into water, creating a stir in the entire Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>The reason was because the notice meant a great opportunity!</p>
<p>The notice listed sixteen people's names. These sixteen people were to be separately sent to two different places three days after the notice was put up. They would undergo a short period of collective training before the two groups would join what was the most important event to all young Luo clan disciples, the Luo Divine Hall trials that happened once every sixty years!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples had a less than one in a million chance of have being able to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials once in their lifetimes!</p>
<p>Exterior disciples did not even need to think about it. The Luo clan had 196 states and each state had hundreds of thousands of exterior disciples and miscellaneous chores disciple. The once every sixty years Luo Divine Hall trials might see two or three batches pass, so they did not even have the chance to look forward to the trials. To them, the trials were mysterious and powerful itself. It could be described with the saying of how a carp leaps into the dragon's gate.</p>
<p>For carps to leap into the dragon's gate, it meant an intense competition to begin with. Many carps would leap at the dragon gate, but the ones who managed to leap through the dragon gate by passing the Luo Divine Hall trials were extremely rare. In fact, these exterior disciples did not even have the qualifications to be carps.</p>
<p>Ignoring them, even Earth Fire Hall disciples did not have the qualification to be carps.</p>
<p>Only Heaven Fire Hall disciples, or about 10% of them had a chance of being a carp once in their lifetimes. They could try to see how far they were from the dragon's gate at the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>In fact, many Heaven Fire Hall disciples who went to the Luo Divine Hall trials did not manage to amount to much. This was because the Luo Divine Hall trials required the participating disciples to be below the age of hundred. To ensure they would get reasonable results, numerous Luo clan disciples would only choose to use their one chance at participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials only when they exceeded sixty years of age, or when they were approaching a hundred years old.</p>
<p>The notice that came out listed down the names who would be participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials. There was a total of sixteen people, so how could the Luo clan disciples not envy these sixteen people who had obtained such a great opportunity?</p>
<p>Even if they knew that they would definitely not be included, they also wanted to know who the sixteen were.</p>
<p>Just like in the mortal world, people who knew that they had no chance would still take a look at who the top scholar was.</p>
<p>The notice was hung on a wall in a square right in front of the main mountain's main hall. A group of people were huddled around the wall to look at the notice.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan, do you think your name will be listed on the notice for the next Luo Divine Hall trials?"</p>
<p>Those who were looking at the notice included Earth Fire Hall's Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>When news of the notice was released, Yang Zishan happened to be mining for fire in Fire Spirit Palace, so he managed to quickly arrive since he wasn't far from it.</p>
<p>Now, Yang Zishan dodged Yi Yun whenever he mined for fire. Elder Heaven Scorpio had eventually gotten wind of the news of Yi Yun snatching his Earth fire at the Fire Spirit Palace. This resulted in Yang Zishan being given a earful that he had to obediently endure. After the scolding was done, Elder Heaven Scorpio had flicked his sleeves, throwing Yang Zishan out the door, causing him to be bruised all over. His face still hurt.</p>
<p>Yang Zishan rubbed his face and glared at the lackey who had just spoken. He grimly said, "It's just taking a look at the notice, why do you have so much nonsense to say!?"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan liked to look good in front of others, so there was no way he would admit his inadequacies. His lackey had tried kissing ass, but he had ended up kissing the wrong spot. Even though Yang Zishan usually liked to brag, he did not dare brag about being able to participate in the next Luo Divine Hall trials. If news got out, his enemies in Earth Fire Hall would probably laugh their heads off.</p>
<p>"You have to take one step at a time. Meals should be taken bite after bite. I don't care about the Luo Divine Hall trials now, and will focus on entering the Heaven Fire Hall first. On the day of the Heaven Fire Hall entrance exams, I'll trample that Yi Yun beneath my feet!" Yang Zishan gnashed his teeth as he said.</p>
<p>It was already difficult for him to enter the Heaven Fire Hall. He was consumed by hate having been trampled by Yi Yun at the Fire Spirit Palace. He still did not know what trick Yi Yun had used to snatch the Earth fire from him, yet Yang Zishan absolutely could not believe that he had lost to a rookie like Yi Yun. All he wanted to do was work hard at cultivation before he looked for Yi Yun in the future to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Especially a year later, there would be an extremely tiny number of Earth Fire Hall disciples who would be promoted to the Heaven Fire Hall. Yang Zishan planned on rising up the ranks to enter the Heaven Fire Hall and squeeze out Yi Yun. Of course, this needed him to work hard at cultivation because at his present level, the chances of him being promoted to the Heaven Fire Hall were slim.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Zishan is right. You should eat your meals bite after bite. First enter the Heaven Fire Hall and proceed orderly. As Earth Fire Hall disciples, wishing to join the Luo Divine Hall trials is just being overly-ambitious. How can it be possible!?"</p>
<p>After Yang Zishan indicated his stance, another lackey with greater seniority immediately stood forward to educate the junior lackey.</p>
<p>The junior lackey hurriedly nodded his head, expressing how his senior was right and then expressed his gushing admiration at Yang Zishan.</p>
<p>Only then did Yang Zishan nod. Just as he wanted to say a few nice words to consolidate his authority as boss, he heard someone in the crowd discuss about the notice. "These people on the list...Tian Shi, Ran Yu, Gu Luo are all famous, so it's no wonder they are there. But Luo Fengling and Bai Chen, how old are they to be able to obtain the qualification to join the Luo Divine Hall trials? And that last guy called Yi Yun, who is he? I've been in the Fire Cloud State for so many years, but why haven't I heard of this person before?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's name was placed last amongst the sixteen people.</p>
<p>The notice was decided by the Fire Cloud State's Elder Consortium, but Prince Pingnan had suggested a few names and one of them was Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Even though the Fire Cloud State Elder Consortium was baffled at the choice, they did not go against Prince Pingnan's wishes. For a prince, closing one eye to let a disciple gain the spot to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials was nothing to them.</p>
<p>Although they were unwilling to do so, the Fire Cloud State Elders still included Yi Yun's name right at the back.</p>
<p>Nearly no one had heard of Yi Yun when his name was mentioned. However, when Yang Zishan and company heard this, they were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun!? Which Yi Yun!?"</p>
<p>This name was extremely harsh on Yang Zishan's ears. All his other lackeys also had a deep impression of Yi Yun. He had single-handedly made everyone in the Fire Spirit Palace apprehensive about mining for fire. They could only anxiously enter Fire Spirit Palace to mine for a few sparks of fire whenever Yi Yun was not around.</p>
<p>"Is...is he the Yi Yun who snatched the Earth fire from us?"</p>
<p>One lackey asked in a daze. He found it unbelievable that Yi Yun, who was a Earth Fire Hall disciple like them, was on the Luo Divine Hall notice! Was this a person with the same name?</p>
<p>But in fact, the entire Heaven Fire Hall had only 108 people and the Earth Fire Hall had only slightly more than a thousand people. All the warriors present had excellent memory, so they could memorize nearly everyone's name. Other than the Yi Yun they had met at the Fire Spirit Palace, there was no other person with the name of Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Besides, although the name "Yi Yun" was simple, the surname "Yi" was extremely rare. It was almost never heard of in the Fey race!</p>
<p>"This...has to be fake!" A lackey of Yang Zishan muttered. He still could not accept the fact!</p>
<p>Chapter 805: Ran Yu</p>
<p>Gloom began to cast dark shades over Yang Zishan's face.</p>
<p>He had previously said that meals had to be eaten one bite at a time, and how one had to take one step at a time on every journey. He was planning on proceeding forward in an orderly fashion through cultivation to vie for a chance at entering the Heaven Fire Hall, winning the right to trample on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But now, before he even made his first move to enter the Heaven Fire Hall, Yi Yun had already been selected for the Luo Divine Hall trials. This was something many Heaven Fire Hall disciples had no chance of!</p>
<p>He was still taking one step at a time, but he could no longer see Yi Yun's back. How far was one stride of Yi Yun's?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was just slightly better than he was in the Fire Spirit Palace and had snatched a plume of fire from him. That shouldn't be enough for him to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trial, right?</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a hubbub around the notice board. There were also quite a number of Heaven Fire Hall disciples present who were complaining.</p>
<p>There was no need to talk about the Earth Fire Hall disciples since they had did not even qualify to join the Luo Divine Hall trials. However, the Heaven Fire Hall disciples had the chance, but now, their chance had been snatched by someone.</p>
<p>A Heaven Fire Hall disciple said to his page, "Do a check and find out who this Yi Yun is!"</p>
<p>"There's no need to check. If I'm not wrong, this Yi Yun is a newly recruited disciple, brought in by Luo Fengling. Just a month ago, he was Luo Fengling's steward disciple on Mt. Fengling. He recently passed the exam to enter the Earth Fire Hall!"</p>
<p>Yang Zishan suddenly spoke out. As he looked at the notice, his gaze appeared as though he wanted to eat up Yi Yun's name.</p>
<p>The appearance of Yi Yun's name on the board made him feel a sense of defeat.</p>
<p>He still had hopes of chasing Yi Yun, but now, how was he able to catch up?</p>
<p>"Earth Fire Hall? Steward disciple? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>As in the butterfly effect, a single rock could similarly stir up a tsunami. Yang Zishan's words attracted the attention of many. A man with a scroll in hand stepped forward and asked Yang Zishan in a soft-spoken manner.</p>
<p>This fair-skinned man who was dressed in an azure colored robe had fine facial features. His eyebrows were like a pair of swords and his eyes were long and slender. On the two corners of his eyes, there were three fish scales on his temples.</p>
<p>This was not an incomplete human manifestation, but a symbol of the Xushui royal clan! The Xushui clan was subordinated to the Luo clan, but the Luo clan had conferred the title of king to the Xushui clan.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, there were three major Fey race categories — Heaven Fey, Earth Fey and Ancient Fey. The Xushui clan belonged to the Heaven Fey, just like the Luo clan.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fey was considered a higher form of existence in the Fey race. Noble blood of primordial Fey flowed in their bodies. There was a chance of awakening it, and once it was awoken, their powers would improve rapidly. And even if it was unawakened, they were still far more powerful than ordinary Fey.</p>
<p>Xushui was an ancient family clan in the Luo clan. During the foundation of the Luo clan's empire, Xushui had made huge contributions, allowing them to be conferred the title of kings that could be passed down through the generations.</p>
<p>The young man in front of Yang Zishan may not be the crown prince nurtured by the Xushui clan, but he too had the royal bloodline, which was enough proof of his noble status.</p>
<p>"Ran Yu!"</p>
<p>Someone in the crowd suddenly exclaimed. The young man with the scales near his temples was Ran Yu from the Xushui clan.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall trial's notice had the following as the top three — "Tian Shi, Ran Yu, Gu Luo"!</p>
<p>In the Fire Cloud State, Tian Shi was the strongest without a doubt. And after him was Ran Yu and Gu Luo. It was difficult to tell which was stronger!</p>
<p>But in recent times, Ran Yu had increasing momentum, making him appear stronger. Hence, the notice which was likely ranked according to strength, hinted at this conclusion by placing Ran Yu ahead of Gu Luo!</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun, who was ranked last, had received the attention of second place, Ran Yu.</p>
<p>"Why is Ran Yu here? When did he come?"</p>
<p>For a famous figure like Ran Yu, nearly every disciple in the entire Fire Cloud State's Heaven Fire Hall and Earth Fire Hall knew of him. His appearance would have long created a stir.</p>
<p>Only when Yang Zishan mentioned of Yi Yun's identity did anyone notice him. That implied that Ran Yu did not want others to notice him.</p>
<p>Although Ran Yu was here, he had used certain means to prevent others from detecting his presence despite standing in the crowd.</p>
<p>This method was indeed amazing.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Senior Brother Ran Yu likes peace and quiet. He does not like being place on a pedestal all the time. He used certain means to prevent us from discovering him."</p>
<p>A Earth Fire Hall girl who was in her twenties looked at Ran Yu from afar while her face blushed red. Ran Yu was of noble birth and strong, so he was naturally favored by young girls.</p>
<p>"If the Yi Yun on the notice is the Yi Yun I know, then whatever I said is true."</p>
<p>Yang Zishan nodded and said. He was feeling quite a lot of pressure in front of Ran Yu. He's eccentricity was only worth anything in front of other Earth Fire Hall disciples. He was nothing compared to Ran Yu who was both of superior birth and talent.</p>
<p>"Oh?" Ran Yu's sword-like brows pricked up. Yang Zishan swallowed a mouthful of saliva before saying, "Senior Brother Ran, you seem to pay a bit of attention to this Yi Yun? It is unknown how that kid managed to get on the list. It is already strange for Luo Fengling to get on it, now that even her steward disciple is on it, it's practically..."</p>
<p>Yang Zishan stopped mid-sentence. What he mentioned was indeed suspicious. What had happened?</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Ran is already on the name list, and the Luo Divine Hall trials would be naturally in the bag for you. Why are you inquiring about a trivial figure who had gotten dog-shit luck?" Yang Zishan probed.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, Ran Yu did not need to pay Yi Yun any mind, but since he was paying attention, Yang Zishan became interested. In Yang Zishan's point of view, regardless of what trick Yi Yun had used, since Yi Yun had managed to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials, it was unrealistic for him to compete with Yi Yun. However, if Ran Yu was the one competing with Yi Yun, that would be completely different!</p>
<p>"Nothing much, I just thought that my younger brother would be on the list." Ran Yu said lightly. One could not tell if there was any trace of anger in his tone.</p>
<p>However, many people knew that Ran Yu took great care to protect his younger brother. Back when his brother entered the Heaven Fire Hall, Ran Yu's presence prevented his brother who was still weak to be messed with.</p>
<p>Later on, Ran Yu's brother cultivated in the Heaven Fire Hall for four decades so he had already fully matured. Now, with both brothers working hand in hand, they could rule the Heaven Fire Hall. If Tian Shi does not appear, who can challenge them!?</p>
<p>But now, Ran Yu's brother had been displaced. Furthermore, his brother's age had passed the age of sixty, so he could only participate in this year's Luo Divine Hall trials, and no longer the next!</p>
<p>In that case, how could Ran Yu feel at ease?</p>
<p>"So that's how it is!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Yang Zishan felt elated! Yi Yun could have snatched anyone's spot, but for him to snatch Ran Yu's brother's spot, this was virtually offending the Xushui family!</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Ran, this Yi Yun must have used some despicable means to snatch Senior Brother Ran's brother's spot. This kid has always been very scheming..." Yang Zishan once again said to fan the flames of discord. But at this moment, Ran Yu gave Yang Zishan a cold glance. The glance caused Yang Zishan's heart to shrink as he felt like he had fallen into an ice cavern, he could not say a single word.</p>
<p>"I do not like that my brother's spot was displaced by others, but similarly, I do not like others trying to induce or arrange for me to do certain things."</p>
<p>Ran Yu took a deep glance at Yang Zishan before he turned around and disappeared, leaving Yang Zishan rooted to the spot and hands clammy. Just a moment ago, he felt like he had been eyed by a primordial powerful Fey. This Ran Yu was too terrifying!</p>
<p>Chapter 806: Mt. Azure Billow</p>
<p>"Missus, it's time to come out!"</p>
<p>Mt. Fengling had also received news of the notice about the Luo Divine Hall trials being released. When Tao'er learned that her mistress had been one of the sixteen selected to represent the Fire Cloud State in the Luo Divine Hall trials, she was completely overjoyed.</p>
<p>There were only sixteen people selected, but how many years had it been since her mistress joined the Heaven Fire Hall? So how could she not be excited for her mistress to be one of the sixteen?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the people who were selected for the Luo Divine Hall trials could undergo a collective training at Mt Azure Billow before the trials began. It was a place even Tao'er had heard of before. It was one of the few holy grounds of the Luo clan, a great benefit to be able to undergo training there.</p>
<p>"Missus, did you hear me?"</p>
<p>While Luo Fengling was in reclusion, Tao'er was the only one who could contact her. Tao'er would only contact Luo Fengling unless it was an important matter.</p>
<p>A few moments after Tao'er called out, Luo Fengling's cultivation chamber's entrance gradually rumbled before it opened. A white-dressed Luo Fengling came out of the chamber.</p>
<p>Previously, when Tao'er informed Luo Fengling about the news, she had told her of the news. Tao'er handed her a letter that came from Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Fairy Black Bamboo made it very clear in her letter that it was Prince Pingnan who had given her the chance to participate in the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Even with Luo Fengling's tranquil personality, she could not calm herself upon receiving this news.</p>
<p>Members who were selected for the Luo Divine Hall trials were once targets she strived for. She never imagined that the opportunity had befallen her in just a few years.</p>
<p>As for Prince Pingnan...Luo Fengling was very aware of his identity. She knew that by accepting to participate in the upcoming trial, she would naturally be labeled under Xuanhou's camp.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling had never joined any faction prior to this, but she was deeply aware that for a minor figure like her in the Luo clan, it was better to choose sides in order to obtain greater support.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with such good conditions, there was no reason for Luo Fengling to reject it. Or it should be said that for a junior like her, such conditions was a form of flattery.</p>
<p>"I'll be going to the main mountain now."</p>
<p>As Luo Fengling spoke, she made some minor preparations before she flew up into the clouds towards the Fire Cloud State's main peak.</p>
<p>From afar, Luo Fengling saw two gigantic spirit cruisers floating above the Fire Cloud State's main mountain.</p>
<p>And below it were numerous Luo clan disciples gathered. With a scan, Luo Fengling saw a few people she was familiar with, including Ran Yu and Gu Luo.</p>
<p>To Luo Fengling, these powerful seniors in the Heaven Fire Hall were targets she strived for in the future. Now, they were fearsome peers that Luo Fengling had deep respect for.</p>
<p>Just as Luo Fengling was about to land, her gaze made her suddenly see a very familiar person. She gaped her mouth in astonishment.</p>
<p>She was surprised to notice that amongst the illustrious and powerful Heaven Fire Hall disciples, there was a youth that looked sixteen or seventeen wearing Earth Fire Hall garbs.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun?"</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was momentarily at a loss. Yi Yun was a steward disciple she had taken in, so from her reclusion up to now, she had no idea what had happened to Yi Yun nor did she care.</p>
<p>Wasn't he supposed to be in Mt. Fengling? Why was he here?</p>
<p>"Senior Luo."</p>
<p>Yi Yun cupped his hands when he saw Luo Fengling. He too had just seen the list and had naturally seen her name.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?"</p>
<p>Luo Fengling asked in astonishment when she landed in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled and said, "I was chosen to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials, so I came."</p>
<p>"Ah?" Luo Fengling's shock was stupendous. Others at least knew that Yi Yun had previously entered the Earth Fire Hall, but for Luo Fengling, her memory was still stuck at the moment of Yi Yun being her steward disciple, a miscellaneous chores disciple. Suddenly, he was her equal by joining the Luo Divine Hall trials!?</p>
<p>She immediately rushed to take a look at the list that was still hung on the wall in the square. From taking a glance, she indeed saw Yi Yun's name right at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>He was really selected?</p>
<p>Was this steward disciple she had taken in an impressive genius? In just a few months, he had showcased his talent and become one of the participants for the Luo Divine Hall trials? It sounded beguiling.</p>
<p>She took a look at how Yi Yun was dressed in Earth Fire Hall disciples garb and clearly he had been selected into the Earth Fire Hall. Luo Fengling had left in a hurry, so Tao'er did not have the time to inform Luo Fengling about the news.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun being chosen for the Luo Divine Hall trials, Tao'er apparently did not know either. After all, Mt. Fengling was separated from the main mountain by quite a distance, so she naturally did not have time to travel to the main mountain with her strength.</p>
<p>"Junior Sister Fengling, you have hidden so much."</p>
<p>Just after Luo Fengling spoke with Yi Yun, a voice came from behind Luo Fengling. Turning her head, she saw the originator of the voice, a thin man by the name Lie Ya.</p>
<p>Although this man had nothing to speak of for his looks, he was not a weakling, considering he was able to stand there. Furthermore, Lie Ya had spent more than fifty years in the Heaven Fire Hall.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Lie Ya, you are teasing me. I didn't hide anything."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling gave Lie Ya a gentle bow in an extremely respectful manner.</p>
<p>"It's not a joke. Why would I joke? For Junior Sister Fengling to stand here, I'm astonished as a senior brother. Using the term well-hidden isn't enough to describe it. And most impressive of all, even your steward is able to stand here. That makes it amazing! I believe since the establishment of the Fire Cloud State, you are the only one who has been capable of doing that!" Lie Ya said with a grin. His words did not seem hostile and he was just stating facts, but they sounded somewhat harsh in Luo Fengling's ears.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling took a glance at Yi Yun. By calling Yi Yun her steward, Lie Ya clearly did not consider Yi Yun as a peer.</p>
<p>This was understandable. As a senior Heaven Fire Hall disciple, Lie Ya had arduously cultivated for decades and endured through so much just to participate in a single Luo Divine Hall trial. But now, Yi Yun, who had just entered the Fire Cloud State for only a few months, had risen up from a miscellaneous chores disciple to the Earth Fire Hall and then immediately leapfrogged past the Heaven Fire Hall, directly entering the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>These senior disciples had worked so hard to obtain the same results as Yi Yun, so it was natural for them to be displeased.</p>
<p>Ignoring Yi Yun, just having Luo Fengling participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials with them already made them peeved. Was the decades of dedication they put in worth anything compared to her?</p>
<p>Behind Lie Ya, several Heaven Fire Hall disciples looked at Luo Fengling with a myriad of expressions — doubt, puzzlement, suspicion as well as hostility.</p>
<p>As for Ran Yu, he only gave Luo Fengling a nonchalant glance before he retracted his gaze. He did not express anything and simply floated in mid air. He was in meditation with his legs crossed and eyes slightly shut.</p>
<p>Ran Yu appeared very calm. He did not think much about being selected into the Luo Divine Hall trials as it was something within expectations. What concerned him was how to be outstanding in the Luo Divine Hall trials and achieve brilliant results.</p>
<p>Chapter 807: Ancient Fey Edifice</p>
<p>Time passed as Ran Yu, who was floating in mediation with his eyes tightly shut, suddenly opened his eyes and landed on his feet.</p>
<p>"Someone is here!" Amidst the crowd, a Heaven Fire Hall disciple shouted.</p>
<p>Everyone hurriedly looked towards the spirit cruiser. There, they saw a stocky man with a python coiled around him jump down from the spirit cruiser's bow!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this man, Yi Yun was slightly taken aback. This person was quite exaggerated in size. He was at least 3.5 meters tall, and a single arm of his was as thick as a woman's waist, while his legs were as thick as pillars.</p>
<p>His body was covered in tattoos and there was a skull necklace around his neck. The skull necklaces were the size of fists. It was hard to tell if they were the skulls of humans or Fey.</p>
<p>As for the python coiled around his body, it was as thick as a water barrel. Such a large python could easily devour two people.</p>
<p>"All fifteen Fire Cloud State disciples, follow me!"</p>
<p>The snake man's voice was as loud as lightning, shaking people to their very core.</p>
<p>"Fifteen? There's someone who isn't here!?"</p>
<p>Sixteen Fire Cloud State disciples were chosen but there was one person was missing, the first person on the list — Tian Shi!</p>
<p>Tian Shi was the strongest person in the Fire Cloud State and his reputation had even reached the royal capital!</p>
<p>"There's no need to wait. Four hours ago, Tian Shi was brought away by King Hong's men."</p>
<p>King Hong?</p>
<p>Everyone was slightly taken aback. They had all heard of King Hong's illustrious name. Even in the royal capital, King Hong was a prominent figure with a powerful faction under him. His personal strength was also immensely powerful.</p>
<p>"Why did King Hong's men take Senior Brother Tian Shi away?"</p>
<p>Some people were puzzled, but others figured out the reason.</p>
<p>"King Hong is Prince Crimson Firmament's uncle, so..." The person stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>King Hong was the son of Emperor Luo, while Prince Crimson Firmament was actually the emperor's grandson.</p>
<p>Emperor Luo had a long lifespan, but the sons and daughters he had were few in number. This was because the Luo clan was Heaven Fey, giving them the bloodline of ancient powerful Fey. The stronger the bloodline, the harder it was to have offspring.</p>
<p>Although Emperor Luo did not have many children, there was a lot of descendants when his grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren were considered.</p>
<p>Many princes and princesses even had more than a dozen generations beneath them. These children that were more than a dozen generations out were considered direct descendants of Emperor Luo, so they too had the right to succeed the throne.</p>
<p>The seniority amongst Emperor Luo's offspring was extremely complex; hence they basically did not look at their seniority in the family tree but based everything on age. Many princes that were generations apart, such as Prince Pingnan would not address the Luo Emperor as Father Emperor but addressed him as His Majesty.</p>
<p>For Prince Crimson Firmament to address King Hong as his uncle, it was also only because it was appropriate both in terms of age and seniority.</p>
<p>King Hong and Prince Crimson Firmament had close relations, so it was reasonable for him to support Prince Crimson Firmament's succession.</p>
<p>As for the Fire Cloud State, Tian Shi's reputation in it was greater than the rest. Only Tian Shi was worthy enough for King Hong to send his men to take him away.</p>
<p>Of course, Tian Shi was definitely not the only person King Hong brought away. In the other states, there were definitely large numbers of Heaven Fire Hall disciples that were brought to the King Hong residence and given special opportunities.</p>
<p>Those gathered by King Hong were the most outstanding elites in the various states and with King Hong betting on these people, it would allow Prince Crimson Firmament to take another step towards the throne if any of them could be amazing at the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>"As expected, Senior Brother Tian Shi is different. He actually has someone dedicated to bring him away."</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Tian Shi's benefits for this collective training is likely better than ours."</p>
<p>Many people were envious of Tian Shi but of course they could only have themselves to blame.</p>
<p>Why couldn't they be stronger to garner the favor of King Hong?</p>
<p>Amongst the crowd, Luo Fengling also sighed. Previously, she was pleasantly surprised to be favored by Prince Pingnan, but now she felt as though it was nothing much. The truly powerful ones had long been selected.</p>
<p>The man with the python up above sneered when he saw the disciples' reaction. He said with a low, muffled voice, "Opportunities are obtained using your own abilities. If you have the time to be envious of the opportunities of others, you might as well look at what you have! Mt. Azure Billow that all of you will be going will not be weaker than King Hong's cultivation grounds. Mt. Azure Billow also has its opportunities, it will just be very difficult to obtain them! As long as you showcase your strength, the items you obtain will definitely not be weaker or fewer than Tian Shi's. If you are stronger than Tian Shi, then the opportunities you receive will exceed Tian Shi's!"</p>
<p>With the man with the python snapping them out of their self-inflicted misery, the Heaven Fire Hall disciples present felt somewhat more at ease. However, no one believed that the opportunities they would obtain would exceed Tian Shi's. They knew their own strength and were self-aware of how big a gap they had with Tian Shi.</p>
<p>Everyone boarded the spirit cruiser before it shot out into the sky!</p>
<p>The Luo clan ruled over a large stellar zone, with numerous planets in it. In the cosmos, there were even small worlds hidden in it. These worlds also gave birth to countless living beings!</p>
<p>Two hours after the spirit cruiser lifted off, it directly burned a World Stone and tore through the void, performing void transference!</p>
<p>While shuttling through chaotic space-time, the spirit cruiser itself experienced minor tremors. Yi Yun stood in front of a window and looked at the spatial storms and streams of light formed from spatial dimension laws. He had mixed emotions while looking at this. Back when he was in the Cloud Wilderness, it was a struggle to even fill his stomach. Now, he had come to the endless cosmos in the 12 Empyrean Heavens and was touring the Universe. His encounters in life really evoked certain complex emotions.</p>
<p>In two hours, the spirit cruiser traversed a distance of billions of miles and when the spirit cruiser appeared out of the void, Yi Yun saw a mountain through the windows.</p>
<p>This mountain was not towering over a piece of ground. Instead, it was suspended in space.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never seen such a large mountain and a conservative estimate would place it as being tens of thousands of miles high. It was comparable to the size of a dwarf star. The spirit cruiser Yi Yun was on appeared like a speck of dust when flying in front of this massive mountain.</p>
<p>"It's huge!" A disciple said on the spirit cruiser, his tone filled with astonishment.</p>
<p>These disciples felt surging emotions the moment they considered that this mountain was just a location for their collective training, and not where the Luo Divine Hall trials was.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall trials happened once every sixty years, so it was not easy to obtain a single chance.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser approached Mt. Azure Billow and Yi Yun saw bands of blue clouds billowing at the peak of the mountain. It was like flowing water patterns which probably gave rise to Mt. Azure Billow's name.</p>
<p>Starting from the mountainside, there were swaths of architecture that ranged from palaces to herbal gardens, as well as grasslands, forests and ranches for Fey beasts.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser finally landed somewhere near the mountain top. Everyone hurriedly disembarked the spirit cruiser when the doors opened as they stepped foot onto the grounds.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man with the python walked out from the spirit cruiser and took a glance at all the young disciples present. He said, "Mt. Azure Billow's collective training will be short, although it's said to be a collective training, it is actually to give you some benefits. It is to allow you to break through your cultivation realms and obtain better results at the Luo Divine Hall trials!"</p>
<p>“The Luo Divine Hall trial lasts a period of ten years. This ten years will be the years you lay your foundation, so it is extremely important! So do your best!"</p>
<p>"In the grand hall in front of you, its name is Ancient Fey Edifice! It's an important part of the collective training at Mt. Azure Billow. Feel free to take whatever you can obtain after entering the Ancient Fey Edifice!"</p>
<p>Chapter 808: Extreme Yang Illumination</p>
<p>"Ancient Fey Edifice?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked towards the dark but magnificent palace, its main door was about five to six storeys tall, but such a tall door was only four or five meters wide. As a result, it made the door resemble a sword more than a door.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Ancient Fey Edifice's door, there were two Fey beast sculptures erected. They resembled evil demons and the creatures carved in the sculpture had sharp teeth and keen claws. They had two wings on their backs and they looked extremely ferocious.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun stared at the two statues, he had a feeling that the statues were watching him, as though the two statues were alive. It was quite astonishing.</p>
<p>"Do you sense the killing intent?"</p>
<p>At this moment, an arrogant voice came from behind. Yi Yun turned his head to realize that the person who said it was Lie Ya.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was scrawny and was shorter than Yi Yun by half a head. However, he was floating in mid air, as such, the top of Yi Yun's head only reached Lie Ya's chest.</p>
<p>Lie Ya looked down from above at Yi Yun as the corners of his mouth gradually curled, "These two statues were powerful Fey who protected the Luo clan from ancient times. When their lifespans came to an end, they became enchanted puppets by sealing their souls in sculptures that were meticulously refined. At any time, they might suddenly awaken, recovering most of their strength from years ago. This is the Luo clan's heritage as Heaven Fey. It is not something ordinary people can imagine."</p>
<p>On the surface, Lie Ya was introducing the origins of the sculptures placed in front of the Ancient Fey Edifice, but his choice of words had an great sense of superiority. Be it because he was a member of the Fey race or be it because he was a native of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, they were all sources of his sense of superiority.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Lie Ya and completely ignored him. He directly stepped through the Ancient Fey Edifice's entrance.</p>
<p>Lie Ya frowned slightly when he was ignored by Yi Yun. He had the intention to flaunt, but Yi Yun did not show any interest. "You are just pretending to act profound. For a human warrior from a lower realm to act so nonchalantly after coming to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven and see the Ancient Fey Edifice, one might even think he was of immortal empyrean birth if they did not know any better!"</p>
<p>Lie Ya shook his head and also entered the Ancient Fey Edifice.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When Yi Yun walked into the Ancient Fey Edifice, Luo Fengling followed him from behind, "Junior Brother Yi, how did you obtain the nomination for the Luo Divine Hall trials?"</p>
<p>As they had set off in a hurry, Luo Fengling did not converse with Yi Yun. On the journey, she was constantly plagued by thoughts of stupefaction.</p>
<p>"I was lucky and was appreciated by Fairy Black Bamboo. She recommended me to Prince Pingnan, and he nominated me, so here I am being selected for the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>After Luo Fengling heard Yi Yun's general explanation, she commended Yi Yun on his good luck, but at the same time, she knew very well that there was definitely something amazing about Yi Yun for him to be able to gain the appreciation of Fairy Black Bamboo.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was brought into the Fire Cloud State by her, so she naturally wished for Yi Yun to have a bright future.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, work hard then. You are still young. Being able to gain the opportunity to enter the Luo Divine Hall trials is exceedingly rare. It's alright even if you are unable to achieve any desirable results. This is because the Luo Divine Hall trial is an opportunity itself. The trials will last for a decade, and during this period, your strength can increase by leaps and bounds!"</p>
<p>"Alright, thank you Senior Sister Luo." Yi Yun smiled. He knew Luo Fengling was full of good intentions. Just as he was about to continue speaking, he suddenly felt an ancient and irregular aura surge over.</p>
<p>It was as though the long corridor was a time tunnel that led to a mysterious ancient world.</p>
<p>"This is..."</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up and saw the end of the corridor approaching. At the moment he stepped through the corridor, Yi Yun drew a cold gasp.</p>
<p>At the end of the corridor was an inconceivable divine palace. Looking up into the sky, the palace dome hung amongst the radiant moon and the myriad of stars. It appeared as though he had come outside, but Yi Yun knew that he was still inside the Ancient Fey Edifice.</p>
<p>Around Yi Yun were twelve divine columns that pierced straight into the sky!</p>
<p>Every divine column was so thick that it required dozens of people hugging it in order to encircle it. It was thick and heavy, as though they were supporting the firmament above.</p>
<p>"This is the Ancient Fey Edifice's main palace. Fey Gods from a primordial era are engraved on the twelve pillars!"</p>
<p>Twelve primordial Fey Gods?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was stunned as he gave a surprising look at Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>As he had snatched a nomination spot for the trials, Luo Fengling was the only person amongst the Fire Cloud State's Heaven Fire Hall disciples that would explain stuff to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"The twelve primordial Fey Gods are already equivalent to legend. During the early formation of the Universe, when the Chaos first came into existence, the Heavens and Earth produced twelve powerful ancient Fey. They do not belong to the Luo clan, nor should they even be called 'Ancient Fey'. They are natural God Spirits. Only the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven call them Fey Gods, believing that the twelve Fey Gods are the ancestors of the Fey race. But in fact, the human race have different names for them. Similarly, there are humans who believe that the twelve Fey Gods are their own ancestors."</p>
<p>"Is it so?" Yi Yun was slightly taken aback. It now appeared that the twelve pillars erected in the Ancient Fey Edifice was just used to worship the twelve Ancient Fey, and not because the Ancient Fey Edifice had anything to do with the twelve Ancient Fey. Although the Luo clan was powerful, it was impossible for them to have any relations with the twelve Ancient Fey that appeared at the beginning of Chaos.</p>
<p>At this moment, someone in the palace suddenly shouted, "Luo Fengling! The twelve Fey Gods are naturally our Fey race's ancestors. At least other than the seventh Fey God, the others undoubtedly belong to the Fey race. They have nothing to do with the human race!"</p>
<p>The person who spoke out was Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was usually calm and gave off a demeanor of a light breeze. Even when his younger brother's spot had been snatched by Yi Yun, he did not turn hostile towards Yi Yun, or at least, he didn't express it.</p>
<p>But when Luo Fengling raised the issue of the way the 12 Empyrean Heavens viewed the twelve Fey Gods in a neutral manner, Ran Yu had coldly interrupted her.</p>
<p>As a member of the Fey race, Ran Yu had pride that was ingrained into his bones. He believed that the Fey race was the noblest race in the 12 Empyrean Heavens, and how its heritage began from the Chaos, making it the earliest to be born. Luo Fengling's words had triggered him.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling fell silent. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, if one were to recognize the stories of the human race when it came to the twelve Fey Gods, it was easy to be incite the rage of the masses.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the Fey race, the twelve Fey Gods were half-beastlike, so they were naturally closer to Fey in form.</p>
<p>Seeing how Luo Fengling did not dispute any further, Ran Yu took another glance at Yi Yun, but he did not speak.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not understand the twelve Fey Gods at all, so he had no right to make any statements.</p>
<p>He looked at the twelve gigantic divine columns and an Ancient Fey God was engraved on each of them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked a the first column and as the first Fey God of the twelve Fey Gods, it was neither a dragon, nor a phoenix. Its name greatly surprised Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Heavens and Earth, Chaos transformed into the two opposites of Yin and Yang. The power of Yang entities and the essence of extreme Yang combined to form a Fey God, an evolution because of Great Dao!</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination had no shape. All Yi Yun saw on the pillar was a portrayal of the Extreme Yang Illumination, which was a black circle.</p>
<p>It did not even have any thickness. It was just a thin black plane, making it look mysterious and strange.</p>
<p>This was completely unlike a "beast", but an existence that was bordering on Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p>"Extreme Yang Illumination. During the origination of the 12 Fey Gods, after Chaos transformed into Yin and Yang, it first gave birth to the Fey Gods. This is probably the apex of pure Yang..."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the Extreme Yang Illumination's carvings, he had a yearning desire. This was the true pure Yang Origins, a Chaos pure Yang that was equal to a Heavenly Dao!</p>
<p>And following that, Yi Yun looked at the second pillar. After Extreme Yang Illumination was...Extreme Yin Nether Glow!</p>
<p>Chapter 809: Twelve Fey Gods</p>
<p>Extreme Yin Nether Glow was like the shadow of the Extreme Yang Illumination. It was born out of the Chaos together with Extreme Yang Illumination. It was a Fey God formed from the power of Yin entities and the essence of extreme Yin. All of this was a portrayal of how Chaos led to Yin and Yang.</p>
<p>The Extreme Yin Nether Glow similarly was not in the shape of a beast. The image engraved on the column was a white halo with a mist in its outer ring that appeared like a burning flame.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Extreme Yin Nether Glow, there was a black circle, as though it was where the Extreme Yang Illumination should sit. When the two Fey Gods were superimposed on each other, it appeared like a solar eclipse. It would be black in the middle, with a misty halo in its exterior. The saying of how Extreme Yin Nether Glow was the shadow of the Extreme Yang Illumination was a result of this.</p>
<p>"Extreme Yang Illumination, Extreme Yin Nether Glow...When the Universe was in its formative stages, the primordial universe (Wuji) generated supreme ultimate (Taiji), and therefore generated the two opposing forces."</p>
<p>"The primordial universe is Chaos, and the two opposing forces are Yin and Yang. During the formation of the Heaven and Earth, the Fey Gods that were born alongside Yin and Yang can even be considered the embodiment of Heavenly Dao. They are the Extreme Yang Illumination and the Extreme Yin Nether Glow."</p>
<p>Yi Yun seemed to gain something from it as he continued looking on.</p>
<p>The third column had a large tree engraved on it. In the carving, the tree was shockingly large. Even the stars in the sky were like the size of fists, floating amongst the tree's leaves.</p>
<p>The tree branches were lush and flourishing. Every leaf was large enough that they appeared like land that floated in space. On the leaf, a drop of dew could have formed an ocean.</p>
<p>With time being pushed forward, after the large worlds were born, this Dao Tree's leaves could still have plains, forests and a myriad of living beings exist on them.</p>
<p>The third Fey God — Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>It was a divine tree formed from three thousand Great Dao after the formation of the Universe!</p>
<p>When Yi Yun saw the third Fey God, the first thing that came to mind was the Dao Tree he had encountered in the Pure Yang Sword Palace.</p>
<p>The Dao Tree that similarly existed for a long period of time was considered much smaller when compared to the engraved Dao Tree that was much bigger than stars.</p>
<p>That tree was encountered by the Pure Yang Sword Palace owner, and by then, the tree had already existed for a long period of time.</p>
<p>"What relationship does the Dao Tree I encountered in the Pure Yang Sword Palace have with the Empress Earth Dao Tree?"</p>
<p>This question arose in Yi Yun's mind. Having come to the Ancient Fey Edifice, the twelve Fey Gods struck Yi Yun with surprise. The first three Fey Gods already made Yi Yun generate many feelings of longing in such an immense world like the 12 Empyrean Heavens. While being enlightened, he was simultaneously filled with questions.</p>
<p>The fourth Fey God — Dragon Emperor!</p>
<p>Near the beginning of the Heaven and Earth, the god bred out of Chaos was the king of all dragons.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of divine dragons in the world, such as the noble five-clawed golden dragon, Red Dragon, Azure Dragon, Yellow Dragon as well as the Torch Dragon that fell into darkness and the bloodthirsty Blood Dragon.</p>
<p>All these dragons came from the Dragon Emperor, they were its descendants.</p>
<p>The fifth Fey God — Seven-colored Phoenix!</p>
<p>If there was a dragon, there was naturally a phoenix. During the inception of the Heaven and Earth, the phoenix was born. It was the ancestor of all birds. The feathers had seven colors, and these seven feathers represented different powers of nature. The Seven-colored Phoenix could not only control fire, but it could also control Wind, Rain, Thunder and Lightning, as well as the five elements.</p>
<p>The world's Fire Phoenix, Ice Phoenix, Azure Luan-bird, Vermilion Bird and even the Golden Crow came from the bloodline of the Seven-colored Phoenix.</p>
<p>The sixth Fey God — Kun Peng!</p>
<p>If the Seven-colored Phoenix was considered the ancestor of all birds, then there was probably only one bird that did not descend from it. That was the Heavenly Peng!</p>
<p>The Heavenly Peng was not exactly a bird, but a fish and bird in one. In the form of a Kun, it could easily devour thousands of seas, and in the form of a Peng, spreading its wings spanned a distance of 45,000 kilometers. In its flying rage, it could tear apart galaxies!</p>
<p>The seventh Fey God — Heavenly Man!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this Fey God, Yi Yun was momentarily stunned. Heavenly Man?</p>
<p>Different from the other Fey Gods, this was a Fey God in the shape of a man. His name was also Ancestor Pan. With a giant ax in hand, he was a giant with five different colored hair. He could split the heaven and earth apart, creating a world in the process!</p>
<p>The eighth Fey God — River of Forgetfulness</p>
<p>This eighth Fey God was even more fascinating. Its shape was in an endless surging river. And what flowed in the river was not water, but time.</p>
<p>The river of time only surged ahead in one direction, the future.</p>
<p>By heading only for the future, it meant forgetting the past. Thus, the river's name was named River of Forgetfulness!</p>
<p>The ninth Fey God...was empty!</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was momentarily stunned. He only understood after looking carefully. The ninth Fey God was not missing but because its form was — "nothingness". It had no shape or form, no edge or limits!</p>
<p>The ninth Fey God — Solitary Nothingness</p>
<p>With time, there would naturally be space. Space-time was like Yin-Yang. They were Dao formed at the formation of the Universe.</p>
<p>Solitary Nothingness was an endless void with complete silence, and had nothing in it. Like the graveyard for the thousands of worlds, it was like the abode to everything.</p>
<p>Worlds were created, but they were also annihilated. Everything would ultimately be transformed to nothingness, returning to the solitary void.</p>
<p>Solitary Nothingness' name was a result of this.</p>
<p>Legends said that "Solitary Nothingness" was an endless void itself. Being devoured into Solitary Nothingness' stomach would result in permanent annihilation...</p>
<p>The tenth Fey God...</p>
<p>When Yi Yun came to this point, he was stunned. If the ninth Fey God was a blank because "Solitary Nothingness" did not have any shape or form, then the tenth Fey God was truly missing.</p>
<p>He did not see the tenth, eleventh or twelfth Fey Gods.</p>
<p>In fact, the Fey race only knew that there existed twelve Fey Gods, but the last three Fey Gods were extremely mysterious. In the canonical books of the Fey race, there were many legends about it that attempted to reveal or speculate the identity of the three great Fey Gods. However, every one of them was rather unconvincing. Eventually, the identities of the three great Fey Gods could not be confirmed and was still a mystery up to now...</p>
<p>"They don't even know what sort of existence they are, but they know there are twelve Fey Gods?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was momentarily stunned as he found it incredulous.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Fengling said, "Junior Brother Yi, the twelve Fey Gods were inferred by the mighty figures of the Fey race when they gain insight into the Heavenly Dao. It is not only the opinion of the Fey race. In the other Empyrean Heavens, mighty human figures have also gained insight into the Heavenly Dao and they have also obtained the same conclusion. Of course, they are just not called 'Fey Gods'. Their common names are — Twelve Dao Ancestors."</p>
<p>"I see..." Yi Yun nodded. Since all the mighty figures in the 12 Empyrean Heavens came to the same conclusion, then it was probably true. The only thing was that the last three great Fey Gods, or Dao Ancestors were lost in the misty Heavenly Dao, preventing others from seeing them clearly.</p>
<p>However, Ran Yu had previously mentioned that the twelve Fey Gods were the ancestors of the Fey race, other than the seventh Fey God — Heavenly Man. There was no way the Fey race could categorize the Heavenly Man into the form of Fey, as he resembled humans in every form and manner. As for the other Fey Gods being said to be "naturally closer to Fey" was in Yi Yun's opinion, just fictitious.</p>
<p>Other than the Dragon Emperor, the Seven-colored Phoenix, the Kun Peng, Yi Yun could not tell how the other Fey Gods had a closer relationship with the Fey race.</p>
<p>"The twelve Fey Gods, or the twelve Dao Ancestors must be the beginnings of Heavenly Dao! They were born directly out of the Chaos. Many divine beasts that sounded amazing, such as the divine beasts of the Four Symbols — Azure Dragon, the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger — while Bifang, Taotie, Responding Dragon evolved after the five elements were split apart, and with everything being born. Compared to the twelve Fey Gods, they are greatly inferior.”</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun suddenly felt like he had broadened his horizons.</p>
<p>Although the twelve columns were engraved by progeny, nor did they contain any profound laws, just looking at them made Yi Yun feel like he had gained a lot.</p>
<p>His gain came in the form of mental benefit. The more he knew how vast and spectacular the world was, the more motivation Yi Yun gained. This motivation came from the unwillingness to be tiny and the ambition of being equal to Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p>Kun Peng is a giant bird (Peng) that transforms from a giant fish (Kun). Sometimes translated as Roc.</p>
<p>Bifang is a mythical bird. It looks like a crane which owns red marking, white beak, and has only one foot. This creature does not eat grains but flames. Its appearance is a signal of big fire.</p>
<p>Chapter 810: Sword and Phoenix</p>
<p>"These ancient twelve Fey Gods stand atop the world, and are just too far away from us. However, in the Ancient Fey Edifice, it is said that it hides a lot of opportunities. Also, Lord Cang Mang had previously said that we can obtain things from the Ancient Fey Edifice." Luo Fengling said. With a sword in hand, her eyes were shimmering. Clearly, she was looking forward to the opportunities that awaited her.</p>
<p>Although she was talented, the amount of time she spent cultivating had been short. After being nominated for the trials, she received a lot of pressure when she saw people like Lie Ya and Ran Yu. She had to use every available time to upgrade herself, if not, by wasting such a good opportunity having not done well, there was no way she could face Fairy Black Bamboo, who had given her guidance and support.</p>
<p>At this moment, a disdainful voice was heard, "Obtain things? Lord Cang Mang did say that, but they are there only if you have the ability to get them. In the Ancient Fey Edifice, there are opportunities of all sizes, but only the able ones can obtain them."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling looked at the speaking Lie Ya, but her pretty face did not change in expression. "I naturally know that, you do not need to worry yourself to remind me."</p>
<p>"Hehe." Lie Ya gave an odd smile. Previously, Yi Yun had ignored him, so he could not be bothered to conceal his contempt for Yi Yun and Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>"Senior Sister Luo, you don't have to mind him." Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>"He is targeting us. The others are also hostile, but at least they aren't like him." Luo Fengling said with a frown.</p>
<p>She usually only bothered herself with cultivation, so she seldom mingled with others and kept a low profile, yet she had become a thorn in the side of others.</p>
<p>However, compared to her, the hostility Yi Yun received was even worse. Despite being an Earth Fire Hall disciple, he was able to join these elites in the same trials, so how could the elites feel mentally balanced?</p>
<p>"This is the Ancient Fey Edifice's main hall!" The burly man with the python had also walked over.</p>
<p>Yi Yun already knew his name was Lord Cang Mang.</p>
<p>"The things you want to obtain are in this main hall." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Luo Fengling looked around them, but the main hall was empty, so what was there?</p>
<p>However, Ran Yu, Lie Ya and company did not move. They only looked at the divine columns of the ancient twelve Fey Gods.</p>
<p>They had prepared for the Luo Divine Hall trials for decades, so they had also obtained information about the Ancient Fey Edifice. Some of them were informed ahead of time by their family seniors.</p>
<p>So while others were looking all around the main hall, these people looked calm like a breeze. It was obvious whose family clan's heritage was better just from this. Many Fey race had heritage passed down for tens of millions of years. Cultivators who were born in such Fey race naturally had the advantage against other cultivators.</p>
<p>Seeing people of noble birth, like Ran Yu, apparently understanding everything beforehand, Yi Yun had a thought and opened his energy vision.</p>
<p>"That means the things must be on these twelve Fey God columns."</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave these people a nonchalant glance. They were standing by the side waiting to watch him make a fool of himself, but this did not affect Yi Yun at all. He cast his gaze at the twelve Fey God columns.</p>
<p>These ancient twelve Fey God columns emanated a pressuring aura. If there was anything in the main hall, it had to do with these twelve Fey God columns.</p>
<p>"The ancient twelve Fey Gods were born at the beginning of Chaos. They are the most primitive embodiment of laws. Their existences are also different manifestations of laws. However, these twelve Fey God columns were built by progeny. The laws they represent naturally are not the purest laws from the beginning of Chaos." Cang Mang spoke and indeed mentioned the ancient twelve Fey God columns.</p>
<p>"However, the people who constructed these twelve Fey Gods columns were ancestors of our Luo clan. They were top mighty figures. The divine columns they constructed had managed to attract a glimmer of divine grace from the ancient twelve Fey Gods. These divine columns are also manifestations of laws. All of you can't stay long in this Ancient Fey Edifice because there are other disciples from other states that will come here a day later. Time is limited so make good use of it."</p>
<p>The twelve mighty figures in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had managed to attract the ancient twelve Fey Gods after constructing the divine columns. Although it was just a glimmer of grace that merged into the divine column, it made the columns divine items too. The profoundness behind the twelve mighty figures' understanding of laws was beyond imagination.</p>
<p>"These twelve divine columns are also twelve different entrances. The opportunities you obtain will differ according to the different entrances." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>"Similarly, the difficulty of opening each of the twelve Fey God columns are different as well." Cang Mang introduced the rules.</p>
<p>Beside him, Ran Yu took a deep breath. As a descendant of the Xushui clan, an ancient royal clan, he naturally knew about the twelve Fey God columns ahead of time. His father had previously participated in the Luo Divine Hall trials as well.</p>
<p>For this, Ran Yu naturally did not want to shame his father or bring disgrace to his family clan. It was imperative that he did well at this trial.</p>
<p>"Lie Ya and company must know which divine columns are the easiest to open, but I will not do that. Choosing the fastest one from the onset might make it simple, but by choosing the easiest path before the beginning of the trials, one will definitely be the fastest to be eliminated during the trials." Ran Yu thought.</p>
<p>His ambition was lofty. He chose to open one of the twelve Fey God columns that had a certain degree of difficulty.</p>
<p>"Begin, all of you only have one day." Cang Mang said and crossed his legs to sit down on the same spot. He tightly closed his eyes while the python around him crept around his body in a slow fashion, its cold eyes sizing up the cultivators.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Cang Mang's words, these cultivators also immediately began, but first all of them looked at Luo Fengling, Yi Yun and another rookie disciple that had been nominated by Black Bamboo—Bai Chen.</p>
<p>The three of them were the most conspicuous in the group.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling frowned slightly because these people were still waiting for them to make a fool of themselves.</p>
<p>None of them were in a hurry to move and they were just waiting for Luo Fengling and Yi Yun's choice.</p>
<p>As for Cang Mang, his eyes were tightly shut, ignoring everything that was going on.</p>
<p>He did not provide the means to open the doors, and wanted them to figure it out themselves.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, I'll go first." Luo Fengling said.</p>
<p>But just as she finished her sentence, Yi Yun had already walked towards the twelve divine columns.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi..." Luo Fengling hurriedly shouted.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Yi Yun had already come before a divine column.</p>
<p>This was the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column. Standing at the bottom of the divine column, Yi Yun was as small as an ant. He looked up and a Seven-colored Phoenix was circling the divine column in flight, with its eyes looking at the endless sky.</p>
<p>However, when Yi Yun focused his eyes on it, the Seven-colored Phoenix's eyes seemed to look down. Immediately, an intense pressure surged over.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's mind quivered. What a powerful aura! Cang Mang had already said that these divine columns only contained a glimmer of the divine charm of the ancient twelve Fey Gods, but just this glimmer was enough to make Yi Yun feel that there was a Seven-colored Phoenix right in front of him. It was able to blot out the sky and tear through the heavens.</p>
<p>But how was he to open this divine column? Yi Yun stretched out his hand and placed it on the divine column.</p>
<p>The ancient twelve Fey God columns were creations of top mighty figures. Every carving they made contained the martial insights of these mighty figures. While stroking the carvings, Yi Yun could even feel himself being threatened.</p>
<p>It was sword, a sharp sword technique that had been carved out slash after slash. The phoenix flew high, soaring over the horizons with the wind as its companion. It was as flexible as this sword slash.</p>
<p>The sword scar from the Pure Yang Sword Palace appeared before Yi Yun's eyes. That slash had managed to split apart a small world. It was no doubt a stunning strike. If he produced the Sword Intent from that strike, Yi Yun believed that the divine column in front of him would likely resonate.</p>
<p>Chapter 811: Powerful Ancient Fey</p>
<p>As long as he gained the recognition of the ancient Fey column, Yi Yun could open an entrance.</p>
<p>It was only through recognition and not his insight. Of course, attempting to open the door through violence was out of the question.</p>
<p>The twelve ancient Fey columns might take several hours, days or even years to give a person its recognition. It might never happen for all eternity as well.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun and the cultivators that came from the Fire Cloud State, they only had a day's time. After them, there were other cultivators from other states that were arranged to come here.</p>
<p>Due to the short amount of time, many people would likely fail.</p>
<p>Cang Mang did not tell them how to open the ancient Fey columns, so as Yi Yun touched the ancient Fey column, Yi Yun guessed that there were many ways to open the columns.</p>
<p>The Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column could resonate with Sword Intent, so it was likely he could open it through Sword Intent, but this Sword Intent was mostly coming from the carver of the Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column.</p>
<p>As the carver of the ancient Fey column was a mighty figure of the Luo clan who used a sword, if Yi Yun were to use his Sword Intent to open the Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column, that would just be an inferior outcome.</p>
<p>This was because swords had nothing to do with Seven-colored Phoenix. The true value of the ancient Fey columns mainly came from how their creators had used their own Dao insights to bring a glimmer of ancient Fey energy together. This energy came from the ancient Chaos from all over the endless Universe. Although it was very minute, it was as close to nomological Origins.</p>
<p>What Yi Yun wanted was the recognition of the nomological Origins and not the recognition of the Sword Dao used by the person who carved the ancient Fey column.</p>
<p>In that case, what should be used to resonate with this glimmer of Seven-colored Phoenix's Origins aura?</p>
<p>Without any rules, that also meant that there were many rules and different opening methods. The opportunities obtained through that was probably also different.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column but he did not release his Sword Intent, instead, he began circulating his pure Yang body.</p>
<p>Phoenixes were reborn from the ashes of fire, so it had much to do with fire-elemental laws. Yi Yun had absorbed Earth fire, making his pure Yang body even purer, and his meridians had been repeatedly tempered by the Earth fire, which was similar to being reborn from Earth fire.</p>
<p>His pure Yang body was like a pure flame and as his pure Yang body circulated, the flames began to burn intensely.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun was circulating his pure Yang body in full force, he suddenly felt in his perception that the Seven-colored Phoenix in front of him seem to come alive. In its seven-colored feathers, there was a flame plume burning. An immense heat wave rushed at him, making Yi Yun feel like his eyebrows were burning.</p>
<p>In front of the phoenix's fire that could raze the world, Yi Yun's pure Yang body was like a tiny fire plume.</p>
<p>"Phoenix Heavenly Fire!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun quivered slightly but immediately regained his consciousness. The fire from the phoenix's feathers was apparently just an illusion. When Yi Yun opened his eyes, everything had disappeared.</p>
<p>The Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column in front of him was still standing silently in front of him while the engraved Seven-colored Phoenix above him had remained the same ever since it was carved, having never changed.</p>
<p>The scenes from before was like a dream.</p>
<p>"Seven-colored Phoenix is not only about fire..." Yi Yun muttered to himself. There were several kinds of phoenixes that were incarnations of fire, such as the white Swan, the purple Celestial Bird, the azure-colored Blue Phoenix...</p>
<p>The ancient Seven-colored Phoenix was the ancestor of all phoenixes. Its seven-colored feathers actually represented, Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Thunder.</p>
<p>Fire was just one of the seven, making it relatively insignificant.</p>
<p>Yi Yun understood that compared to the Fey God's grace that had been attracted by the ancient Fey column, he had too little insight. If he only chose the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column, then he would not gain too much from it.</p>
<p>Using a sword would only end up with inferiority. As for his fire-elemental laws, they were derived from pure Yang laws; furthermore, fire-elemental laws was just one of the seven laws of the ancient phoenix, so it would not be considered an upper grade choice.</p>
<p>Upon realizing this, Yi Yun silently released his hand and looked at Cang Mang. He asked, "Lord Cang Mang, can everyone only choose one ancient Fey column?"</p>
<p>Cang Mang opened his eyes and said slowly, "Many ancient Fey columns can be chosen, and you can receive the recognition of several ancient Fey columns. The recognition you will receive from each ancient Fey column will also be different. The greater and deeper the recognition, the opportunity obtained will be better."</p>
<p>Cang Mang did not despise Yi Yun because of his age, and had seriously answered Yi Yun's question.</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>Yi Yun retreated after saying that. Having touched the Seven-colored Phoenix for the first time, it made him feel the immense power of the ancient Fey Gods. He planned on looking at the other ancient Fey columns and learn of more opening methods.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun stand before the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column for a while before asking Cang Mang such an ambitious question, Lie Ya disdainfully shook his head.</p>
<p>"Being able to open one ancient Fey column is already not bad, but you want to open a few? Dream on!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing Lie Ya's words, Ran Yu said, "Although the time he has spent cultivating has been short, he has previously snatched Earth fire from a senior Earth Fire Hall disciple. He had even used the chance of absorbing Earth fire to make a breakthrough. Just based on his insight into fire-elemental laws, he might gain something with a bit of luck."</p>
<p>"He only beat an Earth Fire Hall disciple. I know that person. He's named Yang Zishan and has spent years in the Earth Fire Hall. If he were any good, he would have entered the Heaven Fire Hall a long time ago. So what if he defeated Yang Zishan?"</p>
<p>Lie Ya could not be bothered to watch Yi Yun posturing. He said to the others, "Let us begin too. There's no need to mind him."</p>
<p>As Lie Ya spoke, he walked towards an ancient Fey column.</p>
<p>He had long made his choice, the ancient Fey column of the sixth Fey God, Kun Peng.</p>
<p>Lie Ya came in front of the Kun Peng divine column and fully released his aura. His eyes stared with a shimmer at the divine column.</p>
<p>The legendary ancient Kun Peng fed on flood dragons and had an extremely powerful body. Lie Ya was not confident in his own nomological insights, so he wanted to use his physique's strength to obtain the sixth divine column's recognition.</p>
<p>The other cultivators also went before different ancient Fey columns.</p>
<p>Their choices were mainly the three ancient Fey columns — Dragon Emperor, Kun Peng or the Seven-colored Phoenix.</p>
<p>In the Ancient Fey Edifice's main hall, there were nine ancient Fey columns that were carved completely, but like the flow of time, the River of Forgetfulness, or Solitary Nothingness that could contain the infinite void, these columns were too esoteric. No one could understand them, so they were abandoned.</p>
<p>By choosing the Dragon Emperor, Kun Peng and Seven-colored Phoenix, not only could they gain the recognition through nomological insights, but they could also do so by using their physical bodies.</p>
<p>The physical bodies of the Fey race were much stronger than humans'.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling also came before a divine column. She had chosen the Seven-colored Phoenix and planned on using her powerful physique, combined with fire-elemental laws, to obtain the recognition of the Seven-colored Phoenix. This was the lowest difficulty she could choose.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu stood in the same spot for a while before he walked to an ancient Fey column. What he chose was surprisingly...the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>Upon seeing Ran Yu's choice, the other cultivators could not help but give a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>Empress Earth Dao Tree!?</p>
<p>Ran Yu actually made such a choice?</p>
<p>Dragon Emperor, Seven-colored Phoenix and Kun Peng were after all Fey. They had similar powerful bodies like the Fey race.</p>
<p>As for the Empress Earth Dao Tree, it had condensed three thousand nomological Great Dao and was a pure manifestation of laws, representing the truth of Great Dao.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to obtain the recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree.</p>
<p>Actually, most members of the Fey race were not adept at nomological perception. In their martial cultivation, they would tend to temper their bodies, so this was the reason why they were trying to obtain the recognition from the Dragon Emperor, Kun Peng or the Seven-colored Phoenix's divine columns.</p>
<p>"Ran Yu chose the Dao Tree as his first choice, and he is also a Heaven Fey with a powerful physique. From the looks of it, Ran Yu probably truly plans on gaining the recognition of two ancient Fey columns!"</p>
<p>Chapter 812: Empress Earth Dao Tree</p>
<p>Although the cultivators were astonished that Ran Yu wanted to obtain the recognition of two ancient Fey columns, they did not think he was being overambitious. Instead, they felt a strange feeling suffuse from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>They were all the same participants of the same trial, but Tian Shi had been taken away in advance, while Ran Yu was prepared to obtain the recognition of two ancient Fey columns. As the best trial participants of the Fire Cloud State, they had opened a gap from normal participants like them right from the very beginning.</p>
<p>However, despite feeling a bit of envy, the cultivators found it acceptable after thinking of Ran Yu's talents as well as his great reputation amongst the Fire Cloud State's younger generation. Two female cultivators were already looking at Ran Yu with a different look in their eyes.</p>
<p>"As long as I do not fall behind others, it's fine losing to Tian Shi or Ran Yu." Lie Ya thought, as he gave a sidelong glance at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"It's fine if Ran Yu asks if one can gain the recognition of many divine columns. But what is this Yi Yun asking, does he really think..."</p>
<p>At this moment, Lie Ya was completely stumped. He saw Yi Yun strolling slowly and standing in front of the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column!</p>
<p>What was he thinking of doing while standing there? Could it be...</p>
<p>An incredulous thought popped up in Lie Ya's mind. As he watched Yi Yun stand motionlessly before the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column, Yi Yun suddenly stretched out his hand and placed it on the divine column. His eyes were slightly shut like an old monk in meditation.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Other than Lie Ya, the other cultivators also noticed Yi Yun's actions.</p>
<p>Even Ran Yu, who was sitting cross-legged in front of the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column gave a look of surprise.</p>
<p>"What is this Yi Yun planning on doing?"</p>
<p>"He has talent in fire-elemental laws, yet he does not put in further effort in it. What is he stopping in front of the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column for?"</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree contained 3000 Great Dao, and there may be fire-elemental laws in them, but that was such a trivial detail. It was impossible to obtain the recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree just using fire-elemental laws.</p>
<p>"Can't you tell? Junior Brother Yi Yun is also trying to obtain the recognition of two divine columns." Lie Ya said nonchalantly, but anyone could tell that he was being sarcastic.</p>
<p>Inquiring about obtaining recognition from multiple columns was fine, but Yi Yun actually treated it seriously!</p>
<p>What sort of person was Ran Yu? He was a Heaven Fey, one of the best amongst the Fire Cloud State's younger generation. As for Yi Yun, he was only able to be here because of Prince Pingnan. He had some dog-sh*t luck and a bit of talent only.</p>
<p>Yet, he wanted to obtain the recognition of two divine columns?</p>
<p>These elites were already indignant about being on the same name list with Yi Yun. Now, seeing that Yi Yun was actually attempting to be equal to one of the best, and trample them beneath his feet, they immediately felt infuriated.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun opened his eyes. He turned a deaf ear towards them and moved his hand away from the column.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Lie Ya immediately chortled, "It's a misunderstanding. Junior Brother is just looking around."</p>
<p>At least Yi Yun knew himself, but from the way he looked, it was such obvious posturing. This was enough to fool low-ranking disciples, but everyone present was an elite from the Fire Cloud State, so when they saw Yi Yun's posturing, they found it amusing.</p>
<p>However, just as Lie Ya said that, he saw Yi Yun standing in front of the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column. This time, Yi Yun was even more thorough and actually sat down in front of the divine column.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was speechless. Yi Yun could not be considered arrogant anymore, but definitely had a screw loose in the head. Trying to obtain the recognition of the Extreme Yang Illumination was much harder than getting the recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree.</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination represented the pure Yang laws at the birth of Chaos. It was one of the supreme Great Dao that approached extremely closely to Heavenly Dao. It was much closer to the Great Dao of Origins compared to the Seven-colored Phoenix.</p>
<p>They were only given one day's time, but Yi Yun was attempting three ancient Fey columns, the Seven-colored Phoenix, the Empress Earth Dao Tree and the Extreme Yang Illumination? This was absurd! Without mentioning the three divine columns, it was already extremely difficult to obtain the recognition from any one of the the two divine columns — Empress Earth Dao Tree and Extreme Yang Illumination.</p>
<p>Besides, the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column was not to be looked down upon. Knowing fire-elemental laws did not necessarily mean one could obtain its recognition. There was just a slightly higher chance of success!</p>
<p>Others began to shake their heads and ignore Yi Yun. A large number of them were still worried over being able to gain the recognition of one divine column, so they naturally could not be bothered with the overambitious Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They had prepared decades for the trials and they were all Heaven Fire Hall disciples. Having finally obtained a spot through great difficulty, they had to take advantage of the precious one day that they had.</p>
<p>As for Luo Fengling, she gave Yi Yun a worried glance.</p>
<p>"Senior Sister Luo, I believe Junior Brother Yi will not be listening to you." Bai Chen's voice was suddenly heard. He was a newer generation disciple and was considered under the same camp as Luo Fengling and Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling also noticed that Yi Yun had his own ideas, so whatever she said was unlikely to be useful. She could only sigh and face the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column in front of her.</p>
<p>It was unknown if she could obtain the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column's recognition in a day. A resolute look flashed in Luo Fengling's delicate face. Although she was weak, it was only because she had cultivated for a short period of time. She did not think her talent as weak, so she could not squander the precious opportunity of this trial.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had already entered a completely ethereal state.</p>
<p>The other cultivators' gaze and chatter did not affect him at all.</p>
<p>From the moment when Yi Yun stood in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column, Yi Yun had already obtained a full understanding of these divine columns, so he was blind and deaf to outside events.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not care how these people were reacting to him. The laws represented by the twelve divine columns and what they showed to him were things Yi Yun cared the most.</p>
<p>They were the most profound and abstruse laws. Although they were not the real ancient twelve Fey Gods, they could benefit him greatly if he could see the glimmer of grace the ancient twelve Fey Gods had left inside the columns through the laws inscribed by the creators of the divine columns.</p>
<p>The ancient twelve Fey God divine columns were not meant for gaining insight. However, by taking a look at the Great Dao Origins, warriors could broaden their horizons. Although they might not be able to obtain insight into Great Dao Origins through this, they could still verify the nomological insights they had.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun came before the Empress Earth Dao Tree, he saw how each tree leaf was a world itself. Every world was an embodiment of a law. These 3000 worlds were the manifestation of 3000 Great Dao. The 3000 Great Dao had been condensed to form the entire Dao Tree.</p>
<p>At the Pure Yang Sword Palace, Yi Yun had once gained enlightenment in front of a Dao Tree. He still had a Dao Leaf on his body, and when he reached his hand out to touch the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column, a glimmer of grace from the Dao Tree immediately resonated with the Dao Leaf Yi Yun had.</p>
<p>"Although the Dao Tree in the Pure Yang Sword Palace might not be the Empress Earth Dao Tree, they must be somehow related to each other."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the Empress Earth Dao Tree, he felt a sense of familiarity. He had once experienced life as though he was a leaf on the Dao Tree during his enlightenment. Now, the Empress Earth Dao Tree had rustled its leaves in response, making him feel as though he had once again become one of the leaves on the tree.</p>
<p>Chapter 813: Insights into Pure Yang</p>
<p>When Yi Yun closed his eyes, he seemed to merge with the Dao Leaves. They echo in unison how full and magnificent the Dao Tree was.</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree's aura was boundless. It was formed from the combination of 3000 Great Dao and was inclusive of everything and could accommodate anything. This admission of everything was the Dao of everything itself. It was too vast, and if Yi Yun had never transformed into a Dao Leaf, it was very difficult for him to obtain the recognition of the Dao Tree.</p>
<p>And after the Dao Tree, Yi Yun came before the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column. It was a manifestation of pure Yang laws that was closest to the Origins. The mighty figure that created this divine column was an ancestor of the Luo clan who was also a fire-elemental Heaven Fey. Fire and pure Yang had features that corresponded to each other. When this particular ancestor carved the Extreme Yang Illumination, just the burning Yang flames that arose from this divine column alone was something enough to burn through a warrior's protective Yuan Qi, reducing them to ashes, what more obtaining its recognition.</p>
<p>Only later, after an immense period of time did the divine column slowly cool down. Now, one could not experience the burning aura in the Ancient Fey Edifice, as though it was just a normal column, but Yi Yun knew that the pure Yang aura in the divine column had just converged within, making it harder to awaken it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun circulated his pure Yang body. After receiving the tempering from the Fire Spirit Palace's Earth fire, his pure Yang body had become even purer. If one were to check his body internally, his bones and flesh were as crystalline as glass as they shimmered with a subtle luster.</p>
<p>A faint plume of phantom flame slowly emerged after being drawn out by Yi Yun's pure Yang body. Soon, what gradually appeared out of the divine column was the fire-elemental laws left behind when the Luo clan Heaven Fey carved the Extreme Yang Illumination. This phantom image was the reconstruction of the Extreme Yang Illumination divine pillar from eons ago.</p>
<p>The pure Yang body had successfully drawn out the phantom flame, but Yi Yun was not satisfied.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the Extreme Yang Illumination's recognition, just drawing out the fire-elemental laws of a Luo clan Heaven Fey was far from enough.</p>
<p>A flame plume appeared in Yi Yun's Dantian. It was the pure Yang spirit that had been quietly residing in the Purple Crystal ever since it was absorbed by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Once the flame appeared, the phantom flame on the divine column "leaped" out and expanded, as though the entire divine column was enveloped by the flame. The Extreme Yang Illumination that was carved on it loomed within the flames.</p>
<p>This was still insufficient. The Extreme Yang Illumination's aura did not appear at all.</p>
<p>Yi Yun focused his eyes on the Extreme Yang Illumination as his mind completely immersed itself into the flames.</p>
<p>Scenes of what the Earth fire saw materialized in his eyes. The fire had been there when the Heaven and Earth was born, so although it was just an Earth fire that was born from the birth of a world, it was somewhat similar to the Extreme Yang Illumination that was born out of Chaos.</p>
<p>Slowly, the engraved Extreme Yang Illumination seemed to have an additional halo surrounding it. This halo was inconspicuous between the burning flames, but all the flames seemed to be subject to it as they circled the halo.</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination was pure Yang laws at the beginning. Even flames were lit by it.</p>
<p>Within this divine column was just the slightest bit of aura of the Extreme Yang Illumination, but when the halo appeared, Yi Yun immediately felt like his entire spirit was burning.</p>
<p>Just a spark from the Extreme Yang Illumination was enough to kill respected figures. Even the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's powerful Fey were like ants in front of it.</p>
<p>Even just a trace of its flame was enough to reduce the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven to ashes.</p>
<p>Flames born out of Pure Yang laws at the beginning could consume everything, pure Yang true flames that could even burn spirits to ashes.</p>
<p>Yi Yun caught a glimpse of the pure Yang true flames' power and as his spirit was being burned, his eyes also felt like they were burning in flames. The Purple Crystal constantly released its energy, preventing Yi Yun's spirit from suffering the burns.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun's eyes shimmered, he had managed to come into contact with the pure Yang true flames, allowing him to come to a realization that a pure Yang body was just the beginning. Having a pure Yang body was just passing through the beginning threshold of being able to truly grasp pure Yang laws.</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun was being slightly enlightened, the Extreme Yang Illumination suddenly sent out a burst of radiance, causing the flames on the divine column to surge down like flowing water, flooding the entire hall in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body trembled and when he suddenly jolted out of his trance, he realized that everything in front of him had been restored to normal.</p>
<p>As for his body, he did not know when it stood up and took several steps back.</p>
<p>The Extreme Yang Illumination's aura had been completely released and it was the power of the Heaven and Earth. Although it was just an instant, it was enough to give Yi Yun an utter shock.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lie Ya's laughter could be heard coming from the Kun Peng divine column.</p>
<p>The other cultivators could not sense the Extreme Yang Illumination's changes, but Lie Ya had personally witnessed Yi Yun suddenly stand up and retreat.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's face sullen and him appearing in a shocked daze, Lie Ya could not help but burst out laughing. He did not believe Yi Yun could obtain the recognition of the Extreme Yang Illumination. Obtaining its recognition was extremely difficult and even if one could obtain its recognition, it could not be so easily accomplished in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, are you fine? You don't look so good." Lie Ya asked with concern.</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave him a glance and could not be bothered with him.</p>
<p>When Lie Ya saw Yi Yun repeatedly ignoring him, he snorted in a cold and contemptuous manner. He continued trying his best to obtain the Kun Peng divine column's recognition.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun stood up and rested for a while, he returned once again to the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column.</p>
<p>"A day's time is almost up and you are changing again? So awesome." A few cultivators were impressed at Yi Yun's laughable actions. Yi Yun had switched ancient Fey columns several times. And for warriors, a day's time would pass in a blink of an eye and more than half the allotted time had passed.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, these cultivators also looked towards Ran Yu as he sat in front of the Empress Earth Dao Tree. Suddenly a faint white gas emitted from the top of his head as the aura he expelled suddenly turned misty.</p>
<p>Seeing Ran Yu's change, the cultivators were astonished. Could this reaction be an indication of having obtained the Empress Earth Dao Tree's recognition?</p>
<p>Instantly, the other cultivators were both feeling both envious and jealous. They were all trial takers for the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials, but compared to these peerless figures, they appeared extremely normal.</p>
<p>"However, the peerless ones are only limited to Ran Yu, Tian Shi and Gu Luo. We still have a chance." Upon thinking of this, these cultivators looked at the people beside them. They had already given up competing with Ran Yu and company. They just needed to be better than the people beside them.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a burst of motivational energy rise up them.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling also glanced at Ran Yu enviously. Ran Yu was truly extremely talented and he had cultivated for a long period of time, giving him outstanding strength.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Fengling also saw Yi Yun come in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column. Compared to Ran Yu, who was suspected to obtain the Empress Earth Dao Tree's recognition, Yi Yun, who had given up the Extreme Yang Illumination and returned to the Seven-colored Phoenix, was probably somewhat frustrated.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, channel your fire-elemental laws and there will be a higher chance of obtaining the Seven-colored Phoenix's recognition. This is just a collective training and not a trial." Luo Fengling said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up and gave her a glance, but he was somewhat stumped. He then said, "Thank you Senior Sister Luo."</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu suddenly opened his eyes and stood up. His face had a look of satisfaction on it before he came before another divine column — the Dragon Emperor divine column!</p>
<p>Dragons were considered royalty amongst the Ten Thousand Fey. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the dragon totem meant something special, symbolizing supreme imperial power!</p>
<p>Ran Yu's expression was filled with confidence, making everyone feel envious.</p>
<p>This meant that he was certain he could obtain the recognition of two divine columns. The first was the Empress Earth Dao Tree and the second was the Dragon Emperor. Being able to accomplish that feat with two ancient Fey columns was no trifling matter!</p>
<p>At the Ancient Fey Edifice, Ran Yu was clearly the best!</p>
<p>Chapter 814: Phoenix Firmiana State</p>
<p>Not long after Ran Yu sat down before the Dragon Emperor divine column, another person stood up from the ancient Fey column he was at, before walking towards the Kun Peng ancient Fey column that Lie Ya was at!</p>
<p>Lie Ya's pupils immediately constricted because it was Gu Luo!</p>
<p>Gu Luo was a person with a glum personality and kept a lower profile than Ran Yu.</p>
<p>His strength was exceptional, and was nearly equal to Ran Yu. Yet, he did not attract the attention of anyone amongst the crowd.</p>
<p>Gu Luo was a person who was accustomed to even hiding his facial features in his gray garb. Gray cloth wrapped around his head, leaving only a pair of eyes to be seen. Only one of his eyes remained open, but its pupil was gray in color. The other eye was tightly closed, and on it was a hideous scar.</p>
<p>When warriors attained a cultivation realm of his level, a tiny scar like this could be completely healed. Even warriors of lower levels could use elixirs that aided the growth of bodily tissue to fade a scar away.</p>
<p>However, Gu Luo had appeared to have deliberately left the scar behind.</p>
<p>Although they were all Heaven Fire Hall disciples, no one was on close terms of Gu Luo. He was a loner partly because no one would rush to have a chat with him with him maintaining an expression and a gaze that resembled a dead man's.</p>
<p>"Gu Luo has been silent, but from the looks of it, he will be gaining the recognition of two divine columns!" Lie Ya thought.</p>
<p>Ran Yu had not spent much time meditating in front of the divine column, so when he saw this scene, there was a drastic change in his expression with a gloomy shade concealing his learned and refined face.</p>
<p>Gu Luo!</p>
<p>Before the beginning of the Luo Divine Hall trials, Gu Luo had left the Fire Cloud State and immersed himself in experiential training for a decade. After he returned, he was only left with one eye, and the aura he emanated was something Ran Yu could not understand.</p>
<p>Back in the list posted at the Fire Cloud State's main mountain, Ran Yu may have had an apparent slight advantage according to his ranking which was above Gu Luo, but ever since Gu Luo returned, Ran Yu had never truly fought him before.</p>
<p>Other than Tian Shi, Gu Luo was Ran Yu's biggest foe!</p>
<p>As for the others...Ran Yu disparaged them.</p>
<p>The Xushui Heaven Fey were naturally filled with pride. Other people of average birth was not worthy of being remembered.</p>
<p>"Gu Luo is also doing two divine columns."</p>
<p>"Compared to the two freaks of nature, the gap between us are too far apart."</p>
<p>Many people private discussed, while Luo Fengling ground her teeth. Just the Fire Cloud State alone made her feel immense pressure.</p>
<p>The starry skies in the Ancient Fey Edifice were unmoving, giving it no sense of time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Cang Mang opened his eyes and bellowed, "A day's time is up!"</p>
<p>Immediately, all the cultivators hung different expressions on their faces. Some look flustered, while others pondered in silence. Only Ran Yu appeared indifferent. As for Gu Luo, his only gray eye still looked as lifeless as before, preventing anyone from telling what he was thinking.</p>
<p>"Time's up!" Cang Mang shouted once again, "It's time to stop."</p>
<p>However, there were still a few cultivators who stood before their divine columns as though they were reluctant to part with them.</p>
<p>This was only normal expected human behavior, but a few more seconds would not have changed anything. There were always people unwilling to accept their failures.</p>
<p>At this moment, an unfamiliar voice interjected, "If you can't obtain the recognition in a day, it would still be useless to loiter around here for a few more moments."</p>
<p>Ran Yu realized something as he turned towards the voice. Immediately, his expression turned ugly, "It's you!"</p>
<p>Gu Luo looked at the person who came in silence.</p>
<p>All the other cultivators were astounded. They did not sense anything before the sudden booming of the voice.</p>
<p>"It's the Phoenix Firmiana State's Luo Tian!" Bai Chen whispered in alarm.</p>
<p>The man who came was thin in built and his hair was combed high up. He was barefooted and barehanded, while a long tail whipped around behind him.</p>
<p>"Luo Tian?" Luo Fengling found the name familiar.</p>
<p>"Luo Tian is the strongest amongst the Phoenix Firmiana State's younger generation. Although he is slightly less famous than Tian Shi, he is much stronger than us."</p>
<p>There was competition amongst the cultivators in the Fire Cloud State, and similarly, the Fire Cloud State and the Phoenix Firmiana State had competed against each other for tens of thousands of years. The contention between the two states was in no way weaker than the competition between the cultivators.</p>
<p>"Does the Fire Cloud State lack people for the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials? Why are there a few kids that should still be sucking on tits here?" Luo Tian said when he scanned the crowd. The kids he were referring to were naturally Luo Fengling, Bai Chen and Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Luo Tian only swept his eyes past Yi Yun and company before finally stopping at Ran Yu and Gu Luo. "Only the two of you can barely qualify."</p>
<p>"Preposterous!" Ran Yu coldly grunted. "What high sounding statements, that's good. Since you are now here, we will let you understand the eminence of the Fire Cloud State."</p>
<p>Ran Yu was very confident of himself, and his confidence stemmed from himself. He did not care about the other Fire Cloud State disciples; furthermore, the ancient Fey columns he had gained insight from were the Dragon Emperor and the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine columns!</p>
<p>Any one of these two divine columns was not easy. The Empress Earth Dao Tree was especially the foundation of his confidence.</p>
<p>"Sure, I want to see how able all of you are."</p>
<p>Luo Tian wrapped his arms across his chest and said teasingly.</p>
<p>At this moment, about a dozen more people entered, they were all cultivators from the Phoenix Firmiana State.</p>
<p>They stood behind Luo Tian, and looked at the Fire Cloud State's cultivators with interest, there presence causing the atmosphere to turn rigid.</p>
<p>Ran Yu scanned the people from the Phoenix Firmiana State. Just from their cultivation levels, they were probably senior disciples that had cultivated for about sixty years or more.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan's factional power was not wide enough. He could only nominate a few young disciples in the Fire Cloud State, but he did not enjoy such prestige in the other states.</p>
<p>Back when the entire Luo clan was embroiled in a war, the Phoenix Firmiana State had conserved a portion of its strength because of its remote location. Now, with them sending out their disciples, they were all senior disciples of the Phoenix Firmiana State.</p>
<p>Looking at the confident looks of these Phoenix Firmiana State cultivators, it was clear that they had come prepared. Ran Yu drew a deep breath of air as a beam flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Even if all of you are filled with confidence, I will still trample you beneath my feet!</p>
<p>With the Phoenix Firmiana State's cultivators here, the few cultivators sitting in front of the divine columns also naturally stood up.</p>
<p>Quite a number of them looked uneasy, while Luo Fengling's delicate face had a look of resolve.</p>
<p>She noticed that Yi Yun had also just stood up. He patted his sleeves lightly, his eyes the same as before.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, how was it?" Bai Chen leaned over to ask. He was not much older than Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"It was alright," Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>"Did you gain the recognition of the Seven-colored Phoenix?" Bai Chen asked again. It was actually just a polite question as he did not believe Yi Yun would obtain the recognition.</p>
<p>"Yea, gained it." Yi Yun said with a nod.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's answer, Luo Fengling and Bai Chen were stunned.</p>
<p>Lie Ya and company also heard their conversation.</p>
<p>What? Yi Yun had first taken a look at the Seven-colored Phoenix before going to the Empress Earth Dao Tree and then went to the Extreme Yang Illumination before finally giving up to return to the Seven-colored Phoenix, as though he was at a market shopping for goods. Now, he actually said he obtained the recognition of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column?</p>
<p>What a joke. Could this kid actually be unsure of what it meant to gain the divine column's recognition? If he was just putting on a false front, he would be exposed very quickly.</p>
<p>"Haha, that's good." Bai Chen forced a smile, but felt unease.</p>
<p>Are you serious!?</p>
<p>Chapter 815: Entering Motion</p>
<p>Bai Chen had actually failed. He had asked Yi Yun only to find a companion in misery. If Yi Yun was worse than him, he could at least have someone line the bottom with him to stabilize his mind. Yet, Yi Yun said that he had gained the recognition of a divine column?</p>
<p>From the looks of Luo Fengling, she had just barely obtained recognition from the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column. Was he the only one amongst the rookies who failed? Or could it be that Yi Yun was just bluffing?</p>
<p>"Alright, enough nonsense! The Phoenix Firmiana State's cultivators, wait by the side. It will soon be your turn. The Fire Cloud State's cultivators, stand over here!" Cang Mang was indifferent towards the conflict between the disciples. To survive in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, cutthroat competition was essential. If not, the Luo clan would not have survived so long.</p>
<p>"Open!" Cang Mang stamped the ground with a foot as the large python around him opened its mouth and spat out its scarlet tongue.</p>
<p>There were shimmering runes on the snake's tongue which were formed from energy. It was unknown if Cang Mang had placed it in the python's mouth beforehand or if it was actually condensed by the python. The runes looked extremely complex, dazzling anyone who took a few more looks.</p>
<p>"The opening of the ancient twelve Fey God divine columns requires a special rune, just like a key."</p>
<p>The twelve Fey divine columns were constructed by the Luo clan's mighty figures and were meant for their progeny to gain insights from. Naturally, there were means of protecting them.</p>
<p>As Cang Mang spoke, the python's tongue stabbed forward like lightning, immediately causing the runes to float into the sky and explode!</p>
<p>Buzz! A sound that could not be traced was heard as it instantly echoed in the minds of everyone.</p>
<p>At this moment, a layer of hazy light suddenly fell from the Ancient Fey Edifice's starry sky. Immediately, it enveloped a Fire Cloud State cultivator within it.</p>
<p>This Fire Cloud State disciple did not panic nor dodge. He just looked somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a Fey divine column suddenly experienced some changes.</p>
<p>It was the Kun Peng divine column. The engraved Kung Peng on it suddenly seemed to come alive. One of its claws began to slowly lift.</p>
<p>The disciple looked on nervously with bated breath.</p>
<p>The amount of recognition given by the twelve Fey divine columns depended on the extent to which the Luo clan disciples managed to awaken the ancient Fey God.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Kun Peng lifted another claw causing the disciple to look excited. However, just as the claw was lifted halfway, it stopped before the Kun Peng appeared to return to its slumber. This Fire Cloud State disciple's talent was insufficient to wake it up.</p>
<p>The pillar of light on the Fire Cloud State's disciple slowly turned to a pale white before disappearing.</p>
<p>"Rating: Entering Motion!" Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>The disciple's face turned gloomy because he was very disappointed.</p>
<p>It was only Entering Motion...His goal was to gain the recognition rating of "Eye Opening". To reach the rating of Eye Opening, it needed the Kung Peng to open its eyes.</p>
<p>However, his talent, perception, physique and nomological insights, when all added up, was only enough to make the Kun Peng moves its claws. It was still a distance away from making it open its eyes.</p>
<p>And the most basic rating of Entering Motion was insufficient for him to obtain any treasures from the Ancient Fey Edifice nor open the Kun Peng ancient Fey column's door.</p>
<p>Yi Yun asked, "How is the rating divided?"</p>
<p>"Just gaining the least bit of recognition is the Entering Motion rating. It also means causing the ancient Fey that was condensed out of laws to move slightly. Above it, there is Eye Opening, Hibernation Awakening, Awakening, etc!"</p>
<p>"This senior brother made the Kun Peng move a bit, but its eyes did not open to glance at him, so this is the lowest bit of recognition." Luo Fengling whispered to him.</p>
<p>Bai Chen had an ugly expression by the side. He wasn't even able to gain the lowest amount of recognition.</p>
<p>As pillars of light appeared on the Fire Cloud State disciples, those who were enveloped by the light immediately tensed up.</p>
<p>They only knew if they had gained the recognition of their respective Fey divine column, but was unsure of the extent of the recognition.</p>
<p>After the first Fire Cloud State disciple, three others were given ratings of Entering Motion.</p>
<p>Amongst the cultivators, it was most common to obtain the Entering Motion rating.</p>
<p>And one of those who obtained Entering Motion was Lie Ya.</p>
<p>When Cang Mang announced the result, Lie Ya's expression turned extremely glum.</p>
<p>In fact, he had long learned about the situation with the twelve Fey divine columns from his family clan. Furthermore, he had already chosen the Kun Peng divine column beforehand as a target to pass the test.</p>
<p>He originally believed that after a long preparation, he could at least reach the rating of Eye Opening.</p>
<p>The Entering Motion rating was just ordinary and most critically, it had no rewards.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Eye Opening rating pushed one to the ranks of excellence, allowing them to obtain some resources.</p>
<p>Lie Ya thought highly of himself, so although he never wanted to compete with freaks like Ran Yu, Gu Luo or even Tian Shi and Luo Tian, he believed that he was at least stronger than the other Fire Cloud State disciples. But the final outcome was greatly disappointing.</p>
<p>He took a sidelong glance at Yi Yun. Noticing how most people looked apprehensive unlike Yi Yun, who appeared as though he was an immortal touring the heavens, Lie Ya immediately turned infuriated. This kid was still pretending to posture, was he courting death?</p>
<p>Lie Ya had only attained Entering Motion, and for a person like Yi Yun, he did not believe Yi Yun could obtain any recognition. It was as though he was shopping at a market, so how could he have gained any recognition?</p>
<p>However, what if Yi Yun really had some dog-shit luck and as Yi Yun said, he had already obtained the recognition. Then wouldn't Yi Yun's results be the same as his!?</p>
<p>Once recognition was obtained, it was Entering Motion. There was no difference between two Entering Motion ratings.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Bai Chen." Luo Fengling suddenly said with a change in expression.</p>
<p>Bai Chen had suddenly been enveloped by a pillar of light and in it, his face turned slightly blue as he clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>The Seven-colored Phoenix divine column did not react...and soon, the pillar of light on Bai Chen's body disappeared.</p>
<p>At the moment he was enveloped by the pillar of light, he had become the focus of attention, but the feeling of being focused on by everyone was a torture that felt like years.</p>
<p>"Bai Chen, no rating! Did not obtain any recognition!" Cang Mang glanced at him and said mercilessly.</p>
<p>Bai Chen's body quivered as his face turned paler. His trembling lips was unable to utter a word.</p>
<p>Bai Chen was not the first person who had failed to obtain any recognition. There was another Fire Cloud State disciple who had also failed to obtain any recognition.</p>
<p>"Hahaha, Ran Yu, is this what you want me to see, the eminence of the Fire Cloud State disciples? Four Entering Motion and two that did not even gain any recognition. Such a result is indeed wonderful. It has never been seen before!" Luo Tian scoffed brazenly.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State disciples also laughed and began their derision, causing the expressions on the Fire Cloud State's disciples to change.</p>
<p>Lie Ya also clenched his fists because he was one of the few who was being mocked!</p>
<p>He was categorized into a group along with Bai Chen and Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Actually, Entering Motion was not said to be too bad. Even amongst the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples, a majority of them would only obtain Entering Motion. However, from the smug looks of the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples, they clearly did not believe that there would be any disciple who failed to gain recognition. Such a comparison led to the Fire Cloud State having two disciples who failed to gain any recognition. In a while, there might be the addition of Yi Yun, making it three. The difference would appear extremely jarring.</p>
<p>"Luo Tian, don't feel so smug too soon." The poor performance of the Fire Cloud State disciples was nothing of concern to Ran Yu. He only cared about his own rating and if it was enough to shut Luo Tian's savage gap.</p>
<p>Chapter 816: Hibernation Awakening</p>
<p>"You seem pretty confident this time," said Luo Tian as his smile disappeared. "Indeed, these ordinary disciples don't matter at all. At the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials, they are not participants at all, but only there to make up the numbers. The true participants are people like us. Ran Yu, I wish you would not disappoint me..."</p>
<p>Before he finished his words, a pillar of light fell from the sky, enveloping Ran Yu's body!</p>
<p>Luo Tian stopped speaking as he revealed a faint smile. "Let's see if you have what it takes to back your words."</p>
<p>Luo Tian's words incensed the other ordinary cultivators, but with Ran Yu's evaluation beginning, they ignored Luo Tian.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was a person with top-tier strength amongst all the Fire Cloud State disciples present. If he failed, Luo Tian and the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples would definitely laugh their heads off.</p>
<p>However, Ran Yu, who was cloaked in the pillar of light, had calm eyes and appeared poised, giving off a confident demeanor.</p>
<p>Even the arrogant Luo Tian did not speak. Although he still hung a faint smile on his lips, he had already stopped giving a look of contempt.</p>
<p>For Ran Yu to dare make such a claim, it was definitely not without reason. With his personality, unless he was extremely certain, he would definitely not have made such a bold claim. Ran Yu was an extremely prideful person, a person who did not tolerate failure from himself.</p>
<p>As the pillar of light emitted a faint glow, Ran Yu stood silently within.</p>
<p>"It's the Dragon Emperor divine column!" All the cultivators immediately noticed a divine column turn abnormal.</p>
<p>The Dragon Emperor divine column had been attempted by a previous Fire Cloud State disciple. He had received a reaction, but it was extremely weak.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Dragon Emperor divine column that appeared to be deep in slumber immediately roused its scales when it was Ran Yu's turn.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the rating would still be at Entering Motion, but despite being in the same state, the previous cultivator had only managed to make the Dragon Emperor move its claws slightly. In comparison, Ran Yu was able to rouse all the scales on the Dragon Emperor to stand up, making the contrast obvious.</p>
<p>"This difference..." The particular Fire Cloud State disciple who had attempted the same divine column turned pale as he silently shook his head.</p>
<p>More transformations happened as the Dragon Emperor's head shook as its pair of eyes suddenly opened!</p>
<p>The pair of eyes was as bright as the stars. Its gaze looked indifferent, as though the people in front of it were just ants. For a powerful ancient life that was born at the beginning of time — even if it was just a glimmer of its grace — these warriors were like specks of dust.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breaths and focused. Dragon Emperor, Eye Opening!</p>
<p>This was reaching the second rating of Eye Opening!</p>
<p>He was the first person amongst the Fire Cloud State disciples to obtain the rating of Eye Opening!</p>
<p>The Dragon Emperor's star-like eyes stared intently at Ran Yu, who was immersed in the pillar of light. It was as though this minute life had given it the slightest cause of attention. One of its claws suddenly raised up before it clasped the divine column. Its body seemed like it was about to move.</p>
<p>"Could it be..."</p>
<p>Lie Ya's expression looked unsettled. If the Dragon Emperor moved its entire body, that would mean Ran Yu had attained the third rating, Hibernation Awakening. The difference between him and Ran Yu would be even greater...</p>
<p>Above Eye Opening, there was Hibernation Awakening. It meant making a dormant ancient Fey, who had been hibernating for billions of years, move.</p>
<p>To make an ancient Fey God open its eyes to take a look at an ant-like person meant that this ant was a stronger ant. If the ant made the ancient Fey move and hold its head up to size the ant up properly, that meant the ant was an outstanding one!</p>
<p>The ancient Fey represented the laws of Chaos, the most Origins of energy. The more they belittled people, the more people felt awed by the Great Dao increased their yearning for it.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State cultivators had mixed looks. Could this Ran Yu really attain Hibernation Awakening!?</p>
<p>Even Cang Mang, who did not show any interest about what recognition the cultivators obtained, raised his eyes to look at Ran Yu. If he really obtained the Hibernation Awakening rating, Ran Yu was a person worthy of attention...</p>
<p>"Boom!" The pillar of light that enveloped Ran Yu suddenly became extremely bright, but it was only an instant before the burst of light disappeared.</p>
<p>Everyone immediately looked towards the Dragon Emperor divine column. All the visions they had seen had already disappeared.</p>
<p>"Rating: Eye Opening!" Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Luo Tian immediately revealed a schadenfreudian expression.</p>
<p>"After all this choosing, it was only the Dragon Emperor. Even if you obtain the Eye Opening rating, it is also nothing impressive." Luo Tian said as he shook his head.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State cultivators were incensed. By saying that Eye Opening was nothing impressive, wasn't that implying that they who had received Entering Motion were trash?</p>
<p>Entering Motion could be ignored, but the difficulty of Eye Opening was not low at all. Luo Tian was being too arrogant!</p>
<p>Ran Yu chuckled, "Oh? I wonder if the Empress Earth Dao Tree would make you, Luo Tian, see it in a different light?"</p>
<p>Luo Tian's pupils immediately constricted.</p>
<p>The cultivators also noticed that the pillar of light enveloping Ran Yu only changed in intensity but did not disappear. And at this moment, another divine column began to experience changes!</p>
<p>It was the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State disciples immediately recalled that Ran Yu had attempted to gain the recognition of two divine columns!</p>
<p>The Dragon Emperor divine column had a rating of Eye Opening, but it was only one. Next, there was the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree had an extensive magnificence to its aura. People could only feel a heavy feeling emanate the surroundings and following that, an azure-colored gas appeared from Ran Yu's pillar of light.</p>
<p>This azure gas contained extremely profound Great Dao, as well as extremely vigorous life energy.</p>
<p>Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree was too esoteric. As people looked at the azure-colored gas, no one could decipher what recognition rating this was.</p>
<p>As the azure gas turned increasingly rich, as though it was about to condense into something, it slowly dissipated moments later.</p>
<p>The ancient Fey column was restored to its calm state.</p>
<p>At this moment, Cang Mang's voice boomed, "Rating, Entering Motion!"</p>
<p>Only Entering Motion!</p>
<p>Ran Yu frowned and was somewhat disappointed. The Empress Earth Dao Tree was a manifestation of the 3000 Great Dao laws. It was too terrifying and complicated. Trying to gain its recognition was too, too difficult!</p>
<p>Luo Tian's brows moved. It was not surprising to obtain Entering Motion. If the Empress Earth Dao Tree's Dao Leaves condensed Dao Eyes, that would be terrifying. Luo Tian knew that even if it came to him, he was still very far from that step. It could be said that in the 196 states of the Luo clan, such a genius was nearly impossible to find. How could gaining insight into 3000 Great Dao be easy?</p>
<p>Having obtained Entering Motion for the Empress Earth Dao Tree and simultaneously obtain Eye Opening for the Dragon Emperor, it meant that Ran Yu's strength was indeed good.</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Tian and the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples relatively silent, the Fire Cloud State disciples also heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Although Ran Yu's achievements made them feel somewhat jealous, they felt great being able to vent their anger once the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples had their mouths gagged.</p>
<p>The shock brought about by Ran Yu did not dissipate immediately as the next pillar of light enveloped Gu Luo!</p>
<p>"Right, Gu Luo also wanted to gain the recognition of two divine columns!"</p>
<p>"Gu Luo..." Phoenix Firmiana State's Luo Tian looked at Gu Luo with a slight daze.</p>
<p>Amongst the Fire Cloud State's younger generation, Tian Shi, Ran Yu and Gu Luo were the leaders of the pack. The person that was hardest to see through was Gu Luo.</p>
<p>Gu Luo was like a shadow that lived in the dark shadows, with no one being able to notice him usually.</p>
<p>Gu Luo walked straight into a pillar of light and was illuminated by it.</p>
<p>However, under the wrapping of the gray cloth, no one could see Gu Luo's mouth move. His voice seemed to directly come out of his head. It sounded dreary and buzzed in one's ears.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>On the Kun Peng divine column, the Kun Peng suddenly rolled around in the sea of clouds. Half its body flew out of the divine column and formed a phantom image in the sky, overlooking Gu Luo!</p>
<p>Next, the Kun Peng opened both its eyes!</p>
<p>It eyes were open! Having the eyes open immediately was a scene that stunned both the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State's disciples.</p>
<p>The motionless Gu Luo formed a contrast with the moving Kun Peng that was like an irresistible force. It was extremely shocking!</p>
<p>"Xiao!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the ancient Kun Peng let out a shrill as it began to flap its wings, causing a violent wind to rise up. It made the Luo clan disciples present have trouble finding their footing. They nearly did not react in time.</p>
<p>"Could this be..." Someone said in utter surprise, "Hib...Hibernation Awakening!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's pupils immediately constricted to the size of a needle tip.</p>
<p>Gu Luo, who was from the Fire Cloud State just like him, had returned ten years after an experiential training outside the Fire Cloud State, but now he had managed to stir the Kun Peng Fey God on the ancient Fey column, completing Hibernation Awakening!</p>
<p>Chapter 817: Solitary Nothingness</p>
<p>Luo Tian wrapped his arms across his chest as a coldness revealed in the way he looked at Gu Luo. He slowly said, "Gu Luo, you are truly one that never rains but when it rains, it pours."</p>
<p>The other Luo clan disciples were also secretly horrified. For Luo Tian to say that, it was undoubtedly Hibernation Awakening.</p>
<p>From Entering Motion to Eye Opening, and from Eye Opening to Hibernation Awakening, he had done it in one fell swoop. Gu Luo had quietly obtained such a high level of recognition!</p>
<p>Especially for Lie Ya, his expression changed greatly as he clenched his teeth tightly. It was the same Kun Peng divine column, but Gu Luo had only spent half the time he spent in front of the Kun Peng divine column!</p>
<p>However, the difference in their recognition was like night and day.</p>
<p>"Can the difference be so big...?" Lie Ya found it hard to accept the truth.</p>
<p>"He can actually obtain the recognition of Hibernation Awakening." Ran Yu's eyes were no longer calm.</p>
<p>On the cultivators' name list, his ranking was higher than Gu Luo, and although Ran Yu had been vigilant against Gu Luo, his true goal was Tian Shi!</p>
<p>Especially with Tian Shi being taken away in advance this time, although Ran Yu still appeared calm on the surface, he was actually feeling indignant!</p>
<p>Ran Yu wanted to prove that even if he lacked the special treatment of Tian Shi of being nurtured with dedicated care, he would still not be any inferior with existing resources.</p>
<p>But now, Gu Luo had obtained the Hibernation Awakening rating...</p>
<p>Under the different gazes of everyone, Gu Luo remained silent. He stood in his spot motionless without even blinking his eyes. He gave an aura of death like he was a walking zombie.</p>
<p>Even the strong wings conjured by the ancient Kun Peng did not make Gu Luo react.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the ancient Kun Peng's phantom image exploded and dispersed.</p>
<p>The Kun Peng divine column returned to normal, as though everything that had happened was just a mass hallucination.</p>
<p>"Rating, Hibernation Awakening!" Cang Mang's voice resounded.</p>
<p>Cang Mang glanced intently at Gu Luo. However, the pillar of light on Gu Luo's body did not disappear.</p>
<p>Two people in a row...</p>
<p>"There is another divine column. What is it?" The cultivators hurriedly looked over.</p>
<p>"It's the Solitary Nothingness divine column! Gu Luo chose the Solitary Nothingness divine column first before the Kun Peng divine column. I wonder what rating he will receive this time!" A sharp-eyed person shouted.</p>
<p>The ninth Fey God, Solitary Nothingness, was an endless void itself. It was the tomb of Great Worlds, and was represented dead silence.</p>
<p>Above the Solitary Nothingness divine column was just blankness. It was no wonder no one noticed anything at a glance. The changes it produced were invisible ripples that radiated throughout its surroundings.</p>
<p>As the ripples swept past, everyone's eyes went into a blur, as though they were being swallowed into Solitary Nothingness' body. It was as though they had fallen into infinity, a world with nothing. This feeling was just instantaneous, but a few cultivators with a lower cultivation level were left in a trance that took them some time to recover from.</p>
<p>"The feeling just now felt like death. This Solitary Nothingness Fey God is so strange!" Bai Chen was one of them. His entire body quivered as cold sweat oozed out his forehead. The boundary of life and death was too horrible. It was definitely not a good feeling to experience the coming of death.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Solitary Nothingness divine column. The aura from before was something even the Death Soulwood could not absorb. However, with the Death Soulwood and the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun was far from being seriously affected by it.</p>
<p>He looked thoughtfully at Gu Luo and wondered what species Gu Luo was and what cultivation technique he cultivated. However, from his appearance, he must be somehow related to the Solitary Nothingness divine column, so it was no wonder he could obtain the Solitary Nothingness divine column's recognition.</p>
<p>The difficulty of Solitary Nothingness and the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column's recognition was nearly equal.</p>
<p>It was just unknown what rating Gu Luo would obtain from the Solitary Nothingness divine column...</p>
<p>"Rating, Entering Motion!" Cang Mang announced, but after that, he looked at Gu Luo with an appreciating gaze.</p>
<p>That ripple from before was the Solitary Nothingness divine column's Entering Motion?</p>
<p>Kun Peng divine column, Hibernation Awakening! Solitary Nothingness divine column, Entering Motion!</p>
<p>"This rating!" The cultivators, including the Phoenix Firmiana State's cultivators, were started as they shook their heads.</p>
<p>There was really no way to compare...</p>
<p>Ran Yu's delicate face was already extremely sullen.</p>
<p>"Pa! Pa!"</p>
<p>Luo Tian began clapping. Each clap from this applause felt as though it was smacking Ran Yu heavily in the face.</p>
<p>"Impressive, truly impressive!" Luo Tian said from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>"Ran Yu, so this is the reason why you told me not to laugh too early." Luo Tian looked at Ran Yu and said with a smirk.</p>
<p>The corner of Ran Yu's eyes immediately twitched. Luo Tian was rubbing salt into his wounds.</p>
<p>"Luo Tian, your Phoenix Firmiana State should be convinced this time, right!?" A female disciple from the Fire Cloud State said to vent her anger.</p>
<p>Gu Luo's rating was extremely high, while Ran Yu was just slightly inferior to him. Their performance could be said to be absolutely brilliant. Seeing the Phoenix Firmiana State's people completely silent, the Fire Cloud State disciples felt they could lift their heads high.</p>
<p>"Gu Luo, it was indeed my mistake to think lowly of you." Hearing Luo Tian's admission, the female disciple from the Fire Cloud State immediately revealed a smile. But before she said anything, she saw the tail behind Luo Tian twitch. And once again, his face revealed an arrogant look.</p>
<p>"However, it's just a Hibernation Awakening and an Entering Motion. That's nothing when it comes to me. If you received Eye Opening from the Solitary Nothingness divine column, I would be impressed. But now, all you got from the Solitary Nothingness divine column was Entering Motion. Trying to use Hibernation Awakening from the Kun Peng divine column to beat me is impossible."</p>
<p>Luo Tian's words made everyone shocked.</p>
<p>Ran Yu's face turned ugly as he coldly said, "What arrogance!"</p>
<p>If Gu Luo was nothing, wasn't he completely unacceptable?</p>
<p>"I don't mind all of you staying for another day to see my rating before leaving." Luo Tian said.</p>
<p>A strange glint appeared in Ran Yu's eyes. What Luo Tian said was him having true confidence. If his rating was lower than Gu Luo, he would completely lose all face.</p>
<p>The other Fire Cloud State disciples also understood this point and were amazed. Ran Yu and Gu Luo's rating was already miles above others, but Luo Tian was even stronger than them?</p>
<p>"Could it be gaining the recognition of three divine columns?" A Fire Cloud State disciple said.</p>
<p>However, before he finished his sentence, he shook his head, thinking it was rather unlikely.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State disciples only had one day to obtain the recognition just like them.</p>
<p>Cogitating two divine column meant half a day's time each. If there were three columns, that meant a third of a day. The difficulty was extraordinary.</p>
<p>With the current situation, nearly no one paid any attention to the remaining evaluations, but it was still carrying on. Amidst the crowd, a pillar of light lit up a person's body.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi."</p>
<p>Only Luo Fengling and a few people around her quickly realized that the person enveloped by the pillar of light was Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Others also noticed it, but quickly turned their gazes away.</p>
<p>With Ran Yu and Gu Luo before him, who would pay any attention to Yi Yun's recognition rating?</p>
<p>Now, everyone was guessing at Luo Tian's possible feats.</p>
<p>Chapter 818: Yi Yun's Rating</p>
<p>"I wonder if Junior Brother Yi Yun really passed." Bai Chen was actually the person most concerned about Yi Yun. As a new disciple, Bai Chen truly wished that Yi Yun failed the test, just like him.</p>
<p>Lie Ya also noticed Yi Yun, but did not pay him much attention. Ran Yu and Gu Luo's rating had given quite a setback to Lie Ya, so he was feeling disheartened.</p>
<p>He did not look forward to Yi Yun making a fool of himself at all.</p>
<p>He was not in the mood.</p>
<p>As for whether Yi Yun's failure to gain any recognition would cause the Fire Cloud State to be ridiculed by the Phoenix Firmiana State, Lie Ya could not be bothered.</p>
<p>At this moment, he heard Luo Fengling say, "The Seven-colored Phoenix is moving."</p>
<p>Lie Ya was surprised and hurriedly turned over.</p>
<p>It moved?</p>
<p>A warrior's eyesight was very good, so Lie Ya instantly saw the Seven-colored Phoenix's tail feathers and one claw tremble slightly.</p>
<p>Lie Ya's face sunk. Be it a tremble or a flap, as long as there was any motion from the Seven-colored Phoenix, it meant Entering Motion!</p>
<p>"He actually managed to gain its recognition! Forget it, it's just luck, why do I need to care about him?"</p>
<p>Lie Ya gave Yi Yun a displeased glance. This punk had truly gotten dog-shit luck! It was shameful for him to share the same rating as Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Bai Chen also sighed and did not feel good. Yi Yun had truly passed!</p>
<p>"Rating, Entering Motion." Cang Mang announced.</p>
<p>Bai Chen looked at Yi Yun and said with a bit of bitterness, "Junior Brother Yi Yun, congratulations."</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not speak. In fact, making the Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column move was not easy for him.</p>
<p>The other cultivators who had obtained the recognition from the Seven-colored Phoenix did it through fire-elemental laws. However, Yi Yun's fire-elemental laws was born out of pure Yang laws. Hence, it was not something great. He had to use a bit of Sword Intent to aid him — the Sword Intent from the Pure Yang Sword Palace.</p>
<p>When he stood in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column for the first time, Yi Yun knew that the Seven-colored Phoenix would resonate with the Pure Yang Sword Palace's Sword Intent. However, the source of the resonance was the Dao the carver of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column had. He had used a sword to carve the ancient Fey column, giving the ancient Fey column a bit of Sword Intent.</p>
<p>This was Yi Yun failing to use a Great Dao, but in fact, a trick.</p>
<p>Hence, regardless how ingenious the Pure Yang Sword Palace's Sword Intent was, the amount of recognition gained by the pure Yang Sword Intent was not much in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column. After all, the Seven-colored Phoenix was born out of Chaos, and not a companion of Sword Intent.</p>
<p>Hence, Sword Intent combined with fire-elemental laws only allowed him to attain Entering Motion. It was only the basic recognition, but for this, Yi Yun was very satisfied.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, your luck sure is good." Someone said sourly. It was as though they would feel better if they concluded that Yi Yun's Entering Motion was a result of luck.</p>
<p>Bai Chen sighed and said, "Luck is also a form of strength. Junior Brother Yi, you sure are good. Unfortunately, I lack that bit of luck. If I were to have just a bit more..."</p>
<p>Bai Chen said indignantly, as though he felt bitter resentment.</p>
<p>"There was indeed a bit of luck in this." Yi Yun smiled. It was true that there was a bit of luck. After all, he spent only a couple of hours in front of the Seven-colored Phoenix ancient Fey column, much shorter than others.</p>
<p>"At least you know yourself." When Lie Ya heard Yi Yun's dialogue with Bai Chen, he cursed in his heart.</p>
<p>"Your luck will not last forever." Lie Ya coldly said before turning his gaze away. Taking another glance at Yi Yun would only upset him.</p>
<p>But at this moment, he suddenly heard Luo Fengling's puzzled voice say, "Why is the pillar of light still on Junior Brother Yi Yun's body?"</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Lie Ya turned his head back right immediately after he turned his head away.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun still being enveloped by the pillar of light, Lie Ya was unable to come to a quick realization. What was going on?</p>
<p>The others had yet to notice this. Only Lie Ya, Luo Fengling, and Bai Chen were staring intently at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At this moment, a divine column had a reaction.</p>
<p>"There's a sound."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling also stared widely with her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Phew...a gentle breeze suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State were also alarmed by this. They hurriedly looked over and soon, everyone noticed the strange phenomena from Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>Who was this punk? Wasn't it just announced that he had gained a divine column's recognition?</p>
<p>Although the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples did not pay Yi Yun any attention, they had heard Cang Mang's announcement.</p>
<p>It was only Entering Motion, so there was nothing to care about.</p>
<p>However, why was there a commotion from a person who had obtained recognition?</p>
<p>"A divine column is moving!" Someone suddenly exclaimed as everyone looked over.</p>
<p>It's...the Empress Earth Dao Tree!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the Fire Cloud State disciples suddenly recalled that Yi Yun had stood in front of the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column for a period of time. Of course, everyone thought that he was being overambitious. Besides, he had left rather quickly.</p>
<p>Could it be...</p>
<p>Motion meant Entering Motion!</p>
<p>That meant that Yi Yun had obtained the recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree?</p>
<p>This was something unbelievable!</p>
<p>If obtaining the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column's recognition was luck, could it be the same for the Empress Earth Dao Tree?</p>
<p>Then wouldn't this luck be preposterous!?</p>
<p>Rustle!</p>
<p>A sound suddenly rang.</p>
<p>In a trance, everyone felt like they were standing beneath a towering tree. Surrounding them was the sound produced by the rustling of the leaves.</p>
<p>Under this large tree, everyone was extremely minute, like ants or dust.</p>
<p>People looked up and saw the lush foliage on the tree. As they faced the sun, their Dao patterns seemed to form eyes as they blinked.</p>
<p>"This is..."</p>
<p>"Eye Opening? The Empress Earth Dao Tree has opened its eyes???"</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State disciples were extremely shocked.</p>
<p>People who previously thought that Yi Yun had gotten lucky were stunned. The Empress Earth Dao Tree's Eye Opening? This was a result from Yi Yun?</p>
<p>If it was Entering Motion, they could use luck to explain, mainly to console themselves. But for Eye Opening, was this something that could be attained with luck?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree was much stronger than the ancient Fey columns like the Seven-colored Phoenix, Dragon Emperor or Kun Peng. To obtain its recognition was extremely difficult. Even the powerful Gu Luo only obtained the rating of Entering Motion in front of the Solitary Nothingness divine column, a column about the same level as the Empress Earth Dao Tree.</p>
<p>But instead, Yi Yun had Entering Motion for the Seven-colored Phoenix, but Eye Opening for the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>This result might appear similar to Ran Yu, but in fact, it was much better than Ran Yu!</p>
<p>Ran Yu's breathing stagnated as he looked at Yi Yun. Previously, he had treated Yi Yun as a sycophant that had gained Prince Pingnan's support, a shameless puny person that squeezed his brother from his spot. But who knew...</p>
<p>He could forget about Gu Luo, but even Yi Yun was about the same as him!</p>
<p>"The Seven-colored Phoenix's rating Yi Yun obtained was him barely scraping through. But for the Empress Earth Dao Tree, is he using some treasure to cheat? I don't believe it. He's just a new disciple, how can he have such a rating?" A female disciple from the Fire Cloud State said with a resenting tone. She was an admirer of Ran Yu, so she could not help but speak out when she heard the surrounding people discuss how Yi Yun's rating was better than Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Everyone did not believe her so-called "cheating" because in front of the twelve Fey divine columns, other than one's grasp of laws, no other means was effective.</p>
<p>At this moment, something suddenly floated down from the top of the pillar of light where Yi Yun was at.</p>
<p>At first, these people could not see it clearly, but slowly, they managed to discern what had floated down.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary leaf.</p>
<p>There was no splendor, just an ordinary leaf that was inferior to spiritual plants.</p>
<p>However, when everyone saw the leaf, their pupils constricted as they could not move their gazes away.</p>
<p>They watched intently as the leaf slowly floated to the top of Yi Yun's head.</p>
<p>Yi Yun reached out his hand and the leaf fell into his palm.</p>
<p>Once the leaf landed in his palm, it went from a bright green color to a withering yellow. It then went from yellow to powder. With a blow of the gentle wind, the powder was blown up, dispersing into the air.</p>
<p>Many people were dazed seeing this.</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree had shed a leaf, letting it fall into Yi Yun's hand?</p>
<p>What did Yi Yun do or deserve to make the Empress Earth Dao Tree shed one of its leaves!?</p>
<p>And at this moment, Cang Mang suddenly stood up and gave Yi Yun a deep meaningful glance, and said, "Rating, Hibernation Awakening!"</p>
<p>His formidable voice woke everyone up from their shock.</p>
<p>Hibernation...Hibernation Awakening!?</p>
<p>Chapter 819: Extreme Yang Body Illumination</p>
<p>The crowd of people that was jolted awake could not believe their ears.</p>
<p>Hibernation Awakening! Furthermore, it was the Hibernation Awakening recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>People were such curious creatures. When a person that was always much stronger than their wildest imagination, such as Ran Yu or Gu Luo, they would not doubt feats accomplished by those people despite feeling shocked. They would only accept it reluctantly, and they would even look up to the person as an idol. An idol being great was taken for granted.</p>
<p>But if the person who accomplished a feat was one who everyone believed was someone weaker than them, it would become something unacceptable.</p>
<p>Eye Opening was already unbelievable for them, but now...it was Hibernation Awakening!</p>
<p>"Impossible!" The moment Cang Mang said his words, Lie Ya could not help but cry out.</p>
<p>"Are you doubting me? Or are you doubting our Luo clan's twelve Fey divine columns?" Cang Mang looked coldly at Lie Ya. A dangerous aura immediately arose from Cang Mang's body. The gigantic python coiled around him also raised its head and stared at Lie Ya.</p>
<p>Lie Ya immediately felt his scalp go numb as he uttered, "No..."</p>
<p>Cang Mang coldly grunted.</p>
<p>The twelve Fey divine columns contained a tinge of the ancient Fey Gods' grace, of course it was impossible to cheat!</p>
<p>The truth was placed before them. Yi Yun had truly obtained the rating of Hibernation Awakening from the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>Ran Yu's delicate face could no longer maintain its calm, as his expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>Although the rating on the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column was weaker, just the Empress Earth Dao Tree's Hibernation Awakening rating was enough to indicate that Yi Yun's performance was better than Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Luo Tian also revealed an unexpected expression. "I thought the Fire Cloud State was just only average. Who knew that a Yuan Opening realm disciple can have such good performance, however...the short period of cultivation might mean a disadvantage for people with low cultivation levels, but from another point of view, having a young bone age gives a bonus. The test of the twelve ancient Fey columns may not be one's final evaluation of strength."</p>
<p>What Luo Tian said was actually a fact, but it had been proven over numerous occasions that the longer one cultivated, the deeper one's nomological insight was. The recognition obtained would be higher; hence, a disciple that had cultivated for sixty years should be stronger than a new disciple.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Luo, does that mean you can exceed this rating?"</p>
<p>"Could it be that Senior Brother Luo is going to attempt to obtain the recognition of three ancient Fey columns?"</p>
<p>On the Phoenix Firmiana State's side, a few disciples were shocked from hearing Luo Tian's words. Luo Tian's confidence made them all believe that he had the chance to achieve even better results.</p>
<p>Luo Tian shook his head, "Forget about three columns. That's just pomposity. I will only choose two columns, one with Eye Opening and another with Hibernation Awakening. That, I can still guarantee."</p>
<p>Luo Tian may have remarked that three columns was just "pomposity", but the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples knew that it was just Luo Tian's prideful way of expressing himself. As meditating before three ancient Fey columns was too much a rush for time, it was very difficult to obtain good results. It was safer to meditate over two ancient Fey columns.</p>
<p>An Eye Opening and a Hibernation Awakening would be a better result than Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, could the Hibernation Awakening rating that Luo Tian guaranteed exceed the Empress Earth Dao Tree? That was the Empress Earth Dao Tree!</p>
<p>Seeing the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples still in doubt, Luo Tian laughed and said, "He's just a Yuan Opening realm disciple junior. Surpassing him will be very easy!"</p>
<p>Just as he wanted to say more confident words, someone suddenly said, "Why...Why hasn't the pillar of light around Junior Brother Yi's body disappeared?"</p>
<p>"That's right, and in fact, it seems to be getting brighter..."</p>
<p>People broke out into a flurry of discussion, but these discussions made Luo Tian feel like he was a rooster that had its neck strangled. Slowly, he lowered his voice till it was completely stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>As though he had seen a ghost, he stared intently at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Why was the situation not over!?</p>
<p>It was not only limited to him, the gazes people gave Yi Yun were completely filled with incredulity.</p>
<p>"Weng!"</p>
<p>A more intense golden beam of light fell from the sky, as though a brilliant sun was illuminating Yi Yun from the nine heavens. It bathed him in its golden light, making him look like a god.</p>
<p>Ran Yu immediately felt as though his brain had been brutally punched. It began to buzz.</p>
<p>Even the way Cang Mang looked at Yi Yun had an additional strange hint to it.</p>
<p>Could there...be more!?</p>
<p>The corners of a Fire Cloud State disciple's eyes twitched as he whispered, "Speaking of which, didn't Yi Yun meditate for quite a period of time in front of the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column? Could it be..."</p>
<p>He did not need to finish his sentence as everyone recalled.</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone's expressions appeared extremely complicated.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had obtained the Hibernation Awakening rating from the Empress Earth Dao Tree. He couldn't have also obtained the recognition of the Extreme Yang Illumination, right?</p>
<p>The Extreme Yang Illumination's birth was immediately after Chaos. The difficulty of grasping it was extremely horrifying.</p>
<p>The Empress Earth Dao Tree was the fusion of 3000 Great Dao, while the Extreme Yang Illumination was the ultimate embodiment of pure Yang laws. It was a Great Dao of Supremacy that was born alongside the beginning of the Universe.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's previous performance had already shamed them to the point of not being able to raise their heads. Only Ran Yu and Gu Luo, as well as Luo Tian, could still compete with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>If he obtained the additional recognition of the Extreme Yang Illumination...</p>
<p>"Just now for the Empress Earth Dao Tree, Yi Yun might have used some small Dao, including fire-elemental laws to obtain its recognition. However, for the Extreme Yang Illumination, no matter how profound one's fire-elemental laws are, it is just too weak in front of the pure Yang laws at the beginning. In my point of view, even if Yi Yun gains its recognition, it will just be Entering Motion." A cultivator said.</p>
<p>"Entering Motion would also be terrifying enough!"</p>
<p>Many people said with great difficulty. Saying that Yi Yun would obtain Entering Motion was not because they were sure of it, but because such a result was something more acceptable for them.</p>
<p>These people originally believed that they were much stronger than Yi Yun. They were the ones who truly had the qualifications to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials. As for Yi Yun, he came from a lower realm, and had just joined the Earth Fire Hall. If not for Prince Pingnan, how could he have been able to participate in the trials?</p>
<p>This understanding formed a huge contrast with the reality before their eyes. How could this bunch of elites accept it?</p>
<p>If the Empress Earth Dao Tree's rating was because of Yi Yun's amazing talents in fire-elemental laws, and if the Extreme Yang Illumination was only at the Entering Motion rating, this result would still make them uncomfortable, but at least it was something acceptable.</p>
<p>Ran Yu did not speak, but in his heart, he too was having similar thoughts. He really could not accept that he who was a Heaven Fey with noble blood would be surpassed by a human from the lower realms.</p>
<p>"To obtain Hibernation Awakening from the Empress Earth Dao Tree, obtaining Entering Motion from the Extreme Yang Illumination is also extremely good." Bai Chen thought bitterly. Previously, he wished that Yi Yun would fail to gain any recognition, but now, he did not care what rating Yi Yun obtained. The differences between the two of them was too great. It did not matter if there was one bit more or less.</p>
<p>Everyone had disparate thoughts, however, the Extreme Yang Illumination would not change its inclination because of these people's thoughts.</p>
<p>A small fire plume suddenly lit up from the Extreme Yang Illumination.</p>
<p>Seeing this plume of fire, everyone immediately felt the same thing, as though this was the only ray of light left in the entire world.</p>
<p>The light from their surroundings, even the starlight above their heads appeared deficient in comparison before the plume of flame, as though they had all been engulfed.</p>
<p>The first ancient Fey column, Extreme Yang Illumination, moved...</p>
<p>Chapter 820: Interspatial Space</p>
<p>After the plume of fire on the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column came into being, it began to burgeon like prairie fire.</p>
<p>As it burst out, even the large python coiled around Cang Mang raised its head up high!</p>
<p>The face which Cang Mang used to look at the Extreme Yang Illumination was filled with astonishment.</p>
<p>As the halo of light expanded, a layer of the halo suddenly burst outwards with a loud boom!</p>
<p>Everyone could not help but take a step back. Even though they knew that it was a phantom image, they could not help but feel that infinite heat radiating towards them. It felt like just touching it would render any protective Yuan Qi useless, reducing immediately to ashes! Even the heaven and earth could not withstand the terrifying heat, what more them?</p>
<p>This was naturally not Yi Yun's strength, but the Fey God's grace contained within the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column. As for Yi Yun, he was just the person who had triggered it.</p>
<p>But what truly shocked them was not the power of the heavens and earth, but Cang Mang's words...</p>
<p>"Hibernation Awakening..."</p>
<p>Cang Mang muttered to himself as the way he looked at Yi Yun completely changed.</p>
<p>Seven-colored Phoenix, Entering Motion.</p>
<p>Empress Earth Dao Tree, Hibernation Awakening!</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination, Hibernation Awakening!</p>
<p>Obtaining the recognition of three divine columns, with two of them being at an extremely high difficulty, and it were these two extremely difficult divine columns that Yi Yun had obtained a rating of Hibernation Awakening!</p>
<p>To obtain the recognition of three divine columns in a day's time, he had to do so in a third the time what others had for each divine column.</p>
<p>At this moment, even the zombie-like Gu Luo's pupils had contracted into a needle tip.</p>
<p>Regardless of the speculation from before, be it about having good luck or being good at fire-elemental laws, the halo that burst forth was like a resounding slap, slapping them hard in their faces.</p>
<p>Luo Tian remained silent for a long time before he silently turned around. He was in fact thinking of turning around and leave the place. After knowing of Yi Yun's ratings and then recall the words he had just said, he felt like he would be sitting on pins and needles just staying here.</p>
<p>In particular, he had even commented on Yi Yun's performance in the capacity as a senior disciple. Seeing the result, Luo Tian's face was burning.</p>
<p>And at this moment, not a single Fire Cloud State disciple cared about what Luo Tian had previously said. Compared to the immense shock Yi Yun gave to them, Luo Tian's words were nothing.</p>
<p>"Two Hibernation Awakening, one Entering Motion. You are very good. Yi Yun, right? I shall remember your name." Cang Mang looked at Yi Yun and said with a deep voice.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Cang Mang's words, Ran Yu immediately clenched his fists. Cang Mang's status and identity was far from simply leading them around for their training. And even though Ran Yu's performance was not bad, Cang Mang had not said any additional words at all. This Yi Yun had gotten the favor of Cang Mang.</p>
<p>Ran Yu had intended to chase after Tian Shi, hoping to prove that even without Tian Shi's resources, he too could excel. Ran Yu was actually satisfied with his performance, but now, compared with Yi Yun, he was greatly inferior.</p>
<p>He was inferior to Tian Shi and Gu Luo, and now, he was even inferior to a rookie disciple of the Earth Fire Hall!</p>
<p>"However, the twelve Fey divine columns is just a testing of one's nomological insight. Just having insights alone is not enough for a warrior, because a warrior also requires sufficient strength." Cang Mang said with great meaning behind his words. Yi Yun's performance was indeed amazing, and combined with his cultivation realm and age, it could only be described as absolutely brilliant. However, the more Cang Mang favored Yi Yun, the more he wanted to specially say those words to warn Yi Yun so as to prevent him from feeling inflated.</p>
<p>"That's right, Yi Yun is only having the upper hand for the time being. Now, I still possess great advantages in various other aspects, such as my body!"</p>
<p>A keenness flashed at the bottom of Ran Yu's eyes. When it came to bodily strength, the Human race was inferior to the Fey race. Furthermore, Yi Yun's cultivation had been short, so even if he was a true genius, the Luo Divine Hall trials were not his stage.</p>
<p>Other than those outstanding disciples being able to receive the attention from various factions at the Luo Divine Hall trials, those who passed the trials would also receive generous rewards! These rewards were very helpful in increasing their strength.</p>
<p>Before the Luo Divine Hall trials that lasted a decade began, they needed to use such training experiences like this to attempt to go one step further, as well as the opportunities obtained during these training experiences.</p>
<p>Following that, pillars of light appeared on the other Fire Cloud State disciples. However, after Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Yi Yun's rating, no one paid attention to the remaining disciples, regardless if they received any recognition or not.</p>
<p>Even they themselves felt a lack of interest. Previously, every disciple was feeling nervous, wishing they could gain the recognition of the Fey divine columns. But now, this feeling of unease was already gone. Even if they passed, it was just Entering Motion, they did not offer any grounds for comparison with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The remaining disciples quickly obtained their ratings of the twelve Fey divine columns.</p>
<p>The evaluation had given them quite a setback.</p>
<p>Cang Mang glanced at the disciples with a smile that did not look like a smile.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State disciples were all having a myriad of expressions. After the evaluation, nearly everyone had different expressions from when they first came in.</p>
<p>However, this was one of the goals of organizing the Luo Divine Hall trials. The Luo clan was able to last for eons through the steady stream of genius warriors.</p>
<p>Letting these elites with eyes as high as the heavens gather together was the only way to let them recognize their shortcomings, inspiring greater potential from them.</p>
<p>As for those disciples who suffered setbacks and could not recover from them would be eliminated without any worries. The Luo clan did not need such warriors.</p>
<p>"Previously, I mentioned that in the Ancient Fey Edifice, a large number of opportunities are prepared for you. The only thing that determines whether you can obtain it is based on your individual skill." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Immediately, all the disciples who gained the recognition of the twelve Fey divine columns felt their spirits lifted. The twelve Fey divine columns made them clearly understand their own nomological insights and limitations. This resulted in their minds being focused on this, making them nearly forget there were still opportunities waiting for them!</p>
<p>"The twelve Fey divine columns represent laws. They are profound and esoteric. To obtain their opportunities is not a simple task." Cang Mang looked at the disciples and slowly said, "Although it's just a hint of their grace, the ancient Fey columns have their own consciousness. The constructors back then left their mantle behind, sealing them in the ancient Fey column's interspatial space. It will provide you with different opportunities depending on the recognition you received!"</p>
<p>Those who had gained the recognition of any of the twelve Fey divine columns obtained the qualification to enter the twelve Fey divine columns interspatial space.</p>
<p>As Cang Mang spoke, everyone who gained the recognition of the twelve Fey divine columns were enshrouded by a sheen of pale light.</p>
<p>Following that, the ground began to issue a dull, rumbling sound, as though an extremely gigantic Fey beast was being awaken beneath it.</p>
<p>A feeling of being stared at by a primordial existence enveloped the crowd as the grounds trembled gently, causing the cultivators to tremble in fear.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also began having an intense anticipatory feeling!</p>
<p>The door was about to open!</p>
<p>Chapter 821: Door to the Fey Gods</p>
<p>Accompanying the sound of rumbling, those Fey divine columns that had been lit up slowly fissured a crevice each. The crevices continued to widen until they formed gigantic doors that connected the sky to the ground!</p>
<p>The twelve Fey divine columns were immensely huge to begin with. This gigantic doors appeared like mountains, so when the cultivators stood in front of the door, they were as minute as specks of dust.</p>
<p>"You can enter," Cang Mang said as his mouth twitched after seeing the expressions of these people staring with widened eyes.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the disciples who had gained recognition eagerly headed towards their doors.</p>
<p>Just as a cultivator reached a divine column's door, he realized he was being repelled by an invisible force.</p>
<p>"You can only enter the door that you passed." Cang Mang added on before he looked at Yi Yun and company again. "As for the three of you, you can choose any door from the divine columns that you have gained the recognition of."</p>
<p>The cultivator who was repelled stared at the magnificent door in front of him and sighed. Standing outside the door, everything in the door was filled with a dense fog, preventing him from seeing the situation inside. As for this great door, it was for the Empress Earth Dao Tree divine column.</p>
<p>It was unknown when he would ever have a chance to enter this door...</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, let us go," Luo Fengling said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. He felt extremely curious looking at these doors. They gave him a feeling that there was a primordial behemoth entrenched behind the door. Even the fog at the door felt like they were formed from the behemoth's breathing.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu proceeded through the Empress Earth Dao Tree's door, and after Yi Yun sized up the doors, he decided to follow suit.</p>
<p>While passing through the dense fog, Yi Yun suddenly had a feeling of being watched by numerous pairs of eyes. There were whispering amidst the fog and when Yi Yun traced the direction of the sounds, he was instantly stunned.</p>
<p>It appeared like there were numerous shadows flashing around in the fog. These shadows seemed to be either man or beast, while some did not even have any specific shape.</p>
<p>But soon, Yi Yun was unconcerned over it. This was the door to one of the twelve Fey divine columns, it was unlikely that there was anything trying to make mischief.</p>
<p>"Those figures that are speaking are said to be spirits born out of the twelve Fey divine columns." Just after Yi Yun walked out from the fog, he heard a faint voice.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was standing not far from him, and had said without even turning his head back.</p>
<p>"Spirits?" Yi Yun frowned. He was unsure about such matters.</p>
<p>However, Ran Yu no longer spoke. Yi Yun was also unsure of what Ran Yu was alluding to, but he did not probe further.</p>
<p>When he looked forward, a look of surprise took over his face.</p>
<p>Walking in from the door, he was apparently treading a path in the form of a bridge. And in the path ahead, there was a huge cave.</p>
<p>The cave was twinkling like starlight. Looking up, there was a recondite sky, and looking down was an infinite abyss, a mystery to where it led to.</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Ran Yu had walked in from the Empress Earth Dao Tree's door and stood on the same stone bridge. And around him were twelve similar stone bridges that circled the cave.</p>
<p>The cave was so large that it made the stone bridges distant from each other.</p>
<p>However, the starlight was illuminating the stone bridges, allowing people to see each other from afar.</p>
<p>Other than Ran Yu and Yi Yun, there were already people standing on several stone bridges.</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun looked at the cave, Ran Yu slowly came to the forefront of the stone bridge and looked down at the abyss. He slowly said, "Do you know why our Fey race built the twelve Fey divine columns at a blue hole in this endless sea?"</p>
<p>Endless sea? Yi Yun was confounded. So this was a blue hole...</p>
<p>However...Wasn't Mt. Azure Billow a large mountain suspended in the Universe? Where did the sea come from?</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu did not wait for Yi Yun's reply and directly said, "That's because the cultivation of us warriors are like standing on this stone bridge, shaky. Some people can achieve success in a short period of time, but they are like fireworks, only having a momentary brilliance. Truly good materials will burn ever brighter. Some of them can burn for tens of thousands of years, or even hundreds of millions of years."</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Ran Yu and understood what he meant.</p>
<p>Clearly, Ran Yu's pride prevented him from accepting Yi Yun's evaluation to be higher than his. The fireworks were probably a metaphor for himself, while Ran Yu wanted to be the good material he mentioned.</p>
<p>Yi Yun only smiled in silence. Ran Yu's face turned surly because he did not like it when people disparaged him.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, you are human. The perception of the Human race indeed surpasses the Fey race, but the Fey race has its own advantages, which are its extremely long lifespans and their powerful physiques! With this comparison, humans are considered too weak. The Fey race can use their long lifespans to close the advantageous gap humans have in laws. For example, I may be decades older than you, but when contrasting this with my Fey race's lifespan, I am actually younger than you!"</p>
<p>"It is difficult to bridge the differences in the physiques of the Human race and Fey race. And it is for this reason that the humans are always the weaker ones in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Most humans, even if they share the same origins as members of the Fey race, they would eventually only become the servants or followers of these Fey." Ran Yu said again, but Yi Yun did not think much of it. It was true humans had a shorter lifespan than the Fey race, but that was only limited to their low cultivation levels.</p>
<p>With the increase of cultivation level, the lifespans of the mighty figures of the Human and Fey race would have the gap closed. In the end, once one had the power to control the heavens and earth, sharing the lifespans of the suns and moons, the racial lines would have long been blurred. There was not much of a comparison who had a longer lifespan amongst the Human and Fey race mighty figures, but the number of mighty human figures would be a lot more!</p>
<p>Yi Yun said, "From what I know, only the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven belongs to the Fey race amongst the 12 Empyrean Heavens. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the position of the Human race is indeed deplorable, but there are even more Empyrean Heavens where humans are supreme." Yi Yun lightly said, putting a plug to Ran Yu's words.</p>
<p>As he looked at Yi Yun, his eyes flashed a hint of sharpness.</p>
<p>The Fey race faced a tremendous problem. Only the Heaven Fey possessed greater potential, but the Heaven Fey's fertility was much weaker than the Human race.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Cang Mang's voice sounded from the cave.</p>
<p>He had also walked in from one of the doors of the divine columns, stunning everyone.</p>
<p>However, they immediately understood that since Cang Mang was a guardian of the Ancient Fey Edifice, he would definitely have gained the recognition of the ancient Fey columns. He was naturally free to enter the door.</p>
<p>"The opportunities are here and what you obtain is up to you. Even with the same rating, the opportunities you obtain will be different." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>The cultivators standing on different stone bridges immediately revealed strange looks.</p>
<p>These cultivators who had managed to gained recognition naturally could not be compared to freaks like Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Yi Yun, but it was possible for them to obtain better opportunities than others.</p>
<p>Everyone was filled with anticipation, hoping that their luck was better.</p>
<p>Chapter 822: Nine Volumed Celestial Axis</p>
<p>At this moment, a light curtain suddenly flew up from deep beneath the chasm before it headed towards the Dragon Emperor divine column's stone bridge.</p>
<p>The Dragon Emperor divine column's stone bridge was in the shape of a giant dragon from afar, and there were a few Luo clan disciples standing there.</p>
<p>These Luo clan disciples were watching earnestly at the light curtain that flew over. This light curtain seemed to possess eyes as it flew straight towards a person, and in a blink of an eye, appeared in front of a disciple. As the light curtain dispersed, it revealed a box in it.</p>
<p>The disciple was stunned as he hurriedly caught it. After opening it, all that could be seen from his face was mixed looks.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>A Luo clan disciple beside said, "World Stones."</p>
<p>World Stones were a form of salary given in the Fire Cloud State. Earth Fire Hall disciples were given one World Stone a year, while Heaven Fire Hall disciples were given five a year. This Luo clan disciple had obtained twenty World Stones as a reward, and it was considered not bad if this was any other time, but when contrasted with the Ancient Fey Edifice's countless opportunities, it was understandably disappointing.</p>
<p>"In the Ancient Fey Edifice, only those above Eye Opening can obtain better awards. We only obtained Entering Motion, so forget it."</p>
<p>This disciple shook his head with an ugly expression and sighed. He had barely obtained the divine column's recognition, but even so, he still had a tiny bit of hope, but he never expected to receive the poorest reward of World Stones.</p>
<p>Another light curtain burst out from the chasm and flew towards a Luo clan disciple on the Seven-colored Phoenix's stone bridge. Immediately, that disciple revealed an uneasy expression. The degree of his Entering Motion was not much higher than the previous person.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was also on this stone bridge, so she was similarly extremely nervous. Luo Fengling had very little time for cultivation, so obtaining a bit of resources would be very beneficial for her.</p>
<p>"It's a cultivation technique!" The light curtain transformed into an ancient tome, as the disciple beamed.</p>
<p>Things were different when it came to cultivation techniques. The cultivation techniques stored in the Ancient Fey Edifice wouldn't be too bad, even if it was the lowest grade.</p>
<p>"It's the first and second volume of the Nine Volumed Celestial Axis." One of the cultivators said after they saw the words on the ancient tome.</p>
<p>"Even if he obtained the first two volumes, trying to obtain all nine volumes is nearly impossible." A Luo clan disciple said.</p>
<p>The Nine Volumed Celestial Axis was a top body-tempering cultivation technique in the Luo clan, but it did not belong to the Luo clan, but a heritage left behind by an ancient mighty figure who was famous in the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>Although the Nine Volumed Celestial Axis was extremely valuable, its first few volumes were relatively simpler and have been replicated into many similar copies.</p>
<p>However, after the fifth volume, the subsequent volumes' prices grew at a geometric rate. Even the Luo clan did not have the complete Nine Volumed Celestial Axis.</p>
<p>"Nine Volumed Celestial Axis. Ze ze. According to legend, mastering the entire Nine Volumed Celestial Axis would result in a body that can shatter a Great World. This is the top body-tempering technique in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, but it is very difficult for humans to master it." Ran Yu suddenly said.</p>
<p>He did not look at Yi Yun, but he was clearly directing it at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Lie Ya, who wasn't very far away, heard this and echoed, "Senior Brother Ran Yu is right. Humans are far inferior to us at cultivating body-tempering cultivation techniques. Humans only have two body-tempering stages when they first come into contact with martial arts, called Mortal Blood and Purple Blood. Compared to the Fey race's body-tempering techniques, that's far inferior. It is mainly due to a problem with physique. The physique of humans is just too weak, so they can't be trained up."</p>
<p>After Lie Ya said that, he glanced proudly at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He admitted that he was inferior to Yi Yun when it came to laws, but he was unwilling to admit that he was inferior to Yi Yun; hence, he mentioned body-tempering techniques. This was the forte of the Fey race, something the Human race was really bad at.</p>
<p>Even for Yi Yun, his body was his weakness. Back when he was fighting against the Black-armored Demon God, the Black-armored Demon God's extraordinary defense came from his body-tempering technique.</p>
<p>And because Yi Yun's body was weak, he was unable to resist the Black-armored Demon God's frontal attacks even once. He could only summon his Draco First True Gold avatar to block the attacks for him.</p>
<p>Although the Nine Volumed Celestial Axis could be used by both the Human and Fey race, nearly no human cultivated it because it was too difficult.</p>
<p>After the Nine Volumed Celestial Axis, a beam of light flew towards the Seven-colored Phoenix's stone bridge, headed straight for Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>"Mine?" An uneasy Luo Fengling hurriedly reached out her hand.</p>
<p>Pa. A small jade box landed in Luo Fengling's white palm.</p>
<p>She first raised her head to survey the cultivators around her, and these people also looked back at her.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling had been recommended by Fairy Black Bamboo and had cultivated for a short period of time, so she was equally unpopular as Yi Yun. Although the recognition she obtained was nothing outstanding, these people probably wished that it would be best if the opportunity she gained was very bad.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling sighed lightly and opened the jade box under the watchful eyes of others.</p>
<p>A round pill, pink like a woman's lips, exuded a faint aroma as it sat in the middle of the jade box.</p>
<p>"It's unknown what pill this is."</p>
<p>A few cultivators, especially those that had obtained rewards but had been inferior to Luo Fengling, revealed downcast looks. Regardless what pill it was, how could it be bad if it was a pill given by the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column? It was definitely slightly better than World Stones or the first two volumes of the Nine Volumed Celestial Axis.</p>
<p>They had all obtained Entering Motion, but everyone's opportunities were different, turning everyone who had not received their opportunities uneasy.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling revealed a look of pleasant surprise. Only after taking a careful look at it was she willing to put the box away.</p>
<p>And after her, another disciple obtained a World Stone. From the way he groaned, he was extremely depressed about it.</p>
<p>At this moment, a light curtain flew out, and this time, the target was the Empress Earth Dao Tree's stone bridge!</p>
<p>Standing on the Empress Earth Dao Tree's stone bridge was Ran Yu and Yi Yun. These cultivators were all guessing the target of this light curtain and what was inside!</p>
<p>"Say, is this mine or yours?" Ran Yu said in a drawn out manner.</p>
<p>After making the assertions regarding the body-tempering situation with the Human and Fey race, he had seemingly regained his confidence.</p>
<p>The light curtain charged at the duo and abruptly appeared in front of Ran Yu.</p>
<p>"Looks like it's mine.' Ran Yu chuckled and reached his hand out.</p>
<p>The light curtain immediately dispersed as Yi Yun saw clearly a golden beam of light appear on Ran Yu's palm the moment the light dispersed,.</p>
<p>Ran Yu and Yi Yun were the only two people on this stone bridge, so regardless of who it was that obtained an opportunity, they were bound to be the focus of attention. Everyone's gazes were trained on this stone bridge.</p>
<p>They had also seen that golden beam of light.</p>
<p>The golden beam of light constantly changed in shape in Ran Yu's hand, at times in the shape of a small sparrow and at other times a miniature golden snake.</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"I wonder if it's a reward from the Dragon Emperor or the Empress Earth Dao Tree."</p>
<p>Previously, Cang Mang had said that those who passed a few divine columns could choose any column. This meant that even if Ran Yu stood on the Empress Earth Dao Tree's stone bridge, he too could receive the opportunities from the Dragon Emperor divine column.</p>
<p>Chapter 823: Intermediary Spirit Pearl</p>
<p>Pa!</p>
<p>Ran Yu suddenly clenched his five fingers, shattering the pocket-sized tiny golden snake with a squeeze.</p>
<p>When he opened his fingers, a golden piece of paper-like charm was revealed.</p>
<p>The golden beam of light that could transform into different shapes autonomously was actually a charm?</p>
<p>All the Luo clan disciples looked at the charm with astonishment and curiosity.</p>
<p>And the moment the charm came into being, those cultivators that had been staring at the charm immediately felt a sense of danger. It was as though they were the ones being stared at by the charm.</p>
<p>Without even using the charm, it already imposed such feelings on others. Could it be weak when it was truly put into use?</p>
<p>Compared to other opportunities, charms were actually considered a consumable item, but truly powerful charms could be used at critical junctures. Some extremely profound charms were equivalent to a strike of a warrior at the supreme level. To Yuan Opening and Heaven Ascension realm warriors, this charm was especially valuable.</p>
<p>However, the more profound a charm was, the more difficult it was to produce one. Like the one Ran Yu had, the difficulty of constructing it was extremely high.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of this, the other cultivators were filled with envy. The cost of the charm definitely would not be low.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was rather satisfied with this charm as he silently kept it.</p>
<p>Ran Yu glanced at Yi Yun beside him, and he immediately sneered when he saw Yi Yun having a ruminating look. Clearly, this was the first time Yi Yun had seen such a charm.</p>
<p>Warriors from the lower realm were limited in their world view, so how could they recognize the charms from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?</p>
<p>At this moment, another light curtain flew over.</p>
<p>"It's headed straight for Ran Yu."</p>
<p>Ran Yu reached out his hand and grabbed the curtain of light.</p>
<p>As the beam of light shattered, an extremely lustrous pearl appeared in Ran Yu's hand.</p>
<p>This pearl gave off a faint azure luster and emitted light. As it quietly sat in Ran Yu's palm, its incandescent radiation fixated the gazes of those cultivators.</p>
<p>"This is..." Some cultivators did not recognize it at all.</p>
<p>"Intermediary Spirit Pearl!" Someone exclaimed. This was not an offensive or defensive item, but a Dao pearl carved with all the nomological insights of a mighty figure of the Luo clan when he was close to his death. Once it was shattered, one could gain enlightenment from the nomological fragments.</p>
<p>Of course, a mighty figure could produce many Intermediary Spirit Pearl over tens of thousands of years. And if one managed to gain insight from an Intermediary Spirit Pearl, it was still impossible to directly obtain the nomological insights of that particular mighty figure.</p>
<p>But even so, it was still extremely valuable.</p>
<p>A cultivator said with an envious tone, "This is similar to the pill Luo Fengling received, but it is much higher in grade than that pill."</p>
<p>"Ran Yu is a Heaven Fey, so he has a powerful body. Now, by having his nomological insights improved, his strength would improve before the Luo Divine Hall trials begin. He would definitely obtain a higher placing at the trials."</p>
<p>The cultivators broke out into discussion.</p>
<p>They shook their heads gloomily as they looked at Ran Yu. The opportunities they had obtained was nothing compared to Ran Yu's.</p>
<p>However, Cang Mang said, "This is the most basic grade of Intermediary Spirit Pearl."</p>
<p>The most basic grade?</p>
<p>But it was still an Intermediary Spirit Pearl...</p>
<p>"However, being able to obtain an Intermediary Spirit Pearl is indeed not easy. People in the past have also gained the recognition of the Empress Earth Dao Tree, but the ones who obtained an Intermediary Spirit Pearl are few in number. There is a bit of luck involved in this." Cang Mang followed up.</p>
<p>When these disciples heard it, they immediately sighed with emotion over the Intermediary Spirit Pearl's value.</p>
<p>A sneer flashed beneath Ran Yu's eyes. Although the grade wasn't high, the opportunity he had received was not bad. Just as people had said to Yi Yun, luck was also a form of strength.</p>
<p>"For Ran Yu to obtain this opportunity, it's a wonder what Gu Luo and Yi Yun would obtain." A cultivator turned his gaze towards Gu Luo and Yi Yun. This cultivator had obtained his opportunity, a notebook from a mighty Fey in his youth. If he carefully studied it, he too could gain some insights and knowledge.</p>
<p>This group of cultivators had already obtained their opportunities, so they had lost all sense of anticipation. Hence, they focused their attention on Gu Luo and Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"The opportunities depend on fated luck. Senior Brother Li, you just got Entering Motion and was weaker than younger brother me. However, the item you received is so much better than mine." Another cultivator spoke with a look of speechlessness. He too had only obtained twenty World Stones.</p>
<p>"Haha." That particular Senior Brother Li could not conceal his laughter as he said, "Hence, Gu Luo and Yi Yun might not received much better opportunities. The ancient Fey columns have strange rules with their ratings. Maybe as a human, Yi Yun might receive something even worse! Then, his results would be for nothing."</p>
<p>The other cultivators nodded their heads in unison. Yi Yun's rating had made their face warm, as though they had been smacked in the face. If the opportunities Yi Yun received were not that great, they could feel more comforted.</p>
<p>Of course, they also knew that with Yi Yun's ratings, no matter how bad his luck was, the opportunities he received would be much better than theirs.</p>
<p>"It's Gu Luo's turn!"</p>
<p>A beam of light shot into Gu Luo's hands and when everyone managed to make out the beam of light, they were taken aback.</p>
<p>Gu Luo's first opportunity was also an Intermediary Spirit Pearl!</p>
<p>And when this Intermediary Spirit Pearl appeared, it immediately made the people present feel like their skin was being pricked. A sharp aura made everyone involuntarily retreat.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this Intermediary Spirit Pearl, Ran Yu frowned. It appeared as though Gu Luo's Intermediary Spirit Pearl was of a higher grade.</p>
<p>The first treasure was an Intermediary Spirit Pearl, and for the next item...</p>
<p>Solitary Nothingness divine column, Eye Opening!</p>
<p>A light curtain flew out of the Solitary Nothingness divine column, transforming into a stone slip.</p>
<p>"It's a fragmentary technique!" A keen-eyed person shouted.</p>
<p>This stone slip was unwhole, and only a portion of the technique recorded on it remained.</p>
<p>Gu Luo was seen silently putting away the Intermediary Spirit Pearl and stone slip into his interspatial ring with a deadpan expression. No one could tell if he was happy or not.</p>
<p>Everyone were engaged in discussion, but Gu Luo did not have the intention to take the two treasures out.</p>
<p>They were curious about the fragmentary technique, and speculated that it was an ancient fragmentary technique, and if Gu Luo managed to master 10 or 20% of it, it would be extremely good.</p>
<p>However, the comprehension of fragmentary techniques also depended on luck. Whether it could be comprehended and the amount one could comprehend was an unknown. Hence, from this point of view, this fragmentary technique might not be better than Ran Yu's charm.</p>
<p>The other cultivators also came to this conclusion as they looked at Ran Yu. Although Ran Yu had received a relatively disadvantaged rating, his luck was still not bad...</p>
<p>However, Ran Yu appeared expressionless. After saying those words to Yi Yun, he had restored his refined and indifferent collectedness.</p>
<p>He had thought things through. As a Heaven Fey, and a member of the Xushui Ran clan, even if his nomological insights were inferior to Yi Yun, he surpassed Yi Yun in various other aspects! Why did he need to use his weakness as a comparison?</p>
<p>As for now, all that mattered was what opportunities Yi Yun obtained.</p>
<p>Chapter 824: The Path of Body-tempering</p>
<p>By now, everyone had realized that the rewards given by the twelve Fey divine columns were issued in order of recognition. After Gu Luo, it was likely Yi Yun's turn.</p>
<p>Everyone's focus turned onto Yi Yun as they were all eager to know what sort of opportunities he would receive, with him being the cultivator with the highest ratings.</p>
<p>Even Gu Luo's dead-like eyes turned to look at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"I wonder how Junior Brother Yi Yun's fated luck is..." Luo Fengling looked from afar as she stood on the Seven-colored Phoenix stone bridge.</p>
<p>The stone bridge beneath Yi Yun was like a shriveled piece of wood that appeared to have been in such a state for more than ten thousand years. Its surface was also covered in a layer of stone.</p>
<p>But beneath the shriveled wood, it was covered with spiritual flowers and spiritual grass that grew lushly and colorfully in an extremely beautiful manner. These spiritual plants would usually only grow in grounds with rich spiritual energy, so it was rather surprising for them to grow on this shriveled wood in this interspatial space.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a light curtain flew up from deep within the chasm. It began out as a tiny dot of light before quickly transforming into a long fogbow, and its direction was headed for the shriveled wood.</p>
<p>The light curtain directly came before Yi Yun, and the moment he stretched his hand out, he felt his hand sink as a box appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>"What is it?" The Luo clan disciples focused at his hand.</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately understood the moment he came into contact with the light curtain.</p>
<p>This was the reward from the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had barely gained the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column's recognition, so he did not have his hopes up on the reward from it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun opened the box and in it was a book. The cover was written in ancient Fey race text—Nine Volumed Celestial Axis.</p>
<p>The first two volumes of the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis"!</p>
<p>"This reward is very average." Ran Yu said with a smile from the side.</p>
<p>The "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis" was a top level body-tempering technique, but its price only began soaring past the fifth volume. Upon reaching the eighth volume, it was already a huge treasure of the Luo clan. As for the legendary ninth volume, it was already considered lost. The moment the ninth volume appeared, it would most definitely set off a blood storm in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>In the world of martial arts, to create a copy of a cultivation technique one obtained, one needed to first master it. Mastering to whichever level allowed one to make a copy of that level. If not, it would be impossible to describe those profound and esoteric laws as well as the energy flow trajectories.</p>
<p>The first few volumes of the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis" were easy to cultivate, and there were many copies.</p>
<p>Previously, a little-known Luo clan disciple whose rating had barely reached Entering Motion had also obtained the first two volumes of the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis", so Yi Yun's treatment was identical to that disciple.</p>
<p>This made Lie Ya gloat as he said, "It's after all a rating of Entering Motion. The 'Nine Volumed Celestial Axis' is still passable and it's much better than World Stones. However, with the physique of a human, cultivating the 'Nine Volumed Celestial Axis' is impossible..."</p>
<p>The opportunities handed out by the Ancient Fey Edifice differed from person to person. These twelve divine columns had been established for an extremely long period of time, and the grace within each of the twelve Fey divine columns was mysterious and profound, giving these divine columns a bit of consciousness. They had a special way of judgment, so the opportunities and rewards they handed out were usually best suited for the cultivator.</p>
<p>For example, Ran Yu and Gu Luo had both obtained Intermediary Spirit Pearls, the reason being their weakness in laws.</p>
<p>But Yi Yun obtained the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis"?</p>
<p>This made many people find it interesting. It was well known that humans could not temper their bodies, so for the Ancient Fey Edifice to give a "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis" to Yi Yun was no doubt smacking Yi Yun in the face.</p>
<p>"It appears like Junior Brother Yi's body is too weak, resulting in the Ancient Fey Edifice to hand a body-tempering cultivation technique to make up for it. If Junior Brother Yi is confident, he can attempt learning it." Ran Yu said to Yi Yun with a smile that did not look like one.</p>
<p>Time was very precious for warriors in their youth. If Yi Yun was being prideful and remained indignant which resulted in him attempting to temper his body, it would definitely waste a lot of his time. This was an outcome Ran Yu was very willing to see.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, don't be provoked by him. It's best you cultivate on laws properly. As for body-tempering, it's not that humans can't do so, but the amount of effort and resources required outweighs the outcome from tempering one's body. The gains cannot make up for the losses."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was afraid that Yi Yun might be hot-headed due to his youth, and if he were to be led astray, the outcome would be disastrous.</p>
<p>"Thank you Senior Sister Luo for your advice. This Junior Brother will keep it in mind."</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a glance at the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis" before keeping it into his interspatial ring.</p>
<p>Although Ran Yu had deliberately belittled him, what he said was indeed true. His body was a pure Yang body, and this pure Yang body was inclined towards laws. As for body-tempering techniques, it was about having powerful bones, blood, muscles and veins. It had nothing to do with a pure Yang body.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal. If he truly cultivated in body-tempering techniques, he could use the Purple Crystal to absorb large amounts of energy to reconstruct his body even if his body was not up to standard. It was still possible for him to cultivate in body-tempering techniques. It was just as Luo Fengling said, the amount of effort and resources could not outweigh the results. There was no need to do so.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not mind the first reward. After all, it was given by the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column. He had barely gained its recognition, so it was expected that the reward he obtained wasn't good.</p>
<p>And next...</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>Another light curtain rushed out of the chasm, straight for Yi Yun!</p>
<p>After the Seven-colored Phoenix divine column, there was the Empress Earth Dao Tree and Extreme Yang Illumination. Yi Yun had obtained Hibernation Awakening in both the two divine columns.</p>
<p>"The first reward runs counter to Yi Yun's cultivation path. I'm interested to see what is the second reward he will receive. If it runs counter again from his path, that would be interesting." Ran Yu said with a laugh.</p>
<p>He admitted that Yi Yun's nomological insights were good, but he still looked down on Yi Yun's origins and bloodline. Although he had obtained ratings of Hibernation Awakening, the opportunities given by the twelve Fey divine columns might not be something he could necessarily enjoy.</p>
<p>His body and cultivation level was weak. If the item he received could not immediately improve his strength, it would also not help out at the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>In the Luo Divine Hall trials, no matter how high one's talent in laws were, it was useless because strength was everything.</p>
<p>"I might not beat you in the Ancient Fey Edifice's twelve columns, but the Luo Divine Hall trials are what's critical. I will certainly surpass you." Ran Yu said silently in his heart.</p>
<p>At this moment, the light curtain had landed in Yi Yun's palm.</p>
<p>It was a squarish stone box.</p>
<p>This stone box looked ordinary and even looked a bit crude.</p>
<p>However, no one dared to belittle it. Quite a number of people shared the same thoughts as Ran Yu, believing that regardless of how good the items Yi Yun received, his low cultivation realm would render them temporarily useless. However, they still knew that the opportunity he received would not be bad.</p>
<p>This was a reward given out for a Hibernation Awakening rating.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the stone box in his hand. It was about the length of a forearm and was simple in appearance. It did not appear special while held in his hand, and the aura inside it was completely isolated. He also had no idea what it was.</p>
<p>Chapter 825: Ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon</p>
<p>Yi Yun ignored the gazes of others as he slowly open the stone box.</p>
<p>When the stone box opened, a chilling aura immediately emanated. The aura was like a water wave that instantly filled the entire area.</p>
<p>While everyone was immersed in this aura, they could not help but quiver. They sensed a baffling sense of pressure and found it difficult to stand properly.</p>
<p>What sort of aura was this?</p>
<p>People were alarmed, and the reason why they couldn't stand properly was not because of the powerful aura, but mostly the pressure they felt from it.</p>
<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"That aura from just now is very odd!"</p>
<p>As the aura rushed past them, they felt their bodies turn cold.</p>
<p>What was stored in this stone box?</p>
<p>Yi Yun opened the stone box completely as his eyes also flickered with a look of anticipation.</p>
<p>He was indeed too young to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials. And it was because of this reason that he needed to grasp every opportunity he had to raise his strength, allowing him to have greater confidence in the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wanted to look for Lin Xintong, and if he could increase his strength by leaps and bounds through the Luo Divine Hall trials, it would be much simpler for him to traverse the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven in the future.</p>
<p>The moment the stone box was opened, it appeared as though what lay inside the box did not seem particularly special compared to the cold and rugged aura.</p>
<p>It was a white bone that was crystalline like jade, exuding a faint shimmer.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples did not react when they saw this white bone, but Cang Mang, who was hovering mid air in a seating position, stood up. Even the large snake coiled around him raised its head.</p>
<p>"This is...an Ancient Fey bone!"</p>
<p>Cang Mang could not even maintain his calm as he looked at the Fey bone.</p>
<p>"Ancient Fey bone!?"</p>
<p>Cang Mang's voice was heard by all the cultivators.</p>
<p>A tiny phantom swirled in the white-as-jade bone, as though it contained a spirit.</p>
<p>These cultivators were all members of the Fey race, so how could they not have heard of Ancient Fey bones?</p>
<p>However, if it came to seeing one, this was the first time Ran Yu saw one, much less those disciples from smaller family clans.</p>
<p>"Ancient Fey bone...How can it be!?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's face went pale when Cang Mang exclaimed that Yi Yun had obtained an Ancient Fey bone. As he looked at the bone, he clenched his fists tightly causing them to tremble gently.</p>
<p>"It's actually an Ancient Fey bone! The Ancient Fey Edifice's twelve ancient divine columns actually prepared an Ancient Fey bone for a human!"</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had three major categories of Fey race — Heaven Fey, Earth Fey and Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was Heaven Fey, and he was considered to have outstanding talent. He was the favored child of the Heavens, but the reason why Heaven Fey were strong was because of their ancestors. They were split off from Ancient Fey, inheriting the Ancient Fey's bloodline.</p>
<p>What was Ancient Fey? Other than the twelve Fey Gods— the dragons and phoenix in the skies, and the Kun Peng in the sea — from Chaos, the Golden Crow, Qilin, Musical Dragon, Baxia, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger were all Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>These Ancient Fey were powerful and mighty as were the primordial divine beasts of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Of course, there were differences amongst Ancient Fey. A pure-blooded True Dragon was thousands of times more powerful than a Flood Dragon with mixed bloodlines.</p>
<p>But even a Flood Dragon's bone was invaluable because the bones contained bone runes and blood marrow!</p>
<p>After Ancient Fey died, their flesh and blood would return to the world, leaving only their bones behind. The runes within the bones carved the laws the Ancient Fey practiced when they were alive.</p>
<p>As for blood marrow, that was where the mighty power of the Ancient Fey's bloodline was.</p>
<p>The blood marrow could be transplanted directly to the bodies of warriors, changing their physique greatly. This would strengthen a warrior's body, allowing the warrior to gain a tremendous leap in power!</p>
<p>And it was this reason that the Desolate Heaven Masters of the Luo clan would find it a waste refining the Ancient Fey bones into relics, instead they would use mystic techniques to directly absorb the Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>Why did Heaven Fey have a superiority complex from birth? It was because of their powerful bodies when they inherited the bloodline of Ancient Fey at birth.</p>
<p>For example, the Xushui Ran clan, their ancestors had inherited the bloodline of the "Ranyi Fish".</p>
<p>The "Ranyi Fish" was a kind of Ancient Fey. The "Ten Thousand Fey Classic of Mountains and Seas" recounts: The Ranyi Fish has the body of a fish and a head of a snake. It has six legs, and eyes that of a horse. Obtaining a scale of the Ranyi Fish allows warriors to distance themselves from dream terrors and remove mental demons.</p>
<p>The Xushui Ran clan may have inherited the Ranyi Fish's bloodline, but its concentration was not necessarily high. A genius within the clan was able to awaken the ancient bloodline to obtain a scale, but for Ran Yu, he was far from awakening the ancient Ranyi Fish bloodline.</p>
<p>If Ran Yu received a bone of the Ranyi Fish and absorbed it, the concentration of his bloodline would improve to a whole new level, making it more possible for him to awaken his ancient bloodline.</p>
<p>However, Ancient Fey bones were too valuable. Although the Xushui Ran family clan had remnant bones of the ancient Ranyi Fish, they were all an accumulation and bedrock of the family clan, so it was impossible for them to give it to Ran Yu for his use.</p>
<p>Ran Yu had eyed the bones of the Ranyi Fish in his family clan for a very long time, but he had never been able to obtain it. But now, Yi Yun had already obtained an Ancient Fey bone!</p>
<p>How could this not make him envious!?</p>
<p>Humans had good perception in laws, but their physical strength was bad. However, if it was reconstituted using the blood marrow in the Ancient Fey bones...</p>
<p>It would not be impossible for him to cultivate the "Nine Volumed Celestial Axis"!</p>
<p>Previously, Ran Yu and Lie Ya had mocked Yi Yun for his weak body, and how the twelve divine columns had given Yi Yun a body-tempering cultivation technique that he could not use. However, before they could even laugh for long, the ancient divine columns had prepared an Ancient Fey bone for Yi Yun, making them nearly vomit blood.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's weak body could be made up with the Ancient Fey bone!</p>
<p>"Why is the Ancient Fey Edifice favoring this kid so much? To give an Ancient Fey bone to a human with such a weak body is a waste of a heavenly treasure. If it's given to me, I might be able to awaken the ancient Ranyi Fish bloodline!"</p>
<p>Seeing the stone box in Yi Yun's hands, Ran Yu's entrails churned.</p>
<p>The reason why he had restored his calm and regained his superiority over Yi Yun was all because of his body being much stronger than Yi Yun, a hallmark of the Fey race. But now, Yi Yun's body condition was also chasing up to him.</p>
<p>The more Ran Yu thought, the more envious he became. Unknowingly, a killing intent effused from his body.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a cold gaze was projected onto Ran Yu, giving him a rude awakening. Turning his head, he saw the large python beside Cang Mang staring coldly at him.</p>
<p>If Ran Yu could not resist the temptation and ended up doing something rash, he would immediately be attacked by the large python.</p>
<p>Ran Yu took a deep breath and remained silent.</p>
<p>At this moment, Cang Mang said to Yi Yun, "The Ancient Fey bone in your hand is the tail bone of an ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon might not be considered a very powerful Ancient Fey, but even so this piece of Fey bone is something of considerable worth in the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. The tail bone of the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon is most suitable for warriors at your cultivation level. At a higher cultivation level, the effects would become increasingly weaker. This is quite an opportunity for you, so make sure you make full use of it."</p>
<p>Chapter 826: Protective Charm</p>
<p>With even Cang Mang saying so, the other Fire Cloud State disciples looked at Yi Yun with even greater jealousy.</p>
<p>This was an Ancient Fey bone!</p>
<p>"It's such a waste of treasure to give this Fey bone to Yi Yun. With a human's physique, absorbing an Ancient Fey bone would result in a lot of waste. If it were given to us, it would be put to full use. What a pity." Someone said while clenching his teeth. And the moment he said that, another light curtain burst forward.</p>
<p>"It shot out from the Extreme Yang Illumination divine column."</p>
<p>"There's still more!"</p>
<p>Everyone watched as Yi Yun reached his hand out to grab the light curtain.</p>
<p>As the light curtain landed in Yi Yun's hand, it seemed like it had spiritual intelligence to it. It burst open, revealing a small burning fire plume that was golden in color. Upon seeing this flame, Ran Yu, who was the closest to it, immediately felt his scalp tingle as he hurriedly took a deep breath to resist the urge of dodging.</p>
<p>The other cultivators also had their faces change as they moved their sights away. Why did that small fire plume resemble a tiny golden crow? Looking straight at it made their eyes hurt. Even those standing on the stone bridge furthest from the Empress Earth Dao Tree stone bridge felt as though the hair on their bodies were being burnt to a crisp.</p>
<p>The golden crow appeared only for an instant before it disappeared, eventually reducing to a charm. This charm looked bland, but the scene from before made everyone feel like all the energy from before was stored inside that thin charm, adding a hint of danger to it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had also obtained a charm!</p>
<p>Ran Yu's fist immediately clenched even tighter. They had both received charms, but it was obvious that Yi Yun's charm was of a higher grade than his.</p>
<p>Previously, receiving a charm had made Ran Yu feel relieved, but now, there was no way he could compete with the charm Yi Yun obtained.</p>
<p>This was likely a protective charm. The main reason for the Ancient Fey Edifice to give a protective charm was to prevent a genius from dying before having fully matured. There was a body-tempering cultivation technique, an Ancient Fey bone, and now, there was a protective charm. Its protection and care for Yi Yun was too thoughtful!</p>
<p>"This Yi Yun always gets items that don't match his strength at all!" Ran Yu said hatefully in his heart.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Yi Yun happened to glance at Ran Yu. As though he had seen through Ran Yu's thoughts, he said with a smile, "Senior Brother Ran, it seems my luck isn't too bad either."</p>
<p>Ran Yu immediately felt his chest turn stuffy as he snorted and said, "Your luck is good, but it's such a pity for those treasures!"</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's cultivation realm and his body as a human, how much of the Ancient Fey bone could he absorb? It was already much harder for humans to absorb Ancient Fey bones when compared to the Fey race. This meant that a large portion of the Ancient Fey bone would be wasted!</p>
<p>It could be ignored if it was just wasting ordinary medicinal items, but if it was wasting an Ancient Fey bone, it would be a great pity!</p>
<p>As for that charm, it also needed one's Yuan Qi to activate it. The stronger one was, the stronger the effects of the charm. If one was weak, the effects would naturally be smaller.</p>
<p>In terms of cultivation realm and physique, Yi Yun was far inferior!</p>
<p>This was not only Ran Yu's thoughts, but the other Fire Cloud State disciples also had similar thoughts.</p>
<p>In that case, even if Yi Yun improved his body, it would also be severely limited. It would still not be sufficient compared to their bodies as Fey race.</p>
<p>Gu Luo opened his only eye and also stared at Yi Yun constantly, only turning his head away when Yi Yun sensed his lifeless gaze.</p>
<p>Cang Mang glanced at the cultivators on the stone bridge with a faint smile that did not look like one. Yi Yun's talent in laws was indeed amazing, and he was truly outstanding this time. At the same training, Yi Yun had not only obtained a high rating, but the opportunities he received were also very good. Furthermore, his strength and age was the lowest amongst the other disciples. So how could the disciples who always thought so highly of themselves be able to remain nonchalant?</p>
<p>It was normal to feel jealous and be unbalanced over this matter. For this, Cang Mang did not interfere as this was what the Luo Divine Hall trials acquiesced.</p>
<p>Geniuses were never rare, and there was no lack of geniuses who died. Only a genius who could truly mature was worthy of being nurtured and valued.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was indeed too young and his cultivation realm was too low. Although the items he received were good, they did not suit him.</p>
<p>For example, if Yi Yun absorbed the Ancient Fey bone at the Heaven Ascension realm, the results would be much better than if he absorbed it now. But even at the Heaven Ascension realm, he would still not be able to match the effects if it were a Heaven Fey that absorbed it.</p>
<p>But, what if he waited till he broke through to the Heaven Ascension realm? By then, Yi Yun would probably have been eliminated at the Luo Divine Hall, and might have even died...</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Cang Mang's eyes glanced at Ran Yu once again.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had stolen the limelight, he would not be able to lead the coming days well.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun, no one paid any attention to the opportunities received by the rest.</p>
<p>Quickly, all the rewards from the twelve Fey divine columns were in the cultivators' hands. Deep in the chasm down below, a sound that sounded like a tsunami was heard.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was startled before he recalled that the area beneath was a blue hole of an endless sea. It was unknown what massive marine animal had produced the stir from before...</p>
<p>"You can go out now!" Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After they came out of the interspatial space, Bai Chen walked over.</p>
<p>His expression did not look too good. Seeing how the cultivators that had come along with him enter the interspatial space, while he had to wait outside, there was naturally extreme bitterness in him.</p>
<p>Bai Chen saw Yi Yun from afar and walked towards Luo Fengling and asked, "Junior sister Fengling, what opportunities did you and Junior Brother Yi Yun receive?"</p>
<p>Luo Fengling's face revealed an envious look as she said, "What I received is not worth mentioning, but for Junior Brother Yi Yun...he received an Ancient Fey bone..."</p>
<p>"What?" Ancient Fey's bone!?"</p>
<p>After hearing Luo Fengling's description, Bai Chen felt as though he had heard wrongly, but when he saw how all the other Fire Cloud State disciples, including Luo Fengling, did not have any other reaction, they were clearly giving unspoken acknowledgment. Bai Chen finally confirmed the fact as he squeezed a smile that looked uglier than crying.</p>
<p>"Congratulations to Junior Brother Yi."</p>
<p>Bai Chen also noticed that the cultivators that walked out were either intentionally or unintentionally looking at Yi Yun. At this moment, Yi Yun was just too striking.</p>
<p>"Truly far behind..."</p>
<p>Bai Chen shook his head and did not speak any further. He walked to a side himself as he felt that standing beside Yi Yun made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling too had mixed emotions. Just as she was about to walk towards Yi Yun, she saw him take the initiative to walk over.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun..." Luo Fengling sighed as she looked at Yi Yun. Back then, she had saved Yi Yun from the void of space, thinking that Yi Yun could be made a steward disciple. She had never paid much attention to Yi Yun, but who knew that in such a short period of time, she had been flung far away from Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, Luo Fengling was resolute in her own way. She might have suffered a crushing defeat in the Ancient Fey Edifice, and not considering Yi Yun, she might be considered below average amongst all the cultivators present, but at the true Luo Divine Hall trials, she would still put in her best.</p>
<p>Chapter 827: Black Wind Valley</p>
<p>"Congratulations Junior Brother Yi. After today, you would definitely be somebody in the Fire Cloud State." Luo Fengling said sincerely.</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled before looking in Bai Chen's direction.</p>
<p>Previously, Bai Chen was in high spirits when he came to the Ancient Fey Edifice, but now, he had lost all of his comportment, as though his entire being was covered in a layer of dust.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Bai Chen appears to have been dealt a heavy blow," Luo Fengling said. "The Luo Divine Hall trials happen once every sixty years. It has yet to officially begin, but the competition is already this intense."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling sighed. The world of warriors was as such and the situation was unavoidable. If Bai Chen could not recover from his setback, and suffer a damaged state of mind, his future in martial arts would be limited. It might even come to a halt and no longer proceed forward.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded as he saw the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples standing across the hall. Seeing these Fire Cloud State disciples come out, Luo Tian did not lead his people over, but instead watched from afar.</p>
<p>Separated by such a distance, Yi Yun and Luo Tian looked each other in the eye.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luo Tian's eyes burned with fighting spirit as a glint flashed in his eye.</p>
<p>Luo Tian transmitted his voice, "You are very good and I'm very satisfied! It appears that other than Tian Shi in the Fire Cloud State, there is still an opponent to look forward to. However, your laws may be strong, but your strength is too weak. When the time comes, don't disappoint me!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned slightly. This person sure was trouble. Previously he was so ashamed to even stand here, but now, here he came being provocative again.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey column was just a training ground of Mt. Azure Billow. To put it bluntly, it was just a place for these disciples to gain some benefits! The obtaining of the twelve Fey divine columns' recognition was a test of one's nomological insight. And passing them naturally led to the receiving of opportunities. Those who did not pass were not punished at all, so the entire process was without any danger.</p>
<p>However, the other collective training spots in Mt. Azure Billow were not that relaxing!</p>
<p>Mt. Azure Billow was a gigantic mountain. After leaving the Ancient Fey Edifice, they returned to the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>Woosh. The wind howled and soon, the spirit cruiser pierced through blue nebula before it began to make an abrupt descent into a valley.</p>
<p>This valley was extremely steep, so steep that if one did not see it with one's own eyes, it was hard to imagine that Mt. Azure Billow, which looked like an immortal's paradise from afar, would have such a place where even birds found hard to cross.</p>
<p>Deep underneath the valley was a surging black river. Black gas rose up into the sky from it, filling the entire valley. From the moment Yi Yun walked out the spirit cruiser, he immediately wrinkled his brows. He saw some people conjuring their protective Yuan Qi, but for people like Ran Yu, they appeared calm and composed.</p>
<p>"This Black Wind Valley is the second venue of your collective training. Before leaving Black Wind Valley, you have a month's time to train up. I believe you have already discovered that Black Wind Valley is extremely dangerous. It constantly emits toxic gases that would eat at your bodies and even your sanity. Those who feel like they can't take it, it's best you put up your protective Yuan Qi constantly. However, even with protective Yuan Qi, it will also constantly be eroded." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>However, despite saying so, he himself did not do so. The large python coiled around him also appeared unaffected.</p>
<p>"As for what Black Wind Valley tests, it will be the Fey race bloodlines left in your bodies!"</p>
<p>With Cang Mang saying this, all the Fey race present was taken by surprise that the Black Wind Valley tested the Fey race's bloodline.</p>
<p>"Fey race bloodline!" Ran Yu clenched his fists tightly as his eyes shimmered.</p>
<p>Finally, it finally was something he was good at.</p>
<p>He belonged to the Xushui Ran clan. His ancestor possessed the Ranyi Fish's bloodline, the pride of the Ran clan as well as his.</p>
<p>He was not good at laws, but would he be afraid of anyone when it came to a test of the Fey race's bloodline?</p>
<p>Upon thinking of this, Ran Yu looked at Yi Yun with a sneer suffusing across his lips.</p>
<p>There was no need to say that this time, this was his home turf. There was nothing that Yi Yun, a human, could do. Even an Earth Fey was stronger than him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not speak, all he did was overlook the Black Wind Valley from the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>"Do you see the caves in the walls of the mountain?" With Cang Mang pointing them out, people managed to notice the mountain caves hidden by the thick black fog.</p>
<p>The entrances of those mountain caves were narrow, and they were not deep. There was just room for one person to sit in each. The entire mountain face was filled with densely packed mountain caves. The mountain caves below were shrouded by black toxic gases with no way of seeing them clearly. However, it was easy to guess that they reached all the way to the surface of the river.</p>
<p>This black toxic gas grew thinner with altitude, but deep below, it was like black ink. It was not a place one could last long there.</p>
<p>"These Black Wind Caves become even more fatal the lower you go. Stimulate the Fey race bloodlines in your body and using your bloodline, resist the black gases' erosion. A month later, those who fail to reach the fifth level, it is advised you go home. With that standard, going to the Luo Divine Hall trials would just be an embarrassment." Cang Mang said as he crossed his arms.</p>
<p>With this said, the cultivators were immediately taken aback. They had been chosen from the Fire Cloud State to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials. Now, before the trials began, there would be people eliminated at a collective training?</p>
<p>However, this was Lord Cang Mang, who had an extraordinary status in the Luo clan. People could really be eliminated just with a single word from him.</p>
<p>Especially for people like Bai Chen, their faces went slightly pale, but they had vigor in their hearts. They could not fail again!</p>
<p>"You don't have to feel indignant. Those who can't pass the training, do you think you would have the qualification to carry on wasting resources?" Cang Mang said without hesitation after seeing the cultivators' reactions.</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. Cang Mang was right. As warriors, if they were weaker than others, it was only deserving that they be eliminated.</p>
<p>However, was cultivating in a toxic environment a good thing?</p>
<p>"Hehe, don't underestimate the Black Wind Valley. I heard that the valley is filled with mysteries. As long as you reach the fifth level and below, you will naturally experience the benefits." A cultivator who knew some of the secrets said with glee. In fact, he had only heard others talk about the Black Wind Valley, and now, with him being the only person to talk about it, it made a normal cultivator like him to be the focus of attention.</p>
<p>"What you said isn't wrong, but reaching the fifth level is easy, but to really get any benefits, the seventh level is just the beginning." Ran Yu suddenly said in a cold manner.</p>
<p>Ever since the Ancient Fey Edifice training began, he appeared colder than before. Although that person had been unceremoniously debunked by Ran Yu, his heart skipped a beat after seeing Ran Yu's ice-like face after flashing a trace of fury in his eyes. He did not dare speak further.</p>
<p>"Seventh level is just the beginning?"</p>
<p>The cultivators looked downwards. At the seventh level, that was truly the zone where the toxic gases became extremely thick. They were still in mid air, but there were already people who needed to use their protective Yuan Qi. Some warriors who endured for a while also began to feel their bodies ache all over and could not help but conjure their protective Yuan Qi. Besides, as Cang Mang said, they could sense that the Yuan Qi around them was slowly being eroded away. Although the speed wasn't significantly fast, it was expected that some people's protective Yuan Qi would not hold up once they reached the fifth level.</p>
<p>As for reaching the seventh level? It was unimaginable how difficult that would be.</p>
<p>"All of you proceed below. The best way to resist the black gas is to stimulate your Fey race bloodline." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Chapter 828: Blood of the Blood Dragon</p>
<p>With Cang Mang saying this, many people looked at Yi Yun with faint smiles that were void of any good intent. Yi Yun was a human with much weaker physique. In the previous training segment, Yi Yun had stolen the limelight, but this time...this was the Fey race's home turf.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling walked over and said, "Junior Brother Yi, are you alright? Shall we go together? At least we can look out for one another."</p>
<p>Luo Fengling had said that because she was afraid of any misfortune that might befall onto Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Alright." Yi Yun nodded.</p>
<p>At this moment, many Fire Cloud State disciples were flying towards the Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Ran Yu also took a deep, meaningful glance at Yi Yun. He was destined to shine at this trial. He wanted to let everyone know how powerful the Xushui Ran clan's bloodline was.</p>
<p>He wanted to let Cang Mang see his strength and potential. He was still holding a grudge from being constantly ignored by Cang Mang.</p>
<p>"Sou!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu flew down rapidly, reaching straight to the fourth level of the Black Wind Valley!</p>
<p>Ran Yu began right at the fourth level. The Fire Cloud State disciples present only attempted the first level for starters.</p>
<p>"Ran Yu chose the fourth level immediately, but Gu Luo only chose the second level?"</p>
<p>"Gu Luo doesn't like to show off. It would probably not be difficult for him to directly reach the fourth level too."</p>
<p>Many people felt mixed emotions. Many of them were Earth and Heaven Fey. However, despite being Heaven Fey, the difference in bloodlines was different. Powerful bloodlines made others extremely jealous.</p>
<p>Having just landed at the fourth level, Ran Yu felt the black mist around him seem to suddenly come alive. They bared their fangs and brandished their claws, turning into the forms of various Fey beasts or haunting ghosts, before they pounced at Ran Yu.</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's protective Yuan Qi burst forward around him, forming a jade-colored halo.</p>
<p>Some of the black gases were immediately reflected by the halo, but the black gas that transformed into Fey beasts and haunting ghosts were able to directly penetrate Ran Yu's jade-colored protective Yuan Qi, as they continued pouncing at Ran Yu!</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Black Wind Valley's black gases are very strange. They can absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi here, slowly transforming their bodies. Some of the black gases can even give rise to intelligence. And these black gases that have some form can penetrate protective Yuan Qi without any effects. That is to say, there is no way to withstand the black gas by just using one's protective Yuan Qi!" said one of the Fire Cloud State disciples who knew about the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>As the Fire Cloud State disciple was saying this, the black gases had already penetrated the protective Yuan Qi barrier as they headed straight for Ran Yu. Just as it was about to enter Ran Yu's body, Ran Yu suddenly let out a shout.</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>Behind Ran Yu, an intense bloodline aura burst out. The red bloodline aura was like a spurting flame, burning through the void!</p>
<p>"Chi! Chi! Chi!"</p>
<p>The black gases were burned by the bloodline aura, melting away like snow under intense heat.</p>
<p>Behind Ran Yu, the bloodline aura finally transformed into a six-legged strange fish. It had a fish body and a snake head. Its scales were engraved with mysterious water runes.</p>
<p>"It's the Ranyi Fish." Someone said enviously.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish was an Ancient Fey that lived in the water. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, there was a myriad of Ancient Fey, and the strengths between different Ancient Fey varied greatly.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish did not have outstanding strength amongst the wide variety of Ancient Fey, but the Xushui Ran clan had inherited the pure bloodline of the Ranyi Fish which made it no trifling matter. Many Heaven Fey liked to boast about the bloodlines of dragons or phoenixes that their ancestors possessed. It may sound amazing, but in fact, they had very low concentration of those bloodlines. The strength left behind for their descendants were naturally much weaker.</p>
<p>If a Heaven Fey's bloodline concentration was high enough, they could form the phantom image of an Ancient Fey using their own body's blood aura, just like Ran Yu.</p>
<p>This was a technique that made many Heaven Fey envious.</p>
<p>If one was a little stronger, they would have the ability to summon the Ancient Fey, which was to gather the real power of the Ancient Fey from the cosmos, and was also known as "bloodline awakening"!</p>
<p>Now, Ran Yu was still a good distance away from this awakening. Heaven Fey that possessed the power of awakening were greatly vied for, even in the Luo clan royal capital.</p>
<p>After Ran Yu condensed the Ranyi Fish phantom image, the red blood aura appeared to be without resistance. It raged wantonly in the black mist as large numbers of the Fey beasts and haunting ghosts formed from the black gas were torn apart and devoured!</p>
<p>"The bloodline phantom image formed by Ran Yu is devouring the black mist?"</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, people were amazed. "That bloodline phantom image appears to be devouring the black mist to strengthen itself?"</p>
<p>"That's right." At this moment, Cang Mang nodded. "This is the opportunity the Black Wind Valley provides. There's no harm in me telling you this. Hundreds of millions of years ago, an extremely powerful Ancient Fey, rumored to be a degenerated Blood Dragon had its corpse torn apart in the Black Wind Valley. The degenerated Blood Dragon's blood that flowed out dyed the Black Wind Valley red, before turning into the black mist that remains present to this day.</p>
<p>"The black mist went from its initial birth till they took up form, eventually generating intelligence. Over a long period that spanned tens of millions of years, their bodies have been able to accumulate pure Heaven Earth essence. If you can devour them, it will strengthen the power of your bloodline. However, if you fail to devour it, you might end up being devoured by the black mist. In more severe cases, your soul might be wiped away; hence, cultivation in the Black Wind Valley is actually very dangerous!"</p>
<p>When Cang Mang said this, he gave a meaningful glance at the Fire Cloud State disciples in front of him.</p>
<p>The weaker ones turned slightly pale in the face.</p>
<p>The blood left behind by a degenerated Blood Dragon had produced the black mist? Then, it was no wonder that absorbing the black mist would strengthen their own bloodlines.</p>
<p>However, the black mist was too terrifying. If one wasn't careful, one's consciousness could be devoured by the black mist, turning them into retards. Then, it was truly no different from being dead.</p>
<p>"Look, Ran Yu has already reached the fifth level!" Someone suddenly said amongst the crowd.</p>
<p>Already the fifth level!?</p>
<p>Previously, when Ran Yu came to the caves at the fourth level, he had suddenly conjured the Ancient Fey bloodline in his body, devouring large amounts of black mist. The beings in the black mist had intelligence so knowing that they were no match for Ran Yu, they escaped.</p>
<p>Hence, Ran Yu went straight for the fifth level!</p>
<p>After the fifth level, the pressure increased sharply.</p>
<p>And this level was the threshold Cang Mang mentioned. If one could not reach this level by the end of the Black Wind Valley trial, Cang Mang could directly eliminate them from participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Many Fire Cloud State disciples were still worrying over their entrance into the fifth level, but Ran Yu was already at the fifth level from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And from the looks of it, Ran Yu was still able to hold up at the fifth level.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was at the fifth level, while Gu Luo was still at the second. As for the others, they had only just begun at the first level in an attempt to adapt to the intensity of the black gases.</p>
<p>The situation was clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Although Gu Luo was at the second level, he had yet to stimulate his Ancient Fey bloodline. He was resisting the black mist only with his powerful body!</p>
<p>It was terrifying just to think of using one's body to resist the black mist.</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of time before Gu Luo reaches the fifth level. He might even have the ability to reach the fifth level now, just that he is no hurry. But for us, we can't not be anxious about it, or we might be eliminated before we reach the Luo Divine Hall. It would be a waste of the chance the Fire Cloud State has given us!"</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, let us go down too. Let's begin from the first level and take it slow. Maybe you can approach the first level from a distance and not be in a hurry to descend. At least, there will be an adaptive process."</p>
<p>Chapter 829: Yi Yun Descends Black Wind Valley</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was still somewhat worried for Yi Yun as she looked at him.</p>
<p>Legend said that the ancient degenerated Blood Dragon was a result of the egg of True Dragon being marred by evil blood. This caused the baby dragon to mutate before it hatched. After it hatched, it would be a crimson-colored degenerated Blood Dragon.</p>
<p>Blood Dragons were cruel and bloodthirsty. It devoured billions of living creatures to strengthen its body and might even be more powerful than True Dragons, but as it traversed the unorthodox path, its aura was messy and violent after devouring too many creatures. This resulted in it having a very short lifespan.</p>
<p>It was a pity that the most precious bones and dragon spine of the ancient Blood Dragon was gone, leaving only the dragon blood behind that had merged with Black Wind Valley as one.</p>
<p>The Black Wind Valley which was refined by the dragon blood could be considered an impressive treasure itself.</p>
<p>In such a dangerous area, Yi Yun did not have the bloodlines of Ancient Fey, nor did he have a powerful body. With protective Yuan Qi losing its effects, it was naturally much harder for him to descend into Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Actually, even Luo Fengling herself lacked the confidence, much less Yi Yun. Although she too was a Heaven Fey, the concentration of her bloodline was greatly inferior to Ran Yu's.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded as he looked at Black Wind Valley in a thoughtful manner.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, what are you looking at?" At this moment, a schadenfreudian voice came from Lie Ya as he grinned. He flew next to Yi Yun and said, "Don't give up, but why did you have to be human? It's understandable that you have a weak physique. Your laws are strong, but it appears to be useless. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, all that matters is after all bloodline. The Luo Divine Hall trials were tailored for the Fey race, not humans. So what if your laws are strong? That will be the only aspect that you will shine in. If you can't pass the obstacle in front of you, you won't even be able to go to the Luo Divine Hall."</p>
<p>Lie Ya smiled happily. What did it mean to being able to walk with one's head held high? This was what it meant to being able to walk with one's head held high!</p>
<p>He had been stifled by Yi Yun previously, because just on the nomological aspect, Yi Yun had completely desecrated Lie Ya with every aspect of his combined. Now, having finally seen Yi Yun encounter a setback, how could he not take the opportunity to taunt Yi Yun? It could be that as Yi Yun matured with the passing of time, the gap in their strength would become bigger. He might not be able to see Yi Yun's back even if he wanted to taunt.</p>
<p>"Hahaha, Junior Brother Yi, this senior brother is going ahead!" Lie Ya roared with laughter and without waiting for Yi Yun's response, he had jumped down towards Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>He jumped straight for the second level!</p>
<p>The reason why Lie Ya chose the second level from the beginning was because he was confident of his own body's strength. Secondly, he intended to show off. Having said those words that allowed him to hold his head high, how could he not let his actions accompany his words? How could he not do a perfect act of establishing his dominance?</p>
<p>The moment Lie Ya arrived in the second level, he immediately sensed the pressure from the black winds.</p>
<p>With a roar, his bones began to crackle as needle-like hair grew from his body. His eyes turned luminous green with a long tail behind him!</p>
<p>This was the transformation of the Fey race.</p>
<p>"Lie Ya is mixed-blood. He has both the bloodlines of a Heaven and Earth Fey. Although he cannot summon the power of his ancestors through the use of his blood like Ran Yu, he can use the Earth Fey's transformation to resist the black gas." Luo Fengling said while standing beside Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Many Earth Fey in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven were beasts, trees, birds, fish or plants who achieved their Dao after living for a very long period of time. To put it bluntly, they were ordinary Fey.</p>
<p>Earth Fey were the direct descendants of these ordinary Fey, so they could transform into the shape of beasts.</p>
<p>However, Heaven Fey were unable to do so. Their ancestors were Ancient Fey. Firstly, their bloodline heritage had been passed down for a long period of time, and secondly, the bloodline they inherited was thin, so for them to transform into an Ancient Fey? It was unknown and probably unimaginable how concentrated the Fey bloodline had to be to do so.</p>
<p>Hence, the technique of transformation was a trait of Earth Fey.</p>
<p>Transformation gave Earth Fey great strength, and now, Lie Ya was enjoying the effects of it.</p>
<p>He let out a wolf howl in a carefree manner, jumping straight from the second level to the third level!</p>
<p>"Ao woo!"</p>
<p>Although Lie Ya could barely withstand the third level, he still howled at Yi Yun, who was still in the air. The provocation was self-evident.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun lost his cool and rushed straight for the third level, the black gas would erode his consciousness, turning him into a retard.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, we'll be going down too. We'll wait down there for you."</p>
<p>A few Fire Cloud State disciples said to Yi Yun with spurious smiles before descending Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>None of these people had any kind intentions when it came to Yi Yun. They were all waiting for him to suffer.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, don't get provoked by them." Luo Fengling exhorted Yi Yun. After all, Yi Yun had stolen the limelight previously, but he now encountered great restrictions. She was worried that Yi Yun could not accept the stark differences.</p>
<p>"Thank you Senior Sister Luo, I know very well." Yi Yun said as he slowly flew down towards Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was not wrong at all. The Luo Divine Hall trials were prepared for the Fey race and not tailored for humans. Most of the test methods were considered from the Fey race's point of view. There was nothing unfair about it; after all, the road of martial arts was never about fairness, only victory and defeat!</p>
<p>Without any further ado, Yi Yun landed in the first level. He did not know anything about Black Wind Valley, so starting from the first level was the most secure way of doing things.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling also landed in the first level of Black Wind Valley with Yi Yun. After that, Luo Fengling immediately conjured her bloodline's power to resist the intrusion of the black gas.</p>
<p>Although Luo Fengling was with Yi Yun, it was obviously impossible for her to help Yi Yun at all.</p>
<p>Many Fire Cloud State disciples were looking at Yi Yun with schadenfreudian looks. They were waiting for Yi Yun to put on a show.</p>
<p>Cang Mang also looked at Yi Yun. He was very interested in Yi Yun, but he did not take extra care of Yi Yun. In the Luo clan, everyone was given equal opportunities.</p>
<p>"Roar!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a few black gas blobs transformed into the shape of Fey beasts beside Yi Yun, before pouncing right at him.</p>
<p>These Fey beasts looked extremely realistic up close. They had hideous blue faces, cruel with tumultuous killing intent.</p>
<p>Yi Yun conjured his protective Yuan Qi. The Yuan Qi barrier that contained the power of pure Yang was like an indestructible golden bell shield, enveloping Yi Yun within.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, there were people who immediately shook their heads. It was already mentioned that protective Yuan Qi was useless, yet he conjured it?</p>
<p>"Chi! Chi! Chi!"</p>
<p>When the black gases struck Yi Yun's protective Yuan Qi, only a portion of the black gas was burnt up by the Yuan Qi shields.</p>
<p>However, those Fey beasts that had taken form could penetrate the pure Yang Yuan Qi shield and continue charging at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun pricked his eyebrows. Indeed, as Cang Mang said, Black Wind Valley tested the bloodline of the Fey race. The black gas that had taken form already possessed intelligence. They could ignore the protective Yuan Qi and were only devoured by a Fey race's bloodline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, energy with intelligence and life could not be absorbed by the Purple Crystal. Besides, the black gas was not purely energy. Yi Yun could sense a high concentration of blood aura in the black gas which was likely attributed to the Blood Dragon's blood. The degenerated Blood Dragon had devoured countless creatures, so the resentment in these creatures remained in the Blood Dragon's blood.</p>
<p>"The black gas left behind by the degenerated Blood Dragon is of a bizarre law. With my cultivation realm, trying to dominate over the laws left behind by the degenerated Blood Dragon is impossible. I can only go along with it. If my protective Yuan Qi is useless, and only a Fey race's bloodline can absorb the blood aura left behind by the degenerated Blood Dragon, maybe..."</p>
<p>As Yi Yun pondered, a few black Fey that had taken form charged at Yi Yun. They were cackling with laughter as they produced sounds that resembled the haunting wails of ghosts and howls of wolves.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was inferior to Gu Luo in certain ways. His body was not strong, so the moment his body was infiltrated by the black gas, he would immediately be in extreme danger.</p>
<p>Many people stared widely to watch this scene.</p>
<p>Just as people believed that Yi Yun was about to have the black gas infiltrate him, resulting in serious injuries even if his mind was not wiped out...</p>
<p>"Xiao!"</p>
<p>They heard a high-pitched scream. This sound came from within Yi Yun's chest as all the black gas Fey beasts' howls were masked by the sharp scream!</p>
<p>Oh? What happened?</p>
<p>People were taken by surprise. They looked at Yi Yun as a terrifying energy exploded behind Yi Yun, as though it was a burning black inferno. As the dancing tongues of flame roared towards the sky, people realized that it was not a fire snake on closer look, but gigantic snake heads. Every snake head was of different shape and size. Some of them had only one eye, while others had three. Some spat out flames while others spat our frost.</p>
<p>Nine snake heads and a massive body. This was the gigantic phantom image that appeared behind Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Nine Neonate!?</p>
<p>Many people finally understood that Yi Yun had summoned a Nine Neonate behind him!</p>
<p>"How is this possible? Could he have the bloodline of a Nine Neonate!?" Many people were alarmed. Nine Neonates, especially Nine Neonates that survived nine tribulations, were powerful Ancient Fey. Even mighty figures in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven would rather not face them in battle.</p>
<p>Heaven Fey who possed the bloodline of Nine Neonates were definitely of supreme status amongst the Heaven Fey!</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate bloodline naturally could not appear on a human's body!</p>
<p>"It's not a Nine Neonate bloodline. It's just his Aspect Totem, and the Nine Neonate in his Aspect Totem is just a One Tribulation Nine Neonate. It's still poles apart from nine tribulations, but...humans can use Aspect Totem in this way?"</p>
<p>People found it incredulous. After the Nine Neonate appeared, it began devouring the transformed black gases, devouring a blob of black gas in one mouthful, straight into its body.</p>
<p>Yi Yun cultivated the "Ten Thousand Beast Totem", which was an odd totem mystic technique. It was first brought to the Ten Thousand Beast Totem by the Azure Yang Lord.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had refined the Nine Neonate as a beast mark using the "Ten Thousand Beast Totem" mystic technique, but the Nine Neonate had yet to die. Instead, it had been merged within Yi Yun's body with the ability to continue growing.</p>
<p>Back when it merged into Yi Yun's body, the Nine Neonate had survived a lightning tribulation, with Yi Yun benefiting from it as well.</p>
<p>This was not just a pure Aspect Totem.</p>
<p>If it were the Aspect Totem other humans cultivated, in the form of swords or starlight, or phenomena like a luminous moon above the sea, these Aspect Totems were completely void of any relation with the Fey race.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun had injected his body's power into the Nine Neonate and absorbed the black gas using the Nine Neonate mark. Although a One Tribulation Nine Neonate was not strong, as a beast with the Ancient Fey bloodline, it was of higher nobility than tiger Fey or wolf Fey who achieved their Dao. It was more than sufficient to deal with the first level's black gases.</p>
<p>Chapter 830: Nine Neonate Tempering</p>
<p>The moment the Nine Neonate appeared, the Blood Dragon black gases around Yi Yun were immediately devoured by the nine snake heads.</p>
<p>After the Blood Dragon black gases were devoured, Yi Yun immediately could sense the joyful emotions of the Nine Neonate.</p>
<p>In the lower realm, the Nine Neonate was always lacking in resources, preventing it from growing stronger. Now, in the Mt. Azure Billow's Black Wind Valley of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, despite it being a land fraught with danger, the Nine Neonate welcomed it as if it was a fish in water. The Fey race's physiques could be strengthened by devouring the Blood Dragon black gas. As for the Nine Neonate, after it swallowed the black gas, wiping away the foul blood aura in it and merging it into the Nine Neonate mark also provided it pure blood energy.</p>
<p>The degenerated Blood Dragon had the bloodline of a True Dragon, and was also a noble existence amongst Fey beasts. And with the Nine Neonate being a beast of relatively noble bloodline, the Blood Dragon black gas was perfectly suitable as a supplement.</p>
<p>"This fellow!" Lie Ya's eyes flickered. He believed that Yi Yun would be out of tricks for this obstacle, so he had went to great lengths to mock him. He never expected the human to possess such an Aspect Totem, one that had a more noble bloodline than his!</p>
<p>"It's just a One Tribulation Nine Neonate!" Lie Ya's eyes flashed with ruthlessness before he stabilized his mind. The One Tribulation Nine Neonate was just an Aspect Totem. It was impossible to compare it with a true Fey body that he had cultivated for decades. Even if Yi Yun had the Nine Neonate, Yi Yun did not even need to think about getting to the fifth level.</p>
<p>The others had similar thoughts. They were stunned when they first saw the Nine Neonate appear from the human's body, but after coming round to, they did not find it anything remarkable. The totem mystic technique this human cultivated was just slightly more special and had to do with the Fey race, so it was no wonder there was such an effect.</p>
<p>It was impossible for a human like Yi Yun to use only his Aspect Totem to compare with their Fey race's bloodline.</p>
<p>The first level's Blood Dragon black gas was nothing much for the Fey race. Some of the Fey race could even withstand the level by just using their bodies.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he had to use his Aspect Totem. The Aspect Totem and the Fey race's stimulation of bloodline was similar, so having used this approach at the first level, what was he to do after that?</p>
<p>The first level's black gas had no effect on the Nine Neonate and instead provided it with food. The black gases already had their own intelligence, so with a sharp scream, they no longer charged at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Onwards to the second level!" Darting his eyes, Yi Yun's body immediately descended.</p>
<p>The nine snake heads behind him moved ferociously as though the gigantic Nine Neonate phantom image was a powerful Fey that descended from ancient times.</p>
<p>The second level's Blood Dragon black gas was much more coagulated than the first level's!</p>
<p>The number of black Fey hiding in the black gases that had taken form were greater in number than the first level.</p>
<p>The moment Yi Yun arrived at the second level, more than a dozen black Fey pounced out of the black gases, in an attempt to bite Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>Although these black Fey that had taken form did not have actual bodies, their fangs and claws were whole and sharp. With the foul energy condensed together, their close proximity to people made the people feel as though their meridians had frozen and their Yuan Qi flow retarded. Such black Fey that had taken form could drain a warrior who was lacking in strength in an instant.</p>
<p>Xiao—! The Nine Neonate phantom image let out a roar as the nine snake heads darted at the black Fey like nine bolts of black lightning. As the Blood Dragon black gases were stirred by the Nine Neonate, ear-piercing screams came from within!</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate held these black Fey in its mouths before tearing them apart. The dispersed black gases were then swallowed.</p>
<p>The foul blood aura was being refined by the Nine Neonate.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling watched in surprise. She was still at the first level, but Yi Yun had already arrived at the second level!</p>
<p>Many cultivators were stunned. This Nine Neonate Aspect Totem was extraordinary! It had already reached the second level, and it was unknown how far it could continue going.</p>
<p>The black Fey that had taken form were constant in number. More than a dozen appeared every single time.</p>
<p>"The Nine Neonate is feeling the pressure." Yi Yun saw a black Fey pounce onto his protective Yuan Qi first, and the moment the foul blood aura struck the protective Yuan Qi, a burning sound was issued. Following that, the Nine Neonate behind him would come biting at it.</p>
<p>The second level's black Fey that had taken form had denser foul blood aura, so devouring them became harder.</p>
<p>"This Yi Yun..." The other cultivators looked uncertainly at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They could also tell that the Nine Neonate phantom image was having a harder time devouring the Blood Dragon black gas.</p>
<p>However, they could not tell what the limits of the Nine Neonate were.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun's body suddenly plummeted.</p>
<p>The third level!</p>
<p>Lie Ya's pupils violently contracted. He was currently only at the third level!</p>
<p>He had previously mocked Yi Yun, and in a blink of an eye, Yi Yun had used an Aspect Totem to arrive at the same location as he was!</p>
<p>"However, the third level is not that easy to handle." Lie Ya howled as he grabbed a plume of black gas that had taken form before tearing it apart with his sharp claws!</p>
<p>The black gas at the third level had already taken the forms of fierce beasts such as tigers and leopards. They constantly pounced out of the black gas. Even Lie Ya was finding it difficult to withstand the barrage of attacks. Furthermore, the black Fey that had taken form were appearing in endless succession, and the Blood Dragon black gas could easily erode the bodies of the cultivators.</p>
<p>To withstand such a waxing and waning situation, it was extremely difficult!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun reached the third level!"</p>
<p>"From the looks of it, Lie Ya doesn't find it easy to remain in the third level. Although we can also reach the third level, it will likely be difficult!"</p>
<p>All these Fey race cultivators had ugly expressions. Could their Fey race bloodline be inferior to a human?</p>
<p>The moment Yi Yun reached the third level, he immediately felt the sharp rise in pressure.</p>
<p>A tiger that had taken form pounced out from his side, locking its jaws on one of the Nine Neonate phantom image's necks.</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate immediately fought back, but when its snake mouth bit the tiger, its body quivered. The phantom image turned somewhat chaotic.</p>
<p>The ferocious foul blood aura was something the Nine Neonate could not withstand either.</p>
<p>However, after devouring a mouthful of it, the Nine Neonate let out a joyful howl.</p>
<p>These were dangerous beings, but they were also great supplements!</p>
<p>After being bitten by a tiger, a gigantic python suddenly appeared behind the Nine Neonate.</p>
<p>In the thick black gas, there was no lack of Fey beasts that had taken form.</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate phantom image may have nine heads, but to handle one of the fierce Fey beasts, it needed two or three heads to match them. Furthermore, these fierce Fey beasts appeared constantly.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for the Nine Neonate to resist them!</p>
<p>Its body was also being bitten by the Fey beasts, and as foul blood aura drilled into its body, Yi Yun immediately felt his Yuan Qi flow turn dissonant. His body felt a soreness and itchiness from within.</p>
<p>The foul blood aura could poison his body through the Aspect Totem!</p>
<p>Yi Yun hurriedly circulated his Yuan Qi. His pure Yang body could counter toxins, but he still needed to slowly clear them away once they entered his system. However, if there was a lot more, Yi Yun would also slowly fail to keep this up.</p>
<p>"This human actually managed to find his footing." Lie Ya's expression turned ugly once again. Yi Yun had also reached the third level and spent about ten seconds there. And although Yi Yun looked like he could barely withstand it, he did not reveal any serious flaws. Things would only gradually become easier for him.</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate phantom image was able to absorb the foul blood aura, and the more it absorbed, the stronger it could grow.</p>
<p>They, as Fey race, also used the absorption of the foul blood aura to strengthen their physique to last further here.</p>
<p>If not for that, how could it be said that the Black Wind Valley was also an opportunity?</p>
<p>However, absorbing this bit of foul blood aura was nothing much in the Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>There were greater benefits hidden below the seventh level, things typical cultivators had no means of probing.</p>
<p>Probably only Heaven Fey with powerful bloodlines like Ran Yu and Gu Luo had a chance.</p>
<p>Chapter 831: Consuming the Fey Bone</p>
<p>Lie Ya did not have any confidence when it came to the seventh level, but even so, he could not tolerate that a physically weak human could use an Aspect Totem to reach the same level as him!</p>
<p>This way, his derision from before had transformed into a slap that smacked him right back in the face!</p>
<p>The other cultivators also had expressions that did not look much better than Lie Ya.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun moved again.</p>
<p>"The third level is too difficult for a One Tribulation Nine Neonate to withstand." Yi Yun stood in the third level for a moment before finding it meaningless to stay on in the third level. He was still two levels away from the fifth level.</p>
<p>Every level down had an exponential increase in difficulty.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had yet to come to the end of the road with every means used, he had already had a good understanding of the danger that lurked in Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Standing in the third level, he needed to give his all to resist the black Fey that had taken form. He could not pay attention to other things, and if he were to wait for the Nine Neonate to slowly mature and for him to gradually adapt to the environment, it would take too long a process.</p>
<p>If he was given a few years time, he could slowly reach the fifth, sixth and even the seventh level. However, Cang Mang had only given them a short period of one month.</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate possessed the blood of Ancient Fey, and was a Heaven Fey of noble blood descent. Its growth would be slower than ordinary Heaven Fey or even Earth Fey. The more powerful a life form was, the more difficult it was for them to breed and mature. This was an unspoken rule of the Universe.</p>
<p>A month's time was too short for Yi Yun and for the Nine Neonate.</p>
<p>"I'll stop the attempt here. It appears that without enhancing my physique, there is no way to pass this." Yi Yun looked indifferent as he looked up. With that, his body moved as it immediately flew upwards.</p>
<p>"Oh? Why is this human returning?"</p>
<p>The cultivators were feeling shocked because they never expected Yi Yun to suddenly fly back.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he did not return to the second level, but returned directly to the first level.</p>
<p>Ascending was much easier than descending. After reaching the first level, Yi Yun found a cave and sat in there.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" The Fire Cloud State disciples looked at each other in confusion.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had shown off his Aspect Totem and appeared to be indomitable. He had stunned them by directly going from the first level to the third level. Why did he suddenly return?</p>
<p>They clearly could tell that Yi Yun was able to withstand the third level, and although this fact was something that irked them, they had to admit that the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem was indeed powerful!</p>
<p>This human had a few tricks up his sleeve too!</p>
<p>But now, with Yi Yun returning, what was going on?</p>
<p>"A human's Aspect Totem is after all not a natural bloodline. He can't last too long!" A cultivator suddenly said.</p>
<p>"Probably. Yi Yun uses a Nine Neonate as his Aspect Totem, but compared to the bloodline of us natural Fey, it's still inferior." Another cultivator nodded his head too.</p>
<p>An Aspect Totem was after all a cultivation technique that humans mastered, how could it be compared to their natural birthright as Fey race?</p>
<p>"From the looks of it, it's not that the Aspect Totem is too weak, but it's Yi Yun, who can't handle it!" The person who spoke was Lie Ya. His voice entered the ears of other members of the Fey race. "The Aspect Totem can withstand it, but Yi Yun's body can't. At the third level, he had to constantly withstand the foul aura's invasion. How can a human's body be able to withstand such pain?"</p>
<p>What Lie Ya said was the truth. He had indeed seen the foul aura drill into Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>The other cultivators nodded their heads in succession. They had also seen it.</p>
<p>"He can't even withstand that bit of pain? What's the point of practicing martial arts!" Someone shook his head.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun could withstand the pain, he could naturally continue staying on in the third level.</p>
<p>However, he had returned just like that, if not for him being unable to withstand it, what other reason could there be?</p>
<p>"Don't say it in that way. Humans are after all inferior to us from the Fey race. Junior Brother Yi Yun has such delicate skin and tender flesh, it's natural he can't withstand the foul blood aura." Lie Ya said with a sneer.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall trials were far more brutal and dangerous than Black Wind Valley, so how could the foul blood aura compare with it? Yi Yun could not even withstand the pain from this stage, so how was he able to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials in the future?</p>
<p>The other cultivators shook their heads and no longer focused on Yi Yun. One by one, they entered Black Wind Valley and began consuming the Blood Dragon black gas.</p>
<p>Ran Yu heard the commotion above him and also shook his head lightly.</p>
<p>This trial was ultimately prepared for Fey race with powerful bloodlines like them.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Gu Luo also moved.</p>
<p>Like a corpse, he plummeted straight down and reached the third level in a blink of an eye!</p>
<p>"Gu Luo has yet to stimulate his bloodline!" The looks in the cultivators' eyes changed.</p>
<p>Gu Luo's body was truly tough!</p>
<p>"Gu Luo is also a Heaven Fey with an extremely powerful bloodline. The difference between Fey race bloodlines is evident here." The cultivators were filled with envy.</p>
<p>"The power of the Fey race's bloodline is indeed very advantageous here."</p>
<p>Sitting in the cave, Yi Yun also heard the discussion regarding Gu Luo. The Nine Neonate phantom image behind him were still digesting the Blood Dragon black gas that it had previously consumed.</p>
<p>At the first level, Yi Yun could hold on just with his Nine Neonate Aspect Totem.</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate could absorb the black gas to grow stronger, while he also had something to do.</p>
<p>"Although I lack the benefits of a bloodline, I have the Nine Neonate phantom image, as well as this item."</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyes flashed as something flew out from his interspatial ring.</p>
<p>The ancient plain stone box quietly floated in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Ancient Fey's bone!</p>
<p>This Ancient Fey bone was something that even Ran Yu coveted.</p>
<p>"That Lie Ya mocked me for being human and having a weak body, but that is indeed the case." Yi Yun's eyes seemed to glaze over.</p>
<p>Who knew how strong his physique would become after he absorbed the Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>"I will first finish absorbing the Ancient Fey bone here on the first level!" Yi Yun's eyes focused as he opened the stone box. The white piece of bone immediately rushed out with its desolate and terrifying aura!</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey's power lasted for eons! Even a piece of bone sent shivers down the spine!</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey's life force was extremely immense. Even after its death, after it being reduced to bone, Yi Yun could still sense that eternal will coming from within the bone.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the Ancient Fey bone, he could even hear the sound of blood flow that resembled a surging river resound in his ears.</p>
<p>"Si!" Yi Yun held his breath.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Ran Yu was tempted to commit murder for this item. The Ancient Fey bone was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>"I'll absorb it first." Yi Yun reached out his hand and pointed at the Ancient Fey bone, immediately wrapping the Ancient Fey bone in Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Surging life force poured out, causing Yi Yun's face to immediately turn white.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey bone's aura was too powerful, just maintaining the Yuan Qi wrappage alone was not easy.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Yuan Qi wrapped around the Ancient Fey bone in an incessant manner, as he slowly extracted a bit of the surging life force.</p>
<p>Extracting a strand of the life force was as difficult as taking a portion of a surging river.</p>
<p>And what would happen if an entire river was plunged into his body?</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Ancient Fey bone energy he had extracted. It was snow-white in color, and contained immense power within.</p>
<p>Chapter 832: Reckless waste of Heaven's gifts</p>
<p>"Come!"</p>
<p>The plume of energy flew towards as Yi Yun willed. It sank deep into his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately felt as though he was a drum, while the energy was a drumstick.</p>
<p>The drumsticks brandished with immense power, slamming him heavily to create reverberating shockwaves!</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yun felt like he had fallen into the endless universe. Amongst the cosmic sea of stars in vast space, he was as tiny as a speck of dust. His body did not even seem to exist, having lost control of himself.</p>
<p>The massive Ancient Fey energy was like the sea of stars, washing his body with formidable force.</p>
<p>The moment a portion of the Ancient Fey bone's life energy was extracted, the Fey race cultivators in Black Wind Valley sensed it.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey's aura was immense and matchless. It caused palpitations in the hearts of others.</p>
<p>"It's Yi Yun. He's beginning to absorb the Ancient Fey bone?"</p>
<p>"It's truly the case. Is he planning on attempting Black Wind Valley again after absorbing the Ancient Fey bone?"</p>
<p>The cultivators looked up but they could not seen anything beyond the cave's entrance. However, the Blood Dragon black gas was constantly in turmoil outside the entrance, as though they had been stirred.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's physique was too weak and could not withstand the black gases' erosion for long periods of time. However, if he were to absorb the Ancient Fey bone, things would be different. However, the premise was that he was able to absorb it.</p>
<p>"Absorbing the Ancient Fey bone here? With only a month's time, how much can he absorb? Even a year is useless, let alone a month. For humans to absorb an Ancient Fey bone is such a reckless waste of Heaven's gifts!"</p>
<p>When the Fire Cloud State disciple saw a human wasting such a precious Ancient Fey bone, they felt their hearts bleeding for the treasure.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey bone, one that came from the Ancient Fey, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, could result in the flourishing of a Heaven Fey clan through the use its bloodline. For example, the Xushui Ran clan was such a large clan — it descended from a Ranyi Fish Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was nearly on the same level of existence when compared to the Xushui Ran clan's ancestor. How could a bone it left behind — even if it was a tiny piece — be something a human could absorb?</p>
<p>Ignoring humans, even Heaven Fey at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, who came from famous clans with powerful bloodlines and extremely tempered bodies, considered geniuses amongst geniuses, would need a great deal of time to absorb and digest the energy within the Ancient Fey bone!</p>
<p>And initially, due to a weak physique, the amount of energy one could bear was very little. With the improvement of one's physique, one was be able to gradually absorb more energy. Just like opening up a lake, only a big lake could hold more water.</p>
<p>The final result of absorption — even if done by a top Heaven Fey genius — would probably have less than half the Ancient Fey bone's energy absorbed. The remaining energy would be dispersed and wasted.</p>
<p>But now, this Ancient Fey bone was being carelessly used by Yi Yun. How much of the energy could he absorb?</p>
<p>Positing 1% was already overestimating him!</p>
<p>The reckless waste of Heaven's gift was not enough to describe the process.</p>
<p>If it were them, they would naturally find a quiet chamber and go into reclusion for two or three years for the absorption of the Ancient Fey bone. They would repeatedly refine it, and even crush and swallow the bones before they would give up.</p>
<p>"Fuck, this Yi Yun must know that without absorbing the Ancient Fey bone, it would be impossible for him to pass this trial, so he wants to absorb the Ancient Fey bone. He is disregarding everything else as long as he passes the trial."</p>
<p>"This is infuriating. As the saying goes, the grandson isn't distressed selling the land his grandfather toiled on. This bastard human. The Ancient Fey bone is not his, but the accumulation of our Luo clan. Now that it has been given to him, he is wasting it! He really does not know how to appreciate it!"</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's manner of usage to pass the trial at all costs, the Fey race present were so peeved that their intestines twisted.</p>
<p>What were his actions based on!?</p>
<p>As Fey race disciples who natively grew up in the Luo clan's 196 states, they had entered the Ancient Fey Edifice together with Yi Yun. Yet, the best items in the Ancient Fey Edifice were taken by Yi Yun, and he was even wasting a treasure in such a manner!</p>
<p>They would have cherished the Ancient Fey bone. Even if they had to give up on the trials, they would not bear to waste it in such a manner. However, the Ancient Fey Edifice only gave them junk, so how could their hearts be balanced!?</p>
<p>"Senior Cang Mang, are you going to watch him waste the Ancient Fey bone just like that?"</p>
<p>Lie Ya could not stand for this. At the third level of Black Wind Valley, he directly spoke to Cang Mang.</p>
<p>Cang Mang coldly glanced at Lie Ya and said, "Is your mind unsettled because you did not receive any good opportunities in the Ancient Fey Edifice? However, this is because you were too disappointing, so who can you blame?"</p>
<p>A single sentence from Cang Mang's mouth caused Lie Ya's words to be stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>Too disappointing!</p>
<p>Lie Ya's face went green. He truly felt ashamed when Cang Mang said those words. Naturally, he did not dare express his anger at Cang Mang, so all he could do was vent his fury on Yi Yun. He gritted his teeth and glanced at where Yi Yun was and ruthlessly said, "Wait and see. Even with the Ancient Fey bone, you might not even reach the fifth level. Using a human's body to absorb the Ancient Fey with just a month's time means most of it will be squandered! What's there to improve your body!? Besides, even if your body is improved slightly, without any means, it's still useless!"</p>
<p>Having a strong physique was like having a good weapon. If one began savagely brandishing it around, the resulting amount of power was still tiny. Only by mastering the methods to using the weapon would the weapon's power be fully expressed. The Yuan Qi system was the same too. Having powerful Yuan Qi was useless, one needed cultivation techniques as well.</p>
<p>And it happened that Yi Yun also had cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>Nine Volumed Celestial Axis!</p>
<p>This was one of the top body-tempering cultivation techniques in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It was also an opportunity Yi Yun gained in the Ancient Fey Edifice.</p>
<p>However, to absorb the Ancient Fey and master the cultivation technique in the time allotted, that would be even more difficult. The Fire Cloud State disciples did not even fathom the possibility that Yi Yun had such unrealistic ideas.</p>
<p>Cang Mang did not speak. Instead, he watched Yi Yun silently, without anyone knowing what was on his mind.</p>
<p>Noticing Cang Mang's look, Ran Yu raised his eyelids. "Even though Lord Cang Mang reprimanded Lie Ya, Lord Cang Mang must feel uncomfortable from the way Yi Yun is wasting the Ancient Fey bone. After all, this is the Luo clan's heritage and accumulation! Yet, it has been wasted by a human."</p>
<p>Ran Yu sneered and looked at Yi Yun. "What a foolish human. Just because you think that the Ancient Fey bone is yours, does that mean you can use it freely? You have gone to extraordinary lengths just to pass the fifth level and not get eliminated. Not only have you wasted your opportunity, but you have also offended Lord Cang Mang! The losses outweigh the gains. Furthermore, despite paying all these costs, it is possible that you won't even be able to reach the fifth level and still be eliminated!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's eyes flashed a sharp color. He found Yi Yun extremely foolish.</p>
<p>Youths were usually impetuous due to their age. To profligate just because he had gained the recognition of the Ancient Fey Edifice was a perfect depiction of a fool's haste is no speed! Such a Yi Yun was not a rival Ran Yu needed to consider. His laws may have been strong, but he had offended others, and was unlikely to pass the trials. Elimination was a most likely outcome.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, the Ranyi Fish bloodline image behind him opened its mouth wide and devoured the constantly appearing black Fey.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hua hua. Yi Yun was floating in the magnificent galaxy.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey's aura came from the galaxy as Yi Yun felt he was immersed inside the Ancient Fey's body which was as large as a world. He was bobbing up and down in the Ancient Fey's blood as it surged through invisible vessels.</p>
<p>Yi Yun maintained his mental clarity and like a sponge, he began to slowly absorb the Ancient Fey energy.</p>
<p>Chapter 833: Acupuncture Points Sealed</p>
<p>Being wrapped by the galaxy, Yi Yun felt his limbs and torso being awash with Ancient Fey energy.</p>
<p>This energy was extremely ancient. It contained the Ancient Fey's will, primal simplicity and savage desolateness.</p>
<p>As the energy entered Yi Yun's body, he felt his aura subtly changing, as though he would experience time in the same way the world he was in experienced, everlasting.</p>
<p>If this feeling of existence alongside the world sunk in, Yi Yun's will would subtly be assimilated. His body would decay away, becoming a part of the aura.</p>
<p>This made Yi Yun's heart sink and he became extremely vigilant.</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly realized the Ancient Fey bone's energy was too powerful. If he did not absorb it cleanly, he would slowly be assimilated.</p>
<p>To be assimilated by an Ancient Fey bone...</p>
<p>It might sound preposterous that a bone that had been dead for billions of years would assimilate a living being, but what Yi Yun was presently experiencing proved this point.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun extricated himself from the situation, he would not be in danger, but the result would be Yi Yun absorbing only a tiny bit of the Ancient Fey's energy that would be around 1%. If this went on, how much could he improve in a month?</p>
<p>It was too slow.</p>
<p>Besides, the energy he failed to absorb in a timely fashion would be dispersed into the Heaven and Earth, turning into a portion of the Ancient Fey's cosmic power.</p>
<p>And the so-called bloodline awakening to gather the power of the cosmic Ancient Fey power was this cosmic power. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, this energy was an energy form that was considered superior to Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>"No wonder those Fey previously mentioned that I won't be able to absorb the Ancient Fey bone. So this is where the problem lies."</p>
<p>Obviously, Yi Yun would not sit idle as such wastage occurred. He wanted to take in all the Ancient Fey energy and compress them into his body!</p>
<p>The thought of using a human's body to dominate over the ancient and powerful Ancient Fey sounded like wishful thinking, but Yi Yun possessed the Purple Crystal Origins. With it, everything was no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Regardless how powerful the energy contained in the Ancient Fey bone was, it was still energy of a dead being. Its ability to assimilate living creatures was just instinctual, but in front of the Purple Crystal, it could not stir any waves.</p>
<p>To the Purple Crystal, controlling such energy was as completely trivial.</p>
<p>"Collect!"</p>
<p>With a thought from Yi Yun, the Purple Crystal's powers radiated outwards!</p>
<p>The energy that was about to disperse was all swept back into Yi Yun's meridians. Following that, all of this massive and ancient energy was compressed by the Purple Crystal!</p>
<p>Yi Yun seemed to see the Ancient Fey bone conjure an Ancient Fey phantom image. However, under the Purple Crystal's pressure, it was only putting up a futile struggle.</p>
<p>Yi Yun decided to seal the 360 acupuncture points on his body. By sealing the energy in his meridians, he allowed his body to slowly digest and absorb it!</p>
<p>As long as he possessed the protection of the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun did not need to worry that his body would be assimilated by the Ancient Fey energy. Now, the only path the Ancient Fey energy had was to be merged into his blood veins.</p>
<p>As such, Yi Yun could freely extract energy from the Ancient Fey bone. As the Ancient Fey energy surged around violently, it slowly filled up all of Yi Yun's meridians. Following that, they seeped out of Yi Yun's meridians, into Yi Yun's body, which his flesh and blood absorbed.</p>
<p>A small amount of Ancient Fey energy attempted to rush out of Yi Yun's body, but with Yi Yun sealing all his acupuncture points, they surged at the closed off points to no avail and had to turn back.</p>
<p>As such, the amount of Ancient Fey energy that accumulated in Yi Yun's body increased.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body began to produce booming sounds as the energy had nowhere to vent itself inside his body, and could only surge in random directions, striking his body.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body began to turn red like melting iron. The Ancient Fey bone's energy bored into his meridians and bone joints, producing the clear sounds of bones cracking.</p>
<p>"Oh?" Cang Mang opened his eyes and looked down.</p>
<p>The cultivators also noticed the commotion.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"It can't be that Yi Yun is trying to forcefully absorb all the energy, right?"</p>
<p>Lie Ya also looked up and after a look of surprise, his expression turned into one of disbelief. Is this Yi Yun still straight in the mind!?</p>
<p>"He wants to become a fatso in one mouthful without a big enough appetite? He will only gorge himself to death!"</p>
<p>If one forcefully absorbed the Ancient Fey bone, either one was assimilated by the Ancient Fey bone or one would explode to their deaths!</p>
<p>"What madness is this? He is going to die from his foolishness!"</p>
<p>The cultivators found it unbelievable. Wasting energy was unavoidable, but the human was planning on reaching the sky in a single bound, and explode his body in the process?</p>
<p>Cang Mang frowned slightly. His opinion of Yi Yun was not that high yet. Yi Yun was indeed talented when it came to laws. If he was nurtured carefully, Yi Yun was likely to become an expert of the Luo clan, and might even be able to enter the royal capital.</p>
<p>The Black Wind Valley trial was definitely disadvantageous for Yi Yun, but martial arts was never about fairness.</p>
<p>"I never expected Yi Yun to take such risks in order to pass." Cang Mang shook his head. Warriors could not mature and grow stronger by just smashing their heads randomly into walls. They needed persistence and courage, but at the same time, they needed wisdom and self-comprehension, otherwise, they would only die.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was clearly placing himself into an extremely dangerous situation.</p>
<p>However, despite this happening, Cang Mang did not intervene. In Mt. Azure Billow, he was just a witness. All the trials were to be completed by the Luo clan disciples themselves.</p>
<p>The disciples beneath him may be said to be of the younger generation, but even the youngest had cultivated for three decades. If they were mortals, they would be head of their households. They had to take responsibilities for their own actions.</p>
<p>Seeing how Cang Mang ignored Yi Yun, Lie Ya, Ran Yu and company were gloating over Yi Yun's misfortune. If Cang Mang intervened, Yi Yun would definitely be alright, but that was something they did not wish to see.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey Edifice had given Yi Yun a great opportunity. Unfortunately, Yi Yun could not digest it, and might even die because of this opportunity. It was very ironic. The only regret was for that piece of Ancient Fey bone. It would have been great if they were the ones to have it.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, many Fire Cloud State disciples saw Yi Yun's skin turn redder, as though he was a boiler with billowing flames burning within.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only had Yi Yun sealed all his acupuncture points, he had even sealed the pores all around his body which numbered in the thousands!</p>
<p>Even geniuses of the Fey race who could awaken their ancient bloodline would only seal a number of acupuncture points when they absorbed the energy in an Ancient Fey bone. They would definitely not seal all the pores on their bodies. They had to disperse a bit of the energy through their pores or their bodies might explode, resulting in their death.</p>
<p>But now, not only was there no excess energy seeping out of Yi Yun's pores, even a drop of sweat did not flow out. This made Yi Yun's body slowly swell up. The blood vessels beneath his skin was visible. If not for Yi Yun's clothes being enchanted, his clothes would have already been lit on fire.</p>
<p>"Hey, why don't we guess how long this punk can withstand this?" Lie Ya suddenly asked on a whim. Since cultivation was boring, he might as well find something to amuse himself. "Shall we make a bet?"</p>
<p>Chapter 834: Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake</p>
<p>"Bet?"</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State disciples immediately had their interests perked up. Since the Black Wind Valley trial would last an entire month, being able to find some fun in the devouring and killing boredom while watching a show was something they certainly would not refuse.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, a commotion happened high above them.</p>
<p>Rolling clouds were separated as a spirit cruiser suddenly appeared. As it descended, it stopped in a hovering position above Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that on the bow of the spirit cruiser stood Cang Mang.</p>
<p>Two Cang Mangs? With their eyesight, they could not tell the differences between the previous Cang Mang and the newly arrived Cang Mang. In terms of looks and aura, they were identical.</p>
<p>However, when the other Cang Mang stood up, the "Cang Mang" on the spirit cruiser's bow transformed into a tiny snake before whizzing into Cang Mang's sleeves.</p>
<p>"It's Lord Cang Mang's avatar." When the disciples saw this, they were secretly amazed. This was not a cultivation technique but Cang Mang's talent. It was unknown how many snakes were hidden on his body, with every snake capable of being his avatar.</p>
<p>"It's the people from the Phoenix Firmiana State. They are done with the Ancient Fey Edifice's test and have been brought here to Black Wind Valley too." The Phoenix Firmiana State disciples quickly saw that the spirit cruiser's human cargo was the group of disciples from the Phoenix Firmiana State.</p>
<p>With more than a hundred states in the Luo clan, the disciples from every state that were to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials would participate in various forms of training. And since the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State were considered neighbors and were assigned to be under Cang Mang's watch, it was normal for their tests and training to be the same.</p>
<p>Back at the Ancient Fey Edifice, their tests were staggered. However, as the Black Wind Valley trials lasted for an entire month, with only a day's difference between the disciples of the two states, most of their time would be spent training together.</p>
<p>Every state's disciples were already engaged in an intense competition amongst themselves. As for different states, the competition was even more intense.</p>
<p>Seeing the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples arrive, the Fire Cloud State disciples ignored Yi Yun and each one of them had their faces sullen.</p>
<p>"From this moment on, the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State's cultivators will undergo training in Black Wind Valley together. The assessment criteria is the same. One month later, those who reach the fifth level will be considered as passing. Those who can't reach the fifth level, you might as well not go to the Luo Divine Hall for the trials, so as to not waste my Luo clan's resources. At the Ancient Fey Edifice, the overall results of the disciples from both states are about the same. It will now depend on the results of the Black Wind Valley training." Cang Mang's cold voice resounded.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the Fire Cloud State disciples immediately had ugly expressions.</p>
<p>Although it was said that their results was about the same, everyone knew that just Yi Yun alone had given them, the Fire Cloud State, a huge lead.</p>
<p>If their overall results were better than the Phoenix Firmiana State, that would only be natural. By saying that it was about the same, that meant that other than Yi Yun and Gu Luo's results being extremely outstanding, the other disciples had results worse than the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples. Or else, how could it just be about the same?</p>
<p>"What Lord Cang Mang said makes me the most ashamed."</p>
<p>Ran Yu secretly clenched his fists. His results at the Ancient Fey Edifice was far from ideal. He was inferior to Yi Yun and also Gu Luo. Of course, there was no way he had beaten Luo Tian.</p>
<p>At Black Wind Valley, this was his area of expertise. He could not lose again.</p>
<p>The training of the two state's disciples was administered by Cang Mang. By putting the disciples from the two states together, and saying such instigating words, it was simply to agitate these disciples, making them compete till they had their heads broken in.</p>
<p>However the path of martial arts was always about stepping on others to go higher. Either you stepped on thousands of people to stride up the heavens, or you would be trampled beneath the feet of others and destroyed.</p>
<p>Hence, when they heard Cang Mang's words, be it the Fire Cloud State disciples or the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples, who had Luo Tian as their leader, they were all full of fighting spirit.</p>
<p>For Luo Tian, his results at the Ancient Fey Edifice test was indeed extremely outstanding. However, with Yi Yun's accomplishments before him, his amazing result did not appear as shocking as it should have been.</p>
<p>On the journey to Black Wind Valley, Luo Tian was pumping himself up. Even without Cang Mang saying anything, he was bent on ruthlessly trampling Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Yi Yun beneath him!</p>
<p>At this moment, a sharp roar was heard beneath Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed as they lowered their heads quickly.</p>
<p>"What's the commotion?"</p>
<p>Seeing the black gas rolling within Black Wind Valley as though it was a tidal wave, the surging black gas seemed to produce the sounds of tsunami.</p>
<p>These disciples were startled having heard this rumbling sound.</p>
<p>The degenerated Blood Dragon was already dead, and Black Wind Valley was a land formed after its corpse rotted. However, from the commotion, it was as though a True Dragon had been revived?</p>
<p>"Your luck isn't too bad." Cang Mang suddenly said.</p>
<p>"Oh? What does Lord Cang Mang mean?'</p>
<p>"If your luck isn't good, you might not even have the chance of encountering it despite reaching the deep depths of Black Wind Valley. However, now, you can see its true face. Aren't you curious what the true opportunity hidden in Black Wind Valley is? This is it." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Cang Mang's words, everyone immediately became extremely curious.</p>
<p>This commotion...was the opportunity of Black Wind Valley?</p>
<p>At this moment, the black gases turned more turbulent as the sharp roar approached them.</p>
<p>With a boom, the concentrated black gas was separated, and a red snake that looked as crystalline as blood jade was seen swimming in it! The snake's head had a single horn and the moment it appeared, it made everyone feel like their scalp had exploded.</p>
<p>What intense foul blood aura!</p>
<p>"This is the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. It is naturally condensed out of the blood dragon black gas in Black Wind Valley. It is considered a unique treasure of Black Wind Valley. It isn't a living creature itself, but it is exceptionally quick-witted. It usually stays below the seventh level and seldom shows its face." Cang Mang said.</p>
<p>Black Wind Valley's treasure!</p>
<p>"Hehe, eating it is equivalent to absorbing blood dragon black gas for three years. Furthermore, it contains a strand of the degenerated Blood Dragon's aura. However, this sort of thing typically isn't used for eating." Cang Mang said in a direct manner.</p>
<p>Si!</p>
<p>Upon hearing that the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake contained the degenerated Blood Dragon's aura, many disciple drew cold gasps!</p>
<p>That was the bloodline of a True Dragon. Even if it was just a strand that could not be any less, it would still be amazing!</p>
<p>People like Luo Tian and Ran Yu already had their eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Even a living zombie like Gu Luo also had a strange glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>As for Lie Ya and company, they only revealed envious looks before their faces turned bitter as they shook their heads.</p>
<p>What good luck was this? Even without Luo Tian and company present, it was impossible for them to reach the seventh level. There was no way they could capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>If everyone could not do it, it would have been fine, but it was highly possible that Luo Tian and company were able to reach the seventh level and below.</p>
<p>The inequality and imbalance left an astringent taste in these disciples' hearts.</p>
<p>Chapter 835: Seamless Body</p>
<p>"Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake… " Ran Yu's eyes flashed a hint of desire and greed.</p>
<p>Previously, he had failed to obtain the Ancient Fey bone. So now, he had to get the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake at all costs!</p>
<p>However, his enemies changed from Yi Yun to Luo Tian and Gu Luo!</p>
<p>But this was just perfect. Luo Tian and Gu Luo were famous opponents with true strength. It felt better competing with such enemies!</p>
<p>Unlike Yi Yun… a human rascal who was unknown. Winning against him did not win any glory, but once he lost, as he did previously at the Ancient Fey Edifice…</p>
<p>That feeling was so embarrassing that he felt like immediately committing suicide.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake only revealed its head before swimming back into the rolling black gases.</p>
<p>"Alright, begin." Cang Mang said lightly.</p>
<p>"Haha, then I shall begin." Luo Tian whipped the tail behind him before leaping into the Blood Dragon black gas.</p>
<p>"Ze ze. The bunch of you came here a day earlier, but the majority of you are still only at the second level! What weaklings."</p>
<p>The moment Luo Tian descended, he did not hold back on his derision. The faces of the Fire Cloud State disciples turned ugly when they heard this.</p>
<p>But it had to be said that Luo Tian was indeed powerful!</p>
<p>Luo Tian was agile like an ape. The foul aura emitted by the Blood Dragon black gas surged at him, but with a wave of his long tail, they were all absorbed by his tail.</p>
<p>It was so easy it was like he was playing.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just the first and second level. Even Luo Tian could not be that relaxed if he went lower.</p>
<p>"Gu Luo! Ran Yu!" Luo Tian noticed Gu Luo and Ran Yu, who were beneath him, at a glance. His eyes focused, but following that, he started looking around and he was somewhat taken aback.</p>
<p>"Why don't I see Yi Yun?"</p>
<p>Luo Tian had jumped down into Black Wind Valley with an aggressive posture, but he did not see Yi Yun's figure.</p>
<p>However, with a sweep of his perception, he found Yi Yun on the first level. At this moment, Yi Yun was sitting in a cave. The skin all over his body looked as though it was roasted, and deep inside his body, there were roaring sounds that resembled an airbox.</p>
<p>"What is Yi Yun doing?"</p>
<p>Luo Tian was momentarily shocked.</p>
<p>"Oh? Ancient Fey aura? All his acupuncture points are sealed?" Luo Tian realized that something was unusual about Yi Yun. Even his acupuncture points for his ears and heart were sealed, so Yi Yun could not hear anything from the outside world.</p>
<p>"Don't… don't tell me that he is absorbing the Ancient Fey bone here?" Luo Tian was deeply startled. Was Yi Yun dumb? The Black Wind Valley trial only lasted a month. His cultivation level was still extremely weak, yet he was absorbing the Ancient Fey bone here!?</p>
<p>"What's so surprising. A human's body is lacking, and Yi Yun's powerful nomological insights are useless here. He can't even pass the fifth level, and the outcome will be him not being able to attend the Luo Divine Hall trials." Ran Yu said nonchalantly from the fifth level of Black Wind Valley. His voice pierced through the black mist and into everyone's ears.</p>
<p>"Weak bloodline… The bloodline of humans is indeed weak… However, using a last-minute effort of absorbing the Ancient Fey bone in order to pass Black Wind Valley is just too naive." Luo Tian did not know why Yi Yun was so dumb. But it was good. Previously, he had been trampled on by Yi Yun, and he nursed a grievance against him. Now that he saw Yi Yun digging his own grave, he also felt his mind ease up.</p>
<p>"A last-minute effort was done because he was out of options. If he doesn't do so, he won't be able to join the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>Ran Yu said nonchalantly and glanced at Luo Tian. "Ignore him, I am your opponent!"</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Ran Yu's aura exploded as a black gas snake the thickness of a bowl was dispersed by Ran Yu's punch that was augmented with his bloodline power. It was immediately devoured after that!</p>
<p>"Hahaha, Ran Yu, you think too highly of yourself. Do you think you are worthy to be my opponent?"</p>
<p>Luo Tian suddenly plummeted straight down!</p>
<p>Third level, fourth level, fifth level!</p>
<p>Luo Tian instantly reached the fifth level, the same level as Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Ran Yu's eyes focused as his bloodline power burst out!</p>
<p>His nomological insights were weaker than Luo Tian, but the test of bloodline at the Black Wind Valley trial was his forte. He had to obtain the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>"Ran Yu is heading to the sixth level!"</p>
<p>"It looks like Luo Tian has given Ran Yu some pressure. He is prematurely rushing for the sixth level."</p>
<p>"No hurry. It is not that easy to descend to the sixth level. Look at Ran Yu, he is only probing it."</p>
<p>Ran Yu did not move, but the Ranyi Fish phantom image behind him began swimming to the sixth level.</p>
<p>However, just as it reached the sixth level, thick black gas surged over, and in it, there was a humanoid shadow.</p>
<p>The humanoid shadow held a long saber which it brandished and it slashed at the phantom image.</p>
<p>Ran Yu immediately felt his scalp tingle and he hurriedly made the Ranyi Fish phantom image dodge and then swing its tail at the saber.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>A loud bang reverberated as the shadow saber was parried. However, the Ranyi Fish also retreated out of the sixth level. The humanoid shadow sullenly took a step back before disappearing into the Blood Dragon black gas.</p>
<p>"Could that humanoid black gas have devoured a warrior in the past? It seems to possess a certain amount of intelligence and it can use cultivation techniques!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's face turn solemn. The degenerated Blood Dragon's blood was extremely odd. The degenerated Blood Dragon had devoured thousands of living beings to begin with, so it was natural that the blood it left behind could devour Fey race warriors to strengthen itself.</p>
<p>When the other disciples saw this scene, they shuddered.</p>
<p>The black gas was terrifying to begin with. If it was able to inherit a certain amount of intelligence of the Fey race, it would be much harder to deal with!</p>
<p>They had also seen that there were several humanoid shadows lurking in the black gas. If Ran Yu truly descended into the sixth level, he would be immediately encircled.</p>
<p>If the sixth level was already this difficult, the seventh level was obviously even more terrifying.</p>
<p>However, levels below the fifth were the stages for powerful freaks. They just needed to reach the fifth level.</p>
<p>Everyone began working hard. Although they could not compare with freaks like Ran Yu, they did not want to lose to the others at the very least.</p>
<p>Instantly, everyone began giving their all to battle the black Fey before devouring the black gas. The rest of the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples also began from the first level.</p>
<p>And as this scene happened, Yi Yun, who was still in cave, was experiencing a different scene.</p>
<p>Phew! Phew!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's glabella rose up high as every acupuncture point and meridian was filled with energy.</p>
<p>Although the energy was tempestuous, with the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun was able to evenly distribute the energy to every minute spot in his body. He wrapped every cell in his body with energy, preventing any leakage.</p>
<p>Typically, during the body-tempering of humans and even the Fey race, there were always 'leaks'. Certain muscles and blood vessels were difficult to temper, and even the most ingenious cultivation techniques would have leaks. And these leaking points would become the warrior's weakness in the future. As their strength reached the next realm, the points would become obstacles that formed bottlenecks.</p>
<p>And at this moment, by relying on the Purple Crystal and the Ancient Fey bone, Yi Yun was unwittingly tempering every minute part of his body. Over time, Yi Yun would possess a Seamless Body. Of course, he was just at the beginning, and he still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>As he inhaled and exhaled, Yi Yun seemed to become one with the heaven and earth.</p>
<p>His flesh, blood, meridians and organs were like an iron block that was repeatedly forged. It was heated to a red-hot color as it was brutally tempered. During this tempering process, impurities were expelled, leaving behind parts that were more transparent and solid.</p>
<p>Chapter 836: Provoked</p>
<p>As time passed, deep in Black Wind Valley, the Phoenix Firmiana State and Fire Cloud State disciples displayed their respective skills!</p>
<p>In the process of them battling the Blood Dragon black gases, their physiques gradually strengthened as well. A large number of disciples had completed the second level, and they successively began to enter the third level. Many of them had gotten their footing in the third level, and some had even reached the fourth level.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of them were at their limits, without any ability to continue descending anymore. Some had no choice but to sit down and cultivate, and allow their Fey race bloodline to devour the Black Wind Valley's black gas so that they could be nourished.</p>
<p>And while cultivating, some of them paid attention to Yi Yun's situation.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's situation, they were rendered truly speechless. When they were at the second level, they saw Yi Yun's body burning over, with all his acupuncture points sealed off. His body was hot like a boiler and he looked as though he would combust in flames.</p>
<p>Now that they had arrived at the third or fourth level, they themselves could not tolerate it any further. And looking back at Yi Yun, his body was still hot all over with his acupuncture points sealed, as though his body was about to explode?</p>
<p>What was wrong with this?</p>
<p>"I say, how is that rascal holding on for so long? Even if he doesn't explode and die, it won't be surprising if his meridians are destroyed. Even the bodies of the Fey race cannot withstand such powerful energies." A Fire Cloud State disciple said after seeing Yi Yun's situation.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lie Ya had also arrived at the fourth level. As he looked at Yi Yun, he knitted his brows. That rascal had lasted longer than he expected.</p>
<p>However, no one could hold on for that long. Even if their will allowed them to hold on, their meridians would not be able to.</p>
<p>When he thought about it, Lie Ya grunted and said, "It's just a result of willpower. But by doing so, his meridians will be damaged. Without a year or two, he won't be able to recover from it. He's already a spent force. I bet he will last for another two hours at most."</p>
<p>"Two hours? In my opinion, it seems like he… won't be limited to that. He might even be able to last another four hours… " A Fire Cloud State disciple said with uncertainty. He too had believed that Yi Yun would not be able to persist for that long, but from the looks of it, Yi Yun appeared to be able to carry on longer...</p>
<p>Lie Ya chuckled and said, "It won't be more than four hours. Didn't I say before that we can bet on this? However, the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples came and interrupted us. Are you still up for it?"</p>
<p>With Lie Ya saying this, the other Fire Cloud State disciples were hesitant. They were not certain on how long Yi Yun could persist for.</p>
<p>However, it was unexpected that someone was really indignant. A female voice belonging to Luo Fengling came from the third level. She said, "Lie Ya, Junior Brother Yi Yun is our Fire Cloud State's disciple. Now that we are competing against the Phoenix Firmiana State, disciples from both states are in contention, trying to outdo the other, so they win glory for their own state. But for you, Lie Ya, you didn't compete with the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples and instead choose to mock our Fire Cloud State disciples. Aren't you going too far!?"</p>
<p>Regardless of the matter, Luo Fengling was the one who brought Yi Yun into the Fire Cloud State. Furthermore, Yi Yun had good character, so Luo Fengling had a good impression of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Besides, Luo Fengling was a new disciple who was going to participate with Yi Yun for the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials together. Their statuses were rather similar, having been ostracized by the senior disciples, so they had a common enemy. Seeing Yi Yun being derided, she felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Lie Ya sneered. "Of course, our Fire Cloud State has to compete with the Phoenix Firmiana State. However, it will not be relying on a human... it will be a member of our Fey race that has the most concentrated bloodline! I might not be up to it, but I believe that my bloodline will be able to contribute a portion of strength!"</p>
<p>"As for you, Luo Fengling, why don't you think about your role when it comes to the competition against the Phoenix Firmiana State? Don't think that just because your surname is 'Luo' and you being a Heaven Fey means anything. There are numerous people in the Luo clan with the surname 'Luo'. Some of the distant bloodlines are even inferior to my Lie clan. You haven't reached the third level up to now. I'm not even sure if you can reach the fifth level by the end of the trial. You might even be eliminated!"</p>
<p>Luo clan mercilessly mocked Luo Fengling, causing her to grit her teeth tightly. The family clan that she belonged clan was an insignificant branch of the Luo clan. Indeed, her bloodline was not powerful, and it was something that she lacked the most confidence in. Cultivation techniques could be cultivated, but to supplement her bloodline, only a top treasure like the Ancient Fey bone could do so. Where was she going to obtain one from?</p>
<p>Having her raw nerve struck, Luo Fengling angrily said, "Didn't you want to make a bet? I'll bet with you. What happens if I can reach the fifth level? What happens if Junior Brother Yi manages to last for more than two hours?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing Luo Fengling's agreement to bet with him, Lie Ya was interested. With a twinkling light in his eyes, a teasing smile suffused across his lips. He was not confident about Luo Fengling being unable to reach the fifth level, and he did not bet on things that he had no confidence in. But for Yi Yun, even if he could last two hours, could he last four hours? Wasn't betting on four hours a sure-win? With Luo Fengling being agitated, she would probably agree if he added another two hours to the bet.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Lie Ya smiled and said, "You want to bet? Great! If the punk lasts for more than two hours, I will give three World Stones to you for every two hours he lasts. If he can't persist past two hours, you give lose ten World Stones to me. How about it?"</p>
<p>With Lie Ya saying that, the people present secretly shook their heads.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was too treacherous. If Luo Fengling made a bet with Lie Ya over how long Yi Yun could last, that was already disadvantageous to Luo Fengling. But now, Lie Ya had established a bet to scam Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>Things like persisting on every two hours which meant losing three World Stones sounded like Luo Fengling had gained the advantage, but everyone knew that eight or ten hours was practically impossible. It was all carrots on a stick that could not be obtained.</p>
<p>With Lie Ya saying this, he made a two hour bet become a four hour bet. Only after four hours would he begin losing World Stones. If it was less than four hours, he would win ten!</p>
<p>Immediately, many people despised Lie Ya for his actions. Luo Fengling was a junior and a young lady. Yet, Lie Ya had taken advantage of an agitated Luo Fengling to change the bet, scamming a young girl for her World Stones. He was utterly shameless.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Fengling was irrevocably committed. Having been mocked by Lie Ya, how could she take this lying? At this trial, she had suffered criticism from her identity as a new disciple and her obtaining a spot in the trial through Fairy Black Bamboo's backdoor.</p>
<p>It was only ten World Stones, two year's worth of salary. Although it will be quite a pinch, Luo Fengling could still afford it.</p>
<p>"Alright! I'll bet on it!" Luo Fengling said while gritting her teeth. At the same time, she secretly prayed that Yi Yun could last for more than two hours. She hoped that not only would his body be tempered, but also allow her to not lose a single World Stone. As a side branch of the Luo clan, Luo Fengling's family would not provide her with too many resources. She still had to rely on herself. Losing ten World Stones would greatly reduce her cultivation speed.</p>
<p>Chapter 837: Lie Ya suffers a mental breakdown</p>
<p>"Hehe, since you have agreed to the bet, make the oath." Lie Ya said.</p>
<p>As he said this, he flicked a drop of blood from his fingers and made a hand seal that flew towards Luo Fengling on the third level of Black Wind Valley. Luo Fengling caught the seal and also flicked a drop of blood onto it.</p>
<p>This was a mental demon oath. The disciples of the Luo clan would typically use such oaths in their bets. After signing it, there was no room for regret, or the costs would outweigh the gain. Once the mental demon oath was established, the bet was established.</p>
<p>Lie Ya chuckled as he began meditating on the fourth level, making his preparations to break through to the fifth level.</p>
<p>It was not easy to meditate on the fourth level. He had to constantly power his Fey race bloodline to devour the black mist and if he made a mistake, the black gas would intrude into his body, causing damage to his soul sea.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was accumulating his strength so that he could proceed to the fifth level.</p>
<p>Up to now, his reaching the fifth level was already certain. Cang Mang had previously demanded that the disciples reach the fifth level, but he did not say that they needed to find their footing on the fifth level. This was very simple for Lie Ya. The personal goal that he set for himself was to find his footing on the fifth level and be able to last on the sixth level for a short period of time!</p>
<p>Although completing such a goal would not leave much of an impression on Lord Cang Mang, it was a commendable achievement in his own family clan, allowing him to enjoy more of the family's resources.</p>
<p>As Lie Ya was focused on his cultivation, someone suddenly said, "Senior Brother Lie Ya, it's almost two hours… "</p>
<p>"Oh?" Lie Ya opened his eyes and used his perception to sweep the first level of Black Wind Valley where Yi Yun was. He saw how Yi Yun looked the same, with his skin glowing red and streams of energy flowing beneath his skin. As Yi Yun's pores were sealed, the energy could not surge out, and seeing the blood vessels that were bursting with energy was quite a shocking sight.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was still persisting on.</p>
<p>Lie Ya frowned slightly and said, "What's the hurry. It's only been two hours. Isn't there another two hours?"</p>
<p>Lie Ya continued his meditation as he devoured the black mist, strengthening his bloodline.</p>
<p>People were quite impressed with Lie Ya's nonchalant state of mind. Many of the Fire Cloud State disciples were paying attention to Yi Yun's situation from time to time as Lie Ya cultivated.</p>
<p>However, Lie Ya was paying close attention as well.</p>
<p>A warrior had great mental powers, so with their sense of time, they did not need things like hourglasses or incense sticks. They could silently keep track of time.</p>
<p>Soon… four hours had passed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was still sitting on the first level and it looked like he was in a trance. Despite his body seemingly burning in flames, he was like a monk that was sitting amidst flames of nirvana — able to meditate and chant Buddhist verses despite the fire consuming him.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Lie Ya, it's been four hours."</p>
<p>Lie Ya was already keeping track of time himself, but a junior brother, who did not know any better, reminded him.</p>
<p>Lie Ya's expression sank all of a sudden. How was this rascal persisting?</p>
<p>He stared at the junior brother who spoke. He wanted to scold him, but at this moment, the junior brother added on, "Senior Brother Lie Ya, you have lost three World Stones to Luo Fengling… "</p>
<p>The corner of Lie Ya's mouth twitched slightly.</p>
<p>"Cut the crap!"</p>
<p>Lie Ya cursed. Three World Stones was nothing much to Lie Ya. However, he could not figure out what was going on with Yi Yun. To last for that long, even the bloodline of Heaven Fey could not do that...</p>
<p>Lie Ya coldly said, "Four hours is his limit. That lass, Luo Fengling, has pretty good luck. However, since I have lost, I will not turn back on my word."</p>
<p>Having said this, Lie Ya calmed his heart down and began to meditate again.</p>
<p>But following that…</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Lie Ya, it's been six hours." The talkative junior brother opened his mouth again.</p>
<p>Lie Ya stared with widened eyes as his face turned ugly.</p>
<p>He stood up and glanced at Yi Yun in a perplexed manner. What the hell was going on?</p>
<p>"It's been six hours. I don't believe that your meridians can withstand it. I want to see how long you can last."</p>
<p>Lie Ya clenched his fists as he forcefully composed himself before sitting down again.</p>
<p>He was still able to calm his heart down for cultivation, but following that…</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Lie Ya, it's been eight hours."</p>
<p>That reminder was like a devil's curse. After hearing it, Lie Ya's heart skipped a beat. He was truly afraid of hearing it, but he knew for a fact that eight hours had passed.</p>
<p>His anger flared as he hatefully stared at the junior brother who had opened his mouth. He snapped, "There's no need for you to remind me!"</p>
<p>"Uh… " The junior brother was taken aback and shrinking his neck, he kept quiet.</p>
<p>"Eight hours! What the heck?"</p>
<p>At this moment, Lie Ya no longer had the composure to continue cultivating. Every two hours, he would lose three World Stones.</p>
<p>Could that punk really persist on all the way?</p>
<p>"Nice going kid. I'll have to hand it to you. I would like to see how long you can last for. If you have the ability, try making me lose all my fortune!"</p>
<p>Lie Ya had quite a fortune. After all, he was older than Luo Fengling. The salary of the Heaven Fire Hall and the support from his family clan allowed him to come up with thirty World Stones.</p>
<p>"World Stones? I have lots of them. Even if I need to produce twenty to buy an explosive death of yours, I'll be willing to produce them."</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Lie Ya felt his mind ease up.</p>
<p>But following that, the tenth hour, the twelfth hour…</p>
<p>As the river of time flowed, Lie Ya could no longer sit still.</p>
<p>"It's been sixteen hours. Is something amiss?" A junior brother said.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, there must be a problem!" Someone said as more and more people paid attention to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They couldn't believe that Yi Yun had persisted for so long.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Lie Ya's face had gone green. His net worth could not withstand such a big loss. Since he had had already signed the mental demon oath, he could no longer go back on his word. Even Ran Yu would feel the pinch if he lost so many World Stones, much less himself.</p>
<p>But that was not the end. Time moved to the twenty-fourth hour as an entire day passed.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was becoming extremely anxious. It meant that he would lose thirty-three World Stones. He did not even have that many World Stones on him. He might even need to sell some of his treasures to produce the rest of that amount!</p>
<p>And following that, thirty hours and then, thirty-two hours. Soon, it was almost halfway past the second day.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was on the brink of a mental collapse. Why did Yi Yun look as though he could persist on further!?</p>
<p>Soon, the sun set. Mt. Azure Billow had an array formation that maintained the rising and setting of the sun. Seeing that the sun had set while Yi Yun was still fine and dandy, Lie Ya felt himself go dizzy. He could only see blackness as he nearly spewed out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>He felt completely defeated. He no longer dared to say things like "if you have the ability, make me lose my fortune", because… he had already lost all his fortune.</p>
<p>Now, he wished that he could kneel down in front of Yi Yun and beg him — Big Bro, please don't hold on any further, I myself can't hold on any longer.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun apparently did not hear Lie Ya's prayer. The second day passed as the sky lit up. Yi Yun remained unfeeling, while Lie Ya passed the night in a tensed up state. His eyes were already red.</p>
<p>The matter was just too strange. Yi Yun looked like a simmering volcano and he looked like he would erupt at any moment. But for some unknown reason, he remained as calm as ever.</p>
<p>And the most unforgivable matter of all was in the morning of the third day, Yi Yun's body suddenly floated up.</p>
<p>He had closed off his five senses, but he flew from the first level slowly onto the second level!</p>
<p>There was no one left in Black Wind Valley's second level. Even Bai Chen had barely managed to reach the third level.</p>
<p>Hence, Yi Yun was the only person on the second level.</p>
<p>No one laughed at Yi Yun's slow speed because Yi Yun had flown to the second level while absorbing the Ancient Fey bone's energy.</p>
<p>Behind Yi Yun, the Nine Neonate phantom image emerged. It wandered about, devouring the black mist to strengthen itself, looking extremely carefree as it went on its merry way.</p>
<p>Not only did Yi Yun dislike the lack of intensity of the black mist on the first level, he was even able to withstand the second level's black mist while absorbing the Ancient Fey bone's energy!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was absorbing the Ancient Fey bone's energy, while the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem was absorbing the black gases!</p>
<p>When he saw this scene, Lie Ya truly wanted to kneel before Yi Yun. He believed that regardless of how long Yi Yun could persist for, there would definitely be a limit. Now, with Yi Yun coming down to the second level, it meant that he still had ample room for more.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me!?</p>
<p>Lie Ya's face was drenched with sweat as his eyes turned bloodshot. He wanted to just pass out or jump off Black Wind Valley's cliff.</p>
<p>What was going on!? He would rather be beaten to death than believe that a human could absorb so much of the Ancient Fey bone's energy!</p>
<p>"That's not right! That's not right! Something must not be right!"</p>
<p>Lie Ya bellowed. At this moment, there were numerous Fire Cloud State disciples who were looking pitifully at Lie Ya.</p>
<p>They also knew about how Lie Ya had attempted to scam Luo Fengling, but now, he had ended up losing 70&ndash;80 World Stones.</p>
<p>And from Yi Yun's situation, it did not seem like it was a problem to break past a hundred.</p>
<p>By losing more than a hundred World Stones in one fell swoop, whatever Lie Ya gained had previously at the Ancient Fey Edifice might even have to be vomited out.</p>
<p>At this moment, even Cang Mang was startled as he looked at Yi Yun. From not paying any concern to Yi Yun from the beginning to noting with interest, and finally to amazement.</p>
<p>There were not many juniors that could amaze Cang Mang.</p>
<p>Chapter 838: Four Days</p>
<p>"It's been… three… three days… " Beside Lie Ya, someone said softly.</p>
<p>Three days had passed since Lie Ya had made his wretched bet with Luo Fengling. This also meant seventy-two hours and Lie Ya had lost more than a hundred World Stones. Lie Ya no longer had the disposition to continue cultivating. Every breath he took made his body wince in pain.</p>
<p>"Why does it feel like… Yi Yun will be able to persist on all the way? He won't persist for a whole month, will he?"</p>
<p>A month?</p>
<p>Lie Ya's face twisted when he heard that sentence. Yi Yun was planning on persisting to the end of the Black Wind Valley trials?</p>
<p>Persisting for a month sounded unbelievable, but from the way that Yi Yun stayed on the second level all fine and dandy, when was it going to end?</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was also now on the third level. With the passing of time, she herself was confused, having earned more than twenty year's worth of salary without doing a thing. It was just fascinating hearing what had happened. What method was Junior Brother Yi using to persist for so long?</p>
<p>However, finally on the fourth day, there was a slight change in the situation.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body was no longer burning hot. His skin was no longer glowing from the heat, and from the looks of it, he seemed to slowly calm down.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey energy was mysterious and bizarre. Using one's flesh and blood to refine the energy could result in all sorts of unpredictable matters. The others had no idea what had happened to Yi Yun either.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, the Ancient Fey energy was not surging as crazily as before, as though it could be controlled now.</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>"Has he finally ended the absorption of the Ancient Fey bone?" People began to generate such thoughts when they saw Yi Yun's state. Only by stopping the absorption of the energy would Yi Yun appear so calm on the surface.</p>
<p>"How do you end the absorption? The Ancient Fey bone is sealed by a mighty supreme figure. The moment that the Ancient Fey blood and energy contained within is absorbed, it is equivalent to opening a hole. The blood and energy would constantly leak out, and in a few days, there wouldn't be much of the Ancient Fey energy left in it."</p>
<p>The person who spoke was Luo Tian from the Phoenix Firmiana State.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Ancient Fey bone, even mortal herbs like ginseng had similar properties. If one bit on a ginseng, its essence would begin draining away, and in a few days, all of its herbal properties would be gone. Hence, ginseng pickers would usually use a small brush to pick at it for days, afraid of breaking any strand of the ginseng.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that be a waste? However, for this guy, wasting is better than succumbing to the tumultuous energy that might result in his meridians being damaged." Another Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said.</p>
<p>"Waste!? Then he might as well give me the part of the Ancient Fey bone that hasn't been absorbed!"</p>
<p>Many people were rendered speechless when they heard this. Don't force yourself if you can't absorb all of it, we can help you absorb a bit of it. Wasting it would be such a pity.</p>
<p>However, regardless of their wishes, with Cang Mang still sitting mid air all calm and composed, as though he was not planning on interfering, it was not possible for them to rush up to the second level to grab it from him.</p>
<p>"Don't be silly! Even if he can't absorb it all, he won't give it to you. Although the Ancient Fey bone's energy will leak, only a small portion ends up leaking. There will be still some left overs, but why would he give it to you?"</p>
<p>Many people were envious, but they were out of options. They could only watch as Yi Yun recklessly destroyed a treasure of heaven.</p>
<p>In order to pass the Black Wind Valley trial, Yi Yun had wrecked an Ancient Fey bone that was from their Luo clan. If not for Cang Mang floating mid air, they would have rushed up and grabbed the Ancient Fey bone from Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, Yi Yun had exceeded expectations. He had persisted on for four days, which was fascinating!</p>
<p>The violent energy was something that typical people could not persist on for eight hours, what more six times that amount.</p>
<p>Ran Yu meaningfully glanced at Yi Yun and he said to himself, "Yi Yun, I have indeed underestimated you previously. To be able to last for so long under the intense energy tempering, you will definitely obtain some benefits if your meridians aren't damaged!"</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Yi Yun did not appear to have injured his meridians.</p>
<p>But even so, with so much energy consumed, no one knew how much he could digest.</p>
<p>Being able to eat a meal that was worth what was days' worth for others did not necessarily mean that one could grow fat or taller.</p>
<p>"That human punk has truly not spared any effort in order to pass the trial. It appears like he won't have problems reaching the fifth level. We can't be inferior to a human punk. Let's work hard at getting a foothold on the fifth level before attempting the sixth."A Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said.</p>
<p>The middle bulk of the Phoenix Firmiana State's disciples were generally stronger than the Fire Cloud State's disciples.</p>
<p>At this moment, they began their attempts at the fourth and fifth levels. And at this moment in time, Ran Yu had already found his footing on the sixth level.</p>
<p>He had destroyed a humanoid shadow with a slash, absorbing all the black gas from it. He was finally able to gain a foothold on the sixth level.</p>
<p>However, the pressure from the black gasses had spiked at the sixth level, so it was not easy for Ran Yu to withstand it. He still had more than twenty days for to step onto the seventh level. As long as everything went smoothly, it would not be difficult.</p>
<p>Seeing Ran Yu gain his footing on the sixth level, many people felt jealous.</p>
<p>As long as he reached the seventh level, there would be an Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake there!</p>
<p>They were also participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials. But as ordinary disciples, they were still too far from competing with a genius like Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Similarly terrifying was Gu Luo.</p>
<p>Gu Luo had remained on the fourth level for a very long period of time. Compared to Ran Yu, he was rather inconspicuous.</p>
<p>However, when Gu Luo descended onto the fifth level, he immediately caught everyone's attention. This was because Gu Luo had yet to stimulate his Fey race bloodline even at the fifth level!</p>
<p>He was relying on his body to forcefully resist it!</p>
<p>The black Fey that had taken form began to bite Gu Luo's body, but he remained as still as a mummy. Instantly, black Fey swarmed him, and this scene alone left many people's scalps tingling. How strong was his body for him to be able to resist such biting?</p>
<p>That was purely masochistic. Even if he had a powerful body, it was impossible to not feel any pain from such biting.</p>
<p>As the Phoenix Firmiana State and Fire Cloud State disciples were striving hard to attempt the deeper levels in Black Wind Valley, Yi Yun was still quietly refining the Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>In four days, the Purple Crystal had completely disintegrated the Ancient Fey bone. The Ancient Fey bone's energy was crystallized into tiny crystals that were dispersed throughout Yi Yun's flesh and blood. Yi Yun was slowly digesting and absorbing the energy crystals, and the process was much slower. This also stopped Yi Yun's body burning like a boiler.</p>
<p>As for the Ancient Fey bone itself, it had already been reduced to powder.</p>
<p>Even a Heaven Ascension realm genius from a famous Heaven Fey family would absorb half the energy of an Ancient Fey bone at best. Furthermore, it would take them a year or two to slowly digest and absorb it. This was already the best outcome, but using the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun just needed an extremely short amount of time to completely absorb the entire Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>Chapter 839: Reappearance of the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake</p>
<p>Days passed and nearly half of the month-long Black Wind Valley trial was over.</p>
<p>Including Lie Ya, there were more and more people who had managed to set foot onto Black Wind Valley's fifth level!</p>
<p>This was the minimum level that Cang Mang required.</p>
<p>Lie Ya was one of the first few people who had stepped foot onto the fifth level, but… regardless of how much he led others by, he had an ashen face, as though his father had just died. The debt of more than 150 World Stones was suppressing his heart like a heavy rock. Just thinking of how he could settle the debt gave Lie Ya a headache.</p>
<p>And the culprit of all this was Yi Yun. He was still on the second level.</p>
<p>"Why is that kid still meditating!? When does he plan on finishing his meditation?"</p>
<p>Just looking at Yi Yun made Lie Ya feel an irreconcilable hatred for him. He wanted to see what fuss Yi Yun would produce after absorbing the Ancient Fey bone for four days. He wanted to know if Yi Yun could even find his footing on the fifth level.</p>
<p>And suddenly, a red stream of light flashed near the seventh level.</p>
<p>It was the tiny single-horned snake with a body as crystalline as blood jade!</p>
<p>The moment the snake appeared, it brought with it a strange aura. Everyone could sense it. To the Fey race, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was a treasure with extreme attractive powers. This attraction came from their bloodline.</p>
<p>Lie Ya momentarily could not bother to focus on Yi Yun. As he looked at the tiny scarlet snake shuttling through the seventh level, his eyes glimmered.</p>
<p>He truly wanted it.</p>
<p>If he could catch that tiny snake, what were 150 or 160 World Stones? Even if it were a thousand World Stones, his family clan would give it to him without the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, he could not even find his footing on the sixth level, what more capture the tiny snake?</p>
<p>Lie Ya felt helpless. On the sixth level, there were only three people — Ran Yu, Luo Tian and Gu Luo! Of course, the three of them were the only ones eligible for competing for the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>Seeing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake appear, the trio, who were meditating on the sixth level, immediately stood up.</p>
<p>All of them wanted the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake at all costs!</p>
<p>"Luo Tian, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake shall belong to me!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu roared as his blood began to boil. The Ranyi Fish phantom image appeared behind Ran Yu once again. With a leap, he entered the seventh level!</p>
<p>For Ran Yu, the move from the sixth to the seventh level was a great challenge.</p>
<p>"The seventh level! It has finally begun!"</p>
<p>Seeing Ran Yu head to the seventh level first, the Fire Cloud State disciples had anticipatory looks. Since they were destined to have no luck with the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, they could feel honored if it was the famous Ran Yu, who was also a Fire Cloud State disciple, that managed to catch the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was the first to jump down, but Luo Tian only smiled. He did not make a move.</p>
<p>The moment that Ran Yu landed on the seventh level, the surrounding black gas immediately billowed around him like a tsunami wave.</p>
<p>Ran Yu had already done all his preparatory work. He had been cultivating for so long on the sixth level all for this moment.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was just too fast. Just after Ran Yu stepped foot onto the seventh level, it sank into the billowing black gas and disappeared.</p>
<p>At this moment, in the roaring sea of black billowing gases, a gigantic black dragon took form. It stirred the sea, producing an overwhelming pressure. As it spiraled over, it bit at Ran Yu!</p>
<p>"Ha!" Ran Yu bellowed. The Ranyi Fish phantom image suddenly expanded in size and it jerked its body. Simultaneously, Ran Yu threw a heavy punch with both arms. The surface of his fists seemed to contain a layer of surging water, and once he struck with his fists, the water withdrew as energy burst forth!</p>
<p>Ran Yu and his Ancient Fey bloodline synergized well together.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The water patterns and the Ranyi Fish clashed with the gigantic black dragon. A wanton shockwave burst out as Ran Yu felt his arms go numb, and was sent flying backwards!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Ran Yu slammed into a stone pillar heavily. He felt something rise up his throat and he nearly spat a mouthful of blood out. But with so many people watching him, he was unwilling to show any weakness. He forcefully swallowed the mouthful of blood and circulated his energy once again!</p>
<p>But even though he could forcefully brace himself, Ran Yu felt that his energy was rapidly depleting, with some of the black gas entering his body!</p>
<p>Ran Yu's heart sank. The seventh level was on a completely different level of difficulty compared to the sixth level!</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu no longer had thoughts of capturing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Gritting his teeth, he resisted the surging black waves around him. Every punch sent out water ripples that expanded out in concentric circles. They clashed with the waves, but they were being repeatedly compressed by the waves!</p>
<p>If this went on, it would be a problem for Ran Yu to find his footing on the seventh level, much less capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State disciples felt their hearts tightened. With Ran Yu having so much trouble, what about Gu Luo?</p>
<p>"Weak!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Tian suddenly spoke. As he watched the struggling Ran Yu, he sneered and said, "With your strength, finding your footing itself is a problem, so how can you even capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake? Even if I don't compete with you, you won't be able to obtain it either."</p>
<p>"You!" Ran Yu's was infuriated. However, he no longer had the time and energy to refute Luo Tian. All his energy was dedicated to resisting the black wave.</p>
<p>"Watch carefully!"</p>
<p>Having said that, Luo Tian roared, as every joint in his body produced an erupting explosion. Luo Tian's bloodline was the ancient Gigantic Demon Ape!</p>
<p>The ancient Gigantic Demon Ape had extremely powerful strength. It had the ability to move stars and it had a brutal personality. It was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>And the descendants of the Gigantic Demon Ape were born with incomplete manifestations. There would always be parts of their body with the characteristics of a Fey beast.</p>
<p>After the Gigantic Demon Ape's descendants stimulated their bloodline, they would be different to typical Heaven Fey. They had a natural ability which was to fuse with the bloodline phantom image!</p>
<p>After the fusion, Luo Tian's body would be like a frame that supported the bloodline phantom image.</p>
<p>With a thick and realistic bloodline phantom image enshrouded by Luo Tian, this fusion resulted in a giant ape!</p>
<p>Luo Tian's realm was only at the Heaven Ascension realm. His bloodline phantom image was not powerful. If it was, what he produced would not have been a thirty feet giant ape, but a being that was a thousand feet tall and would be able to shatter a mountain range with a single punch. Furthermore, this was a mountain range from the 12 Empyrean Heavens. The firmness was far from ordinary.</p>
<p>But even so, with Luo Tian's cultivation realm, it was already extremely terrifying for his bloodline phantom image to reach this stage!</p>
<p>This needed an extremely powerful physique to support it. This was also the result of more than ten days of cultivation on the sixth level for Luo Tian.</p>
<p>Luo Tian used every hidden card he had, with his goal naturally being to enter the seventh level to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>Luo Tian was in no hurry to go lower. Instead, he shattered several black gas shadows on the sixth level and devoured the Blood Dragon black gas to nourish his Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline!</p>
<p>Following that, Luo Tian leaped downwards onto the seventh level of Black Wind Valley!</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, the phantom image moved along with him as a gigantic ape palm struck at the Blood Dragon black gas in the seventh level!</p>
<p>Chapter 840: Cooperate?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Luo Tian's gigantic ape palm heavily slammed into the black-misted dragon head. With a quiver, the dragon head roared and continued rushing forwards!</p>
<p>"Peng!" Luo Tian pressed down on the dragon head, but his body was sent flying backwards by the great impact. He eventually landed on a rock cliff.</p>
<p>Luo Tian suppressed his surging blood as he roared again, bulging all his muscles!</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>The ancient Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline in his body burst out to its limits, but Luo Tian still could not do a single thing against the black dragon. With a sudden jolt, the black dragon pressed down on Luo Tian, causing the cliff face behind him to crack!</p>
<p>Even Luo Tian was at a disadvantage?</p>
<p>When the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples saw this scene, they felt their hearts tighten. Just a flood dragon condensed from the black mist on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley was already this powerful!</p>
<p>Both Luo Tian and Ran Yu could not block it!</p>
<p>At this moment, Gu Luo also jumped onto the seventh level. Taking advantage of Luo Tian's fight with the black dragon and his thin Mummy-like body, he plunged deep into the depths of the black mist like a ghost!</p>
<p>Gu Luo was taking the opportunity to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>"That guy!"</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State disciples began to curse. By taking advantage of Luo Tian's blocking of the black dragon for him, Gu Luo's sneaky act was despised by the rest of the warriors.</p>
<p>Of course, although they found it despicable, they could only watch on. Other than those three, no one else could enter the seventh level.</p>
<p>Gu Luo was extremely fast. Since Luo Tian was trapped by the black dragon, he could not prevent this from happening. Hence, in an instant, Gu Luo had rushed into the black mist. The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was leisurely swimming around in the black mist, as though it was having fun in Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Seeing Gu Luo charge at it, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake remained unperturbed. He didn't if it was an illusion, but it revealed a weird sinister smile.</p>
<p>It was creepy just thinking about a snake's smile</p>
<p>"Si… !"</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake spat its tongue out like an arrow that shot straight at Gu Luo. Using his bloodline's power to augment his dehydrated palm, he suddenly grabbed at the snake.</p>
<p>'"Puah!"</p>
<p>Blood splattered everywhere as a mist of redness burst out of the black mist. With a deep-sounding snort, Gu Luo held his dehydrated palm. His hand had been pierced through by the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, boring a blood hole in it.</p>
<p>This...</p>
<p>People knew very well that Gu Luo's body possessed terrifying strength. Previously, on the fourth and fifth levels of Black Wind Valley, Gu Luo had only used his body to withstand the black gases. Yet, with Gu Luo's powerful body, he was instantly wounded. How could the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake be caught?</p>
<p>"Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!"</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake shuttled through the air and devoured all the blood that spewed out of Gu Luo's palm. And at this moment, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake changed its target and charged at Gu Luo's body.</p>
<p>Gu Luo's constantly paralyzed face finally revealed a trace of fear. With a leap, he jumped towards the sixth level.</p>
<p>Luo Tian and Ran Yu also noticed that the situation was unfavorable. Luo Tian forcefully conjured his bloodline's power and he repelled the black dragon. Luo Tian and Ran Yu also jumped back to the sixth level.</p>
<p>With the trio gone, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake returned to its leisurely state. It swam in the black mist, appearing and disappearing from time to time.</p>
<p>The three top figures of the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State had returned in failure.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Luo clan disciples present felt their hearts skip a beat. The seventh level was just too difficult.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, all three of them had no means to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. There were more than ten days left. It was also difficult for the trio to use the time to improve themselves to the point of being able to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake alone, and it might even be impossible!</p>
<p>Unless… they cooperated!</p>
<p>With the three people cooperating, one of them can block the black dragon, while the other two could capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. It was actually possible!</p>
<p>If the ordinary Luo clan disciples could think of cooperation, it was obvious that the trio thought of it as well.</p>
<p>However, if they cooperated, how were they going to split the trophies of war after capturing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake?</p>
<p>Could the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake be equally split? It was quite impossible to think of splitting such a spiritual being.</p>
<p>When he thought about this, Luo Tian suddenly thought of something else. Looking up, he saw Cang Mang sitting with a coy but deep meaningful smile on his face.</p>
<p>This gave Luo Tian a fright. Could that sly fox have done this on purpose?</p>
<p>Cang Mang knew that with the trio's strength, it was impossible for them to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake alone. However, he made them look at it, and it was practically a carrot dangling in front of them that they could not eat.</p>
<p>Geniuses that came from different states felt contempt for each other, and in fact, even people from the same state believed in every man for himself. Sharing with others was not tolerated.</p>
<p>Cang Mang knew this clearly, but he had deliberately designed a situation in which they needed to cooperate.</p>
<p>Without any cooperation, no one could receive anything. However, if they cooperated, how were they going to split the rewards?</p>
<p>This was a problem that Cang Mang deliberately proposed!</p>
<p>"What is Cang Mang doing this for?" Ran Yu secretly pondered. Maybe Cang Mang was telling the Luo clan disciples that the Luo clan needed intense competition, but they also needed each other's cooperation?</p>
<p>Or could it be that Cang Mang wanted to watch a good show of them trying to cheat and outwit each other? The strongest person who was most opportunistic could capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake in the confusion.</p>
<p>However, regardless of what situation that Cang Mang wanted to see, it did not matter. What mattered was that Luo Tian, Ran Yu and company knew that when they matured, they would explore mystic realms in the future. And when the time came, they would also face similar situations.</p>
<p>When a group of people were chasing a treasure with no one having the ability to monopolize it, they had no choice but to cooperate, and also guard against their teammates while trying to outwit each other.</p>
<p>"That old fox is machinating something against us." Ran Yu's face fell heavily as he looked at Gu Luo and Luo Tian.</p>
<p>Gu Luo remained silent with the same old corpse-like face. There was no way to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>From a look on Luo Tian's face, he clearly shared the same thoughts as Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Noticing that Ran Yu was looking at him, Luo Tian sneered and said, "I know what you're thinking. I do not have the habit of cooperating with others. The three of us shall make a move together, but everything will depend on your own skill. As long as we don't hold back each other, we can see who has the ability to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!"</p>
<p>With Luo Tian being so arrogant, Ran Yu also sneered and said, "I did not plan on cooperating with you as well. We shall be judged by our own merits and see who the winner is!"</p>
<p>Cang Mang sat silently mid-air, nonchalantly watching at all of this.</p>
<p>He naturally knew that be it Luo Tian or Ran Yu, they were prideful people. How could they tolerate sharing treasures with others?</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was more than ten days left before the Black Wind Valley trial ended. Luo Tian and Ran Yu would definitely vie for it, but things would turn interesting when they realized the fact that it was impossible.</p>
<p>Cang Mang did not expect the arrogant geniuses to sincerely cooperate with others. He only wanted to see how the geniuses would handle such situations when they faced with them. It was also interesting to see how they reluctantly cooperated while trying to defend against being backstabbed.</p>
<p>Cang Mang was curious about the outcome. This was the only pleasure that came from leading the bunch of juniors to participate in these boring trials.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, he suddenly sensed something and looked at the second level of Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Eh? That human kid was finally getting up after such a long meditation?</p>
<p>Chapter 841: Body Tempering isn't accomplished in a day</p>
<p>At this moment, nearly every Luo clan disciple in Black Wind Valley was focused on the battle on the seventh level. Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Luo Tian were encircling the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, trying to overpower it. It was an intense battle, so although the other Luo clan disciples could not participate in it, just spectating it was quite a good experience. Some people even abandoned their cultivation just to watch it, so why would anyone pay attention to the lonely Yi Yun at the second level?</p>
<p>Hence, when Yi Yun woke up, other than Cang Mang who was hovering high in the air, very few people noticed it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun slowly opened his eyes and for a split second, his eyes seemed to flicker with the light of the stars. However, the glint subsided after a split second. Yi Yun's eyes was returned to their usual calmness. His pupils were like a baby's, unpolluted and clear. They were deep black and bright.</p>
<p>In the previous cultivation time, Yi Yun had already finished absorbing all the Ancient Fey energy. Now, with the energy tempering his body, Yi Yun's bodily toughness could no longer be compared what it was in the past!</p>
<p>Now, even if Yi Yun faced the Black-armored Demon God, with his body that had been tempered several times, he was confident that he could have a frontal clash with the Black-armored Demon God.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>A breath like a white beam shot out of Yi Yun's mouth. This breath shot to the ceiling of the cave and it became a swirling gas along the mountain cliff, as though the breath contained some spirituality in it. It moved like a white snake.</p>
<p>He opened all his acupuncture points, and his meridians were completely free of any blockage!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yi Yun felt as though his body was lighter. At the same time, a feeling... a great emptiness overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>His body lacked Yuan Qi!</p>
<p>This was because as Yi Yun's physique improved, his organs, meridians and bones were all tempered, becoming extremely firm. This was like how a reservoir had increased in size, allowing it to store more water.</p>
<p>It was not that Yi Yun did not have any Yuan Qi in his body, now the Yuan Qi he had was insufficient to fill his entire body.</p>
<p>With a stronger body, this allowed him to store more Yuan Qi. The benefits of doing so was self-evident.</p>
<p>"This Ancient Fey bone sure has good effects!" Yi Yun's face revealed a very satisfied look.</p>
<p>He looked out of the cave, and even the third level of Black Wind Valley had very few people.</p>
<p>"I've been cultivating for so long, so it's time to attempt Black Wind Valley." Yi Yun said to himself.</p>
<p>With a leap, he jumped straight down to the third level.</p>
<p>At this moment, the third level had a few people like Bai Chen. They could not find their footing on the fourth level.</p>
<p>Bai Chen was stunned when he saw Yi Yun come down. "Junior Brother Yi! Have you just finished!?"</p>
<p>Cultivation time in the Black Wind Valley trials was extremely valuable. Everyone was in a race against time, but Yi Yun had used more than ten days to consume the Ancient Fey bone. Although the saying goes that more preparation would not delay the speed of getting work done, wasting the time for cultivation in Black Wind Valley was quite a pity.</p>
<p>Every level in Black Wind Valley required the warriors to slowly acclimatize to it. Even Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Luo Tian did not get to the sixth level immediately. They began from the fifth level, in Guo Luo's case, the second level, and they adapted to the black mist in Black Wind Valley. They also used it to nourish their Fey race bloodline before they headed to the sixth level.</p>
<p>On the sixth level, the three of them took a long time to consolidate their progress before attempting the seventh level. However, they still failed at the beginning!</p>
<p>Yi Yun now had slightly more than ten days left, so he was definitely at a disadvantage to begin challenging Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded and said lightly, "The Ancient Fey energy was a bit hard to absorb, so there was some delay in time."</p>
<p>"That's more than ten days left. Junior Brother Yi, you sure don't care." Bai Chen felt helpless. He knew that Yi Yun was strong, so he was entitled to being willful. Regardless of how much Yi Yun delayed his progress, he was still much stronger than him.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the Ancient Fey energy is difficult to absorb. Junior Brother Yi, you managed to persist on for four days. That was really impressive. Unfortunately, if there was a period of time for you to specially absorb the Ancient Fey bone after the Ancient Fey Edifice trial, you would have had a full thirty days here in Black Wind Valley. If that was the case, you might even have reached the sixth level!"</p>
<p>For the past few days, as Bai Chen realized that Yi Yun was getting stronger and stronger, he no longer thought about comparing himself with Yi Yun. He might as well befriend Yi Yun, since a genius like Yi Yun was of a different world to him in any case.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun and Bai Chen's conversation, more and more noticed that Yi Yun had awoken.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State disciples did not think too much of Yi Yun's awakening. Their attention was still focused on Luo Tian.</p>
<p>"A typical Heaven Fey needs a year just to absorb Ancient Fey bone. That human only used a short period of ten or so days. Even though his absorption of the Ancient Fey bone seemed rather impressive, to tell me that he can go from a weak bodied person to a powerful body-tempered warrior in slightly more than ten days, I really refuse to believe that. Ignoring body-tempering, just the cultivation of Yuan Qi. Has anyone heard of someone at the most basic Yuan foundation realm eat a treasure and jump a few realms, reaching the Heaven Ascension perfection?" A Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said.</p>
<p>Body tempering was not something that could be completed in a day. How many of the Fey race Luo clan disciples present spent a decade or so focusing on their body-tempering?</p>
<p>The Fey race were weaker at nomological cultivation, so they naturally dedicated more time on body-tempering.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun could use a short span of half a month to surpass them in body-tempering, then what was the point of living? They might as well collectively jump off Black Wind Valley to commit suicide.</p>
<p>As the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples spoke, Yi Yun had already jumped down from the third level onto the fourth.</p>
<p>Many people were watching with great anticipation. Yi Yun had tempered his body for about half a month. If his body-tempering standard exceeded theirs, it meant that with a single Ancient Fey bone, the Luo clan could produce a body-tempering genius in a short period of time! How could a body-tempering genius be so easily available!?</p>
<p>At this moment, even Cang Mang's attention was moved to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>As for Ran Yu, Luo Tian and even the zombie-faced Gu Luo, they all looked at Yi Yun as well. They too wanted to know what was new with Yi Yun, who had stirred up quite a fuss during those four days.</p>
<p>Yi Yun steadily landed on a rock on the fourth level, where Luo Fengling was.</p>
<p>At this moment—</p>
<p>"Wu Wu Wu!"</p>
<p>A cold air blew up! Layers of black gas transformed into the shapes of Fey beasts and ghouls as they pounced on Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not budge, but the Nine Neonate phantom image behind him roared. Its body rapidly expanded as its nine heads waved around before beginning to freely devour the black gases' Fey beasts and monsters. The beasts and monsters were swallowed by the Nine Neonate, turning into pure energy!</p>
<p>As for the present Yi Yun, his body had improved tremendously. He was in need of the nourishment of energy and blood. Yi Yun's body was like a dried up reservoir, so with large amounts of spring water suddenly being injected into it, it made every cell in Yi Yun's body automatically absorb the essence energy that was a result of the degenerated Blood Dragon's blood and rapidly grow!</p>
<p>Yi Yun now possessed a body that was, at the most, a basic Seamless Body.</p>
<p>Every minute part of Yi Yun's body had been tempered. Hence, regardless of if it was blood energy or Heaven Earth Yuan Qi that surged in, none of that would be wasted. Even if he was not in the black mist, Yi Yun's flesh and blood would also slowly grow even while he was sleeping!</p>
<p>Chapter 842: Indomitable without Resistance</p>
<p>After Yi Yun absorbed the Ancient Fey bone, the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem behind him grew even more ferocious. It practically swept through the gases on the fourth level and quickly, the black-misted Fey beasts and ghouls that possessed intelligence no longer dared to approach Yi Yun. Being near him was equivalent to sending themselves to death!</p>
<p>"Wu Wu Wu!"</p>
<p>After the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem devoured large quantities of black mist essence energy, it had a slight feeling of contentment. As for Yi Yun, he also sensed that the lacking blood and energy in his body that was a result of his powerful body was being slowly replenished.</p>
<p>Yi Yun clenched his fist as he experienced the feeling of a body filled with energy. This feeling was extremely good.</p>
<p>"As expected, the fourth level does not pose a problem for Yi Yun."</p>
<p>Yi Yun had gotten his footing on the fourth level, so it meant his reaching the fifth level was certain. After all, according to Cang Mang's standards, as long as they reached the fifth level, even if it was for one second at the end, it would still be considered a pass.</p>
<p>Actually, most people present no longer believed that Yi Yun would be eliminated by the Black Wind Valley trial after his massive display of enduring the torment of the Ancient Fey bone's energy for four days. They were only doubtful about Yi Yun's body-tempering technique.</p>
<p>"That punk sure is crafty. The Nine Neonate Aspect Totem is a human's energy-based method after all. When he reached the fourth level, he did not even use his body's strength." A Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said in disgruntlement.</p>
<p>The Black Wind Valley was a test of the Fey race's bloodline and bodily strength.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had used the energy-based methods of the Human race, so he naturally earned the disdain of the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cang Mang had never barred Yi Yun from using his Aspect Totem in the rules that he had set at the beginning. This allowed Yi Yun to find a loophole.</p>
<p>Another Phoenix Firmiana State disciple laughed and said, "You expect him to use his body? Regardless of what body-tempering system he used, it's impossible for him to accomplish it in ten or so days. Just the time for my body-tempering adds up to about twenty years."</p>
<p>That Phoenix Firmiana State disciple had been cultivating for sixty to seventy years. About a third of his time was spent on body-tempering, so it was evident how much he invested in body-tempering.</p>
<p>Noticing how Yi Yun was about to descend to the fifth level and the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem behind him was still snarling with its fangs and claws, as though it still could go for more, people understood why Yi Yun had previously stopped to absorb the Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>Luo Tian, who was at the sixth level, shook his head and said, "So it seems that Yi Yun's absorption of the Ancient Fey bone was actually to nourish his Nine Neonate Aspect Totem. After the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem absorbed the Ancient Fey bone's bloodline, it naturally became a lot more powerful. Hence, it can absorb the degenerated Blood Dragon's energy in such an indomitable fashion. This strategy of his is ingenious. Unfortunately, it's such a waste to use an Ancient Fey bone to nourish an Aspect Totem.</p>
<p>"With my Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline, I can sense Yi Yun's bodily toughness. It is not that strong. However, to make such a sacrifice for the Luo Divine Hall trials, Yi Yun is nothing impressive after all."</p>
<p>Luo Tian shook his head. Actually, with Luo Tian's cultivation level and his ancient Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline, he could sense Yi Yun's body-tempering accomplishments up to a certain extent. Indeed, there was a limit to how much Yi Yun's bodily strength could improve in less than half a month. Using his Aspect Totem to reach the fifth level was most likely a shortcut.</p>
<p>However, Luo Tian despised such shortcuts. He paid attention to Yi Yun because of Yi Yun's stunning performance at the Ancient Fey Edifice. However, now at Black Wind Valley, Yi Yun putting in so much time and effort in order to pass made him seem inferior.</p>
<p>What Luo Tian said was actually on many people's mind. As Yi Yun's performance in the Ancient Fey Edifice was astounding, everyone had higher expectations of him, even if what was tested at Black Wind Valley was Yi Yun's weakness.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had already landed on the fifth level. Luo Fengling, who was at the fourth level, looked down. She was worried that Yi Yun could not withstand the level.</p>
<p>The moment that he landed on the fifth level, the black mist formed Fey beasts and specters that were immediately several times more powerful than those of the previous level. The black shadows rushed at him maniacally and clashed with the Nine Neonate Aspect Totem!</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate Aspect Totem roared as its nine heads danced in the black mist freely. Every head would snap at a specter or Fey beast. The energy contained within those black figures were devoured by it, strengthening itself.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun find his footing on the fifth level, Lie Ya revealed an extremely complex look.</p>
<p>He had also found his footing on the fifth level just now. As for the sixth level, he could descend onto it, but he could not last long on there.</p>
<p>So what if Yi Yun usage of his Aspect Totem was not the orthodox way? Now with Yi Yun at the same level as him, how could he feel any better?</p>
<p>Thankfully, at this moment, a black-misted Fey beast grasped an opportunity to charge at the Nine Neonate and bit down on one of the Nine Neonate's neck. Instantly, the Nine Neonate's figure began to flicker violently. As the the Nine Neonate's master, Yi Yun also immediately sensed a chill in his blood vessels!</p>
<p>The Aspect Totem was one with Yi Yun. So with the black gas eroding the Aspect Totem, it also managed to invade Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>"He got bitten!"</p>
<p>Lie Ya was delighted and he finally heaved a sigh of relief. Thankfully, Yi Yun was not a freak of nature. He still did not have his footing on the fifth level and he was still slightly inferior to him.</p>
<p>This was good.</p>
<p>Lie Ya had lowered his expectations. Even in a field that was his expertise, he did not wish for Yi Yun to be far inferior to him. As long as there was a tiny bit of difference, he would be psychologically comforted.</p>
<p>"The degree of my body-tempering is still slightly weaker. Although it has increased by a hundred, if not a thousand times in the short span of half a month, compared to the Fey race who have tempered their bodies for more than a decade, it is still inferior."</p>
<p>Luo Tian's evaluation of Yi Yun's body-tempering wasn't wrong. Even with the Ancient Fey bone and the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun was still unable to bridge the chasm that was a result of time.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not care even if his body was not strong enough. He did not stay on the fifth level, and instead, he suddenly leapt down towards the sixth level!</p>
<p>"What!?"</p>
<p>With this, both the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State disciples were stunned. You haven't gotten your footing on the fifth level, why are you going to the sixth?</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi!" Luo Fengling cried out. Black Wind Valley was not a place of fun and games. If he was being careless, his mind and blood would be devoured by the black mist. It was even possible to become a retard.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present, be they Heaven Fey or not, would have to wait till they found their solid footing on each level before they dared to attempt the next level. And even so, it was easy for them to be inflicted with injuries. But now, with Yi Yun forcefully descending onto the sixth level, it appeared fatal.</p>
<p>"That retard is sending himself to his death?" Lie Ya sneered.</p>
<p>He was waiting for Yi Yun to be swarmed by the black-misted shadows and inflicted with serious injuries.</p>
<p>The sixth level was where Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Luo Tian were. The three of them watched as Yi Yun landed in between them.</p>
<p>What audacity!</p>
<p>Ran Yu immediately moved away from Yi Yun. His intentions were clear. He did not want to help Yi Yun by sharing any of the pressure. People like Ran Yu, who had found their footing on the sixth level, were deliberately avoided by the black figures so as to not be devoured.</p>
<p>However, a newcomer like Yi Yun was different. He was definitely 'welcomed'!</p>
<p>Wu—!</p>
<p>The moment that Yi Yun landed on the sixth level, a humanoid figure in black armor immediately charged at Yi Yun!</p>
<p>That humanoid figure was formed by the black mist with the consumption of a warrior's memories. It was much stronger than the typical shadowy figures!</p>
<p>Seeing this figure charge at him, Yi Yun turned serious, and from his chest, a hitch-pitch scream was heard.</p>
<p>This screech was still reverberating as a gigantic three-legged Golden Crow phantom image charged at the sky from behind Yi Yun!</p>
<p>The Golden Crow phantom image cried as it grabbed at the humanoid shadow!</p>
<p>Hu! Hu! Hu!</p>
<p>Before the Golden Crow's claws reached their target, rolling pure Yang flames began to burn and consume their surroundings!</p>
<p>The moment that the evil energies touched the pure Yang flames, they melted like ice. The humanoid shadow paused for a moment and it immediately lost a lot of its momentum. And at this moment, the Nine Neonate also roared, and with the Golden Crow, they attacked the humanoid shadow in a pincer formation!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, all the Luo clan disciples present were astounded. They were waiting for Yi Yun to suffer, but now, Yi Yun had produced another phantom image. That was another Aspect Totem!?</p>
<p>The human had two Aspect Totems?</p>
<p>Furthermore, they were the Nine Neonate and three-legged Golden Crow, two of the best ancient great Fey. The form of this human's Aspect Totems were even better than their bloodlines as Heaven Fey. It was exasperating!</p>
<p>Chapter 843: Powerfulness of Blood</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>On the sixth level of Black Wind Valley, under the combined attacks of the Golden Crow and the Nine Neonate aspect totems, the black-misted shadows that pounced on Yi Yun exploded, emanating large amounts of energy that the Nine Neonate and Golden Crow sucked clean!</p>
<p>And at this moment, there were more and more black shadows encircling Yi Yun on the sixth level.</p>
<p>Other than Ran Yu, Gu Luo and Luo Tian had simultaneously distanced themselves from Yi Yun, causing him to be fully exposed to all the black-misted shadows on the sixth level.</p>
<p>The entire sixth level's black gases were stirred up, turning it chaotic like a turbulent sea.</p>
<p>The combined pressure that Gu Luo, Ran Yu and Luo Tian faced was not even half of what Yi Yun faced.</p>
<p>Every person who entered the sixth level for the first time would experience the relentless attacks of the black-misted shadows. This was nothing surprising, but the number of black-misted shadows around Yi Yun was exceptionally large. This was because the Nine Neonate and three-legged Golden Crow had immense auras. The three-legged Golden Crow could cover a large stretch of mountains when it spanned its wings. Even the black-misted shadows that were far away were attracted to it.</p>
<p>"Phew&ndash;Phew&ndash;"</p>
<p>The pure Yang flames swept everywhere wantonly as large swaths of black mist were burned. At the same time, be it the three-legged Golden Crow's three sharp claws or its blade like golden wings, all of them were terrifying weapons. Many black figures that charged at Yi Yun were immediately slayed!</p>
<p>And beside the three-legged Golden Crow, the Nine Neonate was like nine flood dragons that stirred the seas. A large number of black figures that were injured by the Golden Crow were directly bitten to death by the Nine Neonate!</p>
<p>A steady stream of black gas fused into the Nine Neonate and Golden Crow totems and Yi Yun's body. Yi Yun sensed that the power in his blood was increasingly more powerful, as though his body was a simmering volcano that would erupt at any time.</p>
<p>"What powerful strength!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun clenched his fists tightly as he looked at them.</p>
<p>"Body-tempering is truly fascinating. In the past, I focused on energy training, so my body was very weak. Although with Yuan Qi filling my body, I was still able to experience the surging of energy, this energy is Heaven Earth Yuan Qi after all. It can be considered to be an exterior power. It's not as powerful as the body and blood's strength. It also gives me a feeling of being stronger. It's no wonder that the Fey race thinks so highly of body-tempering!"</p>
<p>Actually, a majority of the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven focused on Heaven Earth Yuan Qi as well. To the Fey race, body-tempering was just a supplement. After all, they were not like the ancient powerful Fey with pure bloodlines, who were able to resist the Heavenly Dao laws using just their bodies of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>To be able to reach that standard, only existences like the Five Claw Dragon, the Undying Phoenix or the Nine Tribulations Nine Neonate could accomplish that.</p>
<p>As for using a human's body of flesh and blood to attain a divine beast's level of strength, that was just unimaginable.</p>
<p>Many thoughts flashed in Yi Yun's mind. And at this moment, the foul black shadows on the sixth level began to subside on their offensive.</p>
<p>A Nine Neonate could be ignored, but with the three-legged Golden Crow, they were no match at all. Many black shadows had become food for the Nine Neonate and Golden Crow.</p>
<p>"Why does Yi Yun have two Aspect Totems?"</p>
<p>Some of the Fey race present did not know much about human cultivation methods. They did not know what it meant to have dual Aspect Totems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only did he have two of them, the totems were ancient Fey beasts and they were extremely powerful. One was a Golden Crow and the other was a Nine Neonate. Just summoning them was an impressive show of might!</p>
<p>"Looks are useless. So what if it's a Golden Crow and a Nine Neonate. They are Aspect Totems after all, so how can they compare to the power of our Fey race's bloodline. However, that human is rather crafty. Up to now, he has yet to use his body or the power of his bloodline, and he has managed to reach the sixth level. He's not much different to Luo Tian and Ran Yu!"</p>
<p>Many of the Luo clan disciples felt aggrieved. Cang Mang had clearly said that Black Wind Valley was a test of the power of the Fey race's bloodline. But now, they who had truly used the power of their bloodlines were still inferior to Yi Yun, who did not.</p>
<p>"It's a bit too over the top to say that he's not much different to Luo Tian and Ran Yu. Although Yi Yun has summoned his Aspect Totems, he is actually inferior to Luo Tian and Ran Yu on the sixth level." A Fire Cloud State disciple suddenly said.</p>
<p>Previously, while the Golden Crow and Nine Neonate were battling the black figures, they saw that despite the Golden Crow and Nine Neonate being ferocious, they were inevitably bitten by the black-misted figures very clearly. However, they were fierce and powerful, so it did not matter if they were bitten once. However, the black-misted figures were devoured after a single bite.</p>
<p>Hence, such arduous means had allowed Yi Yun to find his footing on the sixth level.</p>
<p>This difference was not evident on the sixth level, but it would become extremely obvious in the seventh level.</p>
<p>Luo Tian, who was able to easily cope with the sixth level, was unable to stand on the seventh level for more than a minute. Furthermore, Luo Tian had spent a long time in the sixth level to accumulate his strength.</p>
<p>"Hu! Hu! Hu!"</p>
<p>As the black-misted shadows took the initiative to avoid Yi Yun, the pure Yang flames also gradually shrunk in size. Yi Yun stood in the sixth level of Black Wind Valley, with the Golden Crow and Nine Neonate by his sides as though they were two guardians protecting Yi Yun. The black figures did not dare attack Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>Luo Tian looked at Yi Yun with an ugly expression. Even though Yi Yun had managed to barely find his footing while he did so easily, they were still standing on the same level after all.</p>
<p>Luo Tian was a very proud person. He had previously been repressed by Yi Yun at the Ancient Fey Edifice, so how could he be reconciled with the fact that Yi Yun had chased up to him in Black Wind Valley?</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, you are truly not bad! I thought you would end up in a bad position at Black Wind Valley, but I never expected you that you would also stand here on the sixth level. However, it's useless. The seventh level will still be mine!"</p>
<p>With that, Luo Tian roared loudly and he jolted his palms. Yuan Qi exploded as the palm winds howled, clearing all the black gas around him.</p>
<p>Even those disciples several levels away could sense the shocks from the strike. If the strike had struck them, they would probably be killed instantly! This was the difference between them and a state's top genius.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>Luo Tian conjured the ancient Gigantic Demon Ape and fused it with his body. This allowed his body to manifest the talent of the Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline, making him extremely violent.</p>
<p>"Watch carefully Yi Yun. You have been cultivating all this time, so let me show you how horrible the seventh level is!"</p>
<p>With that said, Luo Tian jumped towards the seventh floor once again!</p>
<p>Black Wind Valley was his home turf, so how could he let Yi Yun catch up to him on his home turf? Furthermore, Luo Tian was planning to push himself to his limits to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Hence, he was overdrawing on his potential so he could make a breakthrough during the training experience!</p>
<p>"Luo Tian is going down again!"</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Tian jump down to the seventh level once again, the rest of the disciples were astounded. They had been rather drained when they entered the seventh level. Ran Yu and Gu Luo were most likely still resting, but Luo Tian had already charged onto the seventh floor alone. As such, one could tell who was better immediately.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Luo Tian is awesome. The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake will either not be captured by anyone, or if someone manages to capture it, that person will definitely be Senior Brother Luo Tian!"</p>
<p>Chapter 844: Ran Yu's Suggestion</p>
<p>Luo Tian landed on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley once again!</p>
<p>There was about sixteen day left until the end of the trial. With Luo Tian having a great deal of pride, he knew that Cang Mang had deliberately posed a difficult problem to tease them for his own amusement. However, Luo Tian was unhappy about that. He was bent on not letting Cang Mang have his wish. He wanted to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake with his own strength!</p>
<p>Luo Tian also knew about the difficulty of the seventh level. To be able to accomplish the task, other than being powerful himself, he needed to redouble his efforts!</p>
<p>Only through hard work and harder work could he achieve a miracle in the remaining days. Besides obtaining such a huge opportunity, he could also show Cang Mang, who was bent on teasing them, that he was not a person that could be easily teased!</p>
<p>"Luo Tian!"</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Tian return to the seventh level, Ran Yu felt his heart tighten. He had consumed a great deal of his blood and Qi on the seventh level. He had yet to recover from his injuries, so the earliest he could return to the seventh level would be tomorrow. This immediately revealed the contrasting difference between him and Luo Tian, who had gone to the seventh level twice!</p>
<p>The seventh level was difficult, but it also provided the chance for rapid growth. When the time came, Ran Yu might not even have the qualifications to cooperate with Luo Tian to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, what more being the first to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>How could Ran Yu not be anxious when he thought of this?</p>
<p>Luo Tian was definitely his worst enemy at the Black Wind Valley trial.</p>
<p>The moment that Luo Tian landed on the seventh level, the black flood dragon charged at Luo Tian with a roar!</p>
<p>"Just nice!"</p>
<p>Luo Tian snarled as all his bloodline and Qi burst outward. At that instant, Luo Tian appeared to have completely transformed into an ancient Gigantic Demon Ape. He pounded his fists on his chest heavily, producing two deafening sounds that resembled heavenly drums being drummed on that reverberated one's ears.</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>Luo Tian and the black flood dragon clashed. Potent attacks were exchanged between the person and beast.</p>
<p>This clash shook all the black mist in the seventh level, resulting in thundering roars. Looking from above, there were dark clouds rolling in a tumultuous fashion!</p>
<p>Luo Tian was still no match for the black flood dragon. Luo Tian was slammed into the cliff by the intense collision again. His blood began surging as he became short of breath.</p>
<p>The black flood dragon was also slightly injured. Its figure seemed to turn dimmer, but the black flood dragon was formed from the Blood Dragon black gas in the first place. There was black mist everywhere on this level, so just one respiratory cycle was enough for it to quickly replenish the stamina it lost. It did not know tiredness at all.</p>
<p>Unless one could kill the black flood dragon in one fell swoop, it would keep on rejuvenating itself.</p>
<p>A black flood dragon like this was powerful and undying. Just watching it made people feel like there was no way to defeat it. However, Luo Tian clashed head-on against it again and again!</p>
<p>"Luo Tian is truly terrifying… This black flood dragon seems to have endless vitality. But look, although Luo Tian is injured, his bloodline phantom image is also consuming the Blood Dragon black gas around him!" A Fire Cloud State disciple said.</p>
<p>Luo Tian was still able to consume the black gasses to heal himself in such an intense battle. Luo Tian was a freak of nature!</p>
<p>"No wonder Luo Tian is able to consecutively enter the seventh level twice. His recovery speed is just too crazy. However… does Luo Tian plan on competing with the black flood dragon on recovery rate? There is no way that he can beat it!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a Phoenix Firmiana State disciple sneered and said, "Senior Brother Luo's recovery rate naturally is no match for the black dragon, which is formed from the black mist itself, but so what? Senior Brother Luo can continuously improve and he can even have a breakthrough. Watch and see. In a few days, this black dragon will be devoured by Senior Brother Luo!"</p>
<p>The Phoenix Firmiana State disciple was filled with confidence. Ran Yu clenched his fists tightly when he heard these disciples' discussion. He had completely been overshadowed by Luo Tian!</p>
<p>Although the Phoenix Firmiana State disciple that spoke was rather arrogant, what he said may not be too far from the truth!</p>
<p>At this moment, a red figure suddenly flashed in the seventh level's black gas.</p>
<p>Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>Luo Tian caught a glimpse of it and immediately, his eyes focused on it.</p>
<p>Woosh! The sharp sound of air tearing resounded!</p>
<p>Luo Tian did not move his body, but the long tail on his back was whipped out as it twirled and flew at the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this situation, everyone felt a jolt in their hearts.</p>
<p>Luo Tian was too crazy. He was still recuperating! In front of him, there was still the black dragon that was about to recover, but he had the guts to make a move on the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake! The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was not something that could be easily messed with.</p>
<p>But it appeared that Luo Tian was not afraid of injury. Even if he was injured by the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake again, it would be nothing!</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was still not something that could be easily captured. As it sensed Luo Tian's tail twirling over, it made an abrupt leap and disappeared in a red flash of light.</p>
<p>It did not clash with Luo Tian's tail. With the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's cautious personality, it would avoid any head-on collisions if possible.</p>
<p>"The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake is indeed a difficult catch!" Luo Tian's tail might have missed, but he revealed a carefree laugh.</p>
<p>He suddenly looked up and glanced at Cang Mang, who was sitting high in the sky, and he said in an unrestrained manner, "However, there are still sixteen days left. This Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake will inevitably be mine!"</p>
<p>What he said was meant for Cang Mang!</p>
<p>Cang Mang's lips curled up slightly as he revealed a fascinated smile. He was waiting to see the fun.</p>
<p>On the sixth level of Black Wind Valley, Ran Yu's expression turned extremely ugly when he heard those words.</p>
<p>Inevitable!?</p>
<p>Luo Tian was way too arrogant to say such strong words publicly!</p>
<p>"Hahaha, Senior Brother Luo Tian is right. The number one person of the Phoenix Firmiana State should be unrestrained in such a manner!" A lackey of Luo Tian shouted loudly. From his point of view, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake at the Black Wind Valley trial was already in the bag for Luo Tian.</p>
<p>When a Fire Cloud State disciple heard this, he could not help but quip, "To be so arrogant despite not catching the snake yet. Our Fire Cloud State's Ran Yu and Gu Luo are still resting. It's not too late to brag after they make their second attempt."</p>
<p>"Haha, wait for your Fire Cloud State's Ran Yu and Gu Luo to make a second attempt? That would be tomorrow, or maybe the day after tomorrow?" The lackey of Luo Tian, who spoke previously, said in disdain.</p>
<p>When he said this, several Phoenix Firmiana State disciples laughed in unison.</p>
<p>"With Ran Yu and Gu Luo's recovery rate, they probably won't have many shots at it even by the end of the trial!" Another person mocked.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State's disciples had ugly expressions on their faces, but they could not refute at all.</p>
<p>As for Ran Yu, his expression was grim, and he had killing intent in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was also a proud person. He refused to cooperate with others, but it was true that he was inferior to Luo Tian. And if this went on any further, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake would truly be caught by Luo Tian.</p>
<p>He suddenly looked at Yi Yun and said, "Junior Brother Yi, let us cooperate!"</p>
<p>The partner Ran Yu chose was Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Even though they were from the same Fire Cloud State, Ran Yu did not wish to cooperate with Gu Luo. Gu Luo's qualifications and cultivation time in the Heaven Fire Hall was in no way inferior to Ran Yu. Furthermore, Ran Yu did not dare say that he could beat the thin fellow in terms of strength. And most importantly of all, Gu Luo had a background, he had a powerful faction behind him!</p>
<p>Such a faction was something that Ran Yu could not afford to offend. That meant that if he cooperated with Gu Luo and obtained the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, it was impossible for Ran Yu to take it all for himself. It might even be taken away by Gu Luo, so his efforts might end up not yielding the desired outcome.</p>
<p>In that case, Ran Yu obviously wanted to cooperate with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was young and he had a low cultivation level. Furthermore, he did not have any factions supporting him. He was absolutely weaker in terms of factional power and he was easier to control.</p>
<p>Chapter 845: Who do you think you are</p>
<p>Oh? Cooperate?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was somewhat stunned. He looked at Ran Yu, as though he had met him for the first time.</p>
<p>"What did you just call me?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it amusing. This was the first time he heard Ran Yu address him so formally as 'Junior Brother Yi'.</p>
<p>Noticing how Yi Yun did not answer him and instead replied with a hint of sarcasm, Ran Yu frowned. He was a genius from the Xushui Ran clan. He had set aside his differences to ask for Yi Yun's cooperation and he was planning on giving Yi Yun sufficient benefits in exchange, but Yi Yun's response appeared like he did not know any better.</p>
<p>However, with a nemesis like Luo Tian, Ran Yu remained patient as he said, "Junior Brother Yi, I know you are upset with me, but this isn't the time to being tangled in these. Cooperate with me. You will be responsible for handling the black dragon, while I will capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. As long as you can last for about half a minute, I will most likely be able to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. When the time comes, I will definitely pay Junior Brother Yi ample remunerations!"</p>
<p>By saying this, Ran Yu did not conceal his thoughts. Many of the disciples in Black Wind Valley heard it.</p>
<p>Letting Yi Yun impede the black dragon, while Ran Yu captured the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake?</p>
<p>Ran Yu was being nefarious! Although Yi Yun could find his footing on the sixth level, his Aspect Totems were slightly injured. Getting Yi Yun to impede the black dragon was life-threatening!</p>
<p>And reading between the lines, Ran Yu was not planning on dividing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake with Yi Yun. This was reasonable. There was no way to split a treasure of that level. It was basically something that could only be earned by one person.</p>
<p>"Ample remuneration?" Yi Yun laughed. "Senior Brother Ran, you seem to be mistaken. I'm not upset with you, it's you who has been targeting me all this time."</p>
<p>"I can't be bothered with all these lame matters, but now… Your plan sure is delightful. Letting me do things like restraining the black dragon while you are responsible for capturing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. I presume that the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake will be yours when the time comes, as for the remuneration you will give me, what would it be? Let me guess… Are they World Stones?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's words were still filled with sarcasm, making Ran Yu's expression turn somewhat ugly. "Yi Yun, the remuneration that I will give will certainly be to your satisfaction. My Xushui Ran clan is a large establishment and it has heritage that you can't even imagine. Will it even skim on your remuneration? The opportunities given to you by the Xushui Ran clan will allow your cultivation level to make a huge leap!"</p>
<p>"Furthermore! If you were to help me this time, it is equivalent to helping the Xushui Ran clan. I, Ran Yu, will also owe you one. In the future, as long as you encounter any trouble in the Luo clan, the Xushui Ran clan will also help you. There's no need for me to elaborate further on being able to cling onto a large faction, right?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu used his family background as bait. The Xushui Ran clan was one of the few large family clans in the Luo clan!</p>
<p>With Ran Yu saying this, many people looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>In cultivation, warriors needed to pay attention to networking. Being alone resulted in receiving very few resources. It was easy to suffer a lot while training outside, and they might even end up dying. A smart person would seize the opportunity to cling to a large clan!</p>
<p>For a person like Lie Ya, he hankered for the chance to cling onto the Xushui Ran clan, but Ran Yu had never given him such a chance!</p>
<p>Lie Ya was a mixed Fey, a hybrid of Heaven and Earth Fey. Although his family clan's power was pretty good, it was far weaker than the Xushui Ran clan. If not, Lie Ya would not have felt the pinch for the over one hundred World Stones that he owed to the point of vomiting blood.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yi Yun had such an opportunity, even Lie Ya began to turn envious for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun suddenly laughed. The Xushui Ran clan was a large family clan, but unfortunately, he did not think too highly of it. Yi Yun's sights were very high. How could the Xushui Ran clan have the qualifications for him to cling on to?</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not say those words out. He knew very well that with his present cultivation level, he was just a trivial ant in front of the Xushui Ran clan. If he said those words out loud, he would only win the derision of others.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun did not say it out, Ran Yu could figure out a bit of Yi Yun's thoughts from his expression.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, do you think you will truly skyrocket at the Luo Divine Hall trials? You are too naive. With your performance at the Ancient Fey Edifice, it is just satisfactory in the eyes of the Luo clan royalty. But that is antecedent on you having a powerful bloodline. You just managed to find your footing on the sixth level of Black Wind Valley, so to the Luo clan royalty, who values Ancient Fey bloodlines, they would not even give you a second look. Do you think that you would be valued by the royal family? You are still far from that!"</p>
<p>"Now, with my Xushui clan soliciting you, you even looked down on my Xushui Ran clan!? Don't you have an exaggerated opinion of your own abilities!?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu was furious. However, what he said sounded reasonable to most people. The Xushui Ran clan was a large family clan. There were a few similar family clans in the Luo clan. However, a young genius like Yi Yun was worthless. The Luo clan had 196 states. It had plenty of geniuses, and batch after batch were produced every century. These geniuses might not even fully mature before their death!</p>
<p>Yi Yun laughed. "The Xushui Ran clan is big, but who do you think you are in the Xushui Ran clan? You are just a scion in the family clan at best. You can't even enter the seventh level of Black Wind Valley, so I guess you don't amount to much in your family clan. If not, you would have already been in the royal capital."</p>
<p>Yi Yun's words had hit Ran Yu's soft spot!</p>
<p>Ran Yu went livid immediately. There was a hint of coldness in his gaze as he said, "Human punk, I lowered my status today to speak to you nicely, but you have scorned me time and time again. You have only managed to use tricks of your energy cultivation and Aspect Totem to stand here on the sixth level. Without your Aspect Totem, you would find it hard to even stand on the second level! You aren't worthy to mock me!"</p>
<p>"I'm asking you one last time. Do you choose to cooperate with me!?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu stared at Yi Yun as he minced his words. No one suspected that Ran Yu's last sentence were not containing a threat.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was from the Xushui Ran clan after all. If he wanted to do harm to Yi Yun, with Yi Yun's low cultivation level, he was bound to suffer!</p>
<p>Between the carrot and the stick, the Luo clan disciples present believed that if they were placed in Yi Yun's shoes, they would likely have already agreed.</p>
<p>They wanted to see how Yi Yun would reply. However, what Yi Yun said next nearly made them bite off their tongues.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Ran Yu and said with a sneer, "Even if I need to cooperate with others in the future, I will not cooperate with a loser. With you coming along, other than being an additional burden, I guess you won't be able to play much of a role."</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>All the Luo clan disciples disciples present were immediately dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Was Yi Yun mad? He actually called Ran Yu a loser? To scold him in public like that, wasn't he completely offending Ran Yu!?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun did not have the qualifications to make such a comment! Didn't he just manage to stand on the sixth level?</p>
<p>Before they could even react, something that nearly made them pop their eyeballs happened. They watched helplessly as Yi Yun leaped down from the sixth level to the seventh level of Black Wind Valley!</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>Everyone was astounded. Yi Yun actually jumped onto the seventh level?</p>
<p>Chapter 846: The Growl From Ancient Times</p>
<p>Back at the sixth level, Yi Yun's Aspect Totems were slightly injured and he had yet to establish a firm footing!</p>
<p>People believed that even if Yi Yun would cooperate with Ran Yu, he would take at least a week or so in the sixth level to find his footing by familiarizing himself fully with the black mist. After his body's lifeblood was strengthened, then he would dare enter the seventh level. But for him to enter just like that, was he mad!?</p>
<p>Ran Yu had nearly gone berserk because of Yi Yun's words, but with Yi Yun immediately leaping downwards, he was also left stunned.</p>
<p>He subconsciously took a few steps to chase after him, but he witnessed Yi Yun's figure submerging into the black mist and landing on the seventh level's bedrock.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Tian was also on the seventh level. He looked incredulously at Yi Yun's arrival.</p>
<p>Why did this punk come down?</p>
<p>In front of Luo Tian, the black dragon had rapidly recovered. It was mostly done with its recovery, and it was planning on charging at Luo Tian and devouring the Fey with a Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline. However, it never expected that a human would suddenly come down.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this human was much weaker than the Fey with the Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline.</p>
<p>The black specter shadows in Black Wind Valley would always start off with the weaker ones. Thus, the black dragon roared and charged at Yi Yun!</p>
<p>It seemed bent on swallowing Yi Yun first to recover itself to its peak state before it would slowly deal with Luo Tian.</p>
<p>This scene made all the cultivators in Black Wind Valley perk up. The black specter flood dragon had finally reached Yi Yun and they wanted to see how Yi Yun was going to block it!</p>
<p>Every Luo clan disciples stared with widened eyes, afraid of missing the next scene. They knew that Yi Yun's physical strength was lacking, but they were also skeptical that Yi Yun would send himself to his death.</p>
<p>As the black dragon pounced on him, the Demon gases rolled as an overwhelming pressure could be felt!</p>
<p>"Xiao!"</p>
<p>"Roar——"</p>
<p>From behind Yi Yun, the three-legged Golden Crow and the Nine Neonate Aspect Totems charged out together!</p>
<p>The three-legged Golden Crow spread its wings. Its wingspan was dozens of meters wide and it wrapped around Yi Yun like a golden fire wall! The Golden Crow's body was like an intense inferno as rolling waves of blood surged over!</p>
<p>As for the black specter flood dragon, it was even fiercer. It soared into the air and lashed its tail out like a whip, striking the three-legged Golden Crow's body!</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>An explosion that sounded like the rupturing of mountains and rivers could be heard. The three-legged Golden Crow shrieked as its body was sent flying by the black specter flood dragon's tail!</p>
<p>The black specter flood dragon was indeed terrifying. The three-legged Golden Crow was no match for it!</p>
<p>However, after the three-legged Golden Crow was struck by the dragon's tail, it had also clawed at the dragon's tail. The dragon tail, which was a manifestation of black gas, was injured with three scratches from the Golden Crow. It even began to bleed black blood.</p>
<p>The flood dragon that was a manifestation of the black gas could actually bleed?</p>
<p>At this moment, no one bothered considering this. They saw that after the black dragon repelled the Golden Crow, it charged at the Nine Neonate!</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate howled as it leaped up and it engaged with the black specter flood dragon in an intense battle mid-air!</p>
<p>Instantly, black winds howled as it radiated in all directions!</p>
<p>The nine snake heads were fighting against a single flood dragon. However, the Nine Neonate was completely suppressed by the flood dragon!</p>
<p>The flood dragon's defenses were terrifying. The nine heads of the Nine Neonate bit on it, but they could not break its defenses!</p>
<p>Ka Ka Ka!</p>
<p>The flood dragon coiled its body around the Nine Neonate. Its immense body wrangled around the Nine Neonate's nine heads. It was trying to strangle the Nine Neonate to death!</p>
<p>No one doubted the flood dragon's power from the terror it revealed.</p>
<p>"Pa! Pa! Pa!"</p>
<p>A series of explosions could be heard from the Nine Neonate totem's body. Its projection started to flicker and dim, as though the Nine Neonate was truly about to be strangled to death by the black flood dragon.</p>
<p>Once the Nine Neonate was utterly defeated by the black flood dragon, its master, Yi Yun, would also be inflicted with serious injuries. It would take him a long period of time to reconstruct the Nine Neonate totem. And this was on the premise that Yi Yun was able to safely escape from the clutches of the black flood dragon. However, how could the black flood dragon give Yi Yun such a chance?</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Ran Yu roared with laughter.</p>
<p>"What a retard. I was wondering how powerful you are. To dare to shamelessly call me a loser. Now, you are just courting death by jumping onto the seventh level! The Nine Neonate is destroyed and the three-legged Golden Crow is seriously injured. By losing the Nine Neonate and the Golden Crow totems, you are like a tiger that has lost its fangs. How can that weak body of yours withstand the black flood dragon!? If you die in Black Wind Valley, your corpse will be devoured and you will be completely annihilated. Haha!"</p>
<p>Previously, Ran Yu had been mocked by Yi Yun without appreciating the favor he had shown him and he was already fuming like a volcano. Now, seeing that Yi Yun was about to be devoured by the black dragon, he could no longer maintain his usually mild-mannered appearance and he said those nasty words.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the opinion of the Luo clan disciples, Yi Yun had relied on his Aspect Totem to land in the seventh level. Once he lost his Aspect Totems, Yi Yun's physical strength was something completely trivial!</p>
<p>Even Luo Tian and Gu Luo's bodies would be quickly devoured by the monsters on the seventh level, what more Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Roar! Roar!"</p>
<p>The Nine Neonate issued an angry roar. The black flood dragon opened its jaws and it was about to snap through the Nine Neonate's neck. It would then devour the Nine Neonate before devouring Yi Yun. That was what would all happen in an instant.</p>
<p>But at that instant, an indescribable deep growl suddenly came from inside Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>This sound was very soft to begin with, but it gradually became louder.</p>
<p>It was rugged and powerful, as though it came from the ancient times after traversing the long rivers of time.</p>
<p>The growl was mysterious and deep. It easily pierced through the barriers in Black Wind Valley and echoed everywhere, reaching everyone's ears.</p>
<p>This sound seemed to have a strange magical effect. It was not as ear-splitting as Luo Tian's ancient Gigantic Demon Ape's roar, but it seemed to resound in everyone's hearts. It resonated with their bloodlines, which was an alarming feeling!</p>
<p>A large number of Luo clan disciples were puzzled, but someone suddenly thought of something as his expression changed drastically!</p>
<p>At this moment, a plume of black smoke emerged from behind Yi Yun. The black smoke was sparse and faint, but what was unbelievable was that after the black smoke floated out, it began to subtly distort space!</p>
<p>This was the spatial dimension of the 12 Empyrean Heavens, so how could it be distorted by a plume of black smoke?</p>
<p>Besides, this black smoke was generating a strong resonance with the Luo clan disciples' blood! Some of them even found themselves having difficulty breathing. And the weaker their bloodlines were, the resonance and discomfort would become more intense. Some of the weaker ones even had the feeling of kneeling on the ground and prostrating themselves to Yi Yun, or to put it more accurately, the black smoke.</p>
<p>Even Cang Mang, who was seating mid air, stood up at this moment. His eyes that were like a deep pool of water flickered. He quietly looked at the plume of black smoke behind Yi Yun, unable to comprehend how such an inconceivable matter could happen.</p>
<p>He had determined that despite the plume of black smoke looking very thin, it was actually very heavy. The plume of black smoke was enough to crush mountains!</p>
<p>"It's indeed that feeling!" Suddenly, someone shouted amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ancient Fey, it's the appearance of an ancient mighty Fey! It's not those Heaven Fey with thin bloodlines who summon fake Ancient Fey phantom images through their own bloodlines. It is the true apparition of the mighty Fey from ancient times. Even if it has 1% of the ancient mighty Fey's power, it is still a true Ancient Fey!"</p>
<p>This sudden voice immediately gave many people a shock.</p>
<p>What? Ancient Fey!?</p>
<p>What is this joke!?</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at the Luo clan disciple that spoke.</p>
<p>That person was from the Phoenix Firmiana State. He was originally from an ancient Heaven Fey family clan. At his family ceremonies where they paid their respects to the family clan's ancestors, there would be rare occasions when their ancestor would take up form during the ceremony. And at that moment, the feeling that the ancestor gave was identical to the black smoke behind Yi Yun!</p>
<p>And at this moment, there was no need to say anything else, as they could see the scene with their own eyes.</p>
<p>This scene made all the Luo clan disciples present gape their mouths in shock, as they were rendered speechless.</p>
<p>They saw the faint black smoke that emerged behind Yi Yun slowly take the form of a fuzzy flood dragon head!</p>
<p>Be it the Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline phantom image that Luo Tian conjured, the Ranyi Fish bloodline phantom that image Ran Yu conjured, or even the two Aspect Totems that Yi Yun summoned himself, this phantom image condensed from black smoke was just too unrealistic.</p>
<p>All the phantom images from before were extremely realistic, as though a real Ancient Fey had appeared? But this phantom image was so fuzzy that it was difficult to perceive.</p>
<p>But they still managed to make it out.</p>
<p>This black-misted phantom image had taken the form of an ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon!</p>
<p>Ancient Fey? A true Ancient Fey!?</p>
<p>No other race knew better than the Fey race about the meaning behind these two words.</p>
<p>Although the Luo clan disciples present would always have the words Ancient Fey bloodline hang from the corner of their mouths all the time, and would frequently summon their Ancient Fey bloodline to offer sacrifices to their Ancient Fey ancestors in rituals, not a single one of them had ever seen Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>Heaven Fey family clans had been passed down for eons. Whatever bloodline they had was thinned out, which was also the reason for why it was difficult for the Heaven Fey to awaken their ancient bloodline.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey were living beings born at the birth of the Universe billions of years ago. Their bodies were existences that were naturally condensed by Heavenly Dao laws.</p>
<p>Although there were a myriad of Ancient Fey, every kind was extremely limited in number! Some extremely special Ancient Fey species might only have one Fey in the entire Universe. Some Ancient Fey species were greater in number, but they were still a handful. Usually, only the death of one would give birth to a new one!</p>
<p>Up to this day, due to a variety of reasons, the numbers of Ancient Fey were dwindling in number. This accentuated the rarity of Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>Under this situation, a true Ancient Fey phantom image emerged behind Yi Yun. Even though the phantom image was extremely fuzzy and thin, the shock it gave everyone was a thousand times more intense than Luo Tian's conjuring of the Ancient Gigantic Demon Ape!</p>
<p>"Ancient Fey… a true Ancient Fey? He only absorbed the Ancient Fey bone for four days, how can he conjure the Ancient Fey phantom image?"</p>
<p>On the sixth level of Black Wind Valley, Ran Yu was feeling extremely agitated.</p>
<p>He knew very well that the Ancient Fey bone that Yi Yun had previously consumed was the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's bone.</p>
<p>But just absorbing an Ancient Fey bone allowed him to conjure an Ancient Fey phantom image?</p>
<p>Although Ancient Fey bones were extremely valuable, there were geniuses in the entire Luo clan that would receive Ancient Fey bones as rewards. After all, an Ancient Fey was large in size. Ancient Fey with bodies thousands of miles long were not uncommon! Although Ancient Fey were rare, an Ancient Fey would leave behind a large number of bones after its death!</p>
<p>However, it was unheard of that any of these Luo clan geniuses who absorbed the Ancient Fey bone were able to conjure an Ancient Fey phantom image from absorbing a piece of Ancient Fey bone once!</p>
<p>Ran Yu found it unbelievable. Similarly, Luo Tian could not accept it either. At this moment, he was still maintaining his ancient Gigantic Demon Ape form, but when he saw the Ancient Fey phantom image that Yi Yun had conjured, he felt that his own bloodline was resonating with it, as though it would be drawn out by the Ancient Fey phantom image. Clearly, the Gigantic Demon Ape bloodline that he was proud of was far inferior to that faint black smoke behind Yi Yun!</p>
<p>This was too great a blow to them. Amongst the Luo clan disciples present, there were quite a few who were proud of their family history, flaunting their Ancient Fey ancestors' bloodline. They had despised Yi Yun because of his identity as a human, but the resulting outcome was that the human, Yi Yun, had conjured what they viewed as their ancestor, the Ancient Fey, that they worshiped at ritual ceremonies. And they as so-called progeny of the Ancient Fey had been abandoned! How could anyone accept that!?</p>
<p>However, at this moment on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley, the black specter shadow's reaction made all the Luo clan disciples present have an ugly expression on their faces.</p>
<p>They saw that the black specter flood dragon looked afraid!</p>
<p>It had already dislodged itself from the Nine Neonate, and it faced the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon image like it was facing a nemesis.</p>
<p>For an existence like the black specter, it was condensed spontaneously by the black mist over eons. Its perception of Ancient Fey was a natural instinct, so it was able to more accurately sense one than the Luo clan disciples present!</p>
<p>With the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon image appearing, it felt a deep sense of apprehension!</p>
<p>Although it was also a flood dragon, and the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was also a flood dragon, they were two lifeforms that were on two separate levels on life's natural order.</p>
<p>The black specter shadow only took the form of a flood dragon. It could even take the form of Extreme Yang Illumination, much less a flood dragon, but it would be useless!</p>
<p>This was the difference between a true flood dragon and a fake flood dragon.</p>
<p>At this moment, the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon roared and it charged at the black specter!</p>
<p>The moment that this ancient Fey beast, that had not stirred for billions of years, had awoken, it was the arrival of a raging storm!</p>
<p>Hu! Hu! Hu!</p>
<p>A strong wind blew from every direction as the sky changed color!</p>
<p>In the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's mouth, a giant vortex appeared. All the black gases and black mist were swept into the vortex!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples, who were on the fourth and fifth level of Black Wind Valley, could feel the dreadful suction force of this vortex.</p>
<p>Their expressions changed as they activated the power of their bloodline to withstand it.</p>
<p>This is...</p>
<p>Heaven devouring!?</p>
<p>The two words 'Heaven Devouring' was a description of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's laws that it had sublimed. Heaven Devouring was a terrifying devouring law!</p>
<p>Such a terrifying suction force swept everywhere, as though a black hole had appeared out of nowhere in the the seventh level of Black Wind Valley. Large amounts of black gas were devoured by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, but its phantom image form remained the same. It did not seem to become any more corporeal.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun, who had conjured the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, had obtained a huge benefit!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had little lifeblood power left in his body. Just conjuring the Ancient Fey phantom image alone had drawn out all of the lifeblood power stored in his body from before!</p>
<p>This lifeblood power was gathered using the Nine Neonate and three-legged Golden Crow previously. If not, it was impossible for him to handle the conjuring of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon phantom image!</p>
<p>But now, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was devouring the black mist like a maniac, which was greatly nourishing for Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt that his emptied out lifeblood was increasing rapidly in a short period of time, and soon, it was filled to the brim. Next, the lifeblood was forcefully merged into his flesh and blood, as his body began to reforge itself!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's bodily strength was indeed lacking.</p>
<p>Although he had used the Purple Crystal to absorb the Ancient Fey bone, allowing his body to be injected with the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's bloodline, which allowed him to conjure the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon phantom image, Yi Yun's actual physique was just too weak.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun's body could become more powerful, there would be innumerable benefits that would follow!</p>
<p>At this moment, the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon had roared once and started flying at the black specter shadow!</p>
<p>Although the black specter shadow feared the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, it could not sit idle when facing a life and death crisis. It roared and charged at the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon!</p>
<p>It wanted to put up a desperate fight!</p>
<p>However, the differences were just too great. It was a difference in life's natural order, resulting in the black specter shadow being unable to use more than 20% of its power!</p>
<p>"Chi La!"</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bit down and snapped off a large chunk of flesh and blood from the black specter shadow. Immediately following that, its tail whipped at the black specter, causing wind and clouds to stir, as the black specter's began to violently shake.</p>
<p>As for that piece of flesh and blood, it was directly swallowed into the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's stomach, and digested to become a part of its lifeblood's power.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Luo clan disciples felt a chill rise up from the soles of their feet. The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon had managed to directly devour a portion of the black specter!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun… Yi Yun went down Black Wind Valley, but until the very end, he has yet to use the power of his body. From the beginning, he used his Aspect Totem, and now, he's using… the power of the Ancient Fey's bloodline… " A Heaven Fey disciple from the Phoenix Firmiana State said. As he spoke, his Adam's apple was twitching.</p>
<p>As they were sure that Yi Yun's physical strength was lacking, many of them were waiting for Yi Yun to suffer when his Aspect Totems could no longer sustain the barrage of attacks. After all, Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was basically useless in Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>But now, despite his Aspect Totem being unable to sustain the attacks any longer, Yi Yun still did not use his body. He had summoned a more terrifying Ancient Fey bloodline power to replace the Aspect Totems!</p>
<p>The Black Wind Valley was a test of the Fey race's bloodline. The Fey race bloodline was always something that the Fey race was proud of. But what other bloodline could be more noble and valuable than a true Ancient Fey's bloodline?</p>
<p>Compared to Yi Yun's Ancient Fey bloodline, their tiny bit of Fey bloodline became jokes.</p>
<p>Chapter 847: Devouring the Black Specter Flood Dragon</p>
<p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon and the black specter shadow snapped their jaws at each other. The battle between the two flood dragons caused turmoil on the seventh level, and everywhere their bodies passed, rocks were shattered, with the black mist quickly filling the void left behind!</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was extremely terrifying. It had a smoke-like body, but it contained tremendous amounts of power. Its every strike could invoke the powers of the Heaven and Earth, as though the source of Heaven and Earth energy was wherever the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was!</p>
<p>"Clang!"</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bit at the black flood dragon, issuing the sound of metal being hit. The black flood dragon grimaced in pain, as one of its claws was ripped off!</p>
<p>Dragon scales and dragon blood was splattered everywhere. The black flood dragon roared fiercely, but it no longer had the strength to battle the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. Hence, ignoring its injuries, it tried escaping deeper into Black Wind Valley!</p>
<p>"Don't you leave!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyes flickered. Although the black flood dragon was a fake flood dragon, it was the embodiment of a large amount of black-misted energy essence on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley. Be it for the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon or himself, it was a great supplement.</p>
<p>"Stay behind!" With a thought from Yi Yun...</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's tail swept down like a heavenly pillar that collapsed. It struck the black flood dragon's back heavily.</p>
<p>"Ka-cha!"</p>
<p>The sound of joints breaking resounded like thunder. The black flood dragon's back had been fractured by the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's tail strike!</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon looked like smoke, but it was able to crush mountains, that was the proof of its heaviness. With it striking down like that, it was like a divine mountain crushing down on the black flood dragon's back. There was no way for the black dragon to withstand it!</p>
<p>Suck!</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon opened its jaws and a black vortex appeared in its mouth once again. This black vortex distorted space, and the surrounding black mist was all sucked towards it!</p>
<p>Heaven devouring laws!</p>
<p>The legendary true ancient fey was able to devour an entire world. Hence it's name, Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon!</p>
<p>No one knew if the legends were true. But now, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon phantom image that Yi Yun conjured was more than enough to devour the black flood dragon.</p>
<p>The black flood dragon struggled with all its strength, but it was completely meaningless. It was eventually devoured by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon.</p>
<p>Roar—</p>
<p>After devouring the black flood dragon, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon let out a satisfied growl.</p>
<p>The black flood dragon was completely digested into essence energy to replenish itself. As a result, its fuzzy body also became slightly more corporeal.</p>
<p>And far behind the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, Yi Yun suddenly felt his blood vessels go into turmoil. His body felt like it was a drum being hit, as it issued explosives sounds!</p>
<p>The black flood dragon's essence energy had mostly been absorbed by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, but there were still some portions that were injected into Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>The violent force surged into Yi Yun's meridians and it moved around crazily.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's meridians had been widened several times after he absorbed the Ancient Fey bone. Furthermore, their resilience was far stronger than before. If not, just the surging of the energy through his meridians would be something that Yi Yun's meridians could not withstand. He would have needed to use the Purple Crystal to suppress the energy.</p>
<p>How could the pleasure derived from the energy's forceful impacts and cleansing of his body be compared to absorbing the energy from the Purple Crystal stores?</p>
<p>"It feels great!" Yi Yun shouted out loud as he clenched his fists.</p>
<p>He felt as though all his energy was filled with inexhaustible energy. The energy was like a roaring tsunami, that swept across wave after wave in an incessant manner!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun… he devoured the black flood dragon on the seventh level!"</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's aura change and the lifeblood stirring in his body, all the Luo clan disciples present could only stare helplessly.</p>
<p>They had seen how powerful the black flood dragon was, but now, it had been devoured. Although it was mainly devoured by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, as its master, Yi Yun benefited greatly from it.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State disciples were filled with jealousy and envy. At the same Black Wind Valley trial, they could only drink a figurative soup, while Yi Yun had managed to eat all the figurative meat!</p>
<p>After devouring the black flood dragon, Yi Yun began to meditate on the seventh level and he began to refine the black flood dragon's power!</p>
<p>And some of the energy had been distributed to his two Aspect Totems — the Nine Neonate and three-legged Golden Crow, allowing them to begin to recover from their injuries.</p>
<p>They were not seriously injured, so it was very easy for them to recover.</p>
<p>With that, Yi Yun began to cultivate on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>This was cultivation on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley. People had previously believed that Yi Yun's body was weak, so it would be pretty good if he could find his footing on the fifth level and be able to probe the sixth level for short periods of time. But now, Yi Yun had found his footing on the seventh level, and he was leisurely cultivating.</p>
<p>And most ironical of all was that they had guessed correctly. Yi Yun's body was indeed not powerful enough, but his bloodline was heaven-defying. So what if his body wasn't strong enough? Yi Yun did not even need to use his body to withstand the black specter shadow. Just his bloodline alone was enough!</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Tian was still opposite Yi Yun. He felt like he was a stake erected on the seventh level and he was extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>He seemed to be an indomitable force and the center of attention, but now, he did not even know what he should do.</p>
<p>"How was Yi Yun able to absorb the Ancient Fey bone to such a degree?"</p>
<p>Luo Tian was left in wonder. Yi Yun, a human, was even better than the geniuses at the Luo clan's royal capital after absorbing an Ancient Fey bone.</p>
<p>At Black Wind Valley, they depended on stimulating their Heaven Fey bloodline to withstand the black mist, while Yi Yun had stimulated an Ancient Fey bloodline. How could they even compete with that? This was already on two disparate levels!</p>
<p>Luo Tian found it excruciating to stay on in the seventh level, so he dejectedly returned to the sixth level.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the seventh level was beginning to produce more black specter lifeforms.</p>
<p>These black specter surged from all directions to the seventh level to occupy it.</p>
<p>Previously, the black specter flood dragon had occupied the entire seventh level. And probably because it was too powerful, it had demarcated its own territory.</p>
<p>And now, with an increase in the number of black specter shadows, it became chaotic. However, these black specters did not dare to approach Yi Yun. They had previously seen how the black flood dragon, which was much more powerful than them, had been devoured by Yi Yun and the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. They wouldn't be silly enough to serve themselves up as food!</p>
<p>In time, Yi Yun began to casually sit down on the seventh level, with no black specter shadow daring to mess with him.</p>
<p>As time passed, the black flood dragon's essence in Yi Yun's body was mostly digested. And at this moment —</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>A bright red beam flashed in the thick depths of the black mist. It was like an agile fish that was swimming and twirling quickly in the black mist!</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes as he looked at the red beam hidden in the black mist.</p>
<p>Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>Compared to the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, the black flood dragon was worth nothing!</p>
<p>If he could capture the intermediary spirit blood snake, his body would improve once again! Furthermore, his energy cultivation was directly tied to his body. Yi Yun's overall strength would undoubtedly make a quantum leap!</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a deep breath and he slowly stood up.</p>
<p>Chapter 848: Capturing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake</p>
<p>"It's the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. It has appeared again!'</p>
<p>With Yi Yun causing quite an impressive stir, the Luo clan disciples present were paying a great deal of attention to what was happening on the seventh level. Some of them even ignored their cultivation.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake that suddenly appeared did not escape their eyes. Furthermore, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake had a special aura, so it was difficult not to notice it.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was the most important opportunity of the Black Wind Valley trial. Who didn't want it? And now, they saw Yi Yun stand up. He was about to make his move on the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun is trying to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Lord Cang Mang had intended to pose a difficult problem for Luo Tian, Gu Luo and Ran Yu, but now, Yi Yun alone might be able to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake."</p>
<p>"I think it's almost in the bag. The most difficult obstacle was the black specter flood dragon and it has already been torn apart and consumed by Yi Yun and the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. Even the flood dragon was eaten, so it shouldn't be difficult to eat a tiny snake, right!? I wonder what Ran Yu and company are thinking. It seems like it has nothing to do with them anymore… "</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present discussed as some of them could not help but cast their gazes at Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Naturally, Ran Yu also heard their conversations. His face went blue. The saying of accompanying the Crown Prince in studies — an outsider in a competition with no possible hope of winning — was relevant to Ran Yu back in the Fire Cloud State. Back then, he was the 'Crown Prince', with people accompanying him in his studies. But when did it become his turn to accompany others in studies, making him have no possible hope of winning?</p>
<p>The Mt. Azure Billow training was a torment for Ran Yu.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun moved. Against the layers of black mist, and the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake within it, a rugged and powerful dragon's roar came from Yi Yun's chest.</p>
<p>"Ang!"</p>
<p>A single-horned flood dragon rushed out from behind Yi Yun and it pounced straight at the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Yi Yun had conjured the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon phantom image once again!</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was an ancient mighty Fey. Its appearance and surging Ancient Fey aura were detected by the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was a spirit of the seventh level of the Black Wind Valley. It sensed a threat, and with a sharp sound, it transformed into a stream of light, drilling deep into the black mist!</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was extremely fast. Although the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's bloodline was powerful, in terms of speed, it was inferior to the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. This was also mainly the reason why the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was so hard to deal with. It was located on the seventh level of Black Wind Valley, where danger lurked everywhere. With its astounding speed, trying to capture it was very, very difficult!</p>
<p>Noticing that the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was about to disappear into the deep depths of the black mist, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon opened its mouth —</p>
<p>Heaven devouring!</p>
<p>"Wu Wu Wu… "</p>
<p>A large black vortex appeared in its mouth as the surrounding black mist was sucked towards it!</p>
<p>90% of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's engulfing law was afflicted on the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Instantly, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's speed was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>"Hiss&ndash; "</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake issued a sharp shrill. It was so sharp that it was like an arrow had shot right into one's eardrums. Even the cultivators on the fourth and fifth levels of Black Wind Valley could not help but cover their ears when they heard it.</p>
<p>However, regardless of how much the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake hissed, it was unable to free itself from the suction of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon!</p>
<p>The Ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was known to be able to devour an entire world. Its engulfing law was top amongst the Ancient Fey. Furthermore, with the difference in life's natural order, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake could not withstand it any longer!</p>
<p>Not only could the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake not fly deep into the black mist, it was bound by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's engulfing powers. It was being pulled bit by bit to the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's mouth!</p>
<p>When they saw this, the people were secretly horrified. They knew that the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was not easy to deal with. It had once penetrated Gu Luo's palm, and with its unparalleled speed, even without the black specter flood dragon on the seventh level, it was still not easy to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake.</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon lived up to its name. It was a true ancient mighty fey. Just its phantom image alone was already terrifying!</p>
<p>"Hiss&ndash; "</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake hissed crazily as its body turned redder and redder, as though channels of blood began to emanate across the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's body.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's mind was connected to the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. He suddenly sensed that the small Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was undergoing some kind of change. Its body was slowly accumulating energy, and its red body seemed to emanate a special smell.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a few black specter shadows seemed to be attracted by this smell and they began to approach the seventh level from the eighth level of Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Yi Yun knitted his brows. The black specter shadows that came from the eighth to the seventh floor were most likely the weaker ones from the eighth level. In terms of strength, they were likely no match for the black specter flood dragon that had dominated the seventh level alone. If this was any other time, they would have been fodder for the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon.</p>
<p>However, at this point, with changes in variable, it made Yi Yun's heart sink.</p>
<p>He had to finish it as soon as possible!</p>
<p>"Dragon Tail!" Yi Yun bellowed.</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon let out a low growl as its body charged out suddenly, and its gigantic dragon tail swept downwards!</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>Like the collapse of a mountain, the extremely heavy dragon tail slammed into the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's body. The snake obviously could not withstand such a strike. Its body quivered as some of its scales broke apart with blood spurting out of the wounds.</p>
<p>As for the black specter shadows that came from the eighth level, they were stunned by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's attack. They did not dare to attack momentarily.</p>
<p>The ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was just too powerful. It was a true Ancient Fey after all. Its aura gave pressure from the difference in life's natural order to the black specters that were condensed from Black Wind Valley's lifeblood.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's final struggle had been ruthlessly crushed by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. If this went on, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was definitely Yi Yun's!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples on the fourth and fifth levels were extremely jealous seeing this scene. As for Ran Yu, who was on the sixth level, he looked livid as a beam flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Ran Yu knew very well that if this continued, all the benefits in Black Wind Valley would be Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>Riches were obtained from taking risk. On the seventh level of Black Wind Valley, it appeared as though the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon had brought the situation under control, but in fact, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was still struggling incessantly. There were several black specter shadows from the eighth level watching on with covetous looks. A tip of the scales would decide the true winner!</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, a wicked look flashed in Ran Yu's eyes. He leaped down from the sixth level to the seventh level.</p>
<p>"Oh? Ran Yu?"</p>
<p>People were surprised seeing the turn in events. Black Wind Valley's battle was a competition of bloodline. Ran Yu's Ranyi Fish bloodline was much weaker than the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. There was no way for him to intervene in the battle on the seventh level. Ran Yu was no match for even the weakest black specter shadows from the eighth level.</p>
<p>"What's Ran Yu going down for? He can't beat those black specters, and he can't attack Yi Yun or he would violate the rules of the trial."</p>
<p>Everyone stared with widened eyes, afraid of missing this scene. Ran Yu's sudden appearance opened up a new variable in what was a decided situation.</p>
<p>Chapter 849: Shimmering Dragon Scales</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously noticed Ran Yu's sudden barge onto the seventh level. At this moment, there was a storm brewing on the seventh level, and it was the critical moment in Yi Yun's capturing of the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Yet, Ran Yu had suddenly appeared, and the moment he landed, he charged straight at the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was caught by surprise. Was Ran Yu charging at the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake at this moment, an attempt to snatch the food from a tiger's jaws?</p>
<p>In Black Wind Valley, Yuan Qi was useless against black specters. It was a contest between bloodline and physique. In terms of Yuan Qi, Ran Yu had his Heaven Ascension realm cultivation level, but when it came to bloodline, he was no match for the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon at all.</p>
<p>In nearly a blink of an eye, Ran Yu had already rushed to the vicinity of the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. At this moment, people realized that his goal was not the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, but the few black specter shadows that came from the eighth level to seventh level!</p>
<p>These black specter shadows were lusting for blood. They were summoned by the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake to deal with the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon.</p>
<p>However, they were also astounded by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon and they did not dare to act rashly. Now, with Ran Yu charging at them, they opened up their jaws and bit at Ran Yu!</p>
<p>They shall swallow Ran Yu first!</p>
<p>Hu! Hu! Hu!</p>
<p>The black specter shadows charged forward together. Just as he was about to be surrounded by the black specters, Ran Yu's face revealed a crazed look.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Ran Yu roared as the Ranyi Fish bloodline appeared behind him. The power of his lifeblood surged and it increased rapidly!</p>
<p>"That Ran Yu!"</p>
<p>Everyone was taken aback when they saw this scene. Although the black specter shadows were inferior to the black specter flood dragon that dominated the seventh level, Ran Yu was still no match for them!</p>
<p>Just as people though Ran Yu was trying to make a desperate struggle to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, Ran Yu suddenly retreated and he turned around to escape!</p>
<p>A few black specter shadows chased Ran Yu without letting up!</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was not something that they could deal with, but the Ranyi fish bloodline conjured by Ran Yu was something that they coveted. If they could devour the Ranyi Fish bloodline, they would also enhance their strength.</p>
<p>Ran Yu flew very quickly. With the black specter flood dragon slain by Yi Yun, the resistance on the seventh level had been greatly reduced. After Ran Yu ran a couple hundred feet, he suddenly turned and rushed towards Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Oh!?</p>
<p>Everyone came to a sudden realization as they understood Ran Yu's plans.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was trying to divert the danger!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was powerful, but his power actually came from the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline. As for Yi Yun's body? It was too weak!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had to depend on his Aspect Totems to even withstand the fourth and fifth level, much less the seventh level.</p>
<p>Without the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline, Yi Yun was nothing!</p>
<p>Previously, due to the threat of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline, the black specter shadows did not dare approach Yi Yun, and now, the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was in a battle with the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, which meant Yi Yun was isolated!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body itself was his greatest weakness!</p>
<p>"That Ran Yu is too despicable!" A Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said. Ran Yu did not have plans on profiteering from taking advantage of the situation, he wanted to add insult to injury!</p>
<p>It was too difficult for him to profiteer from taking advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>However, if he was there to cause damage, things would be much easier. As long as he caused Yi Yun severe injuries or even cause his death, the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon that Yi Yun controlled would lose its mobility and it would not put up the slightest threat!</p>
<p>Then, wouldn't Black Wind Valley be monopolized by Ran Yu and company? They could slowly capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake!</p>
<p>"What are you saying!? What do you mean despicable? That is the smartest strategy. A fundamental solution leveraging on the strength of others! Senior Brother Ran's move is directly striking at Yi Yun's weakness. Furthermore, Senior Brother Ran will not be directly attacking Yi Yun, so the rules of the trial aren't violated. It's the true character of a fierce and ambitious person! Yi Yun is doomed, hahaha!" Lie Ya's maniac laughter resounded.</p>
<p>Having seen Yi Yun ride the waves of success all this while, how could he not gloat when he finally saw Yi Yun getting into trouble?</p>
<p>In a split second, Ran Yu had already arrived in front of Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Yi Yun could clearly see the hideous grin on Ran Yu's lips.</p>
<p>Just as Ran Yu was about to turn and escape, Yi Yun had already guessed Ran Yu's intentions. By using the black specter shadows to kill him, he could avoid violating the rule of not attacking other disciples undertaking the trial. It was indeed the best method!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, go to hell! If there is anything to blame, blame it on your body being too weak! Hahaha!" Ran Yu roared. He suddenly leaped when he was just a few meters away from Yi Yun. He leaped over Yi Yun!</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi!" Upon seeing this scene, Luo Fengling could not help but scream!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's mind turned solemn. His mental energy had been connected to the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon at the moment that Ran Yu charged at him. As such, he let all the power of his lifeblood explode!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon shadow exploded into a ball of black smoke!</p>
<p>At the same time, the black specters that were following Ran Yu charged forward. They noticed Yi Yun and they did not have any intentions of dodging as he watched the rolling black winds. It was as though they could devour Yi Yun's lifeblood in an instant.</p>
<p>"Come!"</p>
<p>With a loud shout from Yi Yun —</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The black smoke that the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon had exploded into burst across the air like a heavenly bridge. It was like a black waterfall falling from the sky as it charged straight into Yi Yun's body!</p>
<p>At that instant, Yi Yun's body issued crackling explosive sounds. The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's black smoke gathered on Yi Yun's body as it formed black scales that were rapidly duplicating themselves.</p>
<p>That was — Dragon scales!</p>
<p>Dragon scales began to appear on Yi Yun's cheeks as they began to cover his entire body.</p>
<p>Instantly, Yi Yun's body shimmered with a black divine glow. A rugged and powerful aura emanated out of Yi Yun's body. It was like a primordial desolate world was sealed in Yi Yun's body. And now, the world had been opened up. The aura of an Ancient Fey began to emanate out like a storm!</p>
<p>This is!?</p>
<p>All the Luo clan disciples in Black Wind Valley were left in shock!</p>
<p>The aura that emanated out of Yi Yun's body… made all their Fey race bloodlines resonate. It was like Yi Yun had become a Fey King from primordial times at that instant! They were shocked and distraught!</p>
<p>Could it be that… Yi Yun had fused with the Ancient Fey bloodline!?</p>
<p>Everyone stared with widened eyes as they had looks of disbelief.</p>
<p>After summoning the Fey race bloodline and then fusing with the bloodline was not uncommon. Previously, Luo Tian had done the same, but Luo Tian's fusion was with a Heaven Fey bloodline Yi Yun was fusing with an Ancient Fey bloodline!</p>
<p>After Luo Tian's fusion, his body revealed the characteristics of a gigantic demon ape. But for Yi Yun, his body was covered in dragon scales after his fusion!</p>
<p>"Break!"</p>
<p>Seeing the black specters rushing at him, Yi Yun bellowed and he suddenly punched out!</p>
<p>The power of that punch seemed like it was a divine mountain compressed into a tiny package. The void trembled slightly as the black specters in front of Yi Yun were torn apart by Yi Yun's single punch! Large amounts of black mist exploded, forming a black shockwave that blew out in every direction!</p>
<p>The handful of black specter shadows that came from the eighth level were slain by a single punch from Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Luo clan disciples present could not help but gape their mouths, and they had trouble closing them.</p>
<p>Just now… wasn't it said that Yi Yun's body was very weak?</p>
<p>Chapter 850: The trapped Ranyi Fish</p>
<p>"To annihilate four black specter shadows with one move, and to think that he just used his fist!"</p>
<p>On the fourth and fifth levels of Black Wind Valley, the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State disciples were dumbfounded. Previously, they were fixated on Yi Yun's weak body, claiming that he had relied on his Aspect Totem and Ancient Fey bloodline to reach the seventh level. If it came to a pure contest in body, Yi Yun would not have been able to find his footing on either the second or third level of Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun's single punch was heaven shaking and forceful. Although these people had not been the target of the punch, they could still feel the pressure of the punch in front of them.</p>
<p>"That is actually not the strength of Yi Yun's body. Yi Yun's body is still very weak, but he summoned the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline back to fuse with him! In this case, the power of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's lifeblood is also the power of his lifeblood!" A Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said.</p>
<p>His tone was filled with amazement, but also regretful over being left in the dust by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The surrounding Luo clan disciples had mixed feelings upon hearing this. Conjuring the Ancient Fey bloodline was good enough, but he had even fused with it!</p>
<p>In that case, who still dared say that Yi Yun's body was weak?</p>
<p>He had been mocked for having a weak body because his body would become a weakness. But now, once Yi Yun conjured the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon to complete a fusion, he could share the lifeblood power of the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon!</p>
<p>That ability was extremely enviable.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had completely absorbed Ancient Fey bloodline in four days, and even if the other days were counted, it was less than half a month.</p>
<p>A human had used less than half a month to absorb an Ancient Fey bone so completely?</p>
<p>Now, in front of Yi Yun, they did not even want to mock him for his identity as a human, because they were embarrassed to call themselves members of the Fey race. Be it in terms of bloodline concentration, or their absorption of Ancient Fey bones, they were far inferior to Yi Yun, so how could they be proud to be members of the Fey race?</p>
<p>At this moment, the person who was suffering the greatest mental collapse was Ran Yu. He had taken the opportunity when Yi Yun and the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake were in a struggle to decisively make a strike. He had lured the eighth level black specter shadows towards Yi Yun, managing to avoid violating the rules of the trial of not attacking each other to place Yi Yun in a life and death danger. It could have been deemed a masterstroke.</p>
<p>But immediately following that, Yi Yun had fused with the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline. His single punch had simultaneously shattered Ran Yu's machinations into smithereens. It made all the planning from before turn into a joke.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was thoroughly afraid when he saw Yi Yun's body covered in dragon scales. Yi Yun was standing there with a murderous aura.</p>
<p>Although Ran Yu knew leaving this dejectedly was embarrassing, he was out of choices. The seventh level was not safe. Despite the fact that the black specter flood dragon was already dead, there were still other black specter shadows that were constantly gathering around the seventh level. Ran Yu could not withstand that at all.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, consider yourself lucky! But don't be complacent. You aren't even at the Heaven Ascension realm. Your future is still a blur. There have been numerous geniuses and wonders in the history of the Luo clan, but unfortunately they died before they managed to mature. Here's me wishing you, Yi Yun... do not die too early!"</p>
<p>By throwing those nasty words out, Ran Yu hoped that he could redeem a bit of his face. Although his words were toxic, what he said was true. In the Luo clan, most juniors failed to mature to the very end. The 12 Empyrean Heavens was a world with large tumultuous waves. It was extremely common to die on the path of martial arts.</p>
<p>After Ran Yu said this, he turned around to flee onto the sixth level. He did not want to compete with Yi Yun any further, because he could not handle it!</p>
<p>Just as Ran Yu flew up, a cold beam flashed in Yi Yun's eyes.</p>
<p>"Do you think that this seventh level is a place where you can come and go as you please!?" Yi Yun bellowed as all the power of his lifeblood burned.</p>
<p>This was the power that belonged to the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon, and now with Yi Yun's body as a medium, it completely burst outward!</p>
<p>Heaven devouring!</p>
<p>Wo! Wo! Wo!</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's body as the core, the engulfing force radiated in all directions!</p>
<p>With the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon completely fused into Yi Yun's body, the engulfing force was much stronger than before!</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake had been injured previously, so it was trapped in the engulfing force's domain without any surprise.</p>
<p>Even seven or eight black specter shadows that had rushed from the eighth level were enveloped by the engulfing force. None of them could escape.</p>
<p>And Ran Yu, who was closest to Yi Yun, had previously summoned his Ranyi Fish bloodline. And now, with the engulfing vortex suddenly appearing, the Ranyi Fish bloodline was being locked onto by the vortex!</p>
<p>"What are you doing!?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's body was about to reach the sixth level, but the lifeblood power that he had conjured was stuck on the seventh level.</p>
<p>Ran Yu stared with anger. The Luo clan disciples were barred from attacking each other during the training at Mt. Azure Billow. This was also why Ran Yu dared to do such a brazen act in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun had directly made his move to use the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's bloodline suppression to stop the Ranyi Fish that he had conjured!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish phantom image was not a true Ancient Fey after all. Having been enveloped by the Ancient Fey aura, it immediately began to quiver. It could not even use thirty percent of its full strength, so it was unable to free itself from the binding of the engulfing force.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun! How you dare!? Are you flagrantly violating the rules of the training?" Ran Yu angrily boomed.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish phantom image was the coagulation of Ran Yu's bloodline essence!</p>
<p>To a Heaven Fey, their bloodline's concentration greatly reflected their potential and future achievements. In a Heaven Fey family, this was also one of the factors that determined how much resources were going to be invested in that person!</p>
<p>If any losses were suffered regarding the Ranyi Fish phantom image, Ran Yu would be eviscerated! It was nearly equivalent to chopping an arm of Ran Yu!</p>
<p>Yi Yun ignored Ran Yu's warning. Black gases rose up from his body, as though he was a demon god from returning from ancient times. In front of him, the energy vortex expanded in size. The Ranyi Fish that was awestruck by the ancient Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline was slowly being pulled towards Yi Yun!</p>
<p>"What is Yi Yun doing? Does he plan on devouring Ran Yu's Heaven Fey bloodline? If he does that, he is definitely violating of the rules of the training. Yi Yun will be punished!"</p>
<p>Many Luo clan disciples on the fourth and fifth levels in Black Wind Valley were taken aback. It was definitely unwise to challenge the rules of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>Ran Yu laughed in extreme anger. "Nice try, Yi Yun. To attack me in public, you are truly mad! Indeed, those who are not of the same kin are sure to be of a different heart. You will pay a terrible price for this!"</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Ran Yu suddenly looked up at Cang Mang, who was sitting high in the sky.</p>
<p>"Lord Cang Mang, Yi Yun is violating the rules of the collective training and he openly attacking me in a bid to destroy my bloodline. I think Yi Yun must be a spy from an alien race. According to the rules of the Luo clan, he should be crippled of his cultivation level!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu's heart was burning with flames of anger. However, despite his complaints, Cang Mang remained motionless mid air.</p>
<p>Cang Mang frowned slightly, but he did not speak. If Yi Yun truly devoured Ran Yu's bloodline, it was obvious that he could not sit idle. Although a warrior's world was all about an eye for an eye, a rule was still a rule that could not violated.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun smiled and said, "Ran Yu, are you saying that I'm attacking you? When did I attack you? I'm just using engulfing laws to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Is this a violation of the Luo clan's rules? I was using engulfing laws to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, but your Ranyi Fish bloodline appeared in the range of my engulfing laws, and for that, you are blaming me?"</p>
<p>Chapter 851: Eye for an Eye</p>
<p>With Yi Yun saying this, he had rebutted all of Ran Yu's rhetoric.</p>
<p>When the Phoenix Firmiana State disciples heard this, they could not stop themselves from laughing. It was Ran Yu, who had ulterior motives to begin with, that caused the Ranyi Fish bloodline to appear in Yi Yun's range of attack. If not, how could this have happened?</p>
<p>However, with the rules of the Luo clan, it was very difficult for Yi Yun to do anything to Ran Yu.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun high-sounding statements, Ran Yu gritted his teeth hatefully. "Cut your crap. I don't care about you capturing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. Quickly release my Ranyi Fish bloodline! I'm a direct descendant of the Xushui Ran clan. If my bloodline suffers in any way, you are doomed!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun laughed in disdain. "What sort of trashy bloodline is this that you treat it as a treasure!? Are you thinking that I would take the initiative to rescind my domain to release that crappy fish of yours? The moment I rescind my domain, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake will escape as a result! After being frightened by me once, it might escape deeper into Black Wind Valley. Can you afford to pay for it?"</p>
<p>While Yi Yun spoke, not only did he not rescind his domain, he had even strengthened the power of his bloodline. The Ranyi Fish was being drawn in as the lifeblood vortex grew larger. It began wailing as it could not break free at all.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Yu became anxious.</p>
<p>However, it was useless for him to remain anxious. From the looks of it, Cang Mang would not interfere. As long as Yi Yun did not directly attack Ran Yu, he would ignore them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what Yi Yun said was right. With the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake startled, it might very likely escape deeper into Black Wind Valley. What about the loss? Letting the Ranyi Fish bloodline was simple, but how was Ran Yu to compensate Yi Yun for his loss?</p>
<p>Regardless of who it was, no one would stop the lifeblood vortex. Yi Yun's actions were very reasonable!</p>
<p>Ran Yu also understood this. He could only grit his teeth and tolerate it. He also knew that even if Yi Yun was trying to make it difficult for him, he would definitely not really devour his bloodline. By trapping his bloodline, it was indeed not a violation of the Luo clan's rules. But even if Yi Yun devoured it directly, Cang Mang would definitely not sit idle, or he would have failed in his duty.</p>
<p>Although he had acknowledged the reality before him, this did not mean that Ran Yu could tolerate it. He said hatefully, "Yi Yun, I know you are trying to seek revenge on me. It is only fair for treasures to be obtained by those with the ability. The Black Wind Valley trial is meant to be about fair competition. So how was I wrong in trying to snatch your Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake? Besides, what I did were within the confines of the rules, and cannot be faulted!"</p>
<p>"Now, there is no chance for your revenge, so what can you do other than stopping my bloodline? Do you even dare devour it!? Do you believe that if you were to devour a tiny bit of my Ranyi Fish bloodline, my Xushui Ran clan would capture and ruin your cultivation, and use your Ancient Fey bloodline to compensate me!?"</p>
<p>The further in the sentence Ran Yu was, the more pleasure he felt. It was as though all the anger he had had been vented out. That's right, although he had been outdone by Yi Yun in various aspects, he still had his family clan's backing!</p>
<p>By using the Xushui Ran clan to threaten Yi Yun, this was the advantage of having a powerful faction behind him! Large family clans worked on the concept of reason. If Yi Yun did not violate the rules, the Xushui Ran clan would naturally not have a legitimate reason to do anything to Yi Yun. However, once Yi Yun violated the rules, they would not leave the matter at that. If not, how could the Xushui Ran clan have any face left?</p>
<p>Yi Yun sneered at Ran Yu's threats. He only circulated his lifeblood's power and the engulfing force that was locked onto the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake had increased.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake let out deafening hisses. The tiny blood snake knew that if it was sucked into the vortex, it would die. Therefore, it began struggling as the redness all over its body seemed like it was going to dropping out, as though it was already in a frenzy!</p>
<p>But regardless of how much frenzy it was, it could not escape the engulfing vortex. Instead, its lifeblood was constantly being extracted.</p>
<p>Other than the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, there were eight black specter shadows locked onto by the lifeblood vortex. The black specter shadows' lifeblood was also extracted and they gradually became weaker.</p>
<p>They roared maniacally, but with them becoming weaker, how were they able to escape the suction of the lifeblood vortex?</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specter shadows as his mind turned slightly heavy.</p>
<p>He glanced at Ran Yu, who was already standing on the sixth level, before his eyes flashed with a cold beam.</p>
<p>Upon sensing the killing intent in Yi Yun's eyes, Ran Yu gave a disdainful smile with an expression that goaded Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"It's time to stop. What's the point of restraining my bloodline? This kind of revenge that does not do anything to me will only reveal your incompetence. You are like a hag cursing on the streets that will be laughed at by others in contempt!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu derided Yi Yun, but suddenly, Yi Yun sent a Yuan Qi voice transmission that echoed in his ears. "The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake seems to be rather drained. I guess it's hungry. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Oh!?</p>
<p>Ran Yu was greatly alarmed as he suddenly realized that Yi Yun was manipulating his engulfing forces to gather the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specter shadows together. And his Ranyi Fish bloodline was slowly approaching the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and black specter shadows near the vortex!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Ran Yu broke out into cold sweat! He finally realized what Yi Yun's goal was. Yi Yun was going to put his Ranyi Fish bloodline, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specter shadows together. If the Ranyi Fish bloodline was torn apart, that had nothing to do with Yi Yun. That was because he was not the one doing it, so it did not violate the Luo clan's rules!</p>
<p>Seeing an irreversible scene about to happen in a split second, Ran Yu did not even manage to say anything. He directly sent a voice transmission to Yi Yun —</p>
<p>"Wait!"</p>
<p>But just as his voice transmission was issued, his Ranyi Fish bloodline had been thrown into the mix of the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the eight black specter shadows!</p>
<p>Be it the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake or the eight black specter shadows, they immediately entered a frenzied state!</p>
<p>In a battle of trapped beasts, a beast in a cage was the most intense. They fought without any regard for their lives. Furthermore, Yi Yun had deliberately drained their lifeblood, so they no longer had the strength to escape from the lifeblood vortex.</p>
<p>At this moment, with the Ranyi Fish phantom image appearing in front of them, how could they miss out on fresh food that could restore their strength?</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's reaction was the fastest. It was the first to rush forward and with its powerful penetrative power, it directly pierced through the Ranyi Fish's mouth!</p>
<p>"Ah&ndash; "</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish let out a scream as it struggled violently, but how could it escape the binding of the engulfing forces?</p>
<p>After the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's first move, the black specter shadows from the eighth level also rushed forward and bit the Ranyi Fish's body!</p>
<p>A black specter shadow clung onto each of the Ranyi Fish's six legs, while its head and tail were being crazily bitten by the other black specter shadows!</p>
<p>"No—— !" Ran Yu bellowed as his eyes turned bloodshot!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish bloodline was connected to his lifeblood, so an intense pain overwhelmed him, nearly causing him to faint.</p>
<p>Painful! It's too painful!</p>
<p>It felt as though his soul was being torn apart, and his blood marrow was being extracted out!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun! How dare you!?"</p>
<p>Ran Yu's body was trembling as blood seeped out of his pores. He was struggling crazily as though he wanted to rush onto the seventh level and fight Yi Yun!</p>
<p>But at this moment, with such excruciating pain and the Ranyi Fish bloodline he had depended on so much was being restrained by the engulfing force and being bitten by the black specter shadows and the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, how could he rush onto the seventh level? That was just courting death!</p>
<p>He could only watch helplessly as his Ranyi Fish bloodline was being consuming!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Luo clan disciples on the fourth and fifth levels were dumbfounded!</p>
<p>Ruthless, just too ruthless!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was definitely doing it on purpose!</p>
<p>By using the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specter shadows to devour the Ranyi Fish, it was similar to how Ran Yu had attracted the black specter shadows to devour Yi Yun's main body. It was the diversion of danger and killing by proxy!</p>
<p>Taking revenge in the confines of the rules, paying him back in his own coin!</p>
<p>Ka-cha! Ka-cha!</p>
<p>At this moment, the sounds of bones tearing apart could be heard. The Ranyi Fish's six limbs were torn apart by the black specter shadows!</p>
<p>Ran Yu collapsed to the ground as his face was twisted. His eyes filled with madness!</p>
<p>His lifeblood was the mark of the Heaven Fey bloodline that he was always proud of was now on the brink of utter destruction. Even with top treasures given to him and several years of recuperation, he would only be able to recover a tiny portion of the lifeblood that he lost!</p>
<p>And although the Xushui Ran clan had such treasures, they would not use it on Ran Yu. Although Ran Yu kept saying that he had the Xushui Ran clan backing him, it did not belong to him alone. He was just one of the many juniors of the Xushui Ran clan. Besides, he was not the best either.</p>
<p>According to the unspoken rules of a large family clan, how could such treasures be wasted on a junior, who was not the most excellent to begin with, after his bloodline was crippled?</p>
<p>"Lord Cang Mang! Save me!"</p>
<p>Ran Yu was sprawled on the ground and he reached out his hand futilely to the hovering Cang Mang. Blood was flowing out of every pore. He was worse than a dying dog that had eaten poison!</p>
<p>Cang Mang pondered slightly. The Luo clan's trials were meant to be a ruthless competition. At the Black Wind Valley, it was not uncommon for juniors to die during the trial, what more being crippled of their bloodlines.</p>
<p>Although the Luo clan had instilled rules, there were always Luo clan disciples who would engage in cut-throat battles within the confines of the rules. Previously, Ran Yu had done the same to Yi Yun, and now Yi Yun was doing the same to Ran Yu!</p>
<p>When Ran Yu harmed Yi Yun, Cang Mang did not intervene.</p>
<p>Now if Cang Mang intervened when Yi Yun harmed Ran Yu, that would be unfair. Besides, according to the rules of the trial, he was not meant to intervene. He was just a bystander.</p>
<p>Noticing how Ran Yu looked like a broken blood bag, his body shivering and face pale, Cang Mang frowned slightly. This savage method of extracting his lifeblood was equivalent to sucking the marrow of mortals dry. If it was any more serious, it would end up fatal.</p>
<p>"That should be enough. Ran Yu harmed you, but you were able to end up unharmed. With you harming Ran Yu, he has lost nearly half his life, and even if you were to stop now, Ran Yu would be mostly crippled. Your revenge would also be achieved. Although it's within the confines of the rules, don't cause his death. If so, the Xushui Ran clan will not be able to salvage the situation and they will end up finding fault with you."</p>
<p>Cang Mang's Yuan Qi transmission suddenly resounded in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>Although it appeared as though he was saving Ran Yu, Cang Mang was actually being thoughtful towards Yi Yun. After all, the Xushui Ran clan was a powerful faction. How could Yi Yun with his measly power offend them?</p>
<p>In fact, Cang Mang actually appreciated Yi Yun's eye for an eye ruthless method to a certain extent. A warrior had to act as such.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lord Cang Mang, for your advice. This junior understands."</p>
<p>Yi Yun first slowly answered Cang Mang before making a pose. Without any hurry, he used his engulfing law to pull the black specter shadows apart.</p>
<p>However, the black specter shadows were still biting on the Ranyi Fish's flesh, so with this pull...</p>
<p>"Chi! Chi! Chi!"</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish let out a scream as large swaths of flesh were torn off by these black specter shadows!</p>
<p>Ran Yu nearly fainted from the pain!</p>
<p>He looked angrily at Yi Yun, but he did not dare say a single word. He was afraid that if Yi Yun was unhappy, he could continue letting the black specter shadows feast on the Ranyi Fish's flesh.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the Ranyi Fish 'that did not look like a fish anymore', he rubbed his chin and said slowly, "Uh… sorry about that. Senior Brother Ran Yu. I used a bit too much force just now, but that was out of no choice. Bear with it a little. There's still a tiny snake in the Ranyi Fish's belly. Don't worry, I'll pull it out immediately."</p>
<p>Chapter 852: Ran Yu was truly too rash</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's words, the corners of Ran Yu's mouth twitched. His face was ashen, and he was so infuriated that his intestines were already twisted together. To pull out the raging snake out of the Ranyi Fish's belly, what sort of situation would occur with the snake still biting onto the Ranyi Fish's organs?</p>
<p>Ran Yu trembled all over as Yi Yun said slowly, "Senior Brother Ran Yu, if it's not pulled out, it will continue consuming your bloodline, right?"</p>
<p>At this moment, even the Luo clan disciples felt the pain for Ran Yu when they heard this, what more Ran Yu. Many of them looked at Yi Yun as an inexplicable chill shuddered down their backs.</p>
<p>That Yi Yun was not someone to be trifled with.</p>
<p>In fact, as a result of being weak overall, the humans gave an impression to most members of the Fey race that they were weak and easily bullied in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. However, look at Yi Yun now! Even the Fey race was not as ruthless as he was.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was one of the direct descendants of the Xushui Ran clan. He was left in such a miserable state after offending Yi Yun, so if it were any of them who had done so, no one knew how much more miserable their outcome would be.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of this, the Luo clan disciples present, especially Lie Ya, were covered in cold sweat. Fear had been struck deep into his heart after seeing Ran Yu's outcome. Other than Ran Yu, he was the one who had offended Yi Yun the most. Now, just recalling it made him feel like he was sitting on a cushion of needles. Would Yi Yun seek revenge on him after this?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was already this ruthless before he had matured fully. Wouldn't it be worse if he matured in the future? Would messing with him be as simple as playing with a toy?</p>
<p>Now, Lie Ya even felt that losing more than one hundred World Stones to Luo Fengling was a good thing. Compared to Ran Yu, it was so much more blissful. Lie Ya had made up his mind to sell everything he had after the Mt. Azure Billow training had finished to gather the World Stones for Luo Fengling. Not only would he personally deliver it to Luo Fengling, he would also speak nicely to her and hope that after she received the World Stones, she would say a few nice words to Yi Yun. In some sense, he was just buying peace.</p>
<p>Just as the Luo clan disciples were having disparate thoughts, Yi Yun had already used the engulfing law to tug at the Ranyi Fish's belly!</p>
<p>'"Puah!"</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, which was covered in blood, was biting on the Ranyi Fish's innards, but it was forcefully pulled out by the engulfing law!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish's projection convulsed violently, its body was on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>And as the master of the Ranyi Fish, Ran Yu spat out a mouthful of blood and as his body convulsed, he completely passed out!</p>
<p>At this moment, Cang Mang took action. If it wasn't for him secretly isolating the black specter shadows on the sixth floor, Ran Yu's body would have been devoured clean by the black specter shadows on the sixth floor. That would definitely be fatal.</p>
<p>The eight black specter shadows' mouths were filled with blood, while the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was still struggling frantically. However, none of them could break free from the binding of the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's engulfing law.</p>
<p>Finally, they were drained of their stamina and they were captured by the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon. They were sealed in the lifeblood vortex!</p>
<p>A great success!</p>
<p>Yi Yun clapped his hands and slowly flew back to the sixth level.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Yi Yun step onto the sixth level, the so called high and mighty Luo Tian, subconsciously took two steps back. Even the zombie-like Gu Luo looked at Yi Yun with a bit of wariness.</p>
<p>They were originally considered the malignant stars of the training at Mt. Azure Billow, figures that everyone feared. But now, they finally realized that there was someone more terrifying. Yi Yun, who looked harmless, was actually very ruthless.</p>
<p>Luo Tian was feeling truly lucky that he did not follow Ran Yu in stepping on the landmine that was Yi Yun. If not, it was very likely that he would end up a companion of Ran Yu now.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun spoke, "Everyone, this time Senior Brother's injuries was an accident. All of you saw the entire process, right? It was Senior Brother Ran Yu, who made the move first. He had some thoughts towards me but he ended up failing. The Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was about to capture the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake, but the moment Senior Brother Ran Yu made his move, I had no choice but to summon the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon back… "</p>
<p>"But once the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon was summoned, the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake would escape. I had no choice but to use a heaven devouring technique in the shortest period of time, and I accidentally trapped Senior Brother Ran Yu's Ranyi Fish bloodline. Following that, Senior Brother Ran Yu ask me to stop, but under the circumstances at that time, how could I stop? I believe if you were in my shoes, you would not stop, right… ?"</p>
<p>"As for the final outcome… I truly did not expect it." Yi Yun began shaking his head when he said this. Glancing at the half-dead Ran Yu, as though he found it regretful, he continued, "For things to have reached this stage was something I did not wish on seeing either. But there was no other choice. It was all because Senior Brother Ran Yu charged into the battlefield himself. The struggle between the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon and the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake is fraught with extreme danger, so Senior Brother Ran Yu was truly too rash."</p>
<p>"In fact, the moment that the Ranyi Fish bloodline appeared to be in danger, I immediately tried to rescue it, unfortunately, the tragedy was already ongoing. So the rescue ended up in such a state."</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said all of this, all the Luo clan disciples present curled their mouths.</p>
<p>This Yi Yun was too wicked!</p>
<p>"No choice but to use a heaven devouring technique", "accidentally trapped the Ranyi Fish bloodline", "final outcome was truly unexpected", ""tragedy I did not wish on seeing", "immediately tried to rescue"...</p>
<p>Not only was Yi Yun ruthless in his actions, his shamelessness had been cultivated to a certain realm. If not, he would not have been able to say those words, full of nonsense, in such a 'genuine fashion'.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Ran Yu had fainted or he would have died from exasperation from hearing that!</p>
<p>But soon, Ran Yu regained consciousness and he learned of what Yi Yun had said. As the saying goes, one did not need to be responsible for angering someone to their deaths.</p>
<p>"Everyone, everything that happened to Senior Brother Ran Yu was something that I did not wish would happen. I hope everyone would be a witness, and I'll be extremely grateful."</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Luo clan disciples on the fourth and fifth level while cupping his hands. Everyone rolled their eyes when they heard this.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Lie Ya, what do you think?" Thinking that that was all to the matter, Yi Yun's sudden questioning confounded Lie Ya.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun grinning at him, he felt like he should just slam his head into a wall till he died. Why are you staring at me? I'm nothing with all these people around me!</p>
<p>What else could Lie Ya say after being stared at by Yi Yun? He did not dare to offend Yi Yun, who was so ruthless. As long as he did not fall in the future, he would likely become a mighty figure in the Luo clan. He did not dare to offend him.</p>
<p>As for the Xushui Ran clan, Lie Ya was even more afraid to offend it. They were a massive clan, so he would be courting death to testify for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"That...*Cough*, Senior Brother Ran Yu was a bit rash… "</p>
<p>Lie Ya ruminated for a long time before saying such wishy-washy words. There was no mistake saying Ran Yu was rash. If he was not rash, he would not have been caught by Yi Yun and tortured to such a half-dead state.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this situation, the hovering Cang Mang's mouth formed an arc. His voice transmission rang in Yi Yun's ears. "Are you done with your acting?"</p>
<p>"Uh… " Yi Yun was momentarily stumped. He felt that Cang Mang did not really think too much about Ran Yu, and Cang Mang did not seem to be afraid of the Xushui Ran clan.</p>
<p>"Not bad, I had just told you to weigh the consequences, but you didn't forget to put the Ranyi Fish in such a terrible state while moving the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specters away. You are truly unafraid of the Xushui Ran clan's revenge."</p>
<p>Upon hearing Cang Mang's words, Yi Yun smiled bashfully. "Lord Cang Mang must be joking. This junior admits that he had previously deliberately fed the Ranyi Fish to the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and the black specters. But later on, this junior had already rescued it immediately, and this state is the limit to how much this junior can save him."</p>
<p>"Enough, there's no need for me to discuss if you were deliberate or not, but there is a warning I need to give you. You have completely offended the Xushui Ran clan. Although Ran Yu is not the most valued junior in their family, you have still smacked the Xushui Ran clan in the face by doing so. Large family clans value their reputation the most. By not letting them have a chance to salvage the situation, they will not let it go."</p>
<p>"Regardless of how they treat you, strength is essential. If you have the strength, they would also not easily make a move on you. It's best that you improve your cultivation level. Your strength now is too weak."</p>
<p>The reason why Cang Mang said this was because he thought highly of Yi Yun. Yi Yun immediately said, "Yes, this junior understands. Thank you to Lord Cang Mang for his advice."</p>
<p>Chapter 853: Absorbing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake</p>
<p>The final outcome for Ran Yu at the Black Wind Valley trial was him quitting midway.</p>
<p>With the Ranyi Fish bloodline severely damaged and Ran Yu suffering serious injuries, he had lost a great deal of his combat strength. He had chosen to quit, if not, there was no need to talk about entering the seventh level. He could only find his footing on the sixth level through Cang Mang's help.</p>
<p>And it was meaningless for Ran Yu to return to the third and fourth floor to cultivate. Furthermore, Ran Yu could not stand the shame of doing that.</p>
<p>However, once Ran Yu fell out, it was possible that he could not participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials, what more the Mt. Azure Billow training.</p>
<p>With just serious injuries, he would only end up being overtaken by others, so what was the point of participating?</p>
<p>It could even be said that Ran Yu's life had mostly been ruined.</p>
<p>Everyone saw Ran Yu being carried away with an ashen expression. Looking at Yi Yun, who had now sat firmly on the sixth level, they could not help but shudder. Many people thought of approaching Yi Yun to express their well intentions in order to prevent Yi Yun from kindly 'rescuing' them.</p>
<p>However, many people knew in that hearts that although Yi Yun was enjoying great success at this point in time, it was not wise to completely offend the Xushui Ran clan.</p>
<p>His future growth was fraught with danger…</p>
<p>Yi Yun finally chose to sit down on the seventh level. After being ravaged a few times on the seventh level, the blood dragon's blood energy that had taken form as beasts had long avoided him. Who would be stupid enough to provoke this malignant star?</p>
<p>In front of Yi Yun was a sealed lifeblood vortex. The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was on its last breath inside it.</p>
<p>The degenerated Blood Dragon aura contained in its body was extremely valuable, but it had now truly become a tiny snake.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake had already formed some intelligence. Upon sensing Yi Yun's Yuan Qi lock onto to it, it immediately began to struggle.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyes focused as the Yuan Qi transformed into a net and trapped the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake within.</p>
<p>"Hiss!" The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake let out a hissing scream as its body was reduced to a mist of blood before being injected into Yi Yun's body in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was the essence condensed from the black blood gases. Yi Yun had directed it into his meridians, and used his pure Yang body to temper it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately felt that a great deal of energy had been injected into his body.</p>
<p>All his bones began to issue explosive crackling sounds immediately.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was the greatest opportunity in Black Wind Valley. It was much more powerful than any relics Yi Yun had ever eaten.</p>
<p>Yi Yun calmed his mind down and he sat in his original spot, with a lifeblood vortex swirling around him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun planned on completely absorbing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake's power right there and then. Cang Mang had warned him to be careful about the Xushui Ran clan's revenge. However, Yi Yun was not afraid of the Xushui Ran clan because they could not do as they pleased in the Luo clan. As long as he showed enough value before they took their revenge, everything would not be a problem.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The energy in Yi Yun's body was surging around his body.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun consume the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake on the seventh floor, Luo Tian and company had complex expressions.</p>
<p>"That Yi Yun is truly decisive! By consuming the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake now, his strength will improve once again. And by doing so, the Xushui Ran clan cannot covet the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake." Luo Tian thought in his mind.</p>
<p>He silently stopped at a spot far away from Yi Yun and began to consume the black gases.</p>
<p>Another person who made the same choice as him was Gu Luo.</p>
<p>The Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake was already in Yi Yun's hands, but a large number of disciples had yet to finish their training.</p>
<p>With half the allotted time passing, there were still a few who could not reach the fifth level, and some who even failed to reach the fourth level.</p>
<p>As Luo Fengling looked at Yi Yun, who was on the seventh level. She took a deep breath and flew down towards the fifth level with a determined look. She began brandishing her sword and she slew several black specter shadows. She attempted to find her footing on the fifth level, but it was still very difficult…</p>
<p>"Although there is no way to compete with Junior Brother Yi Yun, I have to at least surpass myself." Luo Divine Hall trained arduously. After coming to Mt. Azure Billow for the training, she realized that her cultivation time was just too little. Compared to the disciples who participated in the Luo Divine Hall trials, she was just at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was even more disadvantaged than her. Although his cultivation time was very short, he had still managed to trample on the experienced senior disciples. Unknowingly, Luo Fengling had already treated Yi Yun as her role model.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Xushui Ran clan.</p>
<p>As one of the few large family clans in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the Xushui Ran clan possessed an entire floating continent.</p>
<p>The entire continent was filled with lakes. The largest lake in the middle was as vast as a sea. This lake was different from the other mist-covered lakes, because it had huge waves that reached as high as the skies. The lake's water was as black as ink. Warriors of insufficient cultivation level would be washed away by the huge waves.</p>
<p>In the middle of the black lake was a large island with pavilions dotted around it. It was where the Xushui Ran clan's mansion was.</p>
<p>"Xiao!"</p>
<p>A gigantic bird of prey landed in front of the mansion and a figure landed appeared atop the bird.</p>
<p>"Come on down." The person was a middle-aged man that looked like he was in his forties. He had a grim expression on his face, and he did not look like he was in a good mood.</p>
<p>Following that, a teenage-looking man leaped off the bird. When he landed, he let out a low grunt as he nearly stumbled.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man immediately frowned and said, "You can't even stand properly now?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm standing very firmly, Fourth Uncle." Ran Yu whispered, but he bit his lips as his fingernails sank deep into his palm.</p>
<p>Yi Yun!</p>
<p>It was all thanks to Yi Yun for him becoming no different to a prodigal dog!</p>
<p>He had returned to the Xushui Ran clan and he needed ten days before he could barely get out of bed. Indeed, as the middle-aged man said, he still could not stand properly. At least to jump down from such a high height from the mount was something that he could barely do.</p>
<p>"Go back and recuperate well." The middle-aged man glanced at Ran Yu and said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Ran Yu suddenly looked up and a look of indignation flashed in his eyes. "Fourth Uncle… but my injuries… "</p>
<p>"The family already knows about your injuries." The middle-aged man shook his head.</p>
<p>Seeing the middle-aged man's expression, Ran Yu's heart shrank. He felt short of breath as he lowered his head. "Is the family planning to… give up on me?"</p>
<p>"Giving up is being overly serious, but if you wish that the family will use treasures or even an Ancient Fey bone to treat you, that's impossible. In the future, just stay in the family clan. You will be manning the estate in the south-west."</p>
<p>Manning the estate!?</p>
<p>Ran Yu's heart sank as though the last breath in him had been extracted. In the Xushui Ran clan, only those children that had no future would be sent to out to man the estates. They were basically given no hope to continue cultivation!</p>
<p>Ran Yu was once a top genius in the family clan. With the exception of the top few people, he was the best. But now, he had been reduced to handling the family estates!</p>
<p>"Fourth Uncle, I… "</p>
<p>"Enough! Tomorrow, I will prepare some pills and relics for you. Speak no further. You attempted to harm that human, but you ended up crippling your Ranyi Fish bloodline… That person was only an Earth Fire Hall disciple, a human that had cultivated for only thirty years. He even came from a lower realm! What you have done has shamed the Xushui Ran clan! Do you think that the family clan will replenish your bloodline? Ran Yu, you have disappointed me too deeply in the trials!"</p>
<p>The middle-aged man's voice turned harsh and Ran Yu felt dejected as his heart was filled with despair.</p>
<p>He knew that his martial path might have come to an end. There was no chance for him to achieve much in the future. He had basically been abandoned by the family clan.</p>
<p>His fourth uncle was one of the elders who was more fond of him, but for him to also say that…</p>
<p>"Ran Yu, peacefully recuperate. As for that human from the lower realm, I'll remember him. Punishing you was alright, but he had gone too far when he destroyed your Ranyi Fish bloodline! When has a lowly human been able to destroy the bloodline of our Xushui Ran clan!? It's a slap in our Xushui Ran clan's face!"</p>
<p>Upon saying this, a cold beam flashed in the middle-aged man's eyes.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was infuriated as he clenched his fists till their trembled slightly. His eyes were already bloodshot.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man said, "Go back. That won't be the end to this matter. I will definitely give you an answer for it!"</p>
<p>Chapter 854: Entering Heaven Ascension</p>
<p>In Black Wind Valley, there was less than a day left till the end of the training.</p>
<p>Most disciples had managed to get their footing on the fifth level, while a minority of disciples only barely entered the fifth level before they immediately returned to the fourth level. However, this meant that they still passed the training. Although it did not seem like a bona fide pass, and it was quite contemptible, it was within the confines of the rules.</p>
<p>Cang Mang glanced at those people with heavy eyelids and he secretly shook his head. By barely being able to pass, and without any impressive show of ability at the Ancient Fey Edifice, these disciples were most likely to be eliminated immediately once they entered the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>They were the cream of the crop amongst ordinary disciples, but when all the geniuses of the Luo clan were gathered in the Luo Divine Hall trials, they could not even stand on the proper stage.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was the only one who could stand neck to neck with those geniuses amongst the disciples present that Cang Mang eyed. Even Luo Tian was slightly off the mark.</p>
<p>"However, the Xushui Ran clan will not forget this matter. Let's see how he plans on dealing with it." Cang Mang thought to himself.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a loud explosion suddenly echoed from within Yi Yun's body!</p>
<p>The sound was like rolling thunder and everyone's gazes were instantly focused on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>A vortex appeared out of nowhere in front of Yi Yun. All the blood dragon's essence energy on the seventh level was sucked into the vortex.</p>
<p>With a loud shrill scream, the Nine Neonate and Golden Crow totems appeared simultaneously behind Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The totems that were more than a hundred feet tall descended like Ancient Fey. The nine snake heads looked extremely ferocious, while the Golden Crow's flames burned intensely.</p>
<p>And after that, a dragon's roar suddenly boomed as the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon's phantom image appeared as well.</p>
<p>The blood dragon essence energy was devoured so incessantly that the black shadows on the eighth level distanced themselves away.</p>
<p>In Yi Yun's body, Yuan Qi seemed to flow like endless waves as it vigorously circulated around his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Instantly, it was as though the heaven and earth had opened up at the beginning of life. A Dao Tree appeared in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The tree leaves swayed as though they were producing Dao chants. The Dao Tree was already tens of feet high.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun is about to break through to the Heaven Ascension realm." Lie Ya said.</p>
<p>"He was at the Yuan Opening perfection realm, so it's reasonable for him to break through." Another disciple said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had first absorbed the Ancient Fey bone before absorbing the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake. It was no wonder that he could make a breakthrough after consuming such treasures.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Tian already had a distasteful feeling whenever he looked at Yi Yun. At the Black Wind Valley trials, all the limelight had been stolen by Yi Yun. The best things were also obtained by Yi Yun, so how could he feel comfortable?</p>
<p>Originally, Luo Tian was able to mentally console himself that Yi Yun's cultivation realm was lower than his. It was only at the Yuan Opening realm.</p>
<p>But now, once Yi Yun broke through to the Heaven Ascension realm, Luo Tian would be in the same realm as Yi Yun. Although Luo Tian was a subrealm higher, it was not a major advantage.</p>
<p>If that was the case, the decades that he had over Yi Yun in cultivation had been sent to the dogs?</p>
<p>"How old is Yi Yun?" Luo Tian suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"His bone age should be in their thirties, definitely not even forty." A Fire Cloud State disciple said.</p>
<p>This made Luo Tian knit his brows even tighter. He himself had broken through the Heaven Ascension realm at the age of forty-two!</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was just in his thirties.</p>
<p>"Too young!" Luo Tian shook his head. "Even a Luo clan genius would wait till they were nearly forty before they chose to break through to the Heaven Ascension realm. Yi Yun grew up in a lower realm, so be it resources or heritage, there is no way that the lower realm can compete with the 12 Empyrean Heavens."</p>
<p>"Yi Yun has just come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, so he should take advantage of the rich resources here and cultivate for a few more years to ensure he has a solid foundation. Yi Yun's nomological insight is impressive, and his body has absorbed the Ancient Fey bone. So he could be called unique and incomparable."</p>
<p>"But one's cultivation level and foundation cannot be accumulated without the passage of time. If those Luo clan geniuses want to break through to the Heaven Ascension realm, they could do it before the age of thirty as well, but they would drag it out for more than a decade so they could ensure that their foundations were perfect. Once they break through to the Heaven Ascension realm, their Dao Trees would be more than ninety deca-feet tall, some would even reach ninety-nine deca-feet!"</p>
<p>In a warrior's cultivation, they would plant a Dao Seed at the Yuan Foundation, grow a divine tree from the Dao Seed, laying the path to Heaven Ascension. The taller the Dao Tree was, the smoother the warrior's path would be in the future.</p>
<p>At this moment, on the Phoenix Firmiana State's side, someone interrupted, "What Senior Brother Luo said is true. However, Yi Yun is choosing to break through now because of the pressure that the Xushui Ran clan will bring him. Although the Xushui Ran clan would not blatantly deal with Yi Yun, it is inevitable that they will retaliate within the confines of the rules. Who knows, Yi Yun might also end up in the same state as Ran Yu. Yi Yun must have considered this to choose to break through to the Heaven Ascension realm in his thirties."</p>
<p>The moment this Phoenix Firmiana State disciple said this, the others fell silent. Putting themselves in Yi Yun's shoes, they would probably make the same choice. After all, there were still opportunities to slowly make up for a poor foundation. If one's personal strength was too weak, they might suffer a mishap in the trials due to someone from the Xushui Ran clan, and he might even lose half his life.</p>
<p>"What you said is right. What Yi Yun did is a wise choice." Luo Tian sighed as he felt mixed emotions.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the Dao Tree in front of Yi Yun was beginning to grow taller.</p>
<p>The energy within his body was constantly transforming into nutrients for the Dao tree. It was as if the Dao Tree would become towering and pierce straight into the clouds.</p>
<p>Heaven Ascension meant that the tree grown from the Dao seed becomes a path to heaven ascension.</p>
<p>Ten deca-feet, twenty deca-feet… fifty deca-feet... eighty deca-feet, all the way to ninety deca-feet!</p>
<p>With every additional growth in height of the Dao Tree, its appearance would change. It was obvious at a glance at what level the Dao Tree was. In fact, even without these changes, a warrior's eyesight was able to visually estimate the Dao Tree's height.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Yi Yun's Dao Tree reach ninety deca-feet, Luo Tian's heart shrunk. It was already that tall? That's too fast!</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's Dao Tree grow unabated, it was definitely not a problem even if it hit ninety-five deca-feet at this rate.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Luo, how high was your Dao Tree when you broke through to the Heaven Ascension realm?" Someone beside Luo Tian asked.</p>
<p>Luo Tian had quite an ugly expression on his face. Back then, his Dao Tree had grown to a height of ninety-seven deca-feet. That height was considered not bad, but in the Luo clan, there were people with higher Dao Trees than Luo Tian. There were many who had their Dao Trees attain the height of ninety-eight deca-feet, while there even a handful of people reaching ninety-nine deca-feet.</p>
<p>Luo Tian also knew that there was a difference when he compared himself to the top geniuses who grew up in the royal capital. He was still satisfied with his Dao Tree reaching the height of ninety-seven deca-feet. It was something to be proud of, but seeing how Yi Yun's Dao Tree had already reached ninety-five deca-feet without slowing down, how could he mention that he only had a ninety-seven deca-feet Dao Tree?</p>
<p>He had broken through to the Heaven Ascension realm at the age of forty-two... seven or eight years older than Yi Yun.</p>
<p>If even Yi Yun surpassed him with this, what did he amount to? He was inferior to Yi Yun in laws, inferior to Yi Yun in bloodline, and even now, his foundation… that he cultivated for forty-two years was inferior to Yi Yun's just over thirty years.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun's Dao Tree should be at the height of ninety-seven deca-feet now!"</p>
<p>The moment the disciple finished saying that, he realized that Yi Yun's Dao Tree was growing higher again.</p>
<p>Luo Tian's heart shrank as his expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>"Could it be… ?"</p>
<p>"Ka-cha!"</p>
<p>A lightning bolt struck down from above the nine heavens, right onto Yi Yun's Dao Tree.</p>
<p>And at the same time, two sharp calls echoed as the Nine Neonate and Golden Crow circled around the Dao Seed's tree before entering the tree's crown and flying amidst the clouds.</p>
<p>Nine-eight deca-feet!</p>
<p>"Roar!"</p>
<p>A dragon's roar was emitted from Yi Yun's body as the Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon phantom image appeared and flew straight into the Dao Tree.</p>
<p>Ka! Ka! Ka! As though the Heaven and Earth was being split apart, thunder rang again.</p>
<p>The Dao Tree grew ten feet higher once again!</p>
<p>Ninety-nine deca-feet!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Dao tree had grown to a height of ninety-nine deca-feet in one fell swoop. From afar, it looked like it was connected to the firmament.</p>
<p>The numbers of 99 was the pinnacle of Dao. By reaching the height of ninety-nine deca-feet, that Dao Tree had obtained perfection. However, perfection was not something ridiculously difficult. Amongst Luo clan geniuses, they still existed despite being exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up at his Dao Tree. His Dao Tree had stopped growing at the height of ninety-nine deca-feet, and it did not reach a hundred deca-feet.</p>
<p>However… Yi Yun's Dao Tree looked somewhat different. Every leaf of the Dao Tree contained strange textures that resembled the Dao Leaf that Yi Yun had obtained at the Pure Yang Sword Palace.</p>
<p>As the gentle wind blew, the tree leaves rustled. The rustling seemed to contain a strange melody that was quite fascinating.</p>
<p>However, the mystery contained within the leaves was naturally not something that Luo Tian and company could see.</p>
<p>In fact, just reaching the height of a Nine Nine Dao Tree was something that they could not accept.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine deca-feet, perfection!</p>
<p>Luo Tian looked at Yi Yun's Dao Tree and he felt like his face had been brutally smashed in by a fist. He felt his brain buzz.</p>
<p>They had just speculated that Yi Yun was forced by the Xushui Ran clan to make his breakthrough in a haste. But before they were even done with their conversation, Yi Yun's Dao Tree had grown to a height of ninety-nine deca-feet!</p>
<p>Can you stop doing that? Can you spare us a living path?</p>
<p>Being first at the collective training and obtaining all the benefits. Breaking through to the Heaven Ascension realm and even obtaining a Nine Nine Dao Tree!</p>
<p>Luo Tian suddenly felt discouraged and disillusioned. His looking forward to the Luo Divine Hall trials had even reduced.</p>
<p>He finally understood that he should not have competed with Yi Yun to begin with.</p>
<p>He was not a genius on the same level as Yi Yun, which resulted in such a disparate gap. At the collective training session, he was put down by Yi Yun in every single way, with him unable to lift his head up.</p>
<p>"Nine Nine Dao Tree. Yi Yun, you are pretty fine, but do not become complacent. A Nine Nine Dao Tree does not ensure great success in the future."</p>
<p>At this moment, Cang Mang's voice echoed in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>A Nine Nine Dao Tree was a basic, a necessary condition that a top mighty figure had to have. However, there were people with Nine Nine Dao Trees who ended up exhausting all their potential when they reached a certain stage.</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you, Senior Cang Mang, for your sincere advice. This junior is well aware. My martial path has only just started… "</p>
<p>As Yi Yun said this, the Dao Tree in front of him gradually shrunk and it flew into his Dantian. At that moment, Yi Yun's eyes became more profound, and the bottom of his eyes seemed to have Dao Tree leaf veins flashing.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun felt that he was even closer to 'Dao', but that feeling disappeared very quickly.</p>
<p>The truth of Great Dao was not something that was easy to touch.</p>
<p>Chapter 855: Long-awaited Familial</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, one was considered to have matured when they reached the Heaven Ascension realm as they were qualified to train outside.</p>
<p>However, despite there being millions of Heaven Ascension realm warriors, the number of people who reached the pinnacle of martial arts was just a handful.</p>
<p>The rest would exhaust their potential on their road to Heaven Ascension, or be trampled upon by others, becoming the accumulation of bones beneath the Heaven Ascension Great Dao.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood up and he sensed that the Yuan Qi in his body had increased by nearly 100%, as he clenched his fists.</p>
<p>With a breath, Yi Yun put his feet in line with his hip and with strength going from his hip to his back, he punched out like the sudden pouncing of a tiger. Before the fist reached its target, a whistling fist wind had torn through the air and slammed into a mountain wall.</p>
<p>Black Wind Valley's mountain walls had been immersed in black gases for hundreds of thousands of years, which made them extremely solid and as hard as diamond. Slashing down with a blade would not even leave a mark.</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>All the oppressive forces in his body burst outward with that single punch as they slammed into Black Wind Valley's mountain wall. Large chunks of rubble blasted out and with gravel flying, Yi Yun's entire fist was lodged deep in the mountain wall!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hard mountain wall had cracks that spread out like spider webs with Yi Yun's fist at its core.</p>
<p>The power of his fist was enough to cut into a mountain. That would have been nothing in the Tian Yuan world, but this was the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Black Wind Valley.</p>
<p>The rocks in Black Wind Valley had been tempered by the black mist a prolonged period of time. They were extraordinarily resistant. And even if it was damaged by a fist, the mountain rock would slowly recover.</p>
<p>Despite that, Yi Yun was very satisfied with the power of his punch.</p>
<p>At this moment, Cang Mang looked at the time and suddenly said, "Alright, the collective training at Mt. Azure Billow is coming to an end. It's about time we end it."</p>
<p>Most people had reached the fifth level in the Black Wind Valley trial. Yi Yun, who was thought to be one of the failures, had become the biggest winner.</p>
<p>And the aspirant Ran Yu had ended up being crippled. It was truly a lamentable situation.</p>
<p>Two spirit cruisers landed to pick up the disciples.</p>
<p>"The trials at Mt. Azure Billow have ended. Following that, all of you will proceed directly to the Luo clan's royal capital! There, the Luo Divine Hall trials will be held. I wish that all of you will have good results." Cang Mang's gaze swept pass these disciples as he slowly said.</p>
<p>Luo Divine Hall!</p>
<p>Once the trials were mentioned, the disciples felt excited. It happened once every sixty years, and it brought honor to the family and the state they were in. There were also plenty of opportunities.</p>
<p>Even if they knew that they were destined to amount to nothing, they still wanted to give it a try.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, on our trip to the royal capital, just stay in the residence and do not go out. Cultivate in peace inside." Luo Fengling suddenly walked over and told him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that Luo Fengling was worried about the Xushui Ran clan, so he nodded and said with a smile, "Don't worry."</p>
<p>"Alright." Luo Fengling did not know if Yi Yun was truly listening. He came from the lower realm and he lacked a background. It was extremely dangerous to face off against a behemoth like the Xushui Ran clan…</p>
<p>The spirit cruisers lifted off separately a day apart, carrying the Phoenix Firmiana State and Fire Cloud State disciples away towards the Luo clan royal capital.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the endless starry cosmos, a vast continent was shrouded by numerous bands of light. Large spirit cruisers shuttled through the bands of light, and amongst these spirit cruisers, the smallest was the size of a mountain, with numerous pavilions on it.</p>
<p>There were also gigantic flying Fey beasts that were flying slowly.</p>
<p>On the continent, the geological features were precipitous, with a countless number of immortal mountains springing up from the ground. They were like sharp swords that reached the sky. Above the immortal mountains, clouds circled them, and there was no lack of opulent palaces.</p>
<p>This continent was where the Luo clan royal capital was situated. It was also the largest continent in the entire Luo clan.</p>
<p>The Luo clan royal family that had been passed down for more than a hundred million years had lived on this continent for generations.</p>
<p>Decades ago, they had entered a huge war with the enemy invading the entire continent all the way to the capital. They nearly succeeded in invading the capital. It also caused the royal heirs of the Luo clan to be evacuated.</p>
<p>But now, after the war was over, the traces of war had already disappeared.</p>
<p>At this moment, a Fey beast with a wingspan of more than ten meters suddenly called out sharply in the distance. It moved as fast as lightning, and in the blink of an eye, it transformed into a red shadow that sank into a nebula band and flew towards the tallest immortal mountain.</p>
<p>"It's the Luo clan royalty's Divine Swan." Someone on a spirit cruiser said.</p>
<p>A Divine Swan had nearly zero combat strength, but it was the fastest Fey beast in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It was used as a messenger beast amongst the Luo clan royalty.</p>
<p>Seeing the Divine Swan land on an immortal mountain, no one knew what important news had been passed from other states.</p>
<p>"Sou!"</p>
<p>The Divine Swan flew towards the immortal mountain and flew straight to the mountainside, where a huge palace was.</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit's Residence.</p>
<p>This mansion was a residence that was second only to the Emperor and Empress' imperial palace in the Luo clan's royal capital. It was superior to many kingly residences.</p>
<p>It was located on the same stretch as Prince Crimson Firmament's residence, so its importance was obvious.</p>
<p>To the people in the Luo clan royal capital, these two people were important figures. One of them was bound to ascend and step into the empyrean palace.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Princess Purple Spirit, who was one of the heir candidates to the Luo clan throne and a proud daughter of heaven that numerous Luo clan citizens could not even look at in reverence, was baring her feet and busying herself in her boudoir.</p>
<p>"Bam!"</p>
<p>A loud explosion boomed, but the old servant outside the boudoir did not move, as though she did not hear a thing.</p>
<p>Amidst the black smoke, a yellow-dressed girl with a round face was coughing as she said, "Princess, how many times has it been!? If this goes on, you will blow up the entire building!"</p>
<p>"Hmph, there are array formations here, so how can it blow up? A little servant girl like you only knows how to speak nonsense," said another girl while waving her hand nonchalantly. Instantly, a refreshing wind blew over and swept the black smoke away.</p>
<p>The girl in the black smoke also revealed herself. If Yi Yun was here, he would immediately recognize her to be Luo Huo'er!</p>
<p>More than ten years had passed, and Luo Huo'er had a more refined look. She had an extremely noble air to her that flowed naturally from her brows. Most of the Luo clan royalty inherited good looks, and Luo Huo'er's beauty was considered stunning even in the royal family. She had the charm of her mother, Empress Xuanhou.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was only wearing a tight-fit heavenly silk shirt. The light linen softly adhered to her skin, accentuating her figure perfectly. Her breasts were ample and she had a thin waist. Her legs were long and slender, while her black hair cascaded down her back, as though it was the most beautiful satin.</p>
<p>"Princess, I heard that Prince Crimson Firmament has recently been roping in several family clans, aren't you worried? Why do you keep researching the Desolate Heaven technique? Her Highness Xuanhou is worried to death. I heard that Her Highness Xuanhou has delegated Prince Pingnan to rope in geniuses from everywhere to make preparations for the Luo Divine Hall trials. Princess, how can you not care?" The maid servant said with a pout.</p>
<p>"Why should I be anxious? I'm not the one who wants to ascend to the throne. If I was given the throne, wouldn't I have to write royal decrees daily? Just thinking of it irritates me to no end!" Luo Huo'er ran over to look at her Desolate Heaven Cauldron and said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"But… "</p>
<p>"You dare to carry on!?" Luo Huo'er turned around and stared at the maid servant with her beautiful eyes. "Nice going, Chun Ye. Were you bribed by Mother? Look at Dong'er and how well-behaved she is. She doesn't nag."</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er said this, she pointed at Dong'er, who was dozing at a corner. If Yi Yun was here, he would definitely be surprised that despite although more than a decade had passed, Dong'er still looked like a eleven or twelve-year-old loli. She did not grow up at all.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Dong'er, Chun Ye stared at her grumpily. "That rascal would do fine just having buns to eat. Other than that, all she does is sleep. How would she say a thing? She doesn't even have any thoughts, but Princess… "</p>
<p>"Enough, are you even done? If you keep continuing on, I will send you to watch the gates. And it's perfect that you are a descendant of a primordial Fey beast, using you to watch the gates is quite classy."</p>
<p>"Watch… watch the gates? Princess, I've served you for quite a long period of time. I've done hard work even if I have not performed any meritorious deeds. To think you want me to watch the gates… " Chun Ye stared widely as she felt aggrieved.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that Chun Ye was about to cry, Luo Huo'er impatiently snorted and said, "Enough, enough. I knew you must have been listening to Mother. No wonder you have no end to it. Fine, I'll ask about it in the next few days."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Princess! Princess, I'm doing it for your own good. That Prince Crimson Firmament doesn't seem like a good person in any way. How can the Luo throne be given to him? It has to be yours!" Chun Ye said.</p>
<p>At this moment, the old servant's voice suddenly sounded from outside the door. "Princess, Young Master Xuan Junyue wishes to seek an audience."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er frowned and wanted to reject him, but she noticed Chun Ye beside her looking pitifully at her.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er took back her words as she said, "Then, let him wait."</p>
<p>Saying that, Luo Huo'er knocked the dozing Dong'er's head and said, "Stop sleeping. Your saliva is dripping onto the table. Hurry up and help me change. It's been so many years, and you have not improved at all. All you know is sleep and eat!"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er rolled her eyes at Dong'er.</p>
<p>Dong'er rubbed her head and said in an aggrieved manner, "But I grow slowly… "</p>
<p>"Enough! That Xuan Junyue comes visit me every other day. It's so irritating. I wonder what's the matter this time."</p>
<p>"I heard that the Divine Swan just returned. There must be something important." As Chun Ye said, she dragged the slow Dong'er and helped Luo Huo'er change.</p>
<p>In the middle of a wide and grand hall, a man dressed in white was standing up straight, as he stood conscientiously.</p>
<p>His handsome face had sword like eyebrows and star-like eyes as he carried a sword on his back. He stood there, faintly exuding a sharp aura, as though he was a sword that was about to be unsheathed.</p>
<p>At this moment, extremely light footsteps could be heard outside the door. This sound was like a gentle breeze, and every step sounded like a beauty was dancing towards it.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this sound, the man's eyes flashed with a smile as he looked at the door.</p>
<p>Ding Ding Ding… As the sounds of jade being gently hit sounded, a stunning beauty came in from outside the door.</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit's beauty was known by everyone in the Luo clan, but few had the chance to glimpse her face.</p>
<p>The girl was dressed in a red dress, and her black and long satin-like hair reached down to her waist. Her skin was crystalline as though it was the highest grade of white jade. Her eyes were like water and her sharp nose gave her a radiant look. It was filled with an intense sense of dignity, that made one involuntarily feel ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>This was not only because of her status as the Luo clan's royalty, but it was also because of the nobility of her Ancient Fey bloodline.</p>
<p>Under Dong'er's companionship, Luo Huo'er walked into the hall.</p>
<p>"Greetings to Princess Purple Spirit." Xuan Junyue hastily bowed.</p>
<p>Although he was part of Empress Xuanhou's family, and he was considered to be Luo Huo'er's cousin, he was only a genius from a family clan, while she was a heir to the Luo clan throne. Xuan Junyue did not dare breach etiquette.</p>
<p>"Yeah." Luo Huo'er acknowledged tersely and sat down at the seat of honor. She then slightly frowned and said, "What are you standing for?"</p>
<p>"Thank you Princess Purple Spirit for conferring me a seat." Xuan Junyue said.</p>
<p>Conferring a seat? This Princess just finds you an eyesore standing!</p>
<p>However, Luo Huo'er would not say this out loud. Xuan Junyue was from her mother's family clan. He was one of the top geniuses in the younger generation that even Her Highness Xuanhou thought highly of. For the sake of her mother, she could not be too nasty to him.</p>
<p>Chapter 856: Get him to Call me Master</p>
<p>"Why are you looking for me??" Luo Huo'er asked lightly.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's light tone was understood by Chun Ye, who was beside her. She knew that the meaning behind her Princess' words were: Say whatever you have quickly. Once you are done, leave. This Princess still isn't done with refining relics.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue immediately brushed his robe, stood up and said, "Her Highness Empress Xuan invites Princess over. It's an urgent matter, so it is requested that Princess proceeds with this lowly servant as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"What's Mother calling me for?" Luo Huo'er glanced at Xuan Junyue and she felt irritated. Xuan Junyue ran to her mother all day, as though he was treating her mother as his mother.</p>
<p>When she thought about this, Luo Huo'er had a headache. "If that's the case, I'll go visit Mother."</p>
<p>Fenghua Palace, Empress Xuan's palace. It was one of the two larger palace in the royal harem.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan and Empress Luo were both given the title of Empress, and both of them had Ancient Fey family clans supporting them. They were both extremely prominent in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan entered the harem slightly later, but due to her outstanding talent, her cultivation speed in the palace was not any slower than Empress Luo's, so she was quickly on par with Empress Luo, winning the trust of Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>However, Empress Luo's faction had been in operation for a long time and Prince Crimson Firmament himself had a powerful influence as well. Even though Luo Huo'er's talents were outstanding, and she was given a lot of help in various aspects by Empress Xuan, it was still extremely difficult for her to ascend to the throne.</p>
<p>What made Empress Xuan dispirited was her daughter's personality. She did as she pleased and she was dedicated to studying her martial arts and Desolate Heaven technique. She had no interest in vying for the throne.</p>
<p>"Arrival of Princess Purple Spirit!"</p>
<p>Following that, Luo Huo'er's figure appeared by the palace's door. A tiny frown immediately appeared on Empress Xuan's beautiful face as she looked like her mind was in pain.</p>
<p>"Mother, why did you have to call me over?" Before Luo Huo'er reached Empress Xuan, her pouty voice could be heard.</p>
<p>"You are actually willing to come." Empress Xuan said with a sigh and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I come? I was planning on visiting Mother. Wasn't I just busy?" Luo Huo'er came to Empress Xuan's side like a gust of wind and sat down beside her petulantly.</p>
<p>"Busy? You should be busy, but what you should busy yourself over is proper matters. Huo'er, vying for the throne cannot be stopped once it begins. Once we are defeated, no good will come out of it for us. The Luo Divine Hall trials are about to begin, and our Luo clan will have the first Luo Divine Hall trials in decades after the war ended. At the war, our Luo clan lost too many mighty figures, and no one knows how many factions are waiting for the Luo Divine Hall trials to begin."</p>
<p>"Huo'er, you do not care about any of this, so you do not know that your Father thinks very highly about the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials. If our performance at the Luo Divine Hall trials surpasses Crimson Firmament's, you will become the more appropriate candidate for the throne in your Father and his subjects' eyes.</p>
<p>Saying that, Empress Xuan took out a jade slip and said, "Just now, Prince Pingnan sent a Divine Swan back with information. It lists the geniuses who were recommended by us and are likely to have promising performances at the Luo Divine Hall trials. Take a look at it."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er took the jade slip and as she probed it slightly, she immediately frowned silently.</p>
<p>So many!?</p>
<p>It's too long. I don't want to read it.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's eyes turned and looked at Xuan Junyue, "Doesn't Xuan Junyue know all of this very clearly? Why don't you simply summarize it?"</p>
<p>There were so many people with detailed information introducing them on the jade. Luo Huo'er could not even be bothered to read all of it.</p>
<p>"You brat!" Empress Xuan frowned. How could she not know what was going on in Luo Huo'er's tiny head?</p>
<p>"Forget it, Junyue, go ahead and tell her." Empress Xuan said with a headache.</p>
<p>"Yes, Your Highness, Princess." Xuan Junyue answered, "Actually, amongst the geniuses here, most of them are average in my point of view. A few are worthy of attention, especially Cloud Water State's Mo Sang, Heaven Fall State's Gu Qing, and Spirit Feathers State's Ling Wu. They all have Heaven Fey bloodline and they have cultivated for more than four decades. They have long acquired their fame and are the cream of the crop."</p>
<p>"Also, there is a person from the Fire Cloud State whose performance at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training was extremely outstanding. Also, worth mentioning is that he is a human." As Xuan Junyue said this, he also found it unbelievable. For a human to obtain first place, especially success in Black Wind Valley, it was extremely rare.</p>
<p>"Our Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven only has a few humans. In the other Empyrean Heavens, the humans aren't weak as well. Why would it be surprising to have a human genius?" Luo Huo'er said nonchalantly. She couldn't care if they were Heaven Fey or human. All she cared about now was the cauldron in her boudoir. A new batch of relics were being refined in there, and she did not feel at ease about letting her maid servant, Chun Ye, watch it.</p>
<p>"This human is truly different from the humans from other Empyrean Heavens. His name is Yi Yun, and he is a newly recruited disciple of the Fire Cloud State's Earth Fire Hall. As his performance in Fire Spirit Palace was outstanding, he was recommended to Prince Pingnan. He was not a member of our Luo clan prior to that, and he was rescued by a Fire Cloud State Heaven Fire Hall disciple." Xuan Junyue said.</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Xuan Junyue suddenly realized that Luo Huo'er's expression had apparently changed.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun?" Luo Huo'er was taken aback slightly. That name left a deep impression on her.</p>
<p>"It should be impossible that it's that darn rascal… " Upon thinking about this, Luo Huo'er ground her teeth hatefully.</p>
<p>As a princess of the Luo clan, one of the heirs to the Luo empyrean throne, she had been bullied by a country boy in a lower realm…</p>
<p>Once she thought about Yi Yun's mature ways beyond his age, and his composed look, Luo Huo'er was infuriated.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue noticed Luo Huo'er's nasty expression and was greatly disturbed.</p>
<p>"Does Princess know of this Yi Yun?" Xuan Junyue asked.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er said, "It's probably only a person who shares the same name."</p>
<p>That punk was definitely still in some corner in the lower realm like a frog in the bottom of a well. Back then despite losing to the punk, this princess was just being a dragon in a puddle of shrimps. If it wasn't for Mother preventing me from using the Luo clan's cultivation techniques or mystic techniques, because she was afraid that my identity would be revealed, what sort of problems would there be!?</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er surmised that the punk, Yi Yun, was probably just at the Yuan Opening realm. At this realm, he was already considered a sage in the lower realm. However, in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, he was barely a foot soldier.</p>
<p>Maybe she should find an opportunity to return to the Tian Yuan world and bring that rascal, Yi Yun, to the Luo clan to show him her prowess, letting him know how noble this princess' identity is.</p>
<p>She wanted to show the punk that to go far in martial arts, it was not enough to stay in those tiny worlds. There was a need to come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven and rub shoulders with this princess. If he were to prostrate himself in front of this princess, this princess shall be kind and accept him as a lackey. When the time comes, he would understand that his strength was nothing at all.</p>
<p>"Hehe, that guy is obsessed with martial arts. He definitely would want to cultivate my Luo clan's cultivation techniques. When the time comes, I can get him to call me master! That would definitely feel good!"</p>
<p>With this thoughts in mind, Luo Huo'er could not help but reveal a sinister smile.</p>
<p>However, this smile surprised Xuan Junyue.</p>
<p>Even though it had a touch of sinisterness, as long as Luo Huo'er smiled, it would be like the blooming of flowers, dazzling others.</p>
<p>Obviously, this smile would not appear for no reason, so it was clearly because she thought of another Yi Yun…</p>
<p>"That Yi Yun, who is he?" Xuan Junyue suddenly felt alarmed and was wary.</p>
<p>Although he was extremely respectful to Luo Huo'er, he had already considered himself a suitor of Luo Huo'er in his heart.</p>
<p>In the future, if Luo Huo'er were to ascend the throne, as her husband, he would definitely be a dragon amongst people. And with Xuan Junyue being born into Empress Xuan's family, he was a top genius in the family, so he had cultivated with great effort.</p>
<p>No one knew who the person Luo Huo'er was referring to that could leave such an impression on Luo Huo'er. Just thinking of that smile, that person was probably a genius from a prominent family background. Naturally, it could not be the Yi Yun on the name list. Although he was talented, it was only decent. In terms of background, it was not worth mentioning at all.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue felt an urgent sense of danger.</p>
<p>"Oh right, how did this Yi Yun perform?" Luo Huo'er suddenly asked out of curiosity.</p>
<p>"First at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training. He obtained the Dao Tree and Extreme Yang Illumination divine columns' rating of Hibernation Awakening in the Ancient Fey Edifice. At Black Wind Valley, he captured the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake." Xuan Junyue answered.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's pretty awesome." Luo Huo'er nodded.</p>
<p>"Huo'er, This human's performance is already not bad. He came from a lower realm, but he has two Aspect Totems. And after he absorbed an Ancient Fey bone, he obtained a Heaven Devouring Flood Dragon bloodline. In my point of view, he is quite a diligent fellow." Empress Xuan said.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue echoed, "It's not easy to have such performance for a human from the lower realm. However, his foundation is too weak, so he might not be able to amount to much in the future… "</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue was haughty, so he was naturally more reserved when he rated other geniuses.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan said, "The people who did quite well for the collective training are already on their way to the royal capital. Soon, I will be summoning them, and Huo'er, you should meet them when the time comes."</p>
<p>Chapter 857: Empress Luo's Banquet</p>
<p>"Yes, Mother… " Luo Huo'er answered with a clear lack of interest and she was rather reluctant to do so. Luo Huo'er also knew that the reason why her mother had requested for her to show up was to further draw in the geniuses, and show the world her love for talent. If she did not do so, how could more geniuses and the family clans behind them be willing to join their camp?</p>
<p>Empress Xuan glanced at Luo Huo'er and she sighed in her heart. Luo Huo'er might not put these matters at hard, but Prince Crimson Firmament had already established a massive force, and it was constantly expanding.</p>
<p>If they did not adopt vigorous measures, even those family clans and factions that stood on their side might even end up being convinced by Prince Crimson Firmament to switch camps.</p>
<p>The abdication of the throne was at hand, so Empress Luo and Prince Crimson Firmament were using every means possible.</p>
<p>At this moment, a flash of light appeared as a voice transmission charm appeared in front of Empress Xuan.</p>
<p>After hearing the information in the voice transmission charm, Empress Xuan frowned slightly.</p>
<p>"A voice transmission charm from Empress Luo?" Xuan Junyue inquired. Empress Luo had a unique voice transmission charm, so standing nearby, he could recognise it at a glance.</p>
<p>"Yes… " Empress Xuan nodded. "Empress Luo has set up a banquet and has invited us, as well as the geniuses partaking in the trials to attend it. It looks like she plans on showing a display of force."</p>
<p>"Then what are we to do?" Xuan Junyue found the matter somewhat tricky. Their present forces were naturally far inferior to Empress Luo's.</p>
<p>"We shall go. The geniuses we have attracted must have been invited as well. If we do not go, those geniuses might think that we are afraid of Empress Luo. When the time comes, they might end up being roped in by them."</p>
<p>Empress Xuan crushed the voice transmission charm and she looked at Luo Huo'er. "Huo'er, you are not to fool around at Empress Luo's place. A princess must act like a princess. Your nonsense can be ignored at home, but when you are out, if you were to embarrass yourself, no one knows how others will think of you. Please give me peace of mind!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mother." Luo Huo'er spat out her cute tongue, but no one knew if she heeded Empress Xuan's exhortations.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"We are almost arriving at the Luo clan's royal capital." On the spirit cruiser, a Fire Cloud State disciple said excitedly.</p>
<p>Even Luo Fengling's eyes immediately flashed with a hint of excitement.</p>
<p>She had been arduously cultivating in pursuit of martial arts. She had rose up with difficulty, and now, she finally took that solid step forward, arriving at the holy land that she had always longed for — the Luo clan's royal capital.</p>
<p>The Luo clan royal capital was not a place that anyone could go to as they wished.</p>
<p>The numerous nebula bands revolving around the Luo clan royal capital were an array protecting the capital. Unless they received the permit to enter the capital, it was impossible to enter.</p>
<p>Normal disciples might never have a chance in their entire lives to enter the Luo clan royal capital.</p>
<p>"Right in front of us is the Luo clan royal capital. You will be directly sent to the Luo Divine Hall and you will stay there. However, don't be in a rush to be too happy. Look around you." The Fire Cloud State person-in-charge of leading them said coldly.</p>
<p>The disciples on the two spirit cruisers looked around and they saw many other spirit cruisers docked in the vicinity of the royal capital's nebula band along the perimeter.</p>
<p>They saw many spirit cruisers that came from other states.</p>
<p>These spirit cruiser had flags of different states.</p>
<p>“That's the Rain Immortal State's spirit cruiser, and that spirit cruiser, it's the Earth Desolate State's." A disciple said.</p>
<p>At a glance, they saw at least twenty state flags.</p>
<p>The numerous flags fluttered as more than a hundred spirit cruisers headed towards the royal capital.</p>
<p>Even though they knew that the Luo clan had a total of 196 states, and that some of the states were several times larger than the Fire Cloud State and the Phoenix Firmiana State, it still gave everyone a startling feeling.</p>
<p>Other than the 196 states, there were also ancient family clans with deep heritage. For example, the Xushui Ran clan was one such family clan. It also independently nurtured geniuses from the family and sent them to the Luo clan's royal capital! These large family clans would typically nurture the truly exception geniuses themselves. Only the slightly weaker ones, like Ran Yu, were sent to other states for training.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was destined for the royal capital to be filled with outstanding elites!</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, the feeling that one got from truly witnessing the scene of densely packed spirit cruisers, so large in size that their ends could not be seen, was truly phenomenal.</p>
<p>The Fire Cloud State present could not help but sigh and realize their minuteness.</p>
<p>They knew that to compete with people like these, many of them were destined to be green leaves that only accentuated the flowers…</p>
<p>"Oh? That's the Heaven Fall State's spirit cruiser!" A disciple suddenly said.</p>
<p>The Heaven Fall State was one of the top five states ranked amongst the 196 states!</p>
<p>As for the Fire Cloud State, it was only ranked in the middle, so the disparity in strength between the two states was non-trivial.</p>
<p>Although the Heaven Fall State's spirit cruiser was a standard spirit cruiser, its size was several times bigger than the Fire Cloud State's. There was no doubt that the number of young elites that their spirit cruiser carried was many more than the Fire Cloud State's. It was only natural that such a large state would be given more spots.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Heaven Fall State's flag that comprised of a bursting flame. Its fiery redness was harsh on the eyes.</p>
<p>"At the Luo Divine Hall trials, the competition will be immense. The lot of you may be the best in the Fire Cloud State, but amongst the geniuses from 196 states, you might not attract as much attention. Besides, don't forget, there is still the strongest faction, the Luo clan royal capital! The Luo clan royal capital's strength far exceeds any state and family clan! You will have to depend on your efforts in order to obtain a good result at the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>The person-in-charge of leading them said and with a wave of his hand, the two spirit cruisers passed through the nebula band and headed for the Luo clan's royal capital.</p>
<p>As the spirit cruiser passed through layers of nebula bands, it quickly approached an immortal mountain, which stood erect like a sharp sword.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked down and he exhaled lightly.</p>
<p>This competition was truly intense!</p>
<p>However, this made Yi Yun feel a surge of emotions. He had just made a breakthrough and he was thinking of testing his own strength!</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>As the wind howled, the spirit cruisers carrying the geniuses who were going to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials from the 196 states had arrived at the royal capital.</p>
<p>They landed on a large mountain, which had a wide platform built on it. The platform was almost flush with the other divine mountains around it, as though it was a flat piece of land that suspended in mid air. Even a large spirit cruiser was like a speck of dust when it landed on the platform.</p>
<p>Around the platform, there were large and opulent palaces and Yi Yun was assigned to one of them.</p>
<p>The palace was bright and spacious with well-equipped facilities, and there were more than ten servants to serve him. And on a table in the middle of the palace, there was an invitation.</p>
<p>Upon opening it, Yi Yun realized it was a banquet invitation and it was signed by — Empress Luo!</p>
<p>Yi Yun pondered for a moment. He naturally knew that Empress Luo was Prince Crimson Firmament's biological mother. The reason why the Luo Divine Hall trials raged like a storm was mainly because of the competition between Prince Crimson Firmament and Princess Purple Spirit.</p>
<p>"Empress Luo did not only invite us to the banquet, she has also invited Empress Xuan… " Yi Yun read the introduction in the invitation and he was slightly surprised. However, regardless of anything, he was now a Luo clan disciple, so there was no reason for him to reject a banquet invitation from an Empress.</p>
<p>Chapter 858: Four Great Young Masters</p>
<p>The Luo clan's royal capital covered an extremely extensive area. To the north of the royal city, there was a snow-covered mountain that was a hundred thousand feet tall. The mountain's peak was shrouded by clouds, and bluish snow capped it. There were vast swaths of snow that filled the area, making it look like an immortal's paradise.</p>
<p>And in this vast sea of snow stood numerous jade-carved palaces. Every palace was augmented by array formations, so even though the exterior environment was covered in snow, the palace's internal environment was maintained at a comfortable temperature all year round, with luxuriant grass and trees in blooming flowers. It was extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>In the middle of the mountain peak, there was a hot spring that did not freeze regardless of the season. The hot spring had the name 'Luo Lucid Springs' and its temperature was pleasant. Luo Lucid Springs was perennially covered in dense water vapor, and the spring water was like ambrosia from the heavens. It was filled with spiritual energy, so just drinking a mouthful would allow a mortal to become one year younger. A kettle of it allowed one to become ten years younger. The marvelous effects for mortals was no surprise, but even for warriors with relatively high cultivation levels, Luo Lucid Springs was still able to provide them with many rare benefits.</p>
<p>Even in the Luo clan royal compound that was filled with spiritual grounds, the Luo Lucid Springs was still one of the more famous ones.</p>
<p>The entire Luo Lucid Springs was surrounded by a palace with the name 'Luo Lucid Palace'. And it was the venue where Empress Luo was hosting her banquet today.</p>
<p>The people invited to the banquet were important figures of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>There was Empress Xuan, Princess Purple Spirit, old subjects of the Luo clan's royal court, outstanding figures in the royal capital as well as those young elites who performed well at the collective training and who were expected to stand out at the Luo Divine Hall trials!</p>
<p>The standards for choosing these young elites were extremely high. There were certain states which did not have a single person chosen. For example, Yi Yun was the only person picked from the Fire Cloud State.</p>
<p>The young elites who were chosen were extremely excited. The banquet could be one of the most important opportunities in their lives. If they were lucky, they might gain the recognition of the upper echelons of the Luo clan, and enjoy a meteoric rise.</p>
<p>It was still two hours before the banquet began. With the invitation in hand, Yi Yun came to Luo Lucid Palace and he happened to meet Luo Tian, who also had an invitation.</p>
<p>Luo Tian from the Phoenix Firmiana State had been chosen to attend the banquet, but his seat was located at one of the big tables situated outside Luo Lucid Palace. He was just there to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>Sitting there gave him zero chance of being appreciated. He would not even get to see Empress Luo, while all the truly important people were seated inside.</p>
<p>After Luo Tian saw Yi Yun, he gave him an awkward smile. Ever since Yi Yun broke through to the Heaven Ascension realm and obtained a ninety-nine deca-feet Dao Tree, Luo Tian no longer had the mind to compete with Yi Yun. He acknowledged his own inferiority against Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave him a gentle nod before walking into the palace. Upon seeing this scene, Luo Tian felt extremely envious. He also desired to enter the inner palace, but he was ineligible to do so.</p>
<p>The inner palace was filled with top figures. It was even rumored that Princess Purple Spirit would come today. If one entered the inner palace, one could catch a sight of Princess Purple Spirit's beauty.</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit was considered the most dazzling pearl in all of the Luo clan's royal capital. No heiress from the large families or the female elites from the various states could compete with Princess Purple Spirit. She was on a completely different level.</p>
<p>Ignoring her looks and family background, just her talent alone that was derived from the richness of her Ancient Fey bloodline was shocking. It was rumored that Princess Purple Spirit had inherited an Ancient Fey's bloodline as though she was a reincarnation of one. At the age of ten, she had awakened her Ancient Fey bloodline, and she had even greatly surpassed Prince Crimson Firmament!</p>
<p>It was also because of Princess Purple Spirit that Emperor Luo deliberated over the heir to the throne. If not, with the Luo clan's tradition of preference towards age, the forces that Prince Crimson Firmament controlled and the support he received that far exceeded Princess Purple Spirit's would have easily ensured that he would ascend to the throne.</p>
<p>Despite Luo Tian knowing that his talent and status made it impossible for his life to have any intersection with Princess Purple Spirit, he would have been extremely satisfied just meeting her once.</p>
<p>Unfortunately… the statuses they enjoyed were realms apart. They were people from two different worlds.</p>
<p>Obviously, Yi Yun did not know what Luo Tian was thinking. In fact, even if Luo Tian had said it out loud, Yi Yun would find it difficult to imagine that the problematic girl that he met at the Tai Ah Divine City had an identity that was so far beyond one's reach.</p>
<p>The moment he stepped into the inner hall of the Luo Lucid Palace, the atmosphere changed suddenly. Taking a few steps forward, Yi Yun noticed the Luo Lucid Springs situated in the middle of the inner hall.</p>
<p>The Luo Lucid Springs was billowing with spring water, and above the pool, a pavilion carved in jade had been constructed. And on this pavilion, there were girls dressed in white who were dancing.</p>
<p>These girls were specially handpicked from the best in the world. They had Heaven Fey bloodlines, and their looks and figures were impeccable.</p>
<p>To be able to dance at the Luo Lucid Springs was also not a chance that any ordinary girl would receive.</p>
<p>At this moment, there were already quite a few people gathered by the sides of the Luo Lucid Springs. At a glance, there was no lack of young elites, but few elderly important figures had come.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know anyone, so he found a random seat, sat down and slowly began drinking tea.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun looked aloof, everything that happened around him was within his perception.</p>
<p>He realized that not far from the Luo Lucid Springs, there was a small teleportation array. It was surprising that it was built right inside Luo Lucid Palace.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the teleportation array suddenly lit up!</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone in the grand hall looked at the teleportation array. It had to be said that the Luo Lucid Palace was situated on the hundred-thousand-feet tall Luo Lucid Mountain. The journey from the foot of the mountain to its peak spanned a distance of dozens of miles. Other than members of the royal family, no one was permitted to fly in Luo Lucid Mountain. They could only walk up, so although warriors could traverse distances quickly, under the limitations of brisk walking, the journey up the mountain still took a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Although there was a teleportation array built in the Luo Lucid Palace, only people of certain stature could use it to enter the palace directly.</p>
<p>"Someone impressive is coming. I wonder who it is… "</p>
<p>People began discussing as the teleportation array flashed, and soon, two people appeared side by side in the teleportation array.</p>
<p>The person on the left was simply dressed in azure-color clothes. He looked like a mortal scholar, and no energy fluctuations could be felt from his body.</p>
<p>And the other person stood in stark contrast from the scholar. He was covered in silk clothes and jade. The fabric in his clothes was woven from priceless Rainbow Silk produced by Rainbow Celestial Silkworms. The pair of boots he wore were made of leather from top-grade Fey beasts. And just the cost of his clothes and boots added up was impossible to be bought without a few thousand World Stones. Many of the elites present may have been invited to the Luo Lucid Palace's banquet, but they were not necessarily as rich. Just the man's garb alone was worth more than the entire fortunes of a number of people.</p>
<p>The appearance of the duo immediately attracted the attention of all the elites present.</p>
<p>The duo, be it the silk-clothed youth or the azure-clothed scholar, exuded a natural air of nobleness. The heritage of ancient family clans in the Luo clan was manifested from their bearing.</p>
<p>"Donglin Yu! Ran Xueyi! Two of the four great young masters of the Luo clan royal capital!" Someone in the crowd identified them.</p>
<p>In the entire Luo clan royal capital, the people worthy enough to be given the title of one of the four great young masters were definitely the most outstanding figures amongst outstanding figures!</p>
<p>Donglin Yu came from the Donglin family clan, while Ran Xueyi came from the Xushui Ran clan. They were large family clans that ranked in the top ten family clans of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>The fiefs of these two family clans alone were about ten times the size of the Fire Cloud State!</p>
<p>The two family clans' ancestors had previously fought alongside the founding emperor of the Luo clan. They had achieved illustrious military merits, so after the Luo clan was established, they were each bestowed the titles of king and their lineage had persisted to present day. They were as ancient as the Luo clan's royal family.</p>
<p>Furthermore, be it the Donglin clan or the Xushui Ran clan, every generation would nurture large numbers of talents. Some would be given important positions in the royal capital, while others would be assigned to one of the 196 states to become an official of a state.</p>
<p>As for Donglin Yu and Ran Xueyi, they were considered to be two of the most outstanding juniors from the two family clans. For such large family clans, the juniors they paid the most attention to would be nurtured in their own family clans. If Ran Xueyi was compared to Ran Yu, the differences in their positions were like Heaven and Earth. There was no way to compare them.</p>
<p>"Brother Ran, please."</p>
<p>The scholarly-looking azure-clothed man stretched out his hand. He was Donglin Yu.</p>
<p>"Brother Donglin, please." The silk-clothed youth said in response.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's outfit was extravagant, but he did not give off an arrogant demeanor. Every action and word from him felt like a gentle spring breeze, he truly deserved his title as one of the four great young masters.</p>
<p>At this moment, a burly man with a livid face and large fangs walked up and led the silk-clothed youth to his seat.</p>
<p>Seeing the burly man, everyone shuddered in their hearts.</p>
<p>"Fey Demon!"</p>
<p>The Fey Demon race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was a mixed hybrid between Fey and Demon. They were few in number, but they had long lifespans. Their bodily strength was extremely terrifying and they were born warriors.</p>
<p>If a Fey Demon was trained into a loyal soldier, he would be the most valuable protective force of a family clan. This Fey Demon was one nurtured by the Xushui Ran clan, and he was a follower of Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>It was also obvious what sort of status that Ran Xueyi had for him to be able to bring a follower to attend the banquet.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi sat at one of the seats of honor, which was not located too far from Yi Yun. At this moment, the Fey Demon whispered into Ran Xueyi's ear. Ran Xueyi was chatting with Donglin Yu, but after hearing the Fey Demon's words, he stopped and he turned his head slightly as his gaze landed on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The teacup in Yi Yun's hand faltered for a moment before he continued sipping his tea slowly.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi…</p>
<p>Just from the name, Yi Yun knew the person's identity as well.</p>
<p>"Brother Ran, I heard something happened recently to your Xushui Ran clan. It appears as though one of your direct descendant's bloodline had been crippled."</p>
<p>The Fey Demon's whispers were not hidden from Donglin Yu, so Donglin Yu knew that the person that Ran Xueyi was looking at was Yi Yun.</p>
<p>A young disciple from the Fire Cloud State, even if he had obtained first in the collective training, was not someone that Donglin Yu would care too much for. If this was any other time, he would not have even given a glance.</p>
<p>However, this Fire Cloud State disciple had smacked the Xushui Ran clan in the face. It was a taboo for the bloodline of someone from an Ancient Fey family clan like the Xushui Ran clan to be crippled. The news of this small incident had proliferated.</p>
<p>Therefore, Donglin Yu had paid a bit of attention to Yi Yun, who dared to provoke the almighty family clan.</p>
<p>Such a person was usually rash and petulant. He might not understand how terrifying an ancient family clan was, and he had engaged in his reckless behavior because of his bit of talent. He was doomed to suffer sooner or later.</p>
<p>"I have incurred ridicule on myself, Brother Donglin. It had indeed happened. The disciple that had been crippled was one of the disciples that my Xushui Ran clan had assigned outside the family. The four Elders of my Xushui Ran clan have instructed me to simply teach him a lesson within the rules." Ran Xueyi said in a nonchalant manner.</p>
<p>He did not deliberately do so with a voice transmission. It made many people around him hear it.</p>
<p>They were secretly horrified at how Ran Xueyi truly disparaged Yi Yun. He had said such those words so casually, and it was unknown how far the so-called 'lesson' would go.</p>
<p>Chapter 859: Meeting Princess Purple Spirit</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously heard the sentence that everyone heard.</p>
<p>He glanced at Ran Xueyi, and quietly placed his teacup down.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not one to suffer silently. After being disparaged by someone in Luo Lucid Palace, he would not remain silent.</p>
<p>"Young master Ran, this lowly one wants to consult you wholeheartedly... what sort of lesson does Young master Ran plan on teaching this lowly one?" Yi Yun suddenly spoke out.</p>
<p>All the young elites present were taken aback as they immediately turned to look at Ran Xueyi and wait for his reply.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi lightly said, "My Xushui Ran clan will not go overboard in seeking revenge. It only feels that it's right that debts are paid and how murder is paid for with one's life. The lesson that you taught to Ran Yu will roughly be the same lesson I give to you."</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's words interested the surrounding young elites. This was no trifling matter. Yi Yun had crippled Ran Yu's bloodline, so Ran Yu's future was practically destroyed. The lesson that Ran Xueyi was planning to give Yi Yun was to cripple Yi Yun in the confines of the rules?</p>
<p>Such a lesson was tragic, but in the mouth of Ran Xueyi, it appeared as though it was nothing serious.</p>
<p>Just from Ran Xueyi's bearing, he did not exude a feeling of being overbearing, but the words he said were completely overbearing that ran deep into his bone.</p>
<p>"Oh? In that case, you, Ran Xueyi plan on crippling me. Very well. I, Yi Yun, will not go overboard in seeking revenge either. I too believe that it is only right that debts are paid and how murder is paid for with one's life. Whoever wants to cripple me, I will retaliate and might also cripple him."</p>
<p>What Yi Yun said was forceful as it echoed throughout the venue!</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded when they heard this. They had commented that Ran Xueyi was overbearing, but Yi Yun was even more overbearing. He had used the same words that Ran Xueyi had said to strike back at him.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi had made it difficult for Yi Yun in public because he disparaged Yi Yun, but it was because he had the Xushui Ran clan backing him. That was a large family clan ranked amongst the top ten in the Luo clan. Ran Xueyi's background was powerful enough, so no one dared to say a thing when he made such a declaration.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun dared to say something similar.</p>
<p>He was only a human, without any foundation in the Luo clan. Yet, he wanted to be belligerent against Ran Xueyi? What was he basing this on?</p>
<p>If Yi Yun was said to have great talent, Ran Xueyi too had heaven-defying talent. Ran Xueyi was on a completely different level to Ran Yu. No one knew if Yi Yun could compete with Ran Xueyi when it came to talent.</p>
<p>As for other aspects, there was no need to discuss them any further. In nearly every aspect, Yi Yun was left in the dust by Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's sword-like brows pricked up as the cold beam in his eyes shot at Yi Yun's body like an arrow. "What did you say? I didn't hear it clearly. What do you want to do to me?"</p>
<p>"I just said that whoever wants to cripple me, I'll retaliate, and I might also cripple him!" Yi Yun did not mind repeating again.</p>
<p>What he said was the standards of the martial world. If this was any other time, no one would find fault with it.</p>
<p>But in the present situation, if it were any other young elite present in Yi Yun's shoes, none of them would have the courage to say it.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi suddenly laughed out. "It's been a while since a peer dared to say such things to me. Yi Yun, you probably think that some results at the collective training, the appreciation of Empress Xuan, and the invitation to this Luo Lucid Springs banquet means you are one step closer to the upper echelons of the Luo clan. You probably think that my Xushui Ran clan is nothing impressive. You are truly naive." Ran Xueyi derided relentlessly.</p>
<p>He obviously knew that Yi Yun was Empress Xuan's person.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan had drawn in a batch of geniuses in order to let Princess Purple Spirit successfully ascend to the throne. However, it would be a joke to say that these geniuses had any higher status. To put it bluntly, they were just chess pieces.</p>
<p>"You just obtained first in a collective training, which was just a few tiny states in the larger picture, and you are already this overbearing. Those who aren't in the know might even think that you have obtained first place at the Luo Divine Hall trials! Furthermore, even if you were to obtain the first few spots in the Luo Divine Hall trials, so what? The Luo Divine Hall trials happen once every sixty years. In 60,000 years, there are a thousand of those, and you think that's impressive? What a frog in a well!"</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi drank his wine as he shook his head in disdain. He was not finished with his words, but everyone knew the meaning behind Ran Xueyi's words.</p>
<p>An ancient family clan like the Xushui Ran clan had existed for hundreds of millions of years!</p>
<p>In a hundred million years, the powerful family clans in the Luo clan had never changed.</p>
<p>And as for these young elites, there were numerous born, with numerous maturing and numerous dying!</p>
<p>In the history of time, they were already uncountable. Furthermore, the present Yi Yun was still not considered to be a genius of that level.</p>
<p>Compared to the a behemoth like the Xushui Ran clan that had existed for a hundred million years, it was just a joke.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Xueyi had no intention on arguing with Yi Yun any further.</p>
<p>With his stature, arguing with Yi Yun was only demeaning of his identity.</p>
<p>"Brother Donglin, let's continue drinking. There's no need to mind an ignoramus."</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's character was frank. Although he had argued with Yi Yun, it did not affect his drinking mood. He did not even put it at heart.</p>
<p>And indeed, he began drinking with Donglin Yu.</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone looked at Yi Yun as they broke out into a flurry of discussion.</p>
<p>Previously, Yi Yun's performance at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training was amazing, but at the Luo clan royal capital, there were few who knew about Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The Luo clan was just too big. Every clan would have their outstanding progenies, so Yi Yun was not worth paying any concern to. However, today, all of them got to know this young man.</p>
<p>A human, whose cultivation level was only at the early stages of the Heaven Ascension, had dared to enter into a conflict with the top scion of the Xushui Ran clan. This truly had the inkling of a rash move.</p>
<p>"That Yi Yun comes from the lower realm. He probably does not know the terror of a large family clan in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. To dare to make such impertinent remarks with a low cultivation level and zero background, he will suffer sooner or later."</p>
<p>"Background is just too important. Yi Yun can only be considered to have barely clung onto Empress Xuan. Maybe he was lucky and won some recognition."</p>
<p>People began to discuss privately with Yuan Qi voice transmissions. They were not discussing Yi Yun's talent, but his actions. It was inadvisable to be provocative or be unable to be submissive and keep a low profile when one was still lacking in cultivation levels.</p>
<p>At this moment…</p>
<p>A sharp call resounded above Luo Lucid Mountain. People looked up and they saw a gigantic divine bird that was tens of thousands of feet long.</p>
<p>This divine bird looked identical to the legendary Phoenix. Its feathers were all lit up in flames, as it shimmered with seven auspicious colors.</p>
<p>A aura that belonged to an Ancient Fey beast engulfed the vicinity. Even though the people present were elites of the Luo clan, they still felt shortness of breath when they suddenly experienced the Ancient Fey aura that blanketed them.</p>
<p>"It's a Phoenix Bird! Our Luo clan's top grade mount. It is a divine beast that can shuttle through the spatial storms in the sinkhole!"</p>
<p>The Phoenix Bird possessed the bloodline of the ancient Phoenix. Furthermore, its bloodline was extremely rich, and it could be said to be a living Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>There were only two Phoenix Birds in the entire Luo clan, and they were part of the royal family's mounts.</p>
<p>This Phoenix Bird was bestowed to Princess Purple Spirit by Emperor Luo as a mount. It also showed how much favor Princess Purple Spirit had from Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>"It's Princess Purple Spirit sacred mount's arrival!"</p>
<p>The young elites present immediately stood up, including Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu. Although they were the four great young masters of the royal capital, they were incomparable to Princess Purple Spirit, be it background, status or talent. They had arrived at Luo Lucid Palace through a teleportation array, which showed how much higher in status they were compared to other geniuses. However, Princess Purple Spirit traveled from her own palace to the Luo Lucid Mountain, which had a flight ban, on her Phoenix Bird.</p>
<p>As the Phoenix Bird circled the skies, a rainbow bridge fell from the Phoenix Bird's back. Twelve maid servants accompanied the crowned Princess Purple Spirit on her descent.</p>
<p>The air of nobleness that belonged to a royalty spread out at the same time.</p>
<p>"Paying our respects to Princess Purple Spirit!"</p>
<p>The elites present bowed in unison in an extremely respectful manner.</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit was eminent. Ignoring her position as one of the heirs to the throne, just taking ten thousand steps back, even if she failed at ascending to the throne, she would still have a bright future ahead of her.</p>
<p>Although it was inevitable that Empress Xuan would lose power, Princess Purple Spirit herself had exceptional talent. With the elderly Emperor Luo protecting her, it was not difficult for her to become a supreme figure.</p>
<p>A supreme figure, regardless if it was the Luo royalty, would have a sublime status in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>When everyone bowed, Yi Yun was somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>Yi Yun watched as Princess Purple Spirit descended from the sky. Even though he was mentally prepared, he was still unaccustomed when he truly saw the girl who had a screw loose and had previously accidentally exposed herself to him. She had transformed into an illustrious princess of the Luo clan, respected by billions of people.</p>
<p>This scene was too contrasting from before…</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Huo'er nonchalantly wave her hand at the elites to not stand on ceremony, her demure and elegant expression truly gave her the bearing of a princess. Was… was she still the same person?</p>
<p>"Stand up." Luo Huo'er said lightly. At this moment, Ran Xueyi came forward with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>"Your Highness, you are truly getting more and more beautiful."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was considered to be the best female elite in the entire royal capital, so Ran Xueyi naturally looked forward to being able to get closer to her. Even if he could be slightly closer to her while speaking, it would also be a great thing.</p>
<p>Of course, he was still maintaining the standard courtesies of a subject, so it was not offensive.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Ran Xueyi, who had came forward, slowly halted in his footsteps. He realized that the goddess, who had a high standing in his heart all this time, did not pay him any attention. At this moment, her beautiful eyes were looking straight at a corner of the grand hall, with eyes of disbelief.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi was taken aback. What was the princess looking at?</p>
<p>He could not help but look back and trace Princess Purple Spirit's gaze. As a result… he saw Yi Yun at the corner of the hall. Yi Yun had just put down his teacup. Others had came forward to show their respects at the arrival of Princess Purple Spirit, but he clearly appeared to be one step slower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he did not have a respectful expression on his face. Typical elites would bow their heads when they saw Princess Purple Spirit in a respectful manner. It was necessity as royal subjects.</p>
<p>Even Ran Xueyi did not dare look Luo Huo'er in the eye. As for Yi Yun, he was just standing there, blatantly staring at Luo Huo'er's face. And what was most infuriating was the odd expression on his face. It was as though the number one princess of the Luo Clan looked somewhat odd.</p>
<p>Chapter 860: Script Written in Vain</p>
<p>Was Yi Yun dumb? Why did he dare be that disrespectful to Princess Purple Spirit?</p>
<p>He was slower to pay his respects and he stared at Princess Purple Spirit. Furthermore, he even put on such an odd expression.</p>
<p>"To be so unaware of the rules, he is indeed a bumpkin from the lower realms." Ran Xueyi sneered in his heart. The elites present racked their heads to leave a good impression on Princess Purple Spirit, but Yi Yun was such a retard to act so eccentric. He had offended the princess.</p>
<p>For Princess Purple Spirit to produce such an impression, she had apparently been affronted by Yi Yun's actions. Other than that, Ran Xueyi could not think of any other possibility. If one were to say that Princess Purple Spirit had been attracted by this inferior human? That would be a joke.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi looked at Yi Yun with a faint smile, and he waited for him to make a fool of himself.</p>
<p>However, a single statement from Princess Purple Spirit completely froze the smile on Ran Xueyi's face.</p>
<p>"It's really you… You actually came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was truly feeling stumped after she saw Yi Yun.</p>
<p>She may have maintained a dignified and elegant composure on the surface, but deep in her heart, it was already being trampled by 10,000 Ancient Fey beasts with mud-stained hoofs.</p>
<p>What the heck was going on!?</p>
<p>She knew very well that more than a decade ago, Yi Yun was still a country bumpkin in a tiny area of a lower realm! Be it his strength or knowledge, there was no way that Yi Yun could advance past the limits of that world in every possible aspect. How did he come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven in such a short period of time alone, and had even obtained first place after being far in the lead at a collective training?</p>
<p>Being first place in a collective training wasn't much, but just thinking of where Yi Yun had his origins more than a decade ago was such a shocking realization!</p>
<p>His cultivation speed and his speed at nomological insight were way too fast. What sort of freakish talent was this to be able to reach such a state?</p>
<p>It sure was odd. This princess was clearly the genius with the most powerful Ancient Fey bloodline in the entire Luo clan and she also had exceptionally high perception. But why did she feel like she was being suppressed by this fellow the moment she saw him?</p>
<p>Back in the Tai Ah Divine City, Luo Huo'er's Desolate Heaven technique had been inferior to Yi Yun's. That could be ignored since her mother had prohibited her from using the techniques from the Luo clan. She could only use the Desolate Heaven techniques from the lower realm that she learned on short notice, so there was no way that her achievements reflected her true talent.</p>
<p>She could ignore the Desolate Heaven technique, but when Luo Huo'er was cultivating in a training chamber, Yi Yun had seen every part of her body. That was the most teeth-wrenching experience Luo Huo'er ever had.</p>
<p>Later on, Luo Huo'er had set a trap for the fellow, but for some reason, the trap somehow backfired on her!</p>
<p>Just recently, Luo Huo'er was still considering if she could ask her mother if she could make a trip to the lower realm and bring that bumpkin up to this world to broaden his horizons and let him know that the reason why she had lost to him was because she was not at all serious. If they had really come to blows, she would instantly crush him!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er would have loved to see Yi Yun's shocked expression when she brought him to the Luo clan's royal capital and see its grandeur and flourishing establishment. Especially when Yi Yun would learn that her identity was a princess of the highest identity in the royal capital, wouldn't he pay homage to her and offer to be her lackey?</p>
<p>But now… despite having written the script, without any rehearsals beginning, the show's curtains had come to a close.</p>
<p>This fellow had managed to climb up here himself!</p>
<p>How did he do that?</p>
<p>Especially after seeing the fellow's expression, Luo Huo'er really felt like her heart was being trampled by 10,000 Ancient Fey beasts with mud-stained hoofs. His odd expression was a result of a stifled laugh that he repressed because he did not want to embarrass her.</p>
<p>Clearly, her identity as a princess was already within Yi Yun's expectations. He had known of it early on!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er thought that Yi Yun would be astonished after learning of the matter and he would prostrate himself before her. In the end, not only did Yi Yun not prostrate himself, but he was also thinking of laughing!</p>
<p>Clearly, Yi Yun knew what sort of person Luo Huo'er was. At a glance, he knew that Luo Huo'er's elegance and dignity were faked to keep up an appearance.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er hated such banquets with numerous people the most. However, for her mother, she had to maintain her image and tolerate maintaining a front that she hated to do, but this fellow was actually mocking her!</p>
<p>It was infuriating!</p>
<p>Having been seen through, Luo Huo'er didn't even feel like acting any further. She forced herself to hold back on the urge to beat someone and she said to Yi Yun with a smile, "Yi Yun, it's really you. It's truly been long time no see."</p>
<p>Yi Yun stifled his urge to laugh and clasped his fists. He said with a straight face, "Yi Yun greets the Princess. It has been so many years. Meeting you today, Princess Purple Spirit is truly of unsurpassed beauty and glamorous."</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun's words were highly respectful, how could the smiling intent in his eyes escape Luo Huo'er? Clearly, this fellow did not show any signs of veneration because of her identity as princess.</p>
<p>Their conversation absolutely lacked the joy of a reunion that close friends should have after a long period of time. However, this conversation sounded completely different in the ears of others.</p>
<p>Every elite in the Luo clan, including Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu, was dumbfounded!</p>
<p>The princess knew this fellow, and… they appeared to be very familiar!</p>
<p>How was this possible? What sort of noble status did Princess Purple Spirit enjoy? How did she get to know a lowly human punk who lacked any form of background?</p>
<p>For Princess Purple Spirit to say the words 'long time no see' that bordered on affection, that meant that Yi Yun was a friend of Princess Purple Spirit!</p>
<p>A human had become Princess Purple Spirit's friend? That was unthinkable!</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Xueyi, who was standing beside Princess Purple Spirit, probably had the ugliest expression. Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er truly knew each other! Furthermore, Luo Huo'er apparently did not pursue Yi Yun's lack of etiquette.</p>
<p>In Ran Xueyi's impression, Princess Purple Spirit was always composed. But today, after meeting Yi Yun, there was a rare loss of her cool. Although it was not obvious, Ran Xueyi had managed to notice it because of his close distance. Princess Purple Spirit's eyes, which spoke volumes, had flashed a look of surprise and coquetry.</p>
<p>Who was this punk who could make Princess Purple Spirit experience such emotional swings?</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, sit at this table then!" Luo Huo'er pointed at a table and said with a 'cordial' expression.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the table, the corner of Ran Xueyi's mouth twitched. Donglin Yu also had a wry smile on his face.</p>
<p>This table was the closest table to Luo Huo'er's seat!</p>
<p>In Luo Lucid Springs, the arrangement of the tables was a fastidious show of political intrigue. The closer it was to the middle, the more noble the seat was. Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu were already considered close to the middle, but now, Yi Yun's seat was even closer than theirs!</p>
<p>How could Ran Xueyi feel pleasant about this?</p>
<p>He was one of the four great young masters of the royal capital. Yet, a human punk had come and sat at a spot more closer to the middle than his. It was even closer to Princess Purple Spirit! What the heck was this?</p>
<p>"Thank you Princess for conferring me a seat."</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not think too much of it and without standing on ceremony, he sat at the designated seat.</p>
<p>This immediately made all the young elites present envious.</p>
<p>They finally realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Princess Purple Spirit and the punk probably had an unusual relationship. Compared to Yi Yun, they were practically passers-by that did not matter. She did not even glance at them.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, they had been mocking Yi Yun for his presumptuous and foolish behavior of daring stand up against the Xushui Ran clan and Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, the people who were truly foolish were them.</p>
<p>Could it be… that Princess Purple Spirit was Yi Yun's backer!?</p>
<p>That would be ridiculous! If that fellow truly had a good relationship with Princess Purple Spirit, just that alone made him enjoy a background much better than many!</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun sit down, Luo Huo'er maintained a smile. On the surface, she did not look at Yi Yun anymore, but her voice transmission had rung in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>"Not bad, little Yun for you to have the ability to come here. You even got first place in the collective training. Your wings have indeed hardened. Come on, tell this elder sister of yours how you came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's words rendered Yi Yun somewhat speechless. Luo Huo'er wasn't young anymore, but she still insisted on gaining a sense of superiority when it came to words.</p>
<p>Chapter 861: Princess White Fox</p>
<p>"How else? Obviously I flew here." Yi Yun replied nonchalantly. He had experienced a great deal over the years in the Tian Yuan World, and the reason why he had matured so fast was because of obtaining heritage from the 12 Empyrean Heavens, as well as the Purple Crystal. They had vastly broadened Yi Yun's horizons. Without them, just having a fast cultivation speed alone was useless without pairing it with any cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>"Little Yun, how's the Tai Ah Divine City? What about our master, Grandmaster Yuehua?" Luo Huo'er recalled the desolate beast siege that happened years ago. She had left the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom back then as well, so she still cared about Grandmaster Yuehua and a few other people from the Tai Ah Divine City.</p>
<p>However, Luo Huo'er's identity was confidential back then, while the enemies of the Luo clan also had forces in the lower realms, so Luo Huo'er was forbidden from using powers that belonged to the Luo clan. She had almost never fought in the Tai Ah Divine City.</p>
<p>The only one time that Luo Huo'er violated the ban was to heal Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Back then, Yi Yun had used the Golden Crow totem that he had yet to fully master, resulting in the draining of all his strength and the injuring of his lifeblood in the midst of battle. Luo Huo'er had used a tiny portion of her Ancient Fey bloodline powers to help Yi Yun's bloodline recover in a few short seconds, allowing him to return to the battle arena.</p>
<p>Only Yi Yun knew about this.</p>
<p>Yi Yun transmitted his voice, "It's a long story. Grandmaster Yuehua and the Tai Ah Divine City Elders were eventually all safe and sound. Now, the Tian Yuan world is also peaceful."</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that Luo Huo'er might appear haughty and naughty, but she actually possessed a kind heart. If things were put on a scale, it would not be an exaggeration to describe the people from the Tai Ah Divine City as ants when they were compared to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>"That's good." Luo Huo'er cracked a smile. "Back then, I left in a hurry and I returned to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. I was embroiled in the war, where I had to run here and there. After a difficult victory, I was ensnared in this battle of the throne. It's so irritating." Luo Huo'er pouted her mouth as she said, like she were a melancholic kitten.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun saw Luo Huo'er saying it without much thought, he knew that there was definitely quite a bit of sadness behind her story. However, with Luo Huo'er's carefree personality, she did not take those things personally.</p>
<p>"You don't want the throne?" Yi Yun asked.</p>
<p>"Who needs it!?" Luo Huo'er grunted. However, she said sadly after thinking of something, "It's just that… Mother wants me to vie for it, so I have to. If Crimson Firmament ascends to the throne, Mother and I would be in quite a bad situation, especially Mother… If I am able to become a supreme figure, that would not have been a problem, but I am still many years from becoming one. And during this period, who knows if the Luo clan would break out into war again… "</p>
<p>The war that swept through the entire Luo clan more than ten years ago was won with great difficulty, but they had only managed to push the enemy back. Since they did not manage to completely wipe their enemy out, it was still very likely for the enemy to make a comeback. If the elderly Emperor Luo was still alive, that would be fine. But if he passed away, Prince Crimson Firmament might send Empress Xuan's family clan out to war as a sacrifice with his position as supreme commander in chief.</p>
<p>"The Luo clan's war… Who is your enemy?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun had been always hearing about the war that happened decades ago, which made the Luo clan suffer great losses. But up to now, Yi Yun was still unsure about the origins of the enemy.</p>
<p>"The enemy is the Fey Phantasm Sect, an extremely mighty force that pervades the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It is headquartered in the sinkhole, and it's rumored that the Fey Phantasm Sect possesses a complete, ice-sealed Ancient Fey corpse. Furthermore, it was a truly powerful Ancient Fey."</p>
<p>"A complete Ancient Fey corpse?" Yi Yun was slightly taken aback when he heard this. What sort of wealth did an entire Ancient Fey corpse represent? If one could obtain an entire Ancient Fey corpse, the opportunities were unimaginable.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the Fey Phantasm Sect was stronger than the Luo clan!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er seemed to guess Yi Yun's thoughts and said, "The Fey Phantasm Sect is stronger than our Luo clan. They declared war on several fronts, and our Luo clan's war is just one of the many. Back then, our Luo clan had also made an alliance with several other large clans in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven to fight the Fey Phantasm Sect together."</p>
<p>"The Fey Phantasm Sect enjoys great influence. It controls numerous Large Worlds, with countless subsidiaries. They refine Fey Demon puppets and sell them to large family clans for their usage. Many of the buyers come from other Empyrean Heavens."</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er spoke, a whistling sound of a soaring eagle shrieked. High in the sky, a gigantic azure Peng bird arrived.</p>
<p>The azure Peng bird circled in the sky and under the escort of pages, a purple-robed man flew straight down from the Peng bird. The man's clothes fluttered in the mountain winds, as purple aura circulated around him, it was as though a god had descended.</p>
<p>He looked like he was in his twenties, and his eyes were as bright as the stars. His lifeblood was converged, and he seemed to resonate with the Heaven and Earth. He gave off an redoubtable feeling.</p>
<p>"Prince Crimson Firmament!" The elites present said aloud when they saw the man that suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Even people like Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu stood up immediately at this moment to step forward.</p>
<p>He was Prince Crimson Firmament?</p>
<p>Upon seeing this person, Yi Yun was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament truly gave him an unfathomable feeling.</p>
<p>Indeed, Prince Crimson Firmament had been cultivating for thousands of years, so even without mentioning his talent, just his strength would far exceed Luo Huo'er's.</p>
<p>Beside Prince Crimson Firmament was a gorgeous woman.</p>
<p>She had smoky eyes and fair, creamy-white skin. She had a pair of fox ears on her head, and every action she performed seemed to produce silvery bolts that danced around her in a silvery brilliance.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this woman, the elites present were secretly horrified. Someone said, "It's the Lightning Domain's Princess White Fox. It was rumored that Princess White Fox and Prince Crimson Firmament have extremely cordial relations, but those were only rumors. Who knew that Princess White Fox is accompanying Prince Crimson Firmament to the banquet today? Don't tell me they are now an item, and are about to become Dao companions!?"</p>
<p>"The Lightning Domain's Princess White Fox has the Ancient Fey nine-tailed white fox's bloodline, as well as a Body of Lightning Spirit. If she is willing to become partners with Prince Crimson Firmament, it would truly be a match of equal status. The chips that Prince Crimson Firmament holds will increase as well!"</p>
<p>As people discussed it in private, they looked at Prince Crimson Firmament with mixed emotions amidst respect.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament himself was a treasure, with extremely promising chances of inheriting the throne of the Luo clan. In addition to his outstanding talent and powerful bloodline, if he were to marry Princess White Fox, a talented woman with a Body of Lightning Spirit and nine-tailed white fox bloodline, and duo cultivate with her, his life would reach its peak. Even Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu would feel jealous seeing this.</p>
<p>They were two of the royal capital's four great young masters and they were extremely noble, but compared to Prince Crimson Firmament, they were incomparable.</p>
<p>As Prince Crimson Firmament slowly landed, a phoenix shriek echoed throughout the skies as everyone looked up.</p>
<p>They saw nine azure luan birds soaring in the sky. They pulled a glittering chariot that emitted divine light that flashed through the sky.</p>
<p>As the divine chariot shuttled through the sky, the void slightly trembled as it excited the hearts of many.</p>
<p>On the divine chariot, Empress Luo and Empress Xuan, the two mothers of the world, women who had all the riches of the Luo clan in their hands, arrived simultaneously.</p>
<p>Instantly, a divine light burst out as thousands of colorful bands shot out. Dozens of Luo Lucid Palace's maid servants rushed forward and bowed to welcome the two sacred Empresses.</p>
<p>Chapter 862: Unconforming to the rules</p>
<p>The sacred Empress Luo was peerless in beauty, with captivating looks that were unique.</p>
<p>Empress Luo wore a nine phoenix hairpin and her long hair was coiled up, like a gloomy cloud in the sky. She wore a jade garment with an Ancient Fey beast embroidery on it. Her royal elegance truly came from the bone.</p>
<p>And beside her was Empress Xuan, who had a voluptuous figure, with skin no different to a sixteen-year-old girl. Age had forgotten to leave its marks on her face, accentuating her youthful looks and mature woman's charm on her body perfectly.</p>
<p>"Paying our respects to Your Majesty Empress Luo! Paying our respects to Your Majesty Empress Xuan!"</p>
<p>The maid servants and the young elites present bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>The two sacred Empresses walked to the seats of honor with Empress Luo on the right and Empress Xuan on the left. In the Luo clan, the right was associated with the seat of honor, so on this point, Empress Luo's status was slightly higher than Empress Xuan's.</p>
<p>"Xue'er, you came as well."</p>
<p>Empress Luo looked at Princess White Fox with an amiable and endearing smile. Clearly, she was very satisfied with Princess White Fox from the Lightning Domain. At the beginning of the banquet, she nodded and smiled to Princess White Fox, a treatment probably only reserved for daughter-in-laws.</p>
<p>"It appears as though Her Majesty Empress Luo is eager to have Prince Crimson Firmament marry Princess White Fox. If that's the case, Prince Crimson Firmament's position will be unshakable."</p>
<p>As people discussed it in private, they envied Prince Crimson Firmament for his good fortune in love affairs.</p>
<p>Empress Luo and Empress Xuan sat on the main seats of honor with Prince Crimson Firmament and Luo Huo'er sitting on the right and left respectively. Sitting near Prince Crimson Firmament was naturally Princess White Fox, but she was not sitting at the same table with Prince Crimson Firmament. Instead, she was sitting at a table beside the table of honor, and this was a distance away. From the looks of it, Princess White Fox had not fully accepted Prince Crimson Firmament. Hence, she did not want to appear too close to him at such an event.</p>
<p>This was nothing much, but on the other side…</p>
<p>Be it Empress Luo, Empress Xuan or Prince Crimson Firmament, they were somewhat taken aback when they saw the person sitting on the seat symmetrically across Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Sitting near Luo Huo'er was an ordinary youth, who looked very young. His cultivation level had just broken through to the early stages of the Heaven Ascension realm. Such a person could not have a long cultivation time that numbered about thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>And most bizarre of all was that he was a human.</p>
<p>Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Empress Xuan immediately thought about Yi Yun. Only this person matched the various features.</p>
<p>But why was Yi Yun sitting beside her daughter?</p>
<p>It was impossible that he had sat without understanding the rules. The waiters responsible at the banquet would not have sat idle if that was the case. Could it be that her daughter had invited him to sit there?</p>
<p>Although Empress Xuan found it surprising, she at least knew about Yi Yun's identity. But for Empress Luo, she did not even know Yi Yun's identity.</p>
<p>For a small figure like Yi Yun, although he had won first place at a collective training, it was insignificant in Empress Luo's eyes. However, she had paid him some attention because he was sitting beside Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Empress Luo noticed that Yi Yun's clothes were worthless, as though he did not have any background. Why would Luo Huo'er let such a person sit beside her? Furthermore, this was not any ordinary occasion. Every word and action of Luo Huo'er and Crimson Firmament would be recorded by the hall page and reported to Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>"Dear Firmament, who is this youth?" Empress Luo sent a voice transmission to Prince Crimson Firmament.</p>
<p>"Answering Mother, if this child isn't wrong, that person should be Yi Yun. He had obtained an outstanding performance at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training. He obtained the recognition of three Ancient Fey columns, with two of them at the Hibernation Awakening ranking. At Black Wind Valley, he captured the Intermediary Spirit Blood Snake and he is considered to be a talented human. He is in Sister Purple Spirit's camp, and he was recommended by Prince Pingnan."</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament informed her about Yi Yun's background and results in a few words, pleasing Empress Luo. Her son was meticulous, which made him a person capable of big matters. He knew every piece of information about a person, even if he was a minor character.</p>
<p>"Very good. You did well, but according to what you said, that Yi Yun isn't considered to be some blessed son of the heavens. He is just a young elite, so he's not even qualified to sit at where the two young fellows from the Ran and Donglin family are, much less beside Purple Spirit. That Purple Spirit is just too wilful."</p>
<p>Empress Luo shook her head secretly as she glanced at Donglin Yu and Ran Xueyi. They were sitting on seats at a lower level to Yi Yun, so when they saw Empress Luo glance at them, they immediately revealed embarrassed expressions. They probably knew what Empress Luo was looking at. They found it extremely embarrassing to sit beneath Yi Yun. However, this was sanctioned by Princess Purple Spirit, so what else could they say?</p>
<p>Empress Luo frowned slightly. For a princess of the Luo clan to be so enamored towards such a lowly human youth to sit beside her, it was not something that did not conform to the rules, but it would incur ridicule. Especially with Princess White Fox here, how would she think about Yi Yun sitting at a spot equivalent to hers?</p>
<p>"Mother, Sister Purple Spirit has always had a personality of lawlessness. Let her be. Even Father indulges her, so even if this small matter were to reach Father, he would not pay too much attention to it." Prince Crimson Firmament said with a tone filled with discontent with Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>Emperor Luo's favoritism was no secret. If not for his favoritism towards Princess Purple Spirit, wouldn't the throne be firmly in Crimson Firmament's grasps?</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if she's willful, it's not like we are disgracing ourselves." Empress Luo transmitted her voice to Prince Crimson Firmament and glanced at Empress Xuan, while a faint smile suffused across her lips.</p>
<p>Her son, Prince Crimson Firmament had brought Princess White Fox, and they were sitting along the main seats with her.</p>
<p>Look at your daughter. What sort of person is she sitting with? What a disgrace.</p>
<p>"Alright, all of our esteemed young elites, I held this banquet and invited all of you here as a welcome. I wish that everyone will be able to make a difference at the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials, and bring a more brilliant future to our Luo clan."</p>
<p>As the host of the banquet, Empress Luo had to give a speech. As for Yi Yun, she quickly ignored him.</p>
<p>Everyone lifted their cups for a toast. Yi Yun did so too, and he drank the fragrant spiritual wine. It was unknown how the wine was brewed, because not only was the taste excellent, it also made his entire body warm up, and he could even feel his lifeblood strengthen.</p>
<p>It was good wine that was probably extremely pricey. And the food placed in front of him was all sorts of treasured materials. Eating them was beneficial for his cultivation level and lifeblood.</p>
<p>Yi Yun estimated that just this small table of dishes would cost a few hundred, if not a few thousand World Stones.</p>
<p>Thinking back of the painful expression that Lie Ya had when he had to produce more than a hundred World Stones, Yi Yun felt that he did not waste time coming to this banquet.</p>
<p>Although he had the Purple Crystal, he was not wealthy. Since he was at this banquet, he had came with the mentality that he would not suffer any losses. He would not miss out on delicious foods and drink. Hence, these spiritual wine and food quickly entered Yi Yun's stomach.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun eat carefreely, Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu were impressed. How bold are you? Didn't you noticed that Empress Luo had paid you attention a while ago? Don't you feel that sitting at the third highest level in the middle is like sitting on a cushion of needles?</p>
<p>Chapter 863: Show of Strength</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu both felt that if they sat in such a striking location, especially if they were beside Luo Huo'er, they would only sit on a third of their seats, and they would sit with an extremely straight back. They would try their best not to get any food, and if they ate, it would just be a tiny portion. They would not reveal their teeth while eating or make a sound while chewing. If they drank any wine, they would hold the cup with two hands, and drink respectfully. Furthermore, if the Empresses did not hold a wine cup, they would not touch theirs.</p>
<p>But looking at Yi Yun, he was practically invincible. He was gulping food down by the mouthfuls. Whatever dish looked the most exquisite or had the richest Yuan Qi would be eaten. As for wine… it was as though he was afraid of choking on eating too much. He drank as he ate, using the wine to wash the food down.</p>
<p>This was truly… the perfect display of a a bumpkin's characteristics.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Empress Luo's self-restraint was good. Despite there being a human punk, who obviously did not know the rules while sitting there, causing a scene, she could turn a blind eye towards it.</p>
<p>"Little Yun, are you the reincarnation of a starving ghost? Why are you eating so fast?"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was amused by Yi Yun's actions and she wanted to laugh., But on the surface, she maintained her elegant and luxurious appearance.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er detested such occasions greatly. It was too boring, and she had to constantly pay attention to etiquette. It was much better to chat with Yi Yun to amuse herself.</p>
<p>"Since Empress Luo is treating us, and she's your arch-enemy and she has put out so much good spiritual food, I might as well eat them. It's not like I'll lose out." Yi Yun sent a voice transmission as though it was for granted.</p>
<p>His tone clearly did not show any fear or respect for Empress Luo.</p>
<p>"Hehe, if you have the ability to eat her broke, that would be great! I'm telling you, don't look at that old witch appearing as though she's some mother of the world, she's actually bad to the bone."</p>
<p>In the royal palace, Luo Huo'er were restrained in various ways, so she did not dare to talk nonsense. Now, she had finally encountered a friend, so Luo Huo'er had no scruples in the way she spoke.</p>
<p>Previously, Luo Huo'er had encountered many people who were extremely respectful to Empress Luo, Empress Xuan and herself. They were so subservient that they wished that their eyes would grow on the ground and their backs were as bent as a shrimp. Luo Huo'er found Yi Yun, a person who did not care about rules just like her, very fun as though she had found a confidant.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er began chatting through Yuan Qi voice transmissions, the banquet was not going very harmoniously on the other side.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan knew Empress Luo's goal of hosting this banquet very well. She wanted to display her strength and make the young elites participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials know who was the true mother of the Luo clan. As such, more and more young elites would choose to join Empress Luo's clan and turn their backs on Empress Xuan.</p>
<p>"I heard that Younger Sister brought quite a number of people from your family to participate in our Luo clan's Luo Divine Hall trials. Especially that Xuan Junyue, I heard that he is the best in the present Xuan family generation. Why don't I see dear nephew Junyue? I remembered sending him an invitation as well." Empress Luo suddenly said to Empress Xuan.</p>
<p>Although her voice was not loud, everyone present could hear her clearly.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue was an influential figure amongst the younger generation of the Xuan family. Compared to Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu, his reputation exceeded theirs. He was not ranked as one of the four great young masters of the royal capital because the Xuan family was not located in the royal capital.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan smiled and said, "Junyue is still in reclusive training and he will not take a step out of the door for the next few days. He's making preparations for the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>Empress Xuan found an excuse to deflect the question. Xuan Junyue obviously wasn't in reclusive training. Back then, he had gone to Luo Huo'er's palace and passed news to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>However, Empress Xuan would not let Xuan Junyue participate in the banquet hosted by Empress Luo. This was because Empress Xuan knew very well that Empress Luo wanted to show a display of strength at the banquet, and she would very likely begin with Xuan Junyue as one of her victims.</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue was the best genius in the Xuan family, and he was considered one of their highlighting banners. If Empress Luo were to target Xuan Junyue at the banquet, Empress Xuan's camp would suffer a massive loss of reputation if Xuan Junyue were to lose.</p>
<p>Before the Luo Divine Hall trials, Empress Xuan could not afford to lose anything.</p>
<p>By appearing weaker than they did, and avoiding battle, it was much better than losing directly.</p>
<p>"Reclusive training? I think that Brother Junyue did not come because he is afraid?" At this moment, a loud voice resounded.</p>
<p>Everyone turned their heads in alarm and they looked at the person who said it. The person was sitting one level lower than Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>That seat was almost equivalent to Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu, and it was considered a very noble seat.</p>
<p>Two people sat at the table, a man and a woman. The woman had a petite figure that looked like a child's, while the man was youthful, muscular and stout. He wore red battle armor, and his voice sounded like the beat of a drum, with bold undertones.</p>
<p>The person who had openly mocked Xuan Junyue was this burly youth!</p>
<p>Empress Xuan frowned. With the status she enjoyed, how could she let a junior show her disrespect at this banquet?</p>
<p>However, before Empress Xuan spoke a word, Empress Luo had already opened her mouth and rebuked the person in question, "Luo Kui, I'm speaking with Empress Xuan, there's no reason for you to interject!"</p>
<p>Empress Luo's voice sounded harsh and she was faster than Empress Xuan. Her statement sounded like she was rebuking Luo Kui, but in fact, it was to shut Empress Xuan up.</p>
<p>Being rebuked wasn't the loss of a piece of meat after all. It might even be possible that Luo Kui had said that statement as a mouthpiece of Empress Luo.</p>
<p>As the host, she could not say certain things. There was no fault in letting a rash and reckless junior say such words, but it still managed to achieve the effect of smacking Empress Xuan in the face.</p>
<p>The young elites present immediately felt that the banquet was beginning to be filled with the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>Indeed, Empress Luo and Empress Xuan were arch-enemies. How was it possible for them to exist peacefully at a banquet?</p>
<p>However, Empress Xuan had been calculative, and deliberately prevented Xuan Junyue from attending to evade any adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Although this was a smart move, Empress Xuan had already practically lost to Empress Luo by a notch.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wiped his mouth and glanced at Luo Kui. His cultivation level was at the perfected Heaven Ascension realm.</p>
<p>He had a deep Yuan Qi foundation and a tremendous bloodline. His strength was unfathomable.</p>
<p>That was the evaluation Yi Yun gave him.</p>
<p>"The Xuan Junyue that was mentioned can't beat that big guy?" Yi Yun asked Luo Huo'er with a voice transmission.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er grunted and said, "It's not certain that he can't beat him, but the number of people behind me and Mother are few in number. The best one is Xuan Junyue. However, Empress Luo has many more people on her side. The Luo Kui you see is just one of them. If we were really to go at odds, we will definitely lose out."</p>
<p>"I see." Yi Yun understood that as the saying goes, two fists had difficulty overcoming four hands. Having more people was always advantageous. Empress Xuan and Luo Huo'er's foundations were just too weak after all. "Are you telling me that Empress Luo will use this banquet to demonstrate a show of strength to us disciples who are joining the Luo Divine Hall trials, so that we will join her camp?"</p>
<p>"That's right. That witch sure did her calculations!"</p>
<p>"How would the competition work? We can't just fight here in the banquet, right?" Yi Yun was somewhat curious. There was not much space in the middle of the banquet hall, so if there was a fight, it would make the banquet hall a mess.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. It might be a display of tricks in other aspects, showing the best of your skills, or whatever things that can add a bit of interest to the banquet. If it really came to blows, it would just be unbecoming. Why… don't tell me you want to compete with that big guy?" Luo Huo'er asked with a grin.</p>
<p>But Yi Yun shook his head, "I might not be able to beat that big guy."</p>
<p>The opponent was at the perfected Heaven Ascension realm, while Yi Yun had just entered the beginning stages of the Heaven Ascension realm. The Luo clan royal capital was filled with geniuses. Although Yi Yun was confident of himself, he was not certain that he could leapfrog such a vast difference in cultivation level and defeat a young elite from the cream of the crop of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>He did not know what tricks Luo Kui had at all.</p>
<p>The other side had come prepared, and if he did things on a whim, he would likely suffer if things came to blows.</p>
<p>"Hehehe, you are rather calm. Little Yun, I know you took first place at the Mt. Azure Billow trials. To have such an achievement, you must have encountered some interesting events in the lower realm, right? But compared to the geniuses in the royal capital, the Fire Cloud State and Phoenix Firmiana State don't compare to much. Many of them are truly formidable! You are so many subrealms weaker than him, and you want to beat him? Difficult! And taking ten thousand steps back, even if you were to beat him, he has partners. Are you going to beat a dozen of them by yourself? Look at that petite girl. Her name is Luo Xiaodie, and she is also one who is not to be trifled with!"</p>
<p>Chapter 864: You are a Cheat</p>
<p>"Luo Xiaodie, Luo Kui… "</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the man and woman, whose physiques were highly disparate. According to what Luo Huo'er said, Empress Luo had many geniuses under her. Luo Xiaodie and Luo Kui were only two of many.</p>
<p>In a sense, Empress Luo's banquet had achieved the effect of displaying a show of force. Empress Xuan was inferior to her in every single way.</p>
<p>However, Empress Luo was not satisfied with this. Empress Xuan had deliberately avoided any conflict at the banquet by not bringing the Xuan family geniuses. This made Empress Luo feel like she was punching into cotton, it did not feel effective.</p>
<p>"Without Xuan Junyue here, it sure is boring!" Luo Kui said in an unruly manner, his voice echoing throughout the venue.</p>
<p>The impression that Luo Kui gave others was that he was an uninhibited boor. And he was apparently using this to deliberately say things that were out of line. He had challenged Empress Xuan's bottom line again and again.</p>
<p>As Empress Luo ate some grapes, a smile hung on her face. She did not have any intentions of reprimanding Luo Kui.</p>
<p>Luo Kui felt as though he had been encouraged. Standing up from his seat, he cupped his hands and said to everyone, "Everyone, if it's just eating and drinking, it might be somewhat boring. Let me add some excitement for everyone."</p>
<p>After Luo Kui said this, he swept his gaze across the young elites on Empress Xuan's side. Although there were quite a number of young elites clearly on Empress Xuan's side, for example, Yi Yun, Gu Qing, Ling Wu, etc, Luo Kui could not call them out to thrash them. This was because the result of using them as targets was highly ineffective. Take Yi Yun for example, he was only at the beginning stages of the Heaven Ascension realm. Even if Luo Kui thrashed him, there would not be any sense of accomplishment. Instead, he might be rebuked as being a bully.</p>
<p>However, if he did not thrash these people, there was truly no one on Empress Xuan's side either.</p>
<p>Luo Kui stroked his chin and as his gaze swept across the banquet hall, it ended up on Luo Huo'er. Immediately following that, a smile suffused across his lips.</p>
<p>"Your Highness! It was said that Your Highness' attainments in fire-elemental laws are matchless and Your Highness is well-versed in the Desolate Heaven technique. No peer your own age can match you. This lowly one has recently been researching fire-elemental laws and the Desolate Heaven technique and he is very interested in these aspects. However, this lowly one isn't very well-versed at its practical effects. Will it be possible for Your Highness to give some advice?"</p>
<p>When Luo Kui said this, everyone in the audience was stunned.</p>
<p>Luo Kui may be asking for advice, but if Luo Huo'er were to accede to his request, he might do something nasty during the 'advice-giving'. If that was the case, it would no longer be a simple problem of 'advice-giving'!</p>
<p>What sort of identity did Luo Huo'er enjoy!? It was unexpected that Luo Kui would target Luo Huo'er after failing to find a target to thrash. This was practically him being lawless!</p>
<p>Indeed, Empress Xuan's expression had already sunk.</p>
<p>She came knowing that Empress Luo would flaunt her power, and she had tolerated this repeatedly. However, it was unexpected that Empress Luo had set her sights on Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>For a princess of the country to compete with a boor like Luo Kui, it would be a sully to Luo Huo'er's reputation regardless of the outcome!</p>
<p>Actually, if it was just the Desolate Heaven technique, Empress Xuan believed that Luo Huo'er would win. However, it was most likely that Luo Kui was just a probe. After beating Luo Kui, it was certain that a better person would replace him. If Luo Huo'er accepted Luo Kui's challenge but did not accept the match after his, it would not prevent others from thinking that Luo Huo'er feared the challenge because she was feeling unconfident of herself.</p>
<p>At this moment, Crimson Firmament said with a smile, "It is good for young people to desire to do better. Princess Purple Spirit is a person of a kindly disposition and it is well known for her love of talents. If you sincerely ask for her advice, she would definitely not hesitate to advise you."</p>
<p>Crimson Firmament's words were equivalent to acknowledging Luo Kui's sudden thought. People had the belief that Empress Luo was only planned on suppressing the young elites on Empress Xuan's side, but they never expected that they were planning on sullying Princess Purple Spirit's good name!</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er spoke with a sneer as she looked at Luo Kui. "Luo Kui, have you been conferred nobility?"</p>
<p>Facing Luo Huo'er's question, Luo Kui failed to answer immediately. Amongst the younger generation of the Fey race, his background was definitely not bad. He was from the Cloud Sun Luo clan, so although it was inferior to Luo Huo'er, it was still one of the top twenty factions in the Luo clan. Compared to Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu, he was not one bit inferior. However, Luo Huo'er had deliberately avoided Luo Kui's background and she instead pointed out his lack of nobility.</p>
<p>Descendants of a noble family could easily enjoy a life of luxury, but if they wanted to be conferred nobility, they needed to accomplish actual meritorious achievements for the country!</p>
<p>Luo Kui was still young, so how could he have any merits whatsoever. He was not conferred nobility, but for Luo Huo'er, as an heir to the throne, she had already been conferred the title of royalty!</p>
<p>The difference in their background may be small, but the gap in their nobility ranks was huge!</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er hit Luo Kui on a soft spot, his expression turned ugly. He said with a muffled and unhappy voice, "This lowly one's status is humble. According to the rules, there is truly no right to receive advice from Your Highness. However, rules are not absolute at times... For example, at this banquet, aren't the seats also not determined according to the rules?"</p>
<p>When Luo Kui said this, everyone's eyes could not help but drift towards Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had rebuked Luo Kui for not abiding the rules, but Luo Kui had struck back while keeping his countenance. Indeed, it was out of line for Luo Huo'er to allow Yi Yun to sit beside her.</p>
<p>"This brother, you truly have a good appetite." Luo Kui said with a faint smile as he looked at the spiritual food that had been reduced to a large bone pile in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not expect that the arrows of conflict to suddenly shift back to him.</p>
<p>"I wonder which family clan does this brother come from and if he has a noble title?" He had knowingly asked the question.</p>
<p>Many people under Empress Luo's camp looked at Yi Yun and they waited for him to make a fool of himself. However, they failed to see any look of distress on Yi Yun's face. Yi Yun pulled out a snow-silk satin napkin from the table and he began slowly wiping his mouth. "This lowly one comes from a countryside in the lower realm. As for my background… my ancestors are all farmers."</p>
<p>Yi Yun's response made everyone's eyes nearly pop out. Even Empress Xuan's people, such as Ling Wu and Gu Qing, were impressed at Yi Yun's nerves. If anyone was squeezed in such a way, one would typically hope to hide away. Yet, he had been able to answer in all seriousness.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" Luo Kui laughed out loud. "Brother, you sure are 'simple'. Brother, you must have gotten to know Princess Purple Spirit in the lower realm. Her Highness is truly considerate and kind to men of talent, considering how she has given such a privilege to a human from the lower realm."</p>
<p>When Luo Kui said this, everyone was enlightened. So this fellow had gotten to know Princess Purple Spirit back in the lower realm. Princess Purple Spirit was surely immature. How could she favor a fellow that she got to know in the lower realm?</p>
<p>Empress Luo glanced at Empress Xuan as a teasing smile suffused across her lips. Although she did not believe that the extremely lofty-minded Luo Huo'er would fall in love with Yi Yun, if she were to embellish the story and report it to Emperor Luo, Empress Luo would definitely feel furious even if he was fond of Luo Huo'er. This would be shameful for the royal family.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had just wiped his mouth and used a snow-silk satin napkin to wipe clean his hands. Then he threw the napkin down and said, "I learned a bit of the Desolate Heaven technique in the lower realm. I had received five or six months worth of education in the Desolate Heaven technique with Princess Purple Spirit, so I can be considered to have a tiny bit of success in it."</p>
<p>"Didn't you wish for Princess Purple Spirit to give you advice on the Desolate Heaven technique? You already said that you just began researching on the Desolate Heaven technique, and I guess that your standard can't be that high. You might not even be up to my level. If you were to directly get Princess Purple Spirit to give you advice, I'm afraid that you wouldn't be able to comprehend it. Why not I give you some advice?"</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said this, everyone present was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Even Empress Luo was somewhat stunned, much less Luo Kui.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's words were filled with information. They also knew that Yi Yun had come in first place at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training. With Yi Yun's background, it was already astounding to have such an achievement.</p>
<p>But… Yi Yun also knew the Desolate Heaven technique!?</p>
<p>"Five or six months worth of education in the Desolate Heaven technique"?</p>
<p>"Considered to have a tiny bit of success"?</p>
<p>The Desolate Heaven technique was intricate and profound. Without a few decades of hard work, it was impossible to have any success! Yi Yun was obviously bragging!</p>
<p>But if it was said that Yi Yun had been exposed to the Desolate Heaven technique for decades, it was also impossible. He was a warrior from the lower realm, with a bone age of less than forty. Martial arts would have taken a great deal of his time, so how could he spare the time to study the Desolate Heaven technique?</p>
<p>"Little Yun, what are you saying?" At this moment, Luo Huo'er's Yuan Qi voice transmission reverberated in Yi Yun's ear. "Little Yun, I know that you have some talent in the Desolate Heaven technique, but you do not know that the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique is the best in all of the 12 Empyrean Heavens. It's completely different to the Desolate Heaven technique from the lower realm. Be it technique or hand seals, all the methods are different! After coming to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, have you learned the Desolate Heaven technique from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head. He obviously understood the rationale behind Luo Huo'er's words. Although Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal, the time he spent learning the Desolate Heaven technique was too short. Even in the lower realm, the time he spent learning the Desolate Heaven technique was counted in months, much less while he was in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" Luo Kui suddenly burst out into laughter. "What did you say? Did you want to advise me? That's interesting. I had just nonchalantly mentioned that I'm a beginner at the Desolate Heaven technique, and a person like you who has only studied the Desolate Heaven technique for five or six months jumped out to advise me? A godly person like you has actually gained the favor of Her Highness? Are you not a cheat? You have used Her Highness' consideration of men of talent to fool her!" Luo Kui derided relentlessly.</p>
<p>He did not dare to insult Princess Purple Spirit, but he had no scruple when it came to Yi Yun. Regardless if Yi Yun had deceived Princess Purple Spirit or not, mocking Yi Yun would be equivalent to sullying Princess Purple Spirit's reputation.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had already stood up.</p>
<p>Luo Kui gave Yi Yun a contemptuous look. He was ambitious and he belittled the geniuses present. He could only make a name for himself by trampling on the high and mighty princess. By aiding Prince Crimson Firmament in ascending to the throne, he would eventually be conferred nobility.</p>
<p>But at this point, he could not even trample on a princess, but a small fry had come courting death.</p>
<p>Luo Kui had been cultivating for eighty years and he had studied the Desolate Heaven technique for more than a decade. He had definitely come prepared! Even if he met Luo Huo'er, he was confident that he could match her.</p>
<p>There were many people present who knew of Luo Kui's background. As they looked at Yi Yun, they shook their heads. This was all a farce.</p>
<p>Seeing how this matter could no longer be prevented, Luo Huo'er's lips quivered. She eventually chose to remain silent. She understood Yi Yun. She knew that Yi Yun would often do unexpected things. Previously in the Tai Ah Divine City, Luo Huo'er had believed that she would definitely triumph over him, but she always ended up suffering.</p>
<p>But this time, Luo Huo'er had no idea how Yi Yun was going to beat Luo Kui.</p>
<p>Chapter 865: Eclipse Cauldron versus Desolate Heaven Technique Disk Array</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Kui had already taken out his treasured cauldron. It was three feet high and as it spun mid-air, Luo Kui's crossed his arms on his chest. He gave Yi Yun a haughty look and said, "Come on, I'm waiting for whatever you can teach!"</p>
<p>Luo Kui's treasured cauldron was made of an unknown metal. There were all sorts of patterns carved on it, making it look primitively simple.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Luo Kui's cauldron and he felt that it had to be worth a fortune.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique was not only different to the technique from the lower realms, even the tools used were completely different. In the Tian Yuan world, most Desolate Heaven techniques used disk arrays, not cauldrons.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Luo Kui's cauldron was more advanced than the Tian Yuan world's disk arrays.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at my Eclipse Cauldron? Are you scared silly from the ancient aura of the Eclipse Cauldron?" Luo Kui laughed.</p>
<p>The Eclipse Cauldron was an ancient Desolate Heaven Cauldron found in a ruin. It might not be famous in the Luo clan, but if it was placed in an auction, it was definitely an ancient treasure worth vying for.</p>
<p>Despite many of the young elites present not knowing the Desolate Heaven technique, they could tell from its aura that the Eclipse Cauldron was no ordinary item.</p>
<p>Yi Yun ignored Luo Kui. All he did was slowly take out a Desolate Heaven technique disk array.</p>
<p>It was a one-foot square disk array that came from the Tian Yuan world. It looked dusty and simple, and it was completely nondescript.</p>
<p>And in fact, the disk array was consistent in and out. Its quality was indeed nothing to speak of.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not a professional Desolate Heaven Master after all. Although he brought a disk array used by Desolate Heaven Master with him, the disk array would not have been considered something impressive in the lower realm. In the 12 Empyrean Heavens, it would only appear even worse.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun take out a Desolate Heaven technique disk array, Luo Kui was dumbfounded. This punk actually took such a joke of an item to compete with him?</p>
<p>Just the runic patterns carved on the disk array were not worth mentioning. It was not even enough to describe it as a heaven and earth difference. It was like two warrior sparring. One was using a divine weapon, while the other was using a kitchen knife. What's the point of fighting?</p>
<p>Empress Xuan also began to frown slightly at this moment. She had believed that in such an important occasion, Yi Yun definitely had something to rely on and he would not have pushed his face forward to be slapped.</p>
<p>Hence, Empress Xuan still had the illusion of hope, wishing that Yi Yun was truly a Desolate Heaven technique genius, allowing him to compete with Luo Kui with his lower realm background and his bone age of less than forty. But now, Yi Yun had taken out such a disk array that could enter the annals of wonders. He would only be able to demonstrate 30% of his full prowess.</p>
<p>She could not help but ask, "Yi Yun, don't you have a desolate heaven cauldron? I can bestow one to you."</p>
<p>Yi Yun was from a lower realm, so it was normal for him to lack a desolate heaven cauldron. However, Empress Xuan never expected that Yi Yun would shake his head and say, "Thank you Your Majesty for bestowing a reward to me. Unfortunately, this lowly one has never used a desolate heaven cauldron, nor does this lowly one understand the mysteries within them. This lowly one will probably take a period of time to learn it, so it's more handy to use a disk array."</p>
<p>What Yi Yun said was the truth. Regardless of how good his perception was, he did not dare to claim that he could immediately use a desolate heaven cauldron without any practice.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun saying this, all the young elites present were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Could Yi Yun not have been exposed to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique? He was planning on using the lower realm's Desolate Heaven technique to thrash Luo Kui?</p>
<p>Luo Kui stared at Yi Yun. Damn it, is this kid here to amuse him?</p>
<p>He felt that Yi Yun must have studied the Desolate Heaven technique in the lower realm and believed that he had matchless talent. Yi Yun must not be aware of how terrifying the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique was. Competing with such a retard was a lowering of his posturing. It was rather meaningless to win.</p>
<p>He planned on trampling a princess, but he only managed to step on dog shit. Luo Kui did not even have the mood for this competition.</p>
<p>"Let's quickly begin. What bad luck!" Luo Kui said impatiently.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, a Fey beast bone was thrown into Yi Yun's hand.</p>
<p>"Come, 'advise' me. A third-grade Fey bone, I want to see what you can come up with."</p>
<p>Yi Yun flipped the Fey bone in his hand and said nonchalantly, "Just one Fey bone? Is there no spare?"</p>
<p>This Fey bone's quality obviously surpassed the ones from the lower realm. However, it was not too much an exaggeration. With Yi Yun's Desolate Heaven technique standard and the Purple Crystal's help, refining such a Fey bone was not difficult.</p>
<p>"No!" Luo Kui sneered and said, "You don't even have the confidence to refine a third-grade Fey bone in one shot. If your standard is this good, how can you be worthy to advise me?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled and no longer spoke. He threw the Fey bone into the desolate heaven technique disk array and he began to activate its runic patterns.</p>
<p>Immediately, the runic patterns lit up. Yi Yun began to routinely form hand seals. The seals he formed were all ones that Su Jie taught him back in the lower realm.</p>
<p>The Tian Yuan world's desolate beast and the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Fey beasts were similar. Yi Yun speculated that it might have been possible that the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Fey beasts had somehow gone to the lower realm and began breeding with the wild beasts in the lower realms, eventually forming desolate beasts. Hence, the techniques that Su Jie taught him could similarly be used while refining a Fey bone.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of a professional, these techniques were downright trash. It was just too simple. It was like a group of scholars attending an imperial examination turning back to see a child who had just began reading... a child who had been home-schooled to memorize the 'Three Character Classic'. With this standard, he even had the nerve to say that he knew the Desolate Heaven technique?</p>
<p>Luo Kui was infuriated just looking at Yi Yun's clumsy performance.</p>
<p>This guy was truly an extremely ignorant hick!</p>
<p>He had believed that Yi Yun had something backing him for him to dare jump out, and he was still feeling afraid of failing miserably at an easy task.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun was beginning to refine the Fey bone. The hand seals he used were lousy, and the seals he formed didn't make sense. He found his original thoughts laughable considering what Yi Yun was using to back himself.</p>
<p>With Luo Kui's own experience, he could instantly judge that the relics refined by Yi Yun would be in the poor grade at best. This was determined from the hand seals that Yi Yun formed. It was impossible for it to be higher.</p>
<p>And for the same relic, if Luo Kui were to refine it, it would at least reach the 'refined' grade, or even approach the 'outstanding' grade!</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, relics of the same grade would be ranked based on the outcome of the refinement, and they went from poor, ordinary, refined, outstanding, excellent, to spiritual emergence!</p>
<p>The outstanding grade was the limit for a low-grade relic. As for 'excellent' and 'spiritual emergence', that was an evaluation reserved only for high-grade relics.</p>
<p>Luo Kui wanted to be able to produce an outstanding third-grade relic at the banquet and astound everyone. But thinking about it, it was truly too difficult.</p>
<p>As Luo Kui was thinking, Yi Yun suddenly spoke. "Aren't you beginning?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun could speak to him while he was refining a relic?</p>
<p>Luo Kui was taken aback momentarily. However, he brushed it off immediately. The lower realm's techniques might be too simple, so it made it possible for him to speak while refining. He could even produce three cauldrons of relics and refine them at one go with such a lowly technique.</p>
<p>"It looks like you think you aren't dying fast enough. If that's the case, let me show you what the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique is!"</p>
<p>Chapter 866: A Free Win?</p>
<p>Luo Kui began. Although his opponent was trash, Luo Kui planned on doing his best. There was no meaning in thrashing Yi Yun. Now, he was in the pursuit of refining a relic that was nearing the outstanding grade, so he could astound everyone present.</p>
<p>Luo Kui threw the Fey bone into the Eclipse Cauldron and he extracted all the energy in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Luo Kui's body began to burn with blue flames, and behind him, a gigantic, thousand-feet blue centipede shot towards the sky!</p>
<p>This centipede was more than a hundred feet tall as it charged straight for the ceiling.</p>
<p>The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede was Luo Kui's bloodline. After it appeared, it shot towards Luo Kui's Eclipse Cauldron!</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>Everyone was alarmed. Luo Kui was planning to refine his Ancient Fey bloodline with the Fey bone?</p>
<p>Although everyone knew that it was impossible for Luo Kui to damage his Ancient Fey bloodline to refine a single relic, it was still a stunning sight for them when they saw him seal the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede in the Eclipse Cauldron.</p>
<p>"That's not the case." At this moment, a Desolate Heaven Master spoke out. "The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede is one of the rare insect-based Ancient Fey. Its body is highly toxic. Ancient mighty figures would have their bodies disintegrate and die if they were bitten once by it. The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede usually likes to eat all sorts of treasured herbs and poisons. Treasured herbs and Fey bones, which have many kinds of medicinal essences and energies of differing types, or even opposite types, can be refined in its body. It will allow the medicinal essences to merge and be made usable by the Demon Centipede."</p>
<p>"Hence, in ancient times, a Thousand-feet Demon Centipede was invaluable. Just the amount of medicinal essence accumulated in its body would allow a supreme-grade pill to be refined if it is used."</p>
<p>With the Desolate Heaven Master's explanation, everyone came to an understanding. The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede could extract the energy from all sorts of herbs and Fey bones that it devoured. So the reason why Luo Kui had sent his Demon Centipede bloodline into the Eclipse Cauldron was to aid him in refining a supreme-grade relic!</p>
<p>By using the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede, it would be half the work with double the results!</p>
<p>“No wonder such a burly man like Luo Kui would choose to be a Desolate Heaven Master, and waste his precious time cultivating. It's all because he has a Thousand-feet Demon Centipede!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, if the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede can help devour the Fey bone and extract its energy, then it would not be a waste for him to be a Desolate Heaven Master."</p>
<p>As the people were engaged in a flurry of discussion, they felt a bit jealous of him. With the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede helping him, Luo Kui's Desolate Heaven technique would definitely attain great success one day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Desolate Heaven Masters enjoyed a high status in the Luo clan. Many supreme figures from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven would frequently come to the Luo clan to buy a relic for a high price.</p>
<p>For example, the third Empyrean Uncle of the Luo clan, who had retired, was a supreme level Desolate Heaven Master. He was a person that even if Emperor Luo met him, he would respectfully bow with a junior's greeting.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the third Empyrean Uncle retiring, to put it bluntly, if he put his foot down, he could decide who the next Emperor of the Luo clan would be. There was no need for any competition for the throne!</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Kui threw another few pieces of bone fragments and herbs into the Eclipse Cauldron.</p>
<p>Dang!</p>
<p>After the supplemental herbs were added into the Eclipse Cauldron, its lid immediately sealed it tight!</p>
<p>Some of the keen-eyed young elites present could tell at a glance that the bone fragments and herbs that Luo Kui had thrown into the Eclipse Cauldron were extraordinary items. Some of them were worth even more than the third grade Fey bone that he had taken out.</p>
<p>The Fey bone supplements were higher in value than the main Fey bone!</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Luo Kui was determined to refine a supreme-grade relic.</p>
<p>But in fact, using higher valued Fey bones as supplements to forcefully upgrade a low-level relic's grade was somewhat contrived. A truly powerful Desolate Heaven Master would refine a low-level Fey bone into a high-grade relic. Only then was there value in it.</p>
<p>However, that was too difficult. Luo Kui had only been practicing the Desolate Heaven technique for about a decade after all. It was already quite amazing for him to attain what he did.</p>
<p>"Luo Kui using so many supplemental Fey bones makes the competition somewhat unfair. Yi Yun only used a single Fey bone and nothing else."</p>
<p>"So what? This isn't even a competition. It's just an individual performance by Luo Kui! I also know a little bit of the Desolate Heaven technique. The disk array that Yi Yun is using is fully exposed. Regardless of the seals he forms, I can see them clearly. Yi Yun's seals would not be able to refine any relics of a good grade, so it's impossible for him to win. Furthermore, his low-level seals aren't even considered perfect. As such, being able to refine that Fey bone itself should be his limit. He would not be able to handle the adding of any more supplemental Fey bones, so what's so unfair about it?" A Desolate Heaven apprentice spoke.</p>
<p>He did not speak without thinking.</p>
<p>Yi Yun may have talent in the Desolate Heaven technique, but his age was less than half of Luo Kui's. The profession of a Desolate Heaven Master required the accumulation of time. Furthermore, Yi Yun had yet to fully come into contact with the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique, so the outcome was destined.</p>
<p>At this moment, even Luo Huo'er was feeling anxious.</p>
<p>She was certain that Yi Yun would not lose out. Since he dared to step forward, there was something that was backing him. But now, with Yi Yun's relic being almost 70% refined, there was still not a single miracle!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was probably the most qualified person present to comment on the competition. She was not only proficient in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique, she was also proficient in the lower realm's Desolate Heaven technique. She obviously knew that with the techniques being used by Yi Yun, the quality of the relics that he refined would only be a 'poor' grade!</p>
<p>By using the most primitive methods to build a stone hut with a heap of construction materials, there was no way that a top architect could change it into a magnificent palace when the stone hut was nearing completion.</p>
<p>As for Luo Kui, he was using a supreme-grade desolate heaven cauldron, and with so many supplemental materials, as well as the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede bloodline, Luo Huo'er estimated that the quality of the relic Luo Kui would refine would be between 'refined' and 'outstanding'. The difference was like night and day.</p>
<p>Other than that, Luo Kui's refining speed was faster than Yi Yun's. Yi Yun had only refined 70%, while Luo Kui had already refined 90%!</p>
<p>In less than three minutes, Luo Kui's relic would be completed!</p>
<p>However, Luo Huo'er could tell that when the relic was nearing completion, Luo Kui was beginning to have problems holding it together. After all, he had used so many supplemental Fey bones, so it was demanding on his mental strength. Imperfections began to appear in Luo Kui's seals, and these meant that the quality of his relic was going to be at the 'refined' grade.</p>
<p>Seconds changed to minutes. Yi Yun formed one seal after another and he proceeded in a prescribed routine, as though he was not worried at all.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yi Yun had already opened his energy vision. Others could not see the situation inside the Eclipse Cauldron, but he could see it clearly.</p>
<p>In the Eclipse Cauldron, the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede was at its limits. It was not a true Thousand-feet Demon Centipede, after all, it was only a bloodline that Luo Kui had conjured. After eating up too much energy in one fell swoop, it could not digest it fully. As a result, its body swelled up as though it was about to burst.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the energy seals that Luo Kui produced were brought together. He was about to condensed them into a relic.</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er said, these energy seals had their imperfections. It was not easy for ordinary people to detect them, but Yi Yun could see them very clearly. He could even tell how many imperfections there were clearly.</p>
<p>It was true that Yi Yun did not fully understand the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique, but with the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun knew what the perfect form of energy should be.</p>
<p>The spots where the energies were imperfect accumulated and gradually expanded in size. At the moment the relic took form, all of them would merge instantly and reach their largest size. However, it would not explode as it would be forcefully suppressed by Luo Kui's relic-forming hand seals. Finally, they would be left in the relic, and become the relic's energy 'holes', affecting the relic's rating.</p>
<p>In fact, when Luo Kui was using a hand seal to forcefully merge the energy seals together was the moment when the energy was most stable. This was an immense challenge on Luo Kui's mental strength, and it was this reason that the relic formation was a critical stage when Desolate Heaven Masters refined a relic. There could be no mistake.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Kui's relic was nearing completion.</p>
<p>Hundreds of energy seals were already condensed by Luo Kui. The final step was combining them together. He was in full concentration as his forehead began sweating.</p>
<p>Although it was only a third-grade relic, by using so many supplemental Fey bones, it was also an extremely big challenge for Luo Kui to produce an outstanding grade relic. He was also reaching his limit. If not, he would not have produced so many flaws on the energy seals towards the end.</p>
<p>Although it might have missed out on the outstanding grade by a hair, for Luo Kui to obtain such results, it was already something that he could be proud of. After all, despite having only cultivated for eighty years, his strength was not only exceptional, he had also been able to divert some attention onto the Desolate Heaven technique!</p>
<p>Combine!</p>
<p>Luo Kui isolated himself from distractions as his remaining mental strength was devoted into the Eclipse Cauldron, so he could control the energy seal's merger.</p>
<p>Hundred of energy seals began to emit beams as bright as the sun in the Eclipse Cauldron. Just as it was about to merge as one…</p>
<p>A summoning force that no one could perceive mixed itself inside the energy seals. This summoning force was without shape or form, as though it was the Origin powers at the beginning of the Universe… Even Empress Luo or Empress Xuan, much less Luo Kui, couldn't sense it.</p>
<p>At this moment, nearly everyone's attention was focused on Luo Kui's Eclipse Cauldron. No one paid Yi Yun any mind. Yi Yun was standing by the side, condensing his energy seals while controlling the Purple Crystal. He began to lightly 'nudge' the hundreds of energy seals.</p>
<p>Just this light nudge moved the most critical energy combination point. It forcefully repressed many of the imperfects in the energy seals…</p>
<p>Instantly, it was like a spark dropping into an oil well. The delicate balance of energy was broken.</p>
<p>Luo Kui, who was nearing his limits, was late by the time it took to blink as he realized the nearly undetectable energy disturbance! Although the time it took to blink was short, it was fatal for the critical moment of relic formation.</p>
<p>No good!</p>
<p>Luo Kui widened his eyes as his pupils turned bloodshot. He bellowed as all the power from his bloodline burned. The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede in the Eclipse Cauldron opened its mouth wide and it tried to devour the collapsing energy seals. It was trying to maintain the relic at the risk of destroying the relic's quality.</p>
<p>However, the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede was already severely bloated and it was a spent force, so how could it succeed?</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not stand on ceremony as he controlled the Purple Crystal to nudge a second energy combination point.</p>
<p>As such, the collapse of the energy could no longer be stopped!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A tumultuous explosion happened as the hovering Eclipse Cauldron violently trembled. The cauldron's lid was blown open and it heavily slammed into the ceiling. It had smashed a brick on the ceiling into smithereens!</p>
<p>Phew—</p>
<p>A blazing blue fireball rose up into the sky. Luo Kui's Thousand-feet Demon Centipede bloodline's phantom image was enveloped in the blue fireball as it struggled in pain!</p>
<p>The Thousand-feet Demon Centipede bloodline was considered strong, but with it being at its limits and being caught unaware, it had been engulfed by the shock wave at a close distance. Furthermore, it was in a sealed space in the Eclipse Cauldron, so the impact was imaginable!</p>
<p>Luo Kui, who was mentally linked to the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede, grunted as he retreated backward and fell to the ground. His face was as pale as a sheet of paper!</p>
<p>Two streams of black blood began to flow down from Luo Kui's ears. This was the most accurate portrayal of the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede's damage. The shock wave in an enclosed space had blasted through the Thousand-feet Demon Centipede's ears, causing it to be severely injured. It would take him a few months to recover from these injuries.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The Eclipse Cauldron heavily slammed onto the ground as black ash spilled out of it...</p>
<p>Luo Kui was battered out of his senses. His face was blank as he dully looked at the rolling Eclipse Cauldron on the ground. He could not believe his eyes.</p>
<p>The cauldron blew up? His refining of a relic had ended up in him blowing up the cauldron...</p>
<p>At such an important occasion, Empress Luo, Empress Xuan, elites from all over the world, and his future master, Prince Crimson Firmament, were all present, but he blew up his cauldron! Luo Kui's heart was palpitating!</p>
<p>"This… "</p>
<p>The young elites present all widened their eyes. Some of them were not even aware of the wine glasses that they had knocked over.</p>
<p>Luo Kui was just about to refine a relic that was a 'refined' grade at the minimum in an ostentatious display of his prowess. But at the final moment, he had blown his cauldron up.</p>
<p>As a result, he did not even have the poorest grade of a relic. It went from a 'refined'-grade relic to a pile of ash. This sudden change was too great!</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Kui look as though he had lost his soul, everyone knew that this failure would deal a terrible blow to his confidence. In the future, Luo Kui might even have a mental demon when he refined relics. He might end up being afraid of all sorts of things, affecting his future achievement in the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>The elites present, including Empress Luo and Empress Xuan, were stunned by the blowing up of Luo Kui's cauldron. However, there was one person who was unaffected, and that was… Yi Yun!</p>
<p>As everyone recollected their thoughts, they saw that Yi Yun was still controlling his crude disk array as he slowly refined a Fey bone relic.</p>
<p>His motions could only be described as leisurely. The speed at which he formed seals did not seem like he was refining a Fey bone relic. Instead, it could be described as him picking mushrooms in the wild.</p>
<p>On one side, one had blown up a cauldron, while the other looked relaxed. This contrast was way too big…</p>
<p>However slow he was, Yi Yun had managed to finish the final seal as he began to do the final relic formation.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's relic formation technique was also nothing fancy. It was the crudest relic formation technique from the lower realm. He had finished it quickly, but it was simple and crude.</p>
<p>"Dong!"</p>
<p>A gray relic rolled into Yi Yun's hand from the disk array.</p>
<p>Some high-grade relics would be crystalline upon after refinement, but the relic that Yi Yun refined did not look good, as though there were impurities within it. Furthermore, its quality rating did not go beyond its appearance. It was truly consistent in and out.</p>
<p>Quality evaluation — Poor.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun held the relic, he noticed that there was a bit of ash on its surface. Using his sleeve, he nonchalantly wiped it and placed it on the maid servant's tray, and motioned for her to hand it to Empress Luo.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, this lowly one's relic has been completed. This lowly one has only been exposed to the Desolate Heaven technique for four to five months after all. It's quite nice to produce such a poor-quality third-grade relic. Now, this lowly one wants to present it to Her Majesty."</p>
<p>Seeing the maidservant hand the gray relic to Empress Luo, everyone present was dumbfounded. Their eyes were fixated on the relic as they could not turn their gazes away.</p>
<p>Holy shit, what was going on? Don't tell me that Yi Yun has won!?</p>
<p>Many people began to come to this realization. On one side, one had blown his cauldron up, while the other side had refined a poor grade relic, but at least he had completed it.</p>
<p>At this moment, Prince Crimson Firmament felt as though his heart was being trampled upon by a million Ancient Fey beasts with mud-stained hoofs.</p>
<p>He felt like he was a super retard. He had played a secondary role with the retard, Luo Kui, in a super humorous silly play. Unexpectedly, he would become the laughing stock of the royal capital in the next few days.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, this fellow, who looked like he was low on his intellectual quotient, had become the final victor.</p>
<p>"Only been exposed to the Desolate Heaven technique for four or five months."</p>
<p>"Quite nice to produce such a poor-quality third-grade relic… "</p>
<p>Thinking back to Yi Yun's words, Prince Crimson Firmament wanted to slam his head into a wall. This fellow, who looked like he had a screw loose, had actually won!?</p>
<p>Or was this punk acting the pig? However, Prince Crimson Firmament had a few thousand years of cultivation at least. He had been focused on the competition from beginning to end. He did not feel that Yi Yun had secretly done something — how could he have that ability!?</p>
<p>"Pfft!"</p>
<p>A pearly laughter was suddenly heard. Luo Huo'er had burst out into laughter.</p>
<p>She was a person with a child's temperament and she was never serious, to begin with. She had forcibly put on an elegant look for this banquet. How could she tolerate it when she truly encountered such an interesting matter?</p>
<p>Seeing many people looking at her, especially with Prince Crimson Firmament looking as though his mother had died, Luo Huo'er quickly gave a dry cough and dabbed her mouth with a handkerchief. Again, she put on a serious expression.</p>
<p>However, the more she behaved this way, the more depressed Prince Crimson Firmament felt.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er holding back her laughter and pretending to be serious was the greatest travesty against him. This was because he felt that Luo Huo'er was mocking him.</p>
<p>"Prince Crimson Firmament, I… I can't accept it!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the dispirited Luo Kui suddenly got up. How could he accept it? From his point of view, an unpredictable problem had happened when he was combining the seals. It had caused him to blow his cauldron and give Yi Yun a free win. "Just one more time. One more time and I will be able to refine a top grade relic!"</p>
<p>After Luo Kui said this, Prince Crimson Firmament's expression turned even uglier. Luo Huo'er laughed and said, "Luo Kui, it was you who said it yourself. You have failed to refine a third-grade relic, so what qualifications do you have to continue competing? This time, you poked a hole through the roof, if you are given another chance, are you going to demolish this place?"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er played with her handkerchief and spoke without sparing his feelings. The Luo Lucid Palace was not meant to be an area for the refinement of relics. It was not indestructible. When the cauldron blew up, it had shattered a brick.</p>
<p>Chapter 867: Luo Mo</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er said those words, everyone present fell silent. The result was obvious. Yi Yun had managed to refine a relic at least. But for Luo Kui, despite his ostentatious razzle-dazzle, he had ended up refining a pile of ash.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan failed to understand what had happened either. She looked at Yi Yun with amazement, unsure if Yi Yun knew that he would win from the beginning. Everything looked like a coincidence, but Yi Yun's calm and leisurely composure from the very beginning made her feel like he had everything in his grasp.</p>
<p>Had he foreseen this outcome from the very beginning?</p>
<p>"Huo'er, what happened?" Empress Xuan sent a voice transmission to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>"Hehe, Mother, as to what specifically happened, I do not know either. But Yi Yun is a very interesting person. It's not easy to make him suffer!"</p>
<p>Amongst the people present, Luo Huo'er was the one who understood Yi Yun the best. Although Yi Yun looked harmless, he was extremely nefarious. He was filled with evil ideas!</p>
<p>"Oh? You think so highly of Yi Yun?" Empress Xuan was rather surprised. She knew her daughter the best. Luo Huo'er may appear a bit childish, but she was very arrogant deep down. She despised everyone, but she had given Yi Yun such a good evaluation.</p>
<p>If that was the case, Empress Xuan felt that she had to review the young man once again.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Empress Xuan say that, Luo Huo'er's face blushed. How could her evaluation not be high? She had suffered under the hands of Yi Yun several times in the Tai Ah Divine City. Someone who could make her suffer was obviously powerful, unless she wanted to put herself down?</p>
<p>Of course, the mishaps in the lower realm, especially how her body had been seen by Yi Yun was something that she definitely did not want to tell Empress Xuan. It would be unimaginable what Empress Xuan would think of that.</p>
<p>Just as Luo Huo'er was machinating something, Empress Xuan's follow-up statement made Luo Huo'er's face turn sullen. Empress Xuan had said, "Huo'er, in a while, tell Mother of your experiences in the lower realm."</p>
<p>Ah?</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's eyes widened and nearly choked. How could she… mention those things?</p>
<p>Worst of all, her mother was the person who understood her the most. If she made up a story, it was easy for her to be exposed. Also back then, when Luo Huo'er was left in the Tai Ah Divine City, there were Luo clan clansmen who were responsible for protecting Luo Huo'er's safety. Although they had never appeared, or even stepped into the Divine City once, they more or less knew of certain things. As long as Empress Xuan asked them, and compare the facts with what Luo Huo'er said, it was easy for her to deduce which were real or fake…</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Luo Huo'er felt bitter in her heart.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Aren't you going down? Haven't you shamed yourself enough?" Prince Crimson Firmament's voice transmission boomed in Luo Kui's ears.</p>
<p>Luo Kui had suffered a heavy blow and his Ancient Fey bloodline had been damaged. He stood back up unsteadily and staggered back to his seat.</p>
<p>He was unconvinced!</p>
<p>However, he also knew that he had lost!</p>
<p>Luo Kui felt as though he was sitting on pins and needles in the palace. Every second that he stayed in it, he felt as though his face was burning, as though everyone else was mocking him.</p>
<p>However, he would feel indignant if he were to leave. He felt that Yi Yun had obtained a free win, and with Yi Yun's Desolate Heaven technique level, even his Desolate Heaven technique servant was better than Yi Yun, much less himself!</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how embarrassing it was, Luo Kui insisted on sitting in his seat and wait for Yi Yun to be trampled on.</p>
<p>Luo Kui wiped the blood flowing out of his nose and ears and said angrily, "Prince Crimson Firmament, your subject is ashamed, but… but that punk is complete crap. You have to rescue the situation."</p>
<p>"There's no need for your incessant talk. I know what to do!" Prince Crimson Firmament said with a Yuan Qi voice transmission.</p>
<p>He was of the mind to ignore Luo Kui, but what Luo Kui said was right. He had to rescue the situation. If not, he would definitely become the laughing stock of the royal capital. If Emperor Luo were to hear about today's matter, it was unknown how he would think of him.</p>
<p>When Prince Crimson Firmament looked at Yi Yun, his eyes gave off a strange flair.</p>
<p>He did not believe that everything had been machinated by Yi Yun, mainly because he doubted that Yi Yun had such an ability.</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Yi Yun had any inkling of involvement in the matter, his Desolate Heaven technique was definitely extremely limited. Yi Yun's age was obvious for all to see. Prince Crimson Firmament refused to believe that Yi Yun's standard could be even a tenth of Luo Kui's.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament took a deep breath and looked at Empress Luo.</p>
<p>In contrast, Empress Luo appeared calm. She only nodded her head, indicating that she was leaving everything to Prince Crimson Firmament.</p>
<p>This banquet was prepared for Prince Crimson Firmament, to pave his way to the throne. Now that there was an unexpected incident at the banquet, Prince Crimson Firmament had to take care of it.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament faltered slightly as his eyes darted to his side and swept across Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was sitting quietly in her seat, as though she was a pure Snow Lotus. Even the outcome of the competition had not perturbed her much.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament knew that Princess White Fox's Desolate Heaven technique was peerless amongst the younger generation. If she were to compete, only Luo Huo'er was worthy of being her opponent.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Princess White Fox to deal with a single Yi Yun as it would be a hit to her reputation.</p>
<p>"Luo Mo!" Prince Crimson Firmament's voice transmission was sent out of the palace.</p>
<p>In about half a minute, a handsome young man walked into the main hall. His long hair was tied to his back, and he wore black and white clothes. There were delicate and beautiful scenic drawings on his clothes. He did not look like a warrior at all, he looked like a scholar who dabbled in the arts.</p>
<p>"Young master Luo Mo?" The moment that the handsome young man appeared, someone immediately shouted Luo Mo's name.</p>
<p>He was Luo Mo, the one who had the title of the number one genius amongst the younger generation of the royal capital!</p>
<p>Luo Mo was not one of the four great young masters of the royal capital, mainly because his background was not prominent. He was only from an insignificant branch of the Luo clan, but he was still famous in the royal capital, despite not being from an illustrious background.</p>
<p>The label of 'genius' was because of his talent in various aspects.</p>
<p>It was enough for a typical warrior to have martial talent, but for Luo Mo, not only was his martial talent exceptional, but he was also proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. Furthermore, he had very high attainments in the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>In the warrior's world, music, chess, calligraphy, and painting were used as a form of entertainment and they were not considered a main way of life. But Luo Mo had managed to develop his martial path through music, chess, calligraphy and painting, which was an amazing feat. And due to his talent, and his good looks, Luo Mo had won the hearts of many women. In the royal capital, many women from good families were rushing to marry him.</p>
<p>"Luo Mo was also here at the banquet, but why didn't anyone notice him?"</p>
<p>Many young elites were surprised. For a person like Luo Mo, who was well known, he would definitely have stolen the limelight if he had appeared and been the focus of attention.</p>
<p>"He must be in one of the side rooms. There is a small feast in the side rooms, and the level of service there is extremely high. If I'm not wrong, the side room must be filled with important figures. It might be the geniuses under Empress Luo and Prince Crimson Firmament." People discussed with Yuan Qi voice transmissions.</p>
<p>With this said, everyone understood.</p>
<p>So this was the case. Empress Luo was setting up a banquet with malicious purposes. She was worried that if her line-up was revealed, it might appear too strong, frightening Empress Xuan out of her wits.</p>
<p>If that were the case, Empress Xuan might choose to suffer the reputation of being afraid to go to battle by refusing the competition. It was clear that she would suffer an abject failure, so how could she agree to it?</p>
<p>Hence, Empress Luo had deliberately hidden a number of people in a side room that was concealed by array formations.</p>
<p>If Empress Xuan agreed to the match, Empress Luo could call her people out one by one. With a gorgeous line-up, she could thrash Empress Xuan!</p>
<p>However, Empress Luo never expected that Empress Xuan did not bring anyone from her family, making her unable to display her force. She had finally managed to use the burly Luo Kui to get Empress Xuan to compete, but she ended up encountering a wonder like Yi Yun. Immediately, Empress Luo's plans were in a mess.</p>
<p>And now, Prince Crimson Firmament could no longer remain patient. By calling Luo Mo out, he was planning to make Luo Mo to thrash Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Chapter 868: Rules of the Competition</p>
<p>"Everyone, let me introduce him. This is Young Master Luo Mo." Prince Crimson Firmament stood up and toasted Luo Mo from a distance.</p>
<p>This simple action was an indication that Luo Mo was one of his men.</p>
<p>Luo Mo gave Prince Crimson Firmament a slight bow. With a glass in hand, he drank the wine in one gulp.</p>
<p>Luo Mo's behavior had an indescribable free and easy grace. Many of the girls present had a brilliance in their eyes when they saw Luo Mo.</p>
<p>They had also heard of Luo Mo's name when they were in their own states. Although they did not go as far as worshiping him, they would still feel ripples going through their hearts when they encountered such a handsome man who stirred waves in the royal capital.</p>
<p>After drinking the wine, Luo Mo's gaze landed on Yi Yun. He had learned of the situation through a Yuan Qi voice transmission and he was aware of the reason why Prince Crimson Firmament had summoned him.</p>
<p>"Friend, I'm Luo Mo." Luo Mo smiled at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun." Despite knowing the person opposite him was an enemy, Yi Yun did not lose any form of decorum.</p>
<p>"So it's Young Master Yi. I like to be frank. I heard you that defeated Luo Kui in the Desolate Heaven technique using 'very interesting' means. I am curious as to how Young Master Yi did it, can you teach me?"</p>
<p>Luo Mo was suspicious that Yi Yun had used some unknown technique to rip Luo Kui off.</p>
<p>However, what would Yi Yun tell Luo Mo? He said with a smile, "I wouldn't call it interesting. I used a technique called the '36 Basic Hand Seals'. In the lower realm, this is the most basic technique of the Desolate Heaven technique. Don't think lightly of the 'basic' in its name. It actually contains hundreds of alterations. Why? Is Young Master Luo interested in the Desolate Heaven techniques of the lower realm? I can lend it to you if you would like to peruse it."</p>
<p>Yi Yun said 'very generously'. When everyone heard this, they rolled their eyes. Who the hell would want to learn your lower realm's '36 Basic Hand Seals'? It was a something used to teach kids. They didn't want it even if it was free. A few hundred alterations? A few hundred my ass? Didn't it still refine a 'poor' quality relic!?</p>
<p>Many family clans would willingly take out their best Desolate Heaven technique heritage to attract Luo Mo's service, yet Luo Mo might not even think highly of them.</p>
<p>"Young Master Yi, you really like to joke."</p>
<p>Even though Luo Mo was cultured, he was rendered speechless to the point that his mouth slightly twitched when he heard Yi Yun's words that bordered on absurdness.</p>
<p>He even suspected that Yi Yun was playing dumb. Hence, he suddenly looked at the third-grade relic that Yi Yun had just refined.</p>
<p>It was a gray-colored relic, like a glass ball dug out of a ditch.</p>
<p>He was hoping that he could see something peculiar about it, but no matter how much he examined it, it was the most standard of standard 'poor' quality relic. Even the impurities were not cleaned away.</p>
<p>Luo Mo was greatly disappointed. Against such a person, he could not be bothered to compete with him. It was like an adult sparring with a child. There was nothing much to talk about it, and even if he won, people would say that he was a bully.</p>
<p>"Young Master Luo, what do you think about this relic?" Someone noticed Luo Mo's expression and asked with a look of interest.</p>
<p>Luo Mo sighed and said, "If it's meant to feed cattle, it's still passable."</p>
<p>When Luo Mo said this, many people could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Luo Mo glanced at Yi Yun and he felt that Yi Yun probably truly did not know how terrifying the standard of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique was.</p>
<p>However, since his competition with Yi Yun was ordered by Prince Crimson Firmament, he could not refuse it.</p>
<p>With a snap of his fingers, a golden desolate heaven cauldron jumped out from the middle of his palm. It was a tiny golden cauldron that was the size of a chicken egg and it began to playfully spin on his fingertip.</p>
<p>With the desolate heaven cauldron taken out, it was clear that he was going to showcase his skill.</p>
<p>Everyone was immediately intrigued. Luo Mo had used music and paintings as his foundations into martial arts. His Desolate Heaven technique accomplishments were extraordinary. Few people his age could match him, and compared to Luo Kui, Luo Mo was much better.</p>
<p>If it was a person like Luo Mo, even if Princess Purple Spirit was the one opposite him, it would not be demeaning for her status.</p>
<p>But if it was Yi Yun... Everyone looked at Yi Yun with odd expressions.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also someone who did not like to continue engaging in meaningless nonsense. Seeing Luo Mo take out his tool, Yi Yun took out his desolate heaven disk array very naturally.</p>
<p>When Luo Mo saw Yi Yun's desolate heaven disk array, he faltered for a moment. He had only heard a brief description of Yi Yun's victory over Luo Kui. He did not know that Yi Yun had been using a tool of such 'supreme-grade'.</p>
<p>Using that?</p>
<p>Luo Mo's impression of the disk array was that even if it was given to him, he would probably give it to his servant and make sure that it was used as a shovel to throw out the trash.</p>
<p>"What shall we compete on?" Yi Yun ignored Luo Mo's strange gaze.</p>
<p>"Anything will do." Luo Mo said without much interest. "Let me warn you on one point. If you are hoping that I will blow my cauldron while refining a relic, that is impossible."</p>
<p>Yi Yun laughed. He was also not planning on causing Luo Mo's cauldron to blow up. He could tell that Luo Mo's Desolate Heaven technique was extremely strong. With him being wary, it would not be easy to nudge the energy structure inside Luo Mo's desolate heaven cauldron. Besides, if he did it time and again, it would be suspicious.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yi Yun planned on competing with Luo Mo fair and square from the beginning. He said, "Then let's compete on the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique!"</p>
<p>Oh!?</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said this, everyone present was astounded. Competing in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique? Did Yi Yun know it?</p>
<p>Could it be possible that they had made a mistake? Was Yi Yun truly acting the pig to eat a tiger?</p>
<p>Yi Yun said with a smile, "I actually know a thing or two about the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Desolate Heaven technique. Back when I first arrived at the Fire Cloud State, I was assigned to a Heaven Fire Hall disciple's mountain. I met a maidservant named Tao'er, who was practicing the Desolate Heaven technique, and there, I read the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique'. Let us compete using the seventy-two techniques recorded in the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' and judge it based on the refined quality?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never learned any of the advanced methods of the Desolate Heaven technique, so if he were to compete with Luo Mo on those, it was unrealistic.</p>
<p>But back then, he was only a miscellaneous chores disciple at Mt. Fengling. He had been recuperating while guiding Tao'er on the Desolate Heaven technique for half a month. Yi Yun had seen everything about the Desolate Heaven technique that Tao'er had practiced. Hence, Yi Yun understood the seventy-two introductory methods.</p>
<p>He had probed into the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' with a maidservant?</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Yi Yun wanted to compete on this, many young elites looked like they had just swallowed a fly. To think they they had believed that Yi Yun had unknown skills... What Yi Yun mentioned was the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique'!</p>
<p>Compared to the profound Desolate Heaven techniques of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the seventy-two introductory methods were not even a drop in the bucket. Yi Yun dared to say that he knew a thing or two after reading an introductory book!</p>
<p>Forget it. It could not be forced. With Yi Yun's standard, he was indeed only worthy of the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique'.</p>
<p>However, the methods described in the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' were extremely easy, but the refinement ability was severely limited. But now, Yi Yun had said that he wanted to use the methods described in the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' to refine a third-grade Fey bone?</p>
<p>How could this be possible!?</p>
<p>Chapter 869: Seventy-two Introductory Moves</p>
<p>Typically, only Desolate Heaven apprentices at the Yuan foundation realm or those lower would use the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' to attempt to refine a first-grade Fey bone. And most of the time, they would not even be able to do well at refining one. Desolate Heaven Masters that were slightly better would not even use such a technique.</p>
<p>Seeing the Fey bone that Prince Crimson Firmament provided, it was most likely one of the best third-grade Fey bones. It was impossible to use such introductory methods to refine such high-grade Fey bones. The failure rate was nearly 100%!</p>
<p>Was Yi Yun trying to increase the difficulty to make Luo Mo fail?</p>
<p>As people had such thoughts, they saw Luo Mo reveal a look of interest. "Interesting, let's compete in that!"</p>
<p>Were they truly going to compete?</p>
<p>The people were somewhat taken aback when they heard hearing Luo Mo's agreement. Luo Mo must truly have confidence while daring to accept the challenge of using only the 'Introduction to Luo Clan's Desolate Heaven Technique' to produce a top-ranking third-grade Fey bone!</p>
<p>If the relic could be refined, it would be shocking, even if it only had a 'poor' rating.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun is doomed. I guess he had deliberately posed a tough problem so that the both of them would fail together and it would be considered a tie. Unfortunately, Luo Mo is a genius. He even has the confidence in such an absurd competition. Now with Yi Yun irrevocably committed, it's too late for him to go back on his word."</p>
<p>"Using the seventy-two introductory moves to refine a top-ranking third-grade relic is unimaginable!"</p>
<p>As people broke out into a flurry of discussion, Luo Mo had already begun. He beckoned with his stretched out hand, attracting the third-grade Fey bone in Prince Crimson Firmament's hand to make it land directly in his palm.</p>
<p>Following that, the tiny golden cauldron above his right hand's fingertip rapidly spun and it increased in size. Soon, it was about three feet in size. With the lid open, Luo Mo threw the Fey bone into it.</p>
<p>Luo Mo glanced at Yi Yun as he had a confident smile on his face. He was certain that Yi Yun was trying to stump him, but he enjoyed this. It would only be considered a challenge for him if he could use the seventy-two introductory moves to refine a third-grade relic. Just beating Yi Yun alone was meaningless.</p>
<p>"Shall we set the time limit to thirty minutes?"</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun suddenly spoke out. Thirty minutes was too short!</p>
<p>Luo Mo frowned slightly. It was a difficult competition with such a short period of time. Yi Yun was truly trying to prevent him from succeeding. Unfortunately, Luo Mo was confident when it came to his speed at using the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>"Thirty minutes? Sure!" Luo Mo put his hand out, causing his desolate heaven cauldron to flare up with golden light. The runes on the cauldron began to light up as Luo Mo began forming hand seals. Indeed, they were the hand seals of the seventy-two introductory moves. However, the ones that Luo Mo formed were somewhat different.</p>
<p>Did the hands of Luo Mo give life to the somewhat ordinary hand seals? It was like they had come alive.</p>
<p>A Heaven Eminence seal was condensed as it danced in the sky like an alacritous butterfly.</p>
<p>A Fire Willow seal burned like a small fire plume like it was filled with spirit.</p>
<p>As for the Sun Moon seal, it produced a sun and a moon projection that slowly revolved mid-air.</p>
<p>Luo Mo perfectly condensed every hand seal!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, people could only watch with utter amazement. Was it possible to condense the seventy-two introductory moves in such a manner? If not for them seeing Luo Mo's hand seals today, they would never imagine that it was possible to reach such a standard with the most basic hand seals when one's Desolate Heaven technique reached the peak of perfection.</p>
<p>At this moment, an hourglass with markings was placed in the hall.</p>
<p>The sand rapidly flowed downwards as thirty minutes was not a long time.</p>
<p>Luo Mo had already begun, but Yi Yun had yet to make his move.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, why aren't you beginning?" Prince Crimson Firmament asked, as a derisive grin suffused on the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>He had asked while knowing the answer. How was it possible for Yi Yun to use the seventy-two introductory moves to extract the energy of a top-ranking third-grade Fey bone?</p>
<p>Yi Yun lightly answered, "There's no hurry. I'll let Young Master Luo go first. I'll begin after he is done."</p>
<p>Yi Yun chose to let Luo Mo go first mainly because Yi Yun did not have a clear understanding of the Luo clan's seventy-two introductory moves.</p>
<p>The information was recorded in a book after all, and it would be different from what he could see.</p>
<p>Previously, Yi Yun had only seen Tao'er use them, but he had never seen the talented Desolate Heaven Masters of the 12 Empyrean Heavens use the seventy-two introductory moves. Yi Yun could not confirm that his own assumptions had already been perfected.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was planning to affirm his hypothesis with the seventy-two introductory moves used by Luo Mo. He was becoming more and more convinced that using the Luo clan's seventy-two introductory moves derived through the Purple Crystal would be perfect in form. It would even be better than the seventy-two introductory moves that had been honed for countless years!</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun's answer made people disdain him when they heard it. He was still insisting on being tough with his words at such a moment in time.</p>
<p>Slowly, more than half the time had passed.</p>
<p>Luo Mo's motions were still as graceful as ever, as though he was showing a beautiful dance. The energy seals that he condensed appeared perfect, and everything had been done to their best.</p>
<p>But in Yi Yun's energy vision, he could see that the energy extracted from the Fey bone in Luo Mo's desolate heaven cauldron was not flawless. There was 30% left at least.</p>
<p>After all, it was only the seventy-two introductory moves used to refine 'poor'-rated first-grade Fey bones. Using it to refine a top-ranking third-grade Fey bone was something even Luo Mo could not do as well as he wished.</p>
<p>Using such hand seals to extract the Fey bone's energy was just too difficult! Although Luo Mo looked unperturbed, he was actually consuming a great deal of mental strength. It was not apparent because he had a lot of mental strength to begin with.</p>
<p>Seconds changed to minutes and the thirty minutes were nearly coming to an end.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Mo finally completed his final hand seal. Luo Mo still had some mental energy left, despite such a draining procedure. He precisely controlled more than seventy hand seals as he bound them together.</p>
<p>Relic formation!</p>
<p>Luo Mo also completed the final step perfectly.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>A golden beam flashed as the desolate heaven cauldron violently trembled. The cauldron's lid flew open as a crystalline third-grade relic shot out of the desolate heaven cauldron, and accurately landed on Luo Mo's hand.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, everyone was astounded.</p>
<p>He had truly managed to refine it!</p>
<p>The third-grade relic refined using the seventy-two introductory moves definitely did not look like it had a bad rating from its luster!</p>
<p>People believed that it would already be amazing if he could refine a 'poor'-grade relic. But in Luo Mo's hands, he could make the ugly beautiful.</p>
<p>"Quality evaluation, quasi-refined!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Empress Luo gave her answer. As the Empress of the Luo clan, she too was proficient in the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>The 'quasi-refined' rating was above 'ordinary', but compared to a true 'refined'-rating, it was still a distance away.</p>
<p>However, considering the refining conditions for Luo Mo, this outcome was already incredulous.</p>
<p>"It's truly my dear Firmament's fortune to have such a talent assisting him." Empress Luo muttered to herself and she was very pleased with Luo Mo.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament also nodded lightly at Luo Mo.</p>
<p>At this moment, Prince Crimson Firmament suddenly looked at Yi Yun and a teasing smile suffused on his lips . "Yi Yun, it's your turn!"</p>
<p>Chapter 870: Final Rating</p>
<p>A simple comment from Prince Crimson Firmament made everyone's gazes land on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The young elites present, especially those that were in Prince Crimson Firmament's camp, had looks of schadenfreude on their faces.</p>
<p>For example, Ran Xueyi had lost face because of Yi Yun previously, and now seeing Yi Yun in trouble, he obviously felt great. In the present situation, it would be useless even if Yi Yun had the princess backing him!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, at this point in time, you can also use other Desolate Heaven techniques. I'm fine with it." Luo Mo suddenly said as he looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He felt that it was just a farce for Yi Yun to use the seventy-two introductory moves to refine a third-grade relic at his age. If Yi Yun were to use another method, there would be something worth watching at least. Only then would his win appear more valuable.</p>
<p>With Luo Mo saying this, everyone praised Luo Mo for his magnanimity. He did not mind Yi Yun's deliberate act of making things difficult for him earlier on. If Yi Yun agreed to it, it would weaken his stance, but he would have a way to step down from this awkward situation instead of standing there in a silly fashion at least.</p>
<p>However, no one expected Yi Yun to say, "I only know the seventy-two introductory moves. The only other things I know are methods from the lower realm. They are even worse than the seventy-two introductory moves, so there's no need to change the rules. Thank you for your good intentions."</p>
<p>With Yi Yun saying this, the expressions of everyone could be as interesting as one wanted. He was truly a wonder of the ages. Even a genius like Luo Mo would dare to use the seventy-two introductory moves to refine a third-grade relic after deeply researching the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun only knew the seventy-two introductory moves, it meant that he was only at the level of a Desolate Heaven apprentice. And as an apprentice, he had the guts to even compete with Luo Mo…</p>
<p>Even Empress Xuan's camp looked at Yi Yun with discomfort. How were they going to smoothen this situation?</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun began. Indeed, he was still using the desolate heaven disk array that should have been thrown in the trash. Yi Yun placed the third-grade Fey bone in an ostentatious manner.</p>
<p>The hourglass was reversed and the sand began to flow downwards!</p>
<p>This set of seventy-two introductory moves was a combination of hand seals for energy extraction, condensing the energy runes and finally, the relic formation.</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously began with energy extraction. This was the simplest step for him. With the Purple Crystal, he did not even need to form hands seals.</p>
<p>But of course, that would be too startling if he did that.</p>
<p>The first twenty-four moves of the seventy-two introductory moves were related to energy extraction.</p>
<p>This step was extremely critical. Even Luo Mo had formed one seal after another, afraid that he would make a mistake.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not need to mind this. With his two hands together, he extended them outwards and produced a large number of seals in one go. The seals were squished together and they were just sent flooding into the third-grade Fey bone!</p>
<p>"What!?"</p>
<p>People who were familiar with the Desolate Heaven technique were confounded by this scene.</p>
<p>This wasn't him sending the hand seals, it was like he was throwing out the garbage.</p>
<p>Compared to the seals that Luo Mo produced that were beautiful, perfect, and full of life, Yi Yun's hand seals were unbearable for people to watch.</p>
<p>"What is that punk doing? Continuing in this fashion will cause an explosion!"</p>
<p>In the first process of the relic, Yi Yun had used clumsy hand seals, but he had at least completed it them an orderly manner, but this time… it was unknown what there was left to say.</p>
<p>Before people had the time to say anymore, Yi Yun had already begun to condense runic seals and complete the energy structure.</p>
<p>He produced them rapidly as basic runic seals were formed one after another and were augmented onto the Fey bone.</p>
<p>These runic seals looked unremarkable. But in fact, a number of them had been improved by the Purple Crystal.</p>
<p>The essence of relic refinement was to extract energy from the Fey bone before condensing the energy into runic seals. Once they were compressed together, they would become a relic.</p>
<p>The structure of these runic seals was actually the structure that allowed the best trajectories for energy flow.</p>
<p>And in fact, as humans and the Fey race had limited understanding with the laws of energy, the energy trajectories that they designed were still a distant away from being perfect.</p>
<p>However, with the Purple Crystal in his possession, Yi Yun had already came into contact with the trajectory methods of energy that abided to the Origins. Not only could he easily produce perfect runic seals, he could even do extremely tiny improvements to the seventy-two introductory moves!</p>
<p>Just a simple improvement was trivial, but with it accumulated, it would be different!</p>
<p>"Yi Yun has made mistakes in his seals!"</p>
<p>Amongst the young elites present, there were a few who were accomplished in the Desolate Heaven technique. Even though Yi Yun had made the slightest modifications, they could tell at a glance.</p>
<p>"The few seals that Yi Yun formed appear to be somewhat deformed. It's somewhat different from the orthodoxy of the seventy-two introductory moves." Another person said.</p>
<p>As they discussed it, a smile suffused on Prince Crimson Firmament's lips. Prince Crimson Firmament had never learned the Desolate Heaven technique, so he already felt that it was pretty remarkable that Yi Yun had managed to come this far. After all, Yi Yun could still form hand seals. Although the seals that he produced had numerous flaws, which would result in an eventual explosion, it was still much better than sillily standing there doing nothing.</p>
<p>Time had quickly passed and about fifteen minutes was over. Yi Yun's energy seals were almost done. The speed at which he formed seals was two times faster than Luo Mo!</p>
<p>Of course, this was because Yi Yun had dumped all the seals on the Fey bone, saving him a great deal of time.</p>
<p>However, speed alone was useless. The perfection of the relic refinement depended only on the final outcome. If the energy structure was flawed, these runic seals would eventually explode.</p>
<p>And previously, many of the Desolate Heaven Master had assessed that Yi Yun had many flaws in his technique!</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Yi Yun had finished forming the final runic seal.</p>
<p>No one noticed that when more than seventy runic seals were brought together, the tiny modifications that Yi Yun made had resulted in a chain reaction. They merged together and even possessed a hint of a charm.</p>
<p>This was the aura that belonged to the Origins of energy. It was the result of a Great Dao that existed at the formation of the Universe!</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun's cultivation realm was limited after all. Together with the limitations of his technique and the grade of the Fey bone, this formation of Great Dao only appeared for a fleeting moment before it vanished.</p>
<p>Yi Yun sighed slightly. Even with the Purple Crystal, he found it difficult to explore the Origins of the Universe. That level was just too high for him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's hands clasped together —</p>
<p>Relic formation!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A purple beam flashed and shot straight to the ceiling! People involuntarily narrowed their eyes, unsure of what had happened.</p>
<p>Why was there such an intense beam of light?</p>
<p>But there was no doubt that this was definitely not an explosion.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>Under the intense purple light, a round bead burning with purple flames flew onto Yi Yun's hand. It appeared to have a spirit in it as it floated to the middle of Yi Yun's palm.</p>
<p>The round bead was bluish-purple in color. In the middle of the bead, there was a beautiful texture that meandered like a tiny snake.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this bizarre scene, people did not even manage to react in time.</p>
<p>"That round bead is… a relic?" A Desolate Heaven Master present suddenly said.</p>
<p>The crystalline relic was burning with a purple flame at the moment of its birth.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had actually managed to refine a finished relic? Was this reality!? Wasn't it said that Yi Yun's hand seals were problematic?</p>
<p>Also… what was the rating of this relic? Many people present were unable to come to a judgment. But Empress Luo, who was an expert in the Desolate Heaven technique, had already stared with her widened eyes as she stood up from her seat.</p>
<p>As empress, Empress Luo seldom lost her composure in such a manner.</p>
<p>She looked at the Fey bone relic in Yi Yun's hand with eyes of surprised doubt.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan and the Desolate Heaven Masters present, including Luo Kui and Luo Mo, who was competing with Yi Yun, were stunned as well.</p>
<p>Luo Mo drew a gasp. His handsome face was already turning slightly pale. He mumbled to himself, "A third grade Fey bone relic with the appearance of a runic pattern… 'outstanding' grade!?</p>
<p>Runic pattern?</p>
<p>Outstanding?</p>
<p>The young elites present knew the classification of the grades of relics, even if they were not Desolate Heaven Masters.</p>
<p>It was the emblem of an outstanding grade relic to have a runic pattern condensed on it!</p>
<p>A third-grade relic could only be given the four grades — poor, ordinary, refined and outstanding. Outstanding was already the highest, and higher grades, such as transcendent and spiritual emergence, were only reserved for higher-grade relics.</p>
<p>Refining an 'outstanding' third-grade relic was not difficult for a truly talented Desolate Heaven Master, but… using the seventy-two introductory moves to refine an 'outstanding'-grade relic? Was that even possible?</p>
<p>Chapter 871: Rewards and Conferment</p>
<p>Although the young elites who were present found it unbelievable, the outcome was announced by Yi Yun's opponent, Luo Mo.</p>
<p>They looked at the relic in Yi Yun's hand. It was bluish-purple in color and it looked like a dazzling glass bead. In the middle of it, there was a naturally-formed runic pattern, also known as a Dao pattern.</p>
<p>Dao patterns were the manifestation of the condensation of laws. It was common for them to typically appear in high-grade relics, but they were nearly never seen in low-grade relics.</p>
<p>The seventy-two introductory moves might be described as the Luo clan's technique, but it was prevalent in the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Similar techniques could be found in any lowly-tier sect or family clan's library. It was not even worth mentioning.</p>
<p>This so-called poor technique actually managed to allow him to condense a Dao pattern in the relic?</p>
<p>As the people looked at the relic, before looking at Yi Yun again, they subconsciously moved their Adam's apples.</p>
<p>They even began suspecting that the seventy-two introductory moves that they had learned were faked.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had used the seventy-two introductory moves to refine an 'outstanding'-rated third-grade relic that had condensed a Dao pattern, and it made people feel like a child who had only learned the 'Three Character Classic' had defeated the top scholar.</p>
<p>"I've lost… " Luo Mo looked at the relic and sighed.</p>
<p>In fact, he felt that from the appearance of the relic that Yi Yun refined, it was barely at the 'outstanding' rating. However, the Dao pattern was as clear as it could be. It was a manifestation of Yi Yun's nomological insights.</p>
<p>"What you used was not purely the Luo clan's seventy-two introductory moves, right?" Luo Mo asked. Previously, Yi Yun's technique appeared to have several 'flaws', but from the looks of it now, they knew that their assumptions from before were them being too dumb.</p>
<p>Luo Mo's question was also the question on many people's minds.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded and said, "Months ago, when I was researching the Luo clan's Desolate Heaven technique at Mt. Fengling, I felt that there were some spots where there was room for some experimentation. So I attempted it."</p>
<p>Attempted it?</p>
<p>Everyone was rendered immediately speechless. Are you serious!? Just a few nonchalant attempts made him produce an 'outstanding' relic with the seventy-two introductory moves?</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi is a genius. I admit my inferiority… " Luo Mo sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>Luo Mo admitted defeat and left. At the banquet, everyone watched Luo Mo's departing back, especially Luo Kui. He felt his face turn hot, yearning for the ability to simply vanish from the palace.</p>
<p>Previously, he had insisted that Yi Yun had defeated him through luck, so he was extremely indignant after losing. But from the looks of Yi Yun's Desolate Heaven technique, how was he even able to compete with him? Thankfully, he did not continue to compete with Yi Yun. If not, Luo Kui felt that he might as well have torn the skin of his face.</p>
<p>However, didn't Yi Yun only cultivate for only about thirty years? Where did he have the time to practice the Desolate Heaven technique?</p>
<p>After his win over Luo Mo, no one dared to doubt that Yi Yun had won through luck. In fact, there was no one who dared to foolishly challenge Yi Yun anymore.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was one of the rare Desolate Heaven technique geniuses in the Luo clan!</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament looked at Yi Yun, while his lips moved. He then looked at Princess White Fox. With Luo Mo being defeated, the only person on his side who could compete with Yi Yun was Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament knew that Princess White Fox's talent was astounding, and it was not only limited to the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>However, Princess White Fox only smiled and shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>A look of disappointment flashed in Prince Crimson Firmament's eyes, but it was just fleeting.</p>
<p>He smiled at her, before turning his head to look at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At this banquet, not only had he failed at suppressing Princess Purple Spirit and Empress Xuan, he had also embarrassed himself!</p>
<p>This lower-realm punk, who appeared out of nowhere, had never been thought highly of by him from the very beginning.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun was standing in the middle of the banquet, winning fame for himself in a single match!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox also looked at Yi Yun. An odd brilliance flashed in her eyes that seemed to be covered with a thin layer of snow. The seventy-two introductory moves used by Yi Yun as well as the Dao pattern in the relic had left a deep impression on her. This human youth was very special…</p>
<p>At this moment, Empress Xuan suddenly got up. Her slender fingers held up a glass of spirit wine and said, "Elder Sister, this time, Yi Yun, Luo Mo and Luo Kui's performances have already helped add excitement to the banquet, so why don't we end it here?"</p>
<p>With Empress Xuan saying this, it was equivalent to giving Empress Luo a way out of the awkward situation.</p>
<p>In fact, she had to give the way out. Although Yi Yun had used his Desolate Heaven technique at the banquet to help regain her pride, in a battle of true strength, Empress Xuan was still too weak.</p>
<p>Just a single Yi Yun allowed her camp to be peerless in the Desolate Heaven technique, but at the Luo Divine Hall trials, it was a competition of strength, not the Desolate Heaven technique!</p>
<p>Hence, although Empress Xuan was greatly delighted seeing Empress Luo and Crimson Firmament suffer the setback, she had no choice but to take the initiative to provide such a gesture.</p>
<p>Empress Luo had already sat back on her seat. Due to the loss of her composure from before as well as the defeat at the banquet, any discerning person could tell that she did not look happy.</p>
<p>After hearing Empress Xuan's words and then looking at Empress Xuan's obvious good mood, Empress Luo's mood turned even more sullen.</p>
<p>"Younger Sister is right. We should end it here." Empress Luo said.</p>
<p>At this moment, Empress Xuan glanced at Yi Yun and said with a smile, "Yi Yun's performance was not bad and it should be worthy of a reward as a form of encouragement."</p>
<p>"That is natural. Our Luo clan has always had a love for talent. Such a Desolate Heaven technique genius obviously has to be rewarded." Empress Luo said with a nod.</p>
<p>"This Empress shall award Yi Yun three hundred World Stones, twenty fourth-grade relics, and ten fifth-grade Fey bones." Empress Luo said.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er secretly rolled her eyes. What stinginess!</p>
<p>How do you even have the nerve to give such a tiny reward?</p>
<p>Following that, Luo Huo'er looked at her mother.</p>
<p>"Mother, you must award him more!" Luo Huo'er said with a Yuan Qi voice transmission.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan smiled and said, "Yi Yun is not one of Empress Luo's men after all. It's reasonable for her to give such a small reward. As for me, I will not be stingy. Yi Yun has truly helped us a lot. Huo'er, you are also lucky to have met such an amazing person in the lower realm."</p>
<p>"Hehe, thank you, Mother… " Luo Huo'er said with a happy smile. It was rare for her to be praised.</p>
<p>At this moment, Empress Xuan looked at Yi Yun and said, "This Empress has yet to think of a good reward for you at the moment… Seeing how you are only a normal civilian, This Empress shall confer you a title of nobility. You shall be a first-ranked viscount, with Xuan Ye Spiritual Mountain as your fief!"</p>
<p>Xuan Ye Spiritual Mountain was a fief that belonged to the Xuan family. Since Empress Xuan was an empress, she naturally had the right to make the decision of conferring Yi Yun with nobility.</p>
<p>And this superior-grade spiritual mountain had been used by the Xuan family as a cultivation ground for their descendants.</p>
<p>But now, it had been awarded to Yi Yun!</p>
<p>A superior grade spiritual mountain, and a first-ranked viscount title!</p>
<p>When they heard this, the young elites present were amazed and they were also filled with envy.</p>
<p>Previously, Luo Kui had derided Yi Yun's lack of status to sit beside Luo Huo'er. But now, Yi Yun was a first-grade viscount!</p>
<p>Looking at Luo Kui again, although he came from a large family clan, he did not even have the lowest nobility ranking.</p>
<p>Just having a nobility title, despite the annual salary being low, Yi Yun's status in the Luo clan would be greatly different most importantly!</p>
<p>After all, the brilliance of one background was a result of one's ancestors. However, once one was conferred with nobility, it was because of having a true ability of their own right. Many disciples of the large family clans would never be conferred with nobility in their entire lives.</p>
<p>People who were conferred with nobility had done enough to earn their respect. Just having a first-grade viscount title forced anyone who wanted to deride Yi Yun's background to rethink if they had the qualifications to even do so!</p>
<p>By giving such a reward, Empress Xuan had clearly taken this point into consideration.</p>
<p>People mocked Yi Yun for his lower realm background, Empress Xuan gave him a superior-grade spiritual mountain. Others felt that he had a lowly status, she gave him a first-grade viscount title.</p>
<p>Through Empress Xuan's light and calm actions, she had smacked the faces of many people present.</p>
<p>"The Xuan Ye Spiritual Mountain can be given to you now. As for the first-grade viscount, it requires Emperor Luo to approve of it before an edict is issued."</p>
<p>The so-called approval of Emperor Luo was just a mere formality. Empress Xuan's family clan had the rank of a duke, so it was nothing to give the title of viscount.</p>
<p>Chapter 872: Summoning from Empress Xuan</p>
<p>Empress Luo's banquet had ended in a way that was completely unexpected. As for Yi Yun's name, it became well-known amongst the circles of the top elites of various states as well as the upper echelons of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>He had come from a lower realm, but he had managed to obtain first place in a combined training of the two states, the Fire Cloud State and the Phoenix Firmiana State. This achievement might not have been astounding, but defeating Luo Mo with his Desolate Heaven technique, he had truly vaulted into prominence!</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was at the zenith of attention. Especially for him being in his thirties, his future was beyond promising.</p>
<p>At this moment, in a particular hall of the Xushui Ran clan.</p>
<p>Ran Yu was lying prostrate on the ground. Both his hands were held to the ground. Due to using excessive force in his fingers, his veins began bulging out.</p>
<p>In front of Ran Yu sat a middle-aged man. In his hand was a book that he was reading in silence.</p>
<p>This middle-aged man was one of the Elders of the Xushui Ran clan, and he was also Ran Yu's Fourth Uncle, who had always been Ran Yu's backer.</p>
<p>But just a while ago, the middle-aged man had informed Ran Yu of the matters regarding Empress Luo's banquet. Ran Yu's heart was palpitating when he heard the information. The details of the matter were unbelievable, but how could his uncle deceive him?</p>
<p>Yi Yun also knew the Desolate Heaven technique!</p>
<p>Ran Yu did not have a single bit of understanding of the Desolate Heaven technique. He had focused his heart and mind on cultivation. The Desolate Heaven technique was extremely time consuming, but even so, his attainment in cultivation was inferior to Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>The gap was just too great…</p>
<p>"Don't provoke Yi Yun any further. You can't afford to. The family has decided to no longer target Yi Yun."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man had extinguished Ran Yu's hopes with a figurative basin of cold water, causing Ran Yu's body to jolt.</p>
<p>"But our Xushui Ran clan's reputation… " Ran Yu said in disgruntlement.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" The middle-aged man coldly snorted and said, "Reputation is relative. If Yi Yun was an ant, even if he had bitten you gently, it would be easy to trample him to death. But now, he is no longer an ant. Our Ran clan isn't afraid of Yi Yun obviously, but Yi Yun is currently thriving, and with his close relationship with Princess Purple Spirit, our Ran clan may be able to deal with Yi Yun, but the cost would be too high. It's not worth it!"</p>
<p>Once the middle-aged man said this, Ran Yu's fingers nearly tore the ground open while he was kneeling…</p>
<p>Why was this happening? Just a month ago, Yi Yun was just like an ant in his eyes.</p>
<p>But now, be it his identity, status, and fame, they were all far inferior to Yi Yun's. Even his family clan had chosen to avoid the cutting edge with the situation in front of them!</p>
<p>The middle-aged man added on, "Now, Yi Yun is living in a viscount residence. In the future, he will often be in the royal capital. As for you… Choose any one of the Ran clan's other state's mundane estates, and I will do my best at arranging it for you."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man stood up while speaking, and he left the hall, leaving Ran Yu slumped to the ground. Minding the family estate and slowly die of old age? Was this his outcome… ?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Luo clan's royal capital was a sacred land of the Luo clan, where many elites stayed.</p>
<p>Not everyone was eligible to have a residence in the Luo clan's royal capital, much less the breathtaking price of its land.</p>
<p>Being able to own a house in the royal capital was itself a badge of honor.</p>
<p>And now, Yi Yun had obtained a mansion that occupied a circumference of nearly half a mile.</p>
<p>This was the Xuan family's estate in the royal capital, and now, it had been conferred onto Yi Yun as his viscount residence.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun first entered the viscount residence, a number of people had sent him congratulatory gifts, but it was not bustling with visitors. On the contrary, the number of people who visited Yi Yun were very few in number.</p>
<p>After all, Yi Yun was on Empress Xuan's side. During the crucial period of the vying of the throne, the factions in the royal capital had to be very cautious in their dealings with people on both sides.</p>
<p>On the first night that Yi Yun stayed in the viscount residence, a visitor came. He was a golden-armored guard from the royal palace. He had come with news — Empress Xuan wanted to meet Yi Yun.</p>
<p>It was understandable that Empress Xuan wanted to meet Yi Yun after the banquet.</p>
<p>After packing his things slightly, he accompanied the golden-armored guard straight for Fenghua Palace.</p>
<p>This was the first time that Yi Yun had visited the Luo clan's royal palace. Looking ahead, it was littered with immortal mountains, with palatial buildings all over it.</p>
<p>The core royal palace was shrouded by a large array and it was invisible. The lofty Emperor Luo lived in the core vicinity of this area.</p>
<p>As for Fenghua Palace, it was located to the back of the royal palace, and similarly, it was protected by a powerful array. Under the escort of the golden-armored guard, Yi Yun successfully entered the palace.</p>
<p>Most of Fenghua Palace was covered with red glass tiles. From afar, Fenghua Palace looked like a fire phoenix that lived in the deep mountains. It was beautiful and brilliant.</p>
<p>"Little Yun!"</p>
<p>The moment that Yi Yun stepped into Fenghua Palace's main hall, he heard a pleasantly surprised voice. It was Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned his head and he saw Luo Huo'er wearing a red tunic as she walked towards him with a grin. Fenghua Palace's main hall was covered with down feather carpet, so Luo Huo'er simply walked bare-footed. Her fair toes looked like a string of white pearls.</p>
<p>And behind Luo Huo'er was Empress Xuan.</p>
<p>As empress, she was elegant and had esteemed deportment. However, when Empress Xuan looked at her daughter, she shook her head.</p>
<p>Usually, Luo Huo'er would bear with it and barely act like a princess when she was out of the palace. But in the palace, there was no inkling from her actions that she was a princess.</p>
<p>Now, in front of Yi Yun, Luo Huo'er was behaving as such.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun greets Your Majesty Empress Xuan, and greets… "</p>
<p>"There's no need for formalities." Seeing Yi Yun about to seriously call her Princess Purple Spirit, Luo Huo'er found it awkward, and she hurriedly cut Yi Yun off. Although Yi Yun called her princess, he was probably holding back his laughter deep down.</p>
<p>"It's been a while since we have met. Little Yun, you have made quite a lot of progress. Not bad, not bad at all. This Princess is very pleased! Thinking of the times back in the lower realm, you had a lot of talent in the Desolate Heaven technique. Back then, This Princess had already thought highly of your talent." Luo Huo'er walked up to him and said with a giggle.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard this sentence, he somehow found it somewhat weird…</p>
<p>"When you return to your residence, you need to grasp the opportunity to cultivate. The Luo Divine Hall trials are around the corner, so you should be entering reclusion." As Luo Huo'er said this, she smiled at Yi Yun. "Alright, go on. Enter reclusive training until the trials begin. Don't be distracted!"</p>
<p>What was going on? Yi Yun was scratching his head. He had been summoned here so they could tell him a few sentences? And then get him to enter reclusive training?</p>
<p>Yi Yun blankly looked at Empress Xuan, and he heard her say, "There's no hurry. This Empress still has a few things to talk to you about."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er hurriedly said, "Mother, Little Yun needs to enter reclusive training!"</p>
<p>"It's only a few things, it won't severely delay his reclusion." After Empress Xuan said this, she smiled at Yi Yun. "Yi Yun, since you already know Huo'er from the lower realm, there is no need to be too formal in front of This Empress."</p>
<p>"Huo'er mentioned that when you first met, it was not a jovial relationship and there was some friction between the two of you. This Empress knows Huo'er's character, so it's not odd that she would stir something up. However, on the matter regarding the relic, that had gone too far. This Empress had already reprimanded her."</p>
<p>The matter regarding the relic? Was it about the explosion of the relic during the refining process?</p>
<p>That was Luo Huo'er attempting to trick Yi Yun into making a fool of himself, which resulted in…</p>
<p>It was probably because of Luo Kui having blown up his cauldron that Luo Huo'er finally confirmed that the reason behind her relic exploding was all because of Yi Yun's machinations.</p>
<p>Chapter 873: Princess Exchange</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stood beside Yi Yun and she signaled him with her eyes. Just as she was about to send a Yuan Qi voice transmission, Empress Xuan had lightly glanced at her. Luo Huo'er gaped her mouth and no longer spoke.</p>
<p>Yi Yun faltered and glanced at Luo Huo'er before looking at Empress Xuan. He was somewhat confused. Could this impish brat have complained to Empress Xuan and hoped that her mother would avenge her… ?</p>
<p>He honestly said, "Back in the lower realm, the matter regarding the relic was just Her Highness pulling a prank on this lowly one. However, this lowly one had been thoughtless and offensive towards the princess. This lowly one seeks forgiveness from Your Majesty."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Luo Huo'er's face blushed red. As for Empress Xuan, she stared at Luo Huo'er and said to Yi Yun with a smile, "What Huo'er told me was that you had bullied her. Why does it sound like it was the other way around?"</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was taken aback. He had believed that the imp was going to use her status as princess to seek revenge on him. But from the looks of it, things did not play out that way… He was the one who had been bullied to begin with. But from the way that Empress Xuan said it, it sounded as though Luo Huo'er had been victorious.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was at a loss as to what to say momentarily. The relic's explosion was actually nothing serious, but if Empress Xuan knew about him seeing Luo Huo'er's body, that would be…</p>
<p>Yi Yun dryly coughed and he felt that it was better for him to speak less today. It was better to just listen to what Empress Xuan had to say.</p>
<p>In fact, after the banquet had ended today, Empress Xuan had asked Luo Huo'er on matters regarding Yi Yun. Luo Huo'er never expected that Empress Xuan would ask about such trivial matters. She had previously embellished her embarrassing matters, transferring all the sufferance onto Yi Yun. She had never expected that her mother would be so maleficent to summon Yi Yun and debunk her right there and then.</p>
<p>Indeed, a mother knows her daughter best.</p>
<p>Empress Xuan sized up Yi Yun curiously. She knew that her daughter had been accustomed to being an imp in the royal capital. The guards and palace maids had all suffered under the hands of Luo Huo'er. Only a maid servant like Dong'er, who was silly enough to make Luo Huo'er feel like there was no achievement in bullying her, could accompany Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>However, Empress Xuan had never expected that someone from a tiny place in the lower realm would make Luo Huo'er suffer. She found it amusing momentarily.</p>
<p>Of course, this was just the fooling around of children in her opinion.</p>
<p>Debunking one was sufficient, so Empress Xuan did not probe any further. Instead, she asked Yi Yun, "Are you accustomed to living in the viscount residence?"</p>
<p>With the topic being changed, Luo Huo'er heaved a sigh of relief. If Empress Xuan knew of her exposure, with Empress Xuan's understanding of her and Yi Yun's blockhead like answers, she would truly have to kill herself once the truth was revealed!</p>
<p>Yi Yun said, "The viscount residence is spacious and comfortable. Thank you, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"Alright, that's good. What Huo'er said is correct as well. The Luo Divine Hall trials are filled with experts and geniuses. You have to make a lot of preparations. You have to know that although you have gotten a lot of attention at the banquet, that's only on the Desolate Heaven technique aspect of things. On Empress Luo's side, they are gearing themselves up to push you down from your pedestal at the Luo Divine Hall trials. This Empress will not lie to you. The number of top geniuses in This Empress' camp is far lower in those in Empress Luo's camp. At the Luo Divine Hall trials, it will not be easy on you!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded at Empress Xuan's warning. He obviously had foreseen such matters.</p>
<p>"Right, This Empress has summoned you here to let you stay in Fenghua Palace and cultivate. The cultivating grounds here are much better than your viscount residence. You can use any of them. Huo'er will be with you."</p>
<p>With Empress Xuan saying this, Yi Yun thought of something and asked, "Is Her Highness also participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun had believed that with Luo Huo'er being at a suitable age, it was reasonable for her to join the Luo Divine Hall trials, but he never expected that Empress Xuan would shake her head and say, "No, Huo'er will be going to the White Fox clan and participating in the collective training and trials in the White Fox clan. And in exchange, Princess White Fox will be staying for the Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>Empress Xuan's words caught Yi Yun by surprise.</p>
<p>Exchange?</p>
<p>The Luo clan and the White Fox clan were to exchange princesses? What was that for? A rite for the alliance of the two clans?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was somewhat curious, but asking Empress Xuan directly was impolite. Furthermore, from the look on Empress Xuan's face, she did not appear to be fond of the idea. Her slight change in expression made it clear.</p>
<p>"Alright, as for your residence, Huo'er will arrange it for you. You can take your leave. Huo'er, take Yi Yun around so that he familiarizes himself with the surroundings."</p>
<p>After Empress Xuan said this, she waved her hand.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er was still extremely embarrassed. Upon hearing Empress Xuan's instructions, she heaved a sigh of relief. Spitting out her tongue, she tugged at Yi Yun's sleeves and said, "Leave quickly! Why are you so good at reading people? You nearly caused This Princess to embarrass herself!"</p>
<p>Out of the hall, Luo Huo'er had pursed her lips and had said unhappily.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was rendered speechless. What the heck was this? You were the one lying, and all I did was tell the truth.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you. We'll forget about the relic explosion. If that matter ever leaks out, This Princess will strangle you to death… " Luo Huo'er said with a blushed face when she reached this part in the sentence. "You know what I'm referring to, right?"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was too embarrassed to say it loud, but Yi Yun had guessed it. He was tickled, but he endured it. Trying his best to have a serious expression on his face, he said, "I know what matter you are talking about. I won't talk about it."</p>
<p>"You still have the nerve to laugh!?" For some reason, Luo Huo'er had seen through him and she immediately flared up.</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave a look of grievance. He swore to the heavens that he did not even move his lips, but Luo Huo'er was already certain that he wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>"This Princess warns you. That matter is not to be spoken to anyone. It's best that you forget it at once! You lucked out and you still want laugh? You are infuriating This Princess to death." Luo Huo'er said angrily.</p>
<p>"I'm not laughing… " Yi Yun protested. Indeed, he had not laughed.</p>
<p>"You are thinking of laughing in your heart, so that counts." Luo Huo'er said with great certainty, as though she had seen through him.</p>
<p>"… "</p>
<p>Yi Yun was rendered speechless. He knew that he could not outspeak Luo Huo'er, so he changed the topic of conversation and asked, "Princess Purple Spirit, I want to ask you… "</p>
<p>"Wait, it's better you call me Luo Huo'er. If not, Huo'er is fine as well. Princess Purple Spirit is too awkward."</p>
<p>"Uh… fine. Huo'er, previously, Empress Xuan mentioned that you will be participating in the trials at the White Fox clan, and Empress Xuan appeared unhappy about the arrangements. Why was that so?"</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's question, a new bout of anger came from Luo Huo'er. As she ground her canines, she said huffily, "It's all that witch, Empress Luo's idea. She wants her son to marry Princess White Fox. By marrying her, Crimson Firmament's status would be higher. And who knows what the White Fox clan is thinking, they actually agreed to it!"</p>
<p>"However, despite the White Fox clan appearing to readily agree on the surface, how can they be assured to leave their princess here for the Luo clan's trials? Hence, they proposed to send me to the White Fox clan. As such, an exchange would put their minds to rest!"</p>
<p>"According to Mother, Empress Luo has another idea. Not only does she want to allow Crimson Firmament to marry Princess White Fox, she wants This Princess to be fancied by some fox guy at their clan. When the time comes, I'll be married off to the White Fox clan, then I won't have the qualifications to fight Crimson Firmament for the throne!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun stared with widened eyes at her when he heard this. There were so many hidden intents in this simple scheme.</p>
<p>"Then His Majesty has agreed to it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Father has agreed. Our Luo clan hasn't recovered yet and it is indeed in need of allies. However, if they are thinking of marrying This Princess off, that will be naivety on their part. Those fox men are as effeminate as they can be. I won't fancy that, and if I disagree with it, Father will not force me!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. However, if the White Fox clan had a prince that was heir apparent pursuing Luo Huo'er, Emperor Luo would probably have to deliberate on it…</p>
<p>If Crimson Firmament were to marry Princess White Fox, and Luo Huo'er were to marry the new White Fox Emperor, the two clans' alliance would become unbreakable.</p>
<p>As for the Luo clan's greatest enemy — the Fey Phantasm Sect, who came from the sinkhole, and had attacked all the way to the Luo clan's royal capital a few decades ago — they would no longer be as fearful.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was somewhat worried for Luo Huo'er. When something that truly involved the continuation of a clan, a father's law might not be able to withstand the mission of an emperor. If not, he would not be a qualified emperor. Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Luo Huo'er had succeeded in resisting it, her standing in Emperor Luo's heart would drastically deteriorate as a result of this matter. It would then be highly unlikely that she would inherit the throne.</p>
<p>Empress Luo's machinations seemed simple, but they were very deadly. This was probably the reason why Empress Xuan had an unhappy look.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun was thinking, Luo Huo'er's next sentence nearly caused him to stumble to the ground.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er said, "I say, Little Yun, when you are taking part in the Luo Divine Hall trials, go win over the little white fox's hand. If you were to snatch the wife-to-be of Crimson Firmament, that would be fun. Hehe."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Yi Yun was rendered speechless. "I have a wife."</p>
<p>"Oh? You are married? But that's no big deal. In the Fey race, a warrior can engage in polygamy. It's nothing odd." Luo Huo'er said indifferently.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stared at her and he could not be bothered to speak any further. However, if someone truly snatched Princess White Fox away, Crimson Firmament would probably be screaming bloody murder. That was not only the hatred coming from snatching his loved one, it also threatened his path to the throne.</p>
<p>"Tch, it was just a joke. Furthermore, even if you were to pursue her, you might not even succeed. That little white fox has very high standards. She might not even think anything of you. Hehe." Luo Huo'er laughed when she said this. She would never give up on a chance to strike at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Chapter 874: The Fox is Here</p>
<p>As Empress Xuan's palace, Fenghua Palace was much better than the viscount residence when it came to cultivating. It was practically one of the top cultivating grounds in the Luo clan royal capital.</p>
<p>In the following days, Yi Yun peacefully cultivated in Fenghua Palace. His living arrangements were arranged by the palace maids that Empress Xuan assigned to him. He cultivated together with Luo Huo'er and they would spar at times. Time passed very quickly.</p>
<p>On this day, the sky above Fenghua Palace suddenly buzzed with pearly sounds. It sounded distant but melodious to the ear. Even the palace maids in the cultivation ground could not help but look up.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eyes, a few white ribbons fell from the magnolia clouds, linking the sky to the ground. White lights beamed, as though a palace from the nine heavens had descended.</p>
<p>On the ribbons stood a line of figures. The person leading them had white hair that drooped down to the ground and he wore silk clothes under a fox-fur robe. Several strongmen followed behind him. The other figures were beauties dressed in pink tops and blue skirts. The pearly sounds was a result from the adornments on their heads, which chimed in the wind.</p>
<p>With these people appearing, they resembled immortals that lived in the heavens. They were a feast for the eyes and dazzling to the common people. The sound of their footsteps made anyone who heard them involuntarily feel like they were indulging in the greatest of pleasures.</p>
<p>Yi Yun heard it for a moment before he cleared his mind and recovered his senses.</p>
<p>"Who are these people? Are they allowed to fly above Fenghua Palace?" Yi Yun asked.</p>
<p>"Young Master, they are people from the White Fox clan." A palace maid responded.</p>
<p>People from the White Fox? It was surprising that they could fly above Fenghua Palace. Typical nobles had to land from afar when they approached the royal palaces and enter the palace by foot.</p>
<p>The expedition of the White Fox clan had magnolia clouds paving their paths, accompanied by divine music, making them appear like gods. This was very different to the Luo clan. Whenever the Luo clan's royal family went on an expedition, they would usually choose a domineering mount with Ancient Fey bloodlines. It would look full of pomp, but it would lack a certain bit of elegance.</p>
<p>"It's rather elegant." Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>He knew that the magnolia clouds and ribbons were something similar to spirit cruisers. However, the price of them was a lot more higher. As for the adornments, they must have had mystical arrays engraved on them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun recalled Princess White Fox, who he had met at the banquet. It couldn't be her, right?</p>
<p>The white ribbons descended towards Fenghua Palace, and in a while, a palace maid came from the front hall and said, "Young Master Yi, Her Majesty and Her Highness invite you over."</p>
<p>"I'll be right there." Yi Yun changed out of his cultivation clothes and he followed the palace maid to the front hall.</p>
<p>Upon entering, Yi Yun saw the dozen or more girls who previously stood on the ribbons.</p>
<p>The girls' faces were like peach flowers and they were all very tall. They looked nearly identical, clearly a result of a careful selection.</p>
<p>Yi Yun noticed their charming eyes with their fox tails swaying behind them. Indeed, they were girls from the fox clan.</p>
<p>And on the main seat of the hall sat Empress Xuan. And slightly lower than her sat Luo Huo'er on the left and a person with white hair dressed in fox-fur on the right.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was truly taken aback seeing this person's appearance. The person's white hair shimmered with a silver light, and it sprawled down from his head like now.</p>
<p>He was clearly a male, but his looks were more exquisite than a female. In the middle of his brows were three cinnabar dots, adding a feminine touch to him, but he emitted a manly aura, reminiscent of a dragon. He was clearly an esteemed man who had lived through chaotic times.</p>
<p>"How is it, Little Yun? Are you surprised? That is a male seductive fox." At this moment, Luo Huo'er's voice transmission echoed in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard Luo Huo'er's words, he nearly burst out laughing. Thankfully, he was not drinking tea, or he might have sprayed it all out.</p>
<p>From the sound of Luo Huo'er's tone, she was displeased with the white-haired youth.</p>
<p>At this moment, Empress Xuan spoke, "Third Prince, this is Yi Yun. Yi Yun, this is the Third Prince of the White Fox clan. He came specially to visit our Luo clan royal capital. He had heard news of your performance at the banquet and he wanted to meet you. Third Prince is also a person who appreciates talents."</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, you can just call me Bai Yueqing." Bai Yueqing said. His voice sounded pleasant to the ears, but it sounded a little effeminate. He smiled at Empress Xuan before looking at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The moment that he was looked at by the Third Prince of the White Fox clan, Yi Yun felt that he was being probed.</p>
<p>This feeling was very weak. If not for Yi Yun's Purple Crystal, it was nearly undetectable.</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned slightly.</p>
<p>To engage in such a probe after having just met. Was Bai Yueqing certain that he would not have been able to detect it?</p>
<p>Upon seeing Yi Yun's frown, Bai Yueqing's slender eyes narrowed slightly as he seemed to reveal a smile. It could truly be described as a coquettish gaze.</p>
<p>"I heard from Xue'er that this Yi Yun is rather interesting and I was wondering what sort of person he was… But meeting him today, there is naturally no way to compare him to a gem like Prince Crimson Firmament. Even compared to Prince Crimson Firmament's subordinate, Luo Mo, it seems like he is far inferior. In terms of cultivation level, strength and foundation… especially his body's lifeblood strength, it is far inferior to the Fey race."</p>
<p>"However, Xue'er seldom exaggerates. Since she described the situation at the banquet, it is apparently true. However, it is highly unlikely that he modified the seventy-two introductory moves himself to refine an 'outstanding' third-grade relic. Yi Yun probably managed to come across a fascinating modified mystic version of the seventy-two moves, and he had specially prepared for the banquet to be make such an astounding performance. If not, why was there a need to request to compete in introductory moves… ?"</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing quickly came to a conclusion. He did not believe there was such a level of genius in this world. It was likely that Yi Yun had used a clever trick or some other deceptive methods.</p>
<p>He had hoped that Princess White Fox would tie the knot with Prince Crimson Firmament after going to the Luo clan, so that both sides would form an alliance. In the future, when Bai Yueqing inherited the throne, his power would be stabilized as a result. The White Fox clan's reputation would increase and it would expand its influence.</p>
<p>However, after Princess White Fox saw Yi Yun, her description of Prince Crimson Firmament was rather dull, and instead, she had talked more about Yi Yun.</p>
<p>She had even said that Princess Purple Spirit and Yi Yun appeared like old acquaintances and it even looked like a good relationship. Back then at the banquet, Yi Yun sat beside Princess Purple Spirit, and he was just across Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>This made Bai Yueqing extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>Hence, the moment he came to Fenghua Palace, he immediately requested to meet Yi Yun. However, when he met Yi Yun, Bai Yueqing was somewhat disappointed. He had the White Fox Heaven Eye, so he could tell Yi Yun's cultivation level and strength at a glance. At the beginning stages of the Heaven Ascension realm, Yi Yun was not worthy enough for him, even if Yi Yun was skilled in the Desolate Heaven technique.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of background and status, Yi Yun was far inferior to him. If he took Yi Yun as a love rival, that would be sully his status. He believed that Luo Huo'er would definitely not truly fall in love with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>From Luo Huo'er's innocent demeanor, he believed that she did not think about boy-girl relationships too much. It was unlikely she would be moved by anyone. Hence, it was best if he slowly nurtured their feelings on this matter.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing smiled after these thoughts flashed in his mind.</p>
<p>"So you are Yi Yun. Your performance is pretty good." Bai Yueqing nodded his head slightly, while his tone sounded like a warm spring breeze.</p>
<p>"This male seductive fox sure is cocky. Who does he think he is? He thinks he's some heaven's gift to women. Does Little Yun even need his evaluation!?" Luo Huo'er pouted her mouth and began transmitting her voice to the people around her.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard this, he held back his laughter and remained silent.</p>
<p>Chapter 875: Luo Huo'er's Maleficent Idea</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, I came here firstly to visit the Luo clan royal capital on invitation, and secondly to see Princess Purple Spirit. And as a matter of convenience, I will take the princess to the White Fox clan." Bai Yueqing turned towards Luo Huo'er, his tone suddenly sounding even more pleasant.</p>
<p>The way he looked at Luo Huo'er made her feel uncomfortable all over. "What is this male seductive fox doing? Why are his eyes so salacious? It's giving me goosebumps all over."</p>
<p>And from Yi Yun's side, he felt that the arrogant Bai Yueqing had now changed the way he looked at Luo Huo'er. It was tender, and like his mouth was filled with honey.</p>
<p>"Uh, is this person one of the White Fox princes that you previously mentioned… one that might fancy you?" Yi Yun asked with a voice transmission.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, it was no longer a possibility, but a fact.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stared with widened eyes. d</p>
<p>"That can't be! That old witch, Empress Luo, has already found someone! Furthermore, it's a male seductive fox! Just being around that fellow gives me goosebumps all over, alright!?"</p>
<p>Only then did Luo Huo'er come to a realization. Empress Luo must have 'sold' her. Allowing Crimson Firmament to marry Princess White Fox on one side, while on the other side, she was 'sold' to the White Fox clan. It was killing two birds with one stone!</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing had been invited by Empress Luo. He came here for her!</p>
<p>No wonder the moment that this person appeared, he gave Luo Huo'er a feeling that the way he looked at her was rather strange.</p>
<p>"Alright, This Princess still hasn't even gone to the White Fox clan, and a candidate has already been chosen for her. The candidate has even been summoned here!"</p>
<p>"Huo'er." At this moment, Empress Xuan spoke lightly, cutting Luo Huo'er, who was about to flare up, off.</p>
<p>She glanced at Luo Huo'er and gave her a nearly unnoticeable shake of her head.</p>
<p>Although Empress Xuan had stopped Luo Huo'er, she too was furious about this matter.</p>
<p>Empress Luo had taken the liberties to carry out her own plan so her son could inherit the throne and marry off her, Empress Xuan's daughter, to the White Fox clan. There was disregard for her daughter's thoughts, and she was using the entire Luo clan's interests as ransom for her daughter.</p>
<p>This was truly an ingenuous strategy!</p>
<p>Empress Xuan looked at Bai Yueqing. Despite her rage, she did not do anything that would appear demeaning to her bearing.</p>
<p>With the Luo clan facing the threat of the Fey Phantasm Sect, Bai Yueqing represented the White Fox clan. They were their reliable ally, so if their alliance were to break up because of this matter, regardless of how much Emperor Luo loved Luo Huo'er, he too would be incensed.</p>
<p>In that case, even if Luo Huo'er did not marry into the White Fox clan, she would be ineligible for the throne.</p>
<p>"Third Prince, you are so thoughtful." Empress Xuan said lightly.</p>
<p>"Huo'er, the exchange between you and Princess White Fox has been approved by your father. You have to go for the White Fox clan's trials. There's no need for you to worry. You are our Luo clan's princess, and one of the heirs to the throne. No matter how bold Bai Yueqing is, he would not dare to force you. If you don't like him, just keep a distance away from him." Empress Xuan transmitted her voice to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>The Luo clan's status was equal to the White Fox clan's. Both sides would not lose their decorum.</p>
<p>If Luo Huo'er were to go to the White Fox clan, she would be in the same situation as Princess White Fox. It was a similar exchange, which meant they were candidates as marriage partners. Prince Crimson Firmament was extremely polite to Princess White Fox. Even at Empress Luo's banquet, they did not sit together, so Bai Yueqing would have to act in a similar manner.</p>
<p>However, with Luo Huo'er's character, even if she knew this, she still felt extremely upset!</p>
<p>And at this moment, Bai Yueqing spoke again, "I've heard since a long time ago that Princess Purple Spirit is intelligent and is extremely talented. After the White Fox trials, This Prince wishes to invite Princess Purple Spirit to stay in the White Fox clan for a period of time. Princess Purple Spirit can also travel around the White Fox clan, and This Prince will accompany Princess Purple Spirit to introduce her to the customs of the land… "</p>
<p>When Bai Yueqing said this, Luo Huo'er could no longer tolerate it any further. Throughout all his rambling, Luo Huo'er only understood one thing.</p>
<p>Other than the exchange, this male seductive fox actually wanted to keep her back to travel around the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>This traveling was apparently going to be used as an opportunity to saunter in front of her.</p>
<p>This person was someone forcefully arranged by Empress Luo to begin with. Furthermore, he was an effeminate male fox that was trying to cling to her. This incensed Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>"I'm a princess of the Luo clan, it is downright improper to spend prolonged periods of time in foreign lands." Luo Huo'er wrinkled her face as she refused.</p>
<p>"His Majesty Emperor Luo seems to be supportive of princes and princesses travelling the world so they could draw on more martial arts essence. Furthermore, the Luo clan and my White Fox clan has always enjoyed good relations. Your Highness, don't you worry. If you want to learn any cultivation techniques of my White Fox clan, I can choose a batch of young elites from my White Fox clan to spar with Your Highness, so as to improve your strength… "</p>
<p>"Not interested!"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was on her last straw. Did this male fox even know how to read between the lines!?</p>
<p>"In that case… " Bai Yueqing's smile began to vanish. He was not a fool, so he could obviously tell from Luo Huo'er's reactions that he was disliked.</p>
<p>He was a proud person. His status was not one bit lower than Luo Huo'er's. To repeatedly hit a wall, he obviously did not feel good about it.</p>
<p>In the White Fox clan, which woman did not scramble to gain his favor?</p>
<p>"From the looks of it, Your Highness does not think much of my White Fox's mystic techniques and also looks down on my White Fox clan's geniuses."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er grunted, but she did not speak a word. Indeed, she didn't think highly of them.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't Your Highness make a bet with This Prince?" Bai Yueqing suddenly asked. Luo Huo'er ignored him, but he continued speaking, "Regarding the upcoming trial… it's not a boast on This Prince's part, but there are many young talents amongst the White Fox clan's younger generation. This Prince's younger sister, Princess White Fox, is an obvious case that does not need mentioning. If Your Highness doesn't think highly of my White Fox clan's young talents, This Prince can get a number of them to give up on the White Fox trials and transfer them to participate in the Luo clan's Luo Divine Hall trials. We can learn through an exchange!"</p>
<p>"Your Luo clan's young geniuses can also come to my White Fox clan! Finally, we can compare the final results!"</p>
<p>"Princess Purple Spirit is obviously a wondrous genius and you would have dazzling results. However, This Prince's sister, Princess White Fox, would not be inferior to Princess Purple Spirit."</p>
<p>"As for the final outcome… This Prince believes that out of ten, our White Fox clan would take up at least six!"</p>
<p>Six!?</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stared with widened eyes, while Empress Xuan frowned slightly. They were obviously not pleased with the words that he said.</p>
<p>The Luo clan had never been inferior to the White Fox clan, be it the experts in the clan or the younger generation.</p>
<p>But now, Bai Yueqing had made a bold statement.</p>
<p>"If Your Highness doesn't believe in it, why don't you make a bet with This Prince? If what This Prince claims is validated, Your Highness can stay behind and travel around the White Fox clan. What does Your Highness think about this?"</p>
<p>Defeat me? Luo Huo'er's almond-shaped eyes stared at him. This male fox spirit was beginning to act like a bushy-tailed wolf.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had to participate in the trials, but even with Luo Huo'er being included, Bai Yueqing predicted that the results would be six out of ten in his favor!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun's voice transmission rang in Luo Huo'er's ears. "Don't fall for his goading. There is no need for you to take up the bet. If you lose, you end up staying in the White Fox clan, but there's no benefit in winning… "</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned as he glanced at Bai Yueqing. Bai Yueqing definitely had something backing him for him to dare make such a bold claim. It could not have been thin air.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Little Yun. This Princess isn't stupid!"</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's words made Yi Yun nod his head secretly. However, the next sentence of hers made Yi Yun nearly spit whatever he had in his mouth out.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll bet with you." Luo Huo'er said.</p>
<p>What the heck, Luo Huo'er? Didn't she say she wasn't stupid!? Yi Yun was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>A smile flashed on Bai Yueqing's face before it disappeared. From his appearance, it looked as though he had everything under control. "Then it is agreed."</p>
<p>"You haven't said what will happen if you lose!"</p>
<p>"If I lose, This Prince will give Your Highness a gift that she won't expect!" Bai Yueqing used a mysterious tone in his words.</p>
<p>However, Luo Huo'er felt like giving him a slap when she heard this. Who wants a gift from a male fox like you!?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing probably noticed Luo Huo'er's look of repulsiveness. He adjusted his body and he felt somewhat embarrassed. His gifts were something that numerous people yearned for, but she was repulsed at his offering of a gift.</p>
<p>"Princess Purple Spirit, other than gifts, whatever Your Highness wants, This Prince will also satisfy you, as long as the Luo clan wins."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing could only take a step back so as to make Luo Huo'er take up the bet.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er said, "You will satisfy me with whatever? Alright. This Princess is a pragmatic person who loves Ancient Fey bones, especially supreme-grade Ancient Fey bones. Giving seven or eight hundred of them would do."</p>
<p>What Luo Huo'er said nearly choked Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing dryly coughed twice and sweat dripped on the back of his head. Seven or eight hundred Ancient Fey bones?</p>
<p>Yi Yun nearly burst out laughing when he heard this. Luo Huo'er was truly not someone to be messed with. He knew very well that his obtaining of an Ancient Fey bone back at the Mt. Azure Billow collective training had already caused Ran Yu, Luo Tian and company to covet it.</p>
<p>"This… " Bai Yueqing looked somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>"If there are no Ancient Fey bones, This Princess isn't interested!"</p>
<p>"Your Highness, you are truly making things difficult… " Bai Yueqing felt that Luo Huo'er was just fooling with him. "Since you do not want This Prince's gift, we can change the bet."</p>
<p>"What's there to change?" Luo Huo'er rolled her eyes. Other than Ancient Fey bones, there was nothing she was interested in. But on second thought, she suddenly had an idea as she cast a strange look at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>For some reason, Yi Yun felt his heart skip, as though he had an extreme sense of foreboding.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er cleared her throat as she said slowly, "Let's do it this way. Since you use This Princess as a bet, let's pull Princess White Fox in as well. She will be participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials, while I'll be participating in the White Fox trials. It will be a fair bet, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Oh? I wonder how Princess Purple Spirit plans on betting?" Bai Yueqing asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"If Princess White Fox fails to obtain first place, then she will have to stay in the Luo clan while traveling around it." Luo Huo'er answered.</p>
<p>"That's not a problem." Bai Yueqing immediately agreed. What sort of bet was this? Ignoring the upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials, Bai Yueqing believed that it was certain that the White Fox clan would emerge victorious. Even if the White Fox clan lost, leaving Xue'er behind in the Luo clan was fine. It would allow more interactions with Prince Crimson Firmament.</p>
<p>"Then it is agreed upon. When the time comes, Yi Yun will accompany her on her travels."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er turned her head at Yi Yun and said with a grin. "This mission will be entasked to you. Don't disappoint me!"</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er said this, she winked at Yi Yun. Yi Yun had a bitter look on his face. This darn girl. She had indeed made her plans revolving around him.</p>
<p>How maleficent was she to think of such a bet!?</p>
<p>Chapter 876: Too Infuriating</p>
<p>He knew very well that what Luo Huo'er said by "don't disappoint me" had a deeper meaning to it. And in fact, this bet was all a result of Luo Huo'er's playful mindset — she was essentially a young brat who craved to see the world plunge into chaos.</p>
<p>"Huo'er, you are up to your wanton mischief again." At this moment, Empress Xuan's Yuan Qi voice transmission rang. "Do you know what thoughts Crimson Firmament will have if your bet were to come into effect? Yi Yun will become the stye in his eye, a cause of pain he will rid off."</p>
<p>Despite hearing Empress Xuan's words, Luo Huo'er said in a displeased manner, "Yi Yun is already the stye in Crimson Firmament's eye. Making it a little larger would not make a difference. Furthermore, I'm also a stye in Crimson Firmament's eye."</p>
<p>Empress Xuan did not speak further with Luo Huo'er's retort. She only shook her head because it was indeed without a doubt that Yi Yun was already a stye in Crimson Firmament's eye.</p>
<p>"Your Highness, are you pulling my leg?" Bai Yueqing's smile faltered slightly. Although Bai Yueqing did not believe that the White Fox clan would lose to the Luo clan, Luo Huo'er's words sounded rather harsh on his ears.</p>
<p>"Letting Yi Yun accompany Princess White Fox on her travels?" Bai Yueqing gave Yi Yun a look of disdain. "He is unqualified. This Prince would not agree to this bet."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing believed that his regal bearing was already rather esteemed, but at this point in time, he could no longer tolerate it. He felt that Luo Huo'er was constantly teasing him; hence, he said those words. He no longer concealed his belittlement of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard this, he took a glance at Bai Yueqing. He saw in Bai Yueqing's eyes a feature only seen in wild beasts, a cold urge to kill.</p>
<p>In fact, he had sensed the white fox's belittlement and animosity right from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also not someone to be messed with either. Having been earmarked for attacks, he said, "The two of you are intending for me to accompany Princess White Fox on her travels, but you have yet to ask for my thoughts. I want to say that I don't have any intentions traveling with Princess White Fox, to begin with. The opportunity you think I'll be yearning for is actually worth nothing to me."</p>
<p>Yi Yun's final words were directed at Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was dumbfounded hearing this. Not only Bai Yueqing was dumbfounded, even Luo Huo'er was dumbfounded for a moment before she revealed a naughty smile.</p>
<p>"Nice going, Little Yun!" Luo Huo'er said with a voice transmission. What Yi Yun said pleased her greatly.</p>
<p>"What did you just say?" Bai Yueqing's face turned sullen. New flames of killing intent began burning in his eyes as he looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Seeing Bai Yueqing's reaction, Yi Yun smiled and said, "It's truly interesting. Princess Purple Spirit wants me to accompany Princess White Fox on her travels, and you say I'm unqualified and unworthy. I took the initiative to mention that I do not want to travel with Princess White Fox, but not only were you not happy about it, but you turned furious. Could it be that in your mind, I should be pleading on my knees to be able to accompany Princess White Fox on her travels, and you would kick me away and curse me for being a toad that lusts over a swan's meat? Would you feel happy only when that happens?"</p>
<p>What Yi Yun said hit the nail on the head. Indeed, in Bai Yueqing's subconsciousness, it was only right for the White Fox royal family to reject others, and not the other way round.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing looked coldly at Yi Yun. If this was anywhere outside Fenghua Palace, he would have killed Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Whether Her Highness wishes to stay in the White Fox clan is her freedom. By using a bet to force her to stay in the White Fox clan is such a hopeless act!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was unafraid of anything. He directly said those face-smacking words out. Luo Huo'er and even Empress Xuan wanted to give their kudos to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Having been blindsided by Empress Luo, the machinations of Empress Luo against her daughter, and how Emperor Luo was seemingly agreeing to the marriage, how could Empress Xuan not be infuriated? She found Bai Yueqing unpleasing to the eyes no matter how she looked at him. But now, with Yi Yun throwing out those words, Empress Xuan was elated.</p>
<p>Of course, she could not speak her thoughts. Empress Xuan said with an angry glare, "Yi Yun, how can you say such words? Prince Yueqing is a guest of the Luo clan."</p>
<p>Although it sounded like she was reprimanding Yi Yun, was there any inkling of admonishment from her tone?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was incensed. With so many people present, his prestige as prince had been torn apart. As for the bet, he no longer cared for it.</p>
<p>However, he never expected Luo Huo'er to suddenly say, "I can agree to your bet. If the Luo clan loses, I will stay in the White Fox clan for a year of travel, but if the Luo clan wins..."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er came to a pause upon saying that, "I wish that you and I will no longer have any correspondence in the future."</p>
<p>This bet...</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave Luo Huo'er an odd glance. The bet had deeper implications. After all, the White Fox clan had yet to propose any marriage alliance with the Luo clan. If the Luo clan truly lost, with the bet in place, it was unlikely for the White Fox clan to be shameless enough to propose a marriage alliance.</p>
<p>"Alright!" Bai Yueqing spat out the word. "Then This Prince shall be taking his leave. May Princess Purple Spirit prepare for her trip to the White Fox clan in the coming days!"</p>
<p>After saying his words, Bai Yueqing did not stay behind a moment longer. He led his servants and departed Fenghua Palace!</p>
<p>Upon seeing Bai Yueqing leave, Yi Yun smacked his lips and transmitted his voice to Luo Huo'er. "Why are you so confident?"</p>
<p>"I'm not confident. Bai Yueqing isn't a fool. For him to dare propose the bet, he naturally has something backing him. So...all of this is on you, Little Yun."</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er said casually, rendering Yi Yun speechless. Luo Huo'er was truly too bold.</p>
<p>"If it's the Desolate Heaven technique, I might have some confidence, but if it comes to martial arts, be it my foundation or physique, they are far inferior from top geniuses."</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew himself. The geniuses in the Luo clan royal capital were on a completely different level than the Fire Cloud State's.</p>
<p>After all, Yi Yun had just come to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. His potential had yet to been developed. In terms of foundation, he was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>"There's no hurry. We can take a step at a time. The Luo Divine Hall trials last for quite a period of time." At this moment, Empress Xuan spoke. She sighed slightly before saying, "Regardless of the case, Empress Luo has made a good move. Even if Huo'er extricates herself from Bai Yueqing's marriage alliance, whenever Prince Crimson Firmament succeeds in his marriage alliance with Princess White Fox, under the threat of the Fey Phantasm Sect, His Majesty would still consider Prince Crimson Firmament as his heir. Furthermore, if Huo'er were to inherit the throne, her relationship with the new emperor of the White Fox clan might not be cordial."</p>
<p>Empress Xuan was filled with worries. Just this move allowed Crimson Firmament to take another step closer to the throne.</p>
<p>"Maybe Crimson Firmament's marriage alliance would fail?"</p>
<p>The corners of Luo Huo'er's mouth curled up as she revealed her lustrous canine teeth. Although she was disinterested in the throne, she did not want to lose either, especially with Empress Luo machinating against her.</p>
<p>She wanted to win against her, and let that old witch weep!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>News of Luo Huo'er and Bai Yueqing's bet quickly proliferated.</p>
<p>The bet was obviously not concealed as it needed the notarization of the public.</p>
<p>In fact, the announcement of the bet was entrusted to the maid servants by Luo Huo'er. With her penchant for chaos to pervade the world, those Fenghua Palace maidservants reproduced whatever they knew. It even included the first bet Luo Huo'er proposed — "Letting Yi Yun accompany Princess White Fox on her travels", as well as Yi Yun's subsequent refusal.</p>
<p>With that, news spread quickly in the royal capital!</p>
<p>Everyone who heard the news was stupefied.</p>
<p>They were not surprised at the bet agreed upon by Luo Huo'er and Bai Yueqing, but by what Yi Yun had said.</p>
<p>The status Princess White Fox enjoyed was heads and shoulders above the cream of the crop. In the White Fox clan, her status was nearly equivalent to Luo Huo'er's!</p>
<p>But she had been ridiculed by Luo Huo'er and following that...rejected by Yi Yun?</p>
<p>The opportunity to travel with Princess White Fox was worth nothing to Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's words were not only infuriating and surprising to members of the White Fox clan, but also to members of the Luo clan. They were all dumbfounded. Yi Yun was too good at posturing.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Princess! Princess!"</p>
<p>In an elegantly adorned palace in the Luo clan royal capital, a petite maidservant ran over. She had a pair of sharp white fox ears protruding at the top of her head, and a bushy tail behind her. She was clearly a girl from the White Fox clan, but she had yet to fully complete her human manifestation.</p>
<p>"Princess, do you know what has happened outside? It's completely infuriating!" The maid servant said huffily as she ran.</p>
<p>Chapter 877: Supremacy Gulan</p>
<p>In this palace, Princess White Fox was wearing a white veil dress. With a book in her hand, she was quietly sitting on a bed. As the sunlight filtered through the veil, one could vaguely discern her body's beautiful contours.</p>
<p>In the warrior's world, be it reading or writing, people were accustomed to using jade slips that could contain a lot more content, but Princess White Fox preferred the feeling of having a paper-based book in her hand.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the huffing voice, Princess White Fox raised her head and she looked at her personal maidservant. She was like an angry kitten who had came before her to complain.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox smiled. Putting down her book, she said, "Ling'er, are you referring to my brother's bet with Princess Purple Spirit?"</p>
<p>"Princess, you have already got wind of it?" The maidservant stared at her with widened eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got wind of it, as well as some of the words used." Princess White Fox said lightly.</p>
<p>The maidservant was momentarily taken back before she said, "Princess, aren't you angry? That fellow named Yi Yun has no shame at all. He even said that he has no interest in travelling with Princess. Who does he think he is? There are so many people who want to travel with Princess that even the entire Luo clan royal capital couldn't contain them if they lined up. Even Prince Crimson Firmament yearns for it, but this Yi Yun… "</p>
<p>Princess White Fox said with a laugh, "Everyone has their own preferences and choices. You may like beautiful clothes and accessories, but warriors like superior-grade sabers and swords, and a farmer might like fertile soil. There's nothing odd about that. So, why should I be mad? However, there is one point that is true. As Princess White Fox, I represent the entire White Fox clan. My pride is the glory of the White Fox clan. Regardless of anything, Luo Huo'er and Yi Yun's words can be considered a challenge to me. At the Luo Divine Hall trials, I would probably be with Yi Yun. When the time comes, I want to see what Yi Yun's true strength is."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Time soon passed and with that, a month had passed.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had accompanied a White Fox clan ambassador to head for the White Fox clan. As for Yi Yun, he remained in the Luo clan royal capital to consolidate his cultivation realm.</p>
<p>Today was the day that the Luo Divine Hall trials began.</p>
<p>Every sixty years, the Luo Divine Hall would hold a trial that lasted eighteen years!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was quite surprised when he first heard of the Luo Divine Hall trials that lasted eighteen years.</p>
<p>Why did it last so long?</p>
<p>"Of course it's long… " Empress Xuan stood on a high platform. Behind her were elites that were going to participate in the trials. She was dressed in a lavish regal outfit, and she looked domineering. "The trials is not just a single test. In fact, it is the most important opportunity of the Luo Divine Hall. It happens once every sixty years, and it lasts for eighteen years each time. The eighteen years are extremely important, they are a stage for you to build your foundation." Empress Xuan slowly said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, along with other disciples who had joined Empress Xuan's camp, including Gu Qing, Ling Wu, etc, were all present. They were all elites from the various Luo clan states. Furthermore, they were mostly less than fifty years old. Amongst the younger generation, they were considered the youngest juniors.</p>
<p>"Huo'er's trial will also begin at the same time as our Luo clan's. In fact, many clans and Fey countries in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven chose today as the beginning of an important trial for their young disciples." Empress Xuan added on.</p>
<p>"Oh? Other Fey countries have the trials going on concurrently as well?" Yi Yun was surprised. It was obviously not a coincidence with so many powerful factions choosing this day for the beginning of their trials.</p>
<p>At this moment…</p>
<p>A spirit cruiser flew over and it landed on a square in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser looked extremely special. It looked like a carp that was covered in scales. It had two long tentacles growing by its large mouth and its eyes were bright. If it wasn't for its surface having indications of it being made out of metal, Yi Yun would have believed that it was a gigantic carp.</p>
<p>"This spirit cruiser is truly strange… "</p>
<p>"It's indeed strange… " At this moment, Empress Xuan spoke. "Our entire Luo clan only has two spirit cruisers of this grade. One of them is used by His Majesty, and the other is by the Empyrean Uncle. And the one in front of you is His Majesty's mount. These two spirit cruisers are one of the cornerstones of the Luo clan!"</p>
<p>Emperor Luo's mount?</p>
<p>The people present were amazed. Just heading to the Luo Divine Hall trials required using Emperor Luo's mount?</p>
<p>"The spirit cruiser in front of you was a golden carp from ancient times. This is the body that it left behind after failing to transform into a dragon. Using its body as a foundation, this spirit cruiser was constructed. Hence, the spirit cruiser you see resembles a carp."</p>
<p>An ancient parable in the Fey race describes how a golden carp transforms into a dragon goes — A Jinlin is in no case a common creature living in the pool, but it changes into a dragon upon facing a storm.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never expected that the spirit cruiser in front of him was refined using a golden carp's corpse.</p>
<p>The corpse of an ancient beast like a golden carp was unimaginably valuable.</p>
<p>But even so, Empress Xuan had just said that the two spirit cruiser were the cornerstones of the Luo clan and they were of paramount importance. Clearly, such a spirit cruiser was not simply used for traveling only.</p>
<p>At this moment, a middle-aged man dressed in white robes appeared from the gigantic carp's mouth.</p>
<p>He had long purple hair, and his eyes were deep blue in color, resembling the deep starry sky. Just standing there nonchalantly made the light around him distort. Yi Yun knew that this was a manifestation of the Dao.</p>
<p>The person standing at the fish's mouth had unfathomable strength. It was even very likely that this was the strongest person that Yi Yun had ever encountered in person so far!</p>
<p>"Your Majesty."</p>
<p>The blue-eyed man nodded slightly at Empress Xuan.</p>
<p>From the fact that he did not need to bow at Empress Xuan was enough to show of his esteemed status!</p>
<p>And following that, Empress Xuan's words made everyone understand his identity.</p>
<p>"Supremacy Gulan, we haven't met each other in a thousand years… "</p>
<p>Supremacy?</p>
<p>This was not the first time that Yi Yun had heard such a term. Even in the 12 Empyrean Heavens, a Supremacy was considered to be a powerhouse. And in the Luo clan, Supremacies were exempt from bowing, even when greeting Emperor Luo. They would only bow when they met the third Empyrean Uncle.</p>
<p>Every few decades, a new batch of geniuses and elites would be born in the Luo clan. Amongst these geniuses, there would be existences at the pinnacle. But true Supremacys could be counted with one's hand in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>This was the first time that Yi Yun heard of Supremacy Gulan, but many of the elites present already knew the few Supremacies in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>"He's Supremacy Gulan! For our trip to the Luo Divine Hall trials, we actually get to ride on His Majesty's spirit cruiser and have a Supremacy lead the way! The whole situation is so fantastic… " Someone said in surprise.</p>
<p>The situation appeared exaggerated regardless of anything.</p>
<p>"There's no other way. The place we are going cannot be entered without a Supremacy powering the golden carp spirit cruiser… " Someone who understood the Luo Divine Hall trials well said with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>It was also because of this reason that Empress Xuan had mentioned that the two spirit cruisers owned by Emperor Luo and the third Empyrean Uncle were the cornerstones of the Luo clan. The reason was mostly attributed to the fact that spirit cruisers at that grade were the keys to activating the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Without spirit cruisers at such a grade, the Luo clan would lose the ability to nurture their young elites.</p>
<p>Chapter 878: Primordial Empyrean Heaven</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser tore through the void of the world it was in and it began Void Transference.</p>
<p>The moment a spirit cruiser, which was controlled by a Supremacy and also the mount of Emperor Luo, did Void Transference, be it its teleportation distance or the energy it consumed, they were both unimaginable.</p>
<p>The reason why it had to be controlled by a Supremacy was because the venue of the Luo Divine Hall trials was completely unexpected…</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood beside a window of the spirit cruiser. As it passed through space, he saw numerous twinkling lights. These dots of light each represented a star.</p>
<p>Some of these stars were desolate, but there were others brimming with life in their respective solar systems. These lives similarly could give birth to warriors. There were as many lives in the entire 12 Empyrean Heavens as the number of grains of sand on a beach. It was difficult to estimate the number, and even if one was a Supremacy, one would only be able to explore a very tiny area of the entire 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi Yun."</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned around when he heard someone call him. He saw a young man and woman walk towards him.</p>
<p>The man was lanky while the woman was petite.</p>
<p>"I'm Gu Qing. She's Ling Wu. We are both members of the younger generation in Empress Xuan's camp. We might be considered pretty alright in our states, but compared to Junior Brother Yi Yun, we are far too inferior."</p>
<p>Gu Qing laughed. He came to get to know Yi Yun, because be it his current status, or the amount of potential he had revealed, he was someone worth acquainting with.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Gu, you must be joking. This lowly one only lucked out on a little bit of Desolate Heaven technique. The upcoming Luo Divine Hall trials is a competition of strength, and I lack the advantage in various aspects."</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun was speaking, the spirit cruiser suddenly accelerated, as though the void had been torn apart as its fragments transformed into bands of light while they hurtled backwards.</p>
<p>"The tunneling through space is about to begin."</p>
<p>Yi Yun had once experienced Void Transference. But compared to the void transference on the spirit cruisers he had ridden before, the bands of light were more than a hundred times brighter. This implied an even stronger spatial force.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that a top-grade spirit cruiser used by Emperor Luo was deployed for this trip. If it was any ordinary spirit cruiser, it would be torn apart by the force of the spatial storms.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Yi Yun could not help but ask. He was still clueless about the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>"To the Primordial Empyrean Heaven." Ling Wu said.</p>
<p>She had ocean-blue long hair. As she watched the gorgeous band of lights outside the spirit cruiser, her looks revealed a yearning.</p>
<p>"Primordial Empyrean Heaven?"</p>
<p>This was the first time that Yi Yun had heard of such a name.</p>
<p>"The Primordial Empyrean Heaven sits independent outside the 12 Empyrean Heavens. Its volume is relatively smaller than the 12 Empyrean Heavens, but its status is extremely pivotal. Legend says that… it is a world that failed to take form." At this moment, Gu Qing spoke.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was taken aback after hearing this. A world that failed to taken form?</p>
<p>"That's right. In this world, there are stars that are in their inchoate states, fragmentary spaces, the richest Fey God auras, and the power of Chaos… "</p>
<p>Chaos?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was alarmed. He obviously knew what it meant by the word 'Chaos'. Legend said that the Universe was born out of Chaos. According to the 12 Empyrean Heavens' stories, the 12 Fey Gods came out of Chaos.</p>
<p>After the 12 Empyrean Heavens were formed out of Chaos, most of the power of Chaos had been depleted.</p>
<p>And according to Gu Qing, the Primordial Empyrean Heaven was a world that failed to take form. If that were the case, leaving behind the power of Chaos was nothing surprising!</p>
<p>What sort of form was the power of Chaos?</p>
<p>Just having the power of Chaos in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven was already an extremely attractive point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only was there the power of Chaos, it also contained a great deal of opportunities.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Ling Wu's eyes sparkled when she mentioned the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Ling Wu said, "Actually, the White Fox clan's trials are also held in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. Every sixty years, there will be a moment when the barrier demarcating the Primordial Empyrean Heaven is at its weakest. That also the best time to enter the Primordial Empyrean Heaven."</p>
<p>"This is the reason why the White Fox and Luo clan choose to begin their most important trials on the same day. However, even if the spatial barrier is at its weakest, a top-grade spirit cruiser and a Supremacy are needed to break through the spatial barrier. If not for this reason, how are we even qualified to ride in His Majesty's mount and get to meet Supremacy Gulan."</p>
<p>"Then will we be in the same place as the White Fox clan?" Yi Yun asked. Luo Huo'er was currently together with the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>"Of course not. The Primordial Empyrean Heaven is a very complex environment. Opening up a zone requires a great deal of resources and the sacrifice of warriors. No power would be willing to sacrifice so much to share the zone that they open up with others. Our zone is ours, while the White Fox clan's is theirs." Gu Qing explained to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is."</p>
<p>As they spoke, the spirit cruiser began another round of Void Transference.</p>
<p>The beams of light surrounding them grew in intensity till finally, the spirit cruiser came to a halt in a nebulous space.</p>
<p>Primordial Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>"This is the world that failed to take form." Yi Yun looked at the space around the cruiser. In fact, this was a universe amidst disorder. Just the Yuan Qi around him felt different from the 12 Empyrean Heavens. An ancient and desolate aura that existed in this Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>The Primordial Empyrean Heaven was filled with fog, and amidst the fog, there were fragmentary continental land masses, as well as floating stars.</p>
<p>However, a large majority of the stars were dim and dead silent, as though they were just gigantic pieces of rock. There were some stars and land masses that emanated an extremely dangerous aura.</p>
<p>Yi Yun imagined that they would disembark from the spirit cruiser here, but he never expected that the spirit cruiser would continue flying before landing on a large land mass.</p>
<p>"We're here." Gu Qing said.</p>
<p>"This is the Luo Divine Hall. The Luo clan has set up a large formation array here. Every time Void Transference is used, we would arrive in the vicinity. A short trip here would do." Ling Wu understood a lot about the matter.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the land mass and he noticed a towering but unsophisticated palace, as well as hundreds of tall spires standing above the lands as well.</p>
<p>"This is the Luo Divine Hall." Gu Qing said.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine was the totem of the Luo clan. Legend said that the ancestor of the Luo clan was an extremely powerful Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>"So… the true Luo Divine Hall is actually here. I thought that it would be in the royal capital."</p>
<p>Yi Yun drew a light gasp. There was no vegetation on the land mass. It looked desolate and cold, as though it was a forgotten world.</p>
<p>If the Luo clan could build a Luo Divine Hall in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, it was possible that the White Fox clan did as well. The various factions of the 12 Empyrean Heavens divided the Primordial Empyrean Heaven amongst themselves.</p>
<p>The Primordial Empyrean Heaven was an important ground for them to nurture their talents. There was a delicate balance maintained amongst the factions, with each going their own way.</p>
<p>A few Luo Divine Hall Elders, who were stationed here, had already been waiting mid-air.</p>
<p>"From today onwards, you will be spending the next eighteen years here! After eighteen years, it is unknown how many of you will be able to leave on the spirit cruiser alive. And amongst you, how many would experience a complete metamorphosis to become a dragon or a phoenix amongst people!?"</p>
<p>"Disembark the spirit cruiser!" Another thin elder took a step forward as he said.</p>
<p>This Elder was truly direct…</p>
<p>The disciples, who had just arrived in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, were still feeling fascinated about their surroundings. But at the moment that they arrive, it was like a figurative basin of cold water was poured over them to dampen their spirits. Many of them immediately wiped the wonderment from their minds and fighting spirit and diligence appeared in their eyes.</p>
<p>Chapter 879: Chaotic Laws</p>
<p>After the lanky elder finished speaking, the hull of spirit cruiser opened. The disciples who came to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials subsequently flew out.</p>
<p>However, the moment that they stepped out of the spirit cruiser, there were immediately people who stumbled. There were even a few disciples who screamed as they plummeted straight down.</p>
<p>Elder Shi and the other Elders watched coldly, but they had no intention of saving them.</p>
<p>These disciples desperately powered their Yuan Qi before finally stabilizing their bodies. Slowly, they rose up, but from their pale looks, it was obvious that they had been given quite a fright.</p>
<p>They were still about a hundred thousand feet high in the sky. If they truly plummeted down, it would not be a problem in any other common universe, but in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, falling meant a high chance of death.</p>
<p>As warriors, they were already accustomed to flying. Although their Yuan Qi was insufficient to allow them to fly over great distances, just hovering mid-air for a while was easy as lifting a finger. It was practically an inborn instinct.</p>
<p>But just a moment ago, they had to relearn the feeling of flying in air.</p>
<p>"This is a universe that failed to take form, the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. The laws here are different to the 12 Empyrean Heavens. It's in great disorder. The laws of nature around the landmass that the Luo Divine Hall is situated on is considered to be stable, but there are certain places where every step taken will allow you to encounter different laws. At those places, the energy in your bodies might be triggered by the disorderly laws even while standing. If you fail to control it, you might explode to your deaths, much less fly." At this moment, an Elder with an extremely long beard spoke slowly.</p>
<p>"But it's because of this that the Primordial Empyrean Heaven is such an excellent place for the trials. In here, you will be able to experience the laws of nature at the primordial birth of the Universe. The laws are disorderly and brutal. But it is also because of this that they are easier to gain insights from. They have not gone through a perfect transformation and maintains they most primordial state. They do not have a system of a harmonious trajectories."</p>
<p>"In worlds like the 12 Empyrean Heavens that have taken form, the insights into a law requires you to extract them from their trajectories. Here, there is no need to do so. If you can seize the opportunity, and grasp one law, you would become a dragon or phoenix amongst people."</p>
<p>The bearded Elder was apparently more patient than Elder Shi. However, the look he gave the disciples was dull. How could it be easy to grasp a law? Even in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, gaining insight into laws was still extremely difficult.</p>
<p>It was equivalent to the mortals in the lower realm. They lived on tiny planets. Even if they grasped a tiny law and used the law to fly out of their planets, they were still no different to an ant when it came to the Universe. It was extremely difficult for an ant to even try fathoming the vastness of the entire world.</p>
<p>It was as though the bearded Elder had not spoken in a very long while. Having said his piece, he fell silent.</p>
<p>They had volunteered to stay in the Luo Divine Hall. Other than protecting the Luo Divine Hall, they also went into reclusive cultivation here.</p>
<p>The disciples who were still in the spirit cruiser were appalled. They never expected that just moving alone was difficult enough in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. They still needed to gain insight into laws and battle…</p>
<p>With the lessons drawn from the mistakes of those before them, the remaining disciples were careful when they flew out of the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>Although many of the disciples had jolted themselves to give their all, they were still unable to find their footing after flying out. Even after familiarizing themselves with the surroundings, they were still unable to stand freely. It was as though they would plummet at any time.</p>
<p>However, there were a group of people who adjusted to it faster. After a few moments of stumbling, they were able to barely stand firm, with no signs of them falling at any time.</p>
<p>Immediately, the disciples who failed to find their footing felt that their faces were burning.</p>
<p>The setback was too great to be immediately proven to be inferior to the other disciples upon arrival at the trial.</p>
<p>However, no matter how well the disciples performed, the two Elders that protected the Luo Divine Hall had their eyelids lowered. They did not pay any attention to them.</p>
<p>"It's Senior Brother Luo Mo." Someone suddenly shouted from amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>Luo Mo, who had competed with Yi Yun at Empress Luo's banquet had arrived.</p>
<p>Luo Mo was still wearing his black-and-white robe. He silently stepped out of the spirit cruiser. Ever since he was defeated by Yi Yun in the Desolate Heaven technique at Empress Luo's banquet, he appeared more staid.</p>
<p>The moment he stepped out, his robe fluttered up, as though it was lifted up by winds. Following that he stably hovered mid-air, no different to normal flying.</p>
<p>"Ze!"</p>
<p>People remarked with a tinge of regret. Indeed, a genius at Luo Mo's level was different.</p>
<p>Behind Luo Mo was a black-dressed youth.</p>
<p>The moment the black-dressed youth appeared, he attracted the attention of many.</p>
<p>The reason why the black-dressed youth attracted the attention of the others was not because of his identity. In fact, many people present had never seen him before.</p>
<p>The youth had a pair of black and bright eyes. He was extremely well kept, with a sword behind his back. He had black short hair, but his face looked somewhat pale.</p>
<p>The bone sword was made of the bone of an unknown beast. It was white like jade and it did not appear sharp at all. Instead, it gave off a warm feeling to others.</p>
<p>The most astonishing thing was that beside the sword's hilt, there was a tiny bird standing on the black-dressed youth's shoulder.</p>
<p>And it was this bird that attracted the eyes of everyone.</p>
<p>The participants present were members of the Fey race. They were extremely sensitive to Fey race bloodlines, so they were certain that the bird was not a powerful Fey beast, to the point that it was most likely an ordinary bird.</p>
<p>Bringing an ordinary bird to the Luo Divine Hall?</p>
<p>The laws in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven were extremely disorderly. Out of the Luo Divine Hall's vicinity, many places could trigger the energies in a person's body due to the chaotic laws to result in an exploding death.</p>
<p>Even in the land mass where the Luo Divine Hall lay, where the laws were slightly more stable, it was still not a place that an ordinary bird could withstand.</p>
<p>A strange scene was seen. When the black-dressed youth stepped out of the spirit cruiser, it was as though he was walking on flat ground. His body did not even quiver once. Even the bird on his shoulder was turning its tiny head in an alacritous manner. From time to time, it would issue clear sounds of chirping.</p>
<p>That can actually do?</p>
<p>Many people had struggled just to be able to stand firmly, but the youth in front of them had not only stood firmly, but he had also brought a tiny bird.</p>
<p>Who was he?</p>
<p>Such thoughts appeared on many people's minds. It was as though Luo Mo knew the youth, and from his demeanor, he was rather respectful towards the youth.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ran Xueyi, Luo Divine Hall had begun to come out of the spirit cruiser. As two of the four young masters of the royal capital, the both of them were members of the younger generation that were younger than a hundred years old. Obviously, they would not miss the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>Just as Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu were about to step out of the spirit cruiser —</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>The sound of the tearing of the void resounded as air was pushed apart. The surrounding laws also turned chaotic. The young disciples, who had struggled to find their footing, stumbled again, as though they were tiny boats bobbing on a huge wave.</p>
<p>People looked up as a gigantic white spirit cruiser descended and it landed near the Luo clan's spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>"It's the White Fox clan's spirit cruiser!"</p>
<p>The gigantic white cruiser had a line made up of large beads across the keel of the boat that resembled the eyeballs of beasts. The line gave off a feeling full of mystery.</p>
<p>"It's Princess White Fox and the disciples of the White Fox clan!" A young Luo clan elite said.</p>
<p>Chapter 880: Shadow Twins</p>
<p>At the Luo Divine Hall trials, the Luo clan and White Fox clan had exchanged quite a large number of elites.</p>
<p>A number of elites that Empress Luo had nurtured were sent to the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>As for the White Fox clan, it had sent an extremely strong lineup that accompanied Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>At the trials, it was not only a competition between Empress Luo and Empress Xuan, it was also a competition between the Luo and White Fox clan!</p>
<p>This destined the trial to be an intense competition!</p>
<p>At this moment, an arc of light shot out of the white spirit cruiser as its hull opened. Appearing from inside the hull were a group of lavishly dressed White Fox disciples. The male disciples made up no more than 20%, while the rest were all female disciples!</p>
<p>At a glance, there were dozens of White Fox clan beauties. Any one of them had beauty that could topple kingdoms!</p>
<p>The White Fox clan's ancestor was a powerful Ancient Fey, the Nine-tailed White Fox. Female White Fox that took human form had an inexplicable charm, and they were considered one of the most perfect beings in the world.</p>
<p>But now, this group of female disciples were one of the most elite girls amongst the White Fox's younger generation with the purest bloodlines. Their looks, bearing and figures were impeccable. The group of beauties that suddenly appeared had different charms. There were those with ample chests or those with slim waists. Some had long, slender fair legs, while others that did not look tall would be petite and adorable. Some had temperaments as cold as jade, as though they were lofty snow lotuses, and there were others that were sultry, and completely capable of bringing down a country to its knees.</p>
<p>Most of them wore fine silk-veiled clothing, and all of them standing together projected an astounding feeling.</p>
<p>Amongst the young male elites of the Luo clan, not everyone was a blessed son of heaven who were pursued by girls like Luo Mo. There were some relatively common male disciples. Being able to suddenly see a bevy of beauties in all styles, they were momentarily dazed when they vaguely made out the beauties' fair legs and arms through the thin veils.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the Luo clan's male disciples looking at them dumbfoundedly, there was a slight stir in the White Fox clan. They began giggling, with laughter as pleasant sounding as orioles birds.</p>
<p>"The White Fox clan indeed lives up to its fame as a charming species. These girls must have cultivated in some illusionary charming techniques. Their auras have already been fully integrated into their bodies. Even without exercising their charm, they can still influence the minds of people."</p>
<p>Yi Yun came to a conclusion upon seeing this scene. Ignoring the looks of the White Fox girls, just their reactions alone could stir up a male's dominating desires.</p>
<p>The long mustached Luo Divine Hall Elder frowned slightly. Emperor Luo had instructed him to lead the Luo Divine Hall trials. Although quite a number of Luo clan geniuses had been sent to the White Fox clan, he could not allow the Luo clan to embarrass itself.</p>
<p>He interrupted the dazed Luo clan youngsters present with a soft grunt. After a momentary surprise, they hurriedly focused their minds and looked somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>They had also realized that their reactions were quite embarrassing, and they had unknowingly fallen for the other party's tricks.</p>
<p>At this moment, a red-dressed beauty appeared at the entrance of the white spirit cruiser's hull. She had an ample bosom, and even with an extremely loose dress, there was no way it could hide her voluptuous figure that exuded a mature woman's charm.</p>
<p>"Hehehe, Elder Duanmu, why are you grunting? It's just a look, and the girls don't mind, so what's wrong with that? Furthermore, with the common enemy of the Fey Phantasm Sect, my White Fox clan's Sacred King and His Majesty Emperor Luo have the intentions to begin an alliance. In the future, wouldn't it be common for White Fox clan ladies to marry into the Luo clan?" The red-dressed woman said with a giggle.</p>
<p>Pandemonium seemed to happen as the voluptuousness under her dress made people lose themselves in reverie.</p>
<p>Some of the Luo Clans's hot-blooded youths could not help but waver on their purpose after hearing her words. What the red-dressed woman said was very alluring. The Luo Divine Hall trials would last a very long time, so it was possible that they could hook up with one of the White Fox beauties, and leave with a beauty in hand!</p>
<p>Just thinking of this made many Luo clan disciples muster up their strength in a bid to showcase themselves at the trials.</p>
<p>"Come on down!"</p>
<p>The red-dressed woman waved her hand.</p>
<p>The elites of the White Fox clan began to step out of the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples immediately focused. The spatial dimension laws here were extremely chaotic. It was not easy to stand firmly, so they wanted to see how strong these girls from the White Fox clan were. They wanted to see if they were even worthy of them, if a few of them could not even beat a single one of them, how could they win their hand in marriage?</p>
<p>The first to step out of the spirit cruiser was a pair of young girls.</p>
<p>They were extremely tall, with ample breasts and thin waists. Long hair gushed down their backs, while there was a pair of fox ears that could hardly be seen.</p>
<p>They looked like they were made out of the same mold. Twins?</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples were somewhat astonished. Coupled with their flawless faces, and identical looks, they found it nearly impossible to distinguish them.</p>
<p>"It's the White Fox clan's Shadow Twins!" At this moment, Luo Mo said, "They grew up together with Princess White Fox, and they are personal guards of Princess White Fox. The term, 'guards', might not be appropriate, and instead, they could be described as Princess White Fox's confidants and left and right-hand women."</p>
<p>With Luo Mo saying this, the Shadow Twins had already stepped out of the spirit cruiser. The chaotic laws immediately subjected them to their power, but the duo did not appear to be affected at all. More mysteriously, a faint ripple appeared under their feet, as though they were stepping on a water surface. These ripples emanated out from their feet and it gathered together before destructively interfering with each other into eventual calmness.</p>
<p>And following that, the Shadow Twins took one step after another down the empty space. Every step produced a ripple and these ripples formed a trail that expanded in range. Following that, the young White Fox clan disciples began walking out of the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>The invisible ripples seemed to stabilize the chaotic void as they created an invisible ground. All of the White Fox disciples were able to stand firmly on the ripples that destructively interfered with each other, as though they were not affected by the chaotic laws!</p>
<p>This scene shocked everyone.</p>
<p>What sort of technique was that?</p>
<p>Not every White Fox clan disciple was able to easily adapt to their surroundings. With the Shadow Twins forging a path ahead, it was as though they had calmed down the chaotic laws, which resulted in all of them appearing unaffected.</p>
<p>It was fascinating!</p>
<p>At this moment, Princess White Fox appeared. She was still dressed in a simple but elegant white robe. Her long white hair and her every gesture had silver bolts lightning circulating around her. The resplendent silver beams added an air of mystery to her.</p>
<p>Quite a few of the Luo clan disciples present had attended the banquet hosted by Empress Luo. Back at the banquet, they did not sense how unfathomable Princess White Fox was, but now in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, they were able to deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's eyes were calm as she slowly walked towards the Luo Divine Hall. Following behind Princess White Fox were four male White Fox clan men.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan men had exquisite appearances like the women, but in the eyes of the members of the Luo clan, this was completely disgusting. Men mostly liked delicate and beautiful women, but how many would like delicate and beautiful men?</p>
<p>At this moment, the White Fox clan men looked at the Luo clan disciples and one of them said, "Who amongst you is Yi Yun?"</p>
<p>Chapter 881: Mimicking</p>
<p>The White Fox clan man who spoke immediately attracted the attention of many, this was because he was especially unique.</p>
<p>He was tall and burly, and there was a heavy weapon on his back. From the shape of it, it resembled a heavy sword.</p>
<p>The man's face was chiseled and his eyes were like two sharp blades. He had a faint scar in between his eyebrows, which looked like ivory. Standing there, he emanated an overwhelming foul bloodthirsty aura!</p>
<p>This foul aura would only appear on people who had their hands stained with a great deal of blood. Clearly, this man had experienced several life and death battles and he had traversed the realms of both life and death.</p>
<p>How was such a man in the White Fox clan?</p>
<p>Ignoring his foul bloodthirsty aura, just his appearance alone definitely made him an extremely masculine man, even in the Luo clan. He was completely different from the effeminate men in the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan had such a person?</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood at the exit of the Luo clan's spirit cruiser. He had yet to disembark from the spirit cruiser, and when he locked eyes with the sword-bearing man, Yi Yun felt that the other person's aura was extraordinary.</p>
<p>The sword-bearing youth was somewhat special.</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins, together with the sword-bearing youth, allowed the White Fox clan to showcase their strength even before the trials began. It was already quite amazing.</p>
<p>"My name is Wufeng!" The sword-bearing man announced his name as he looked deeply into Yi Yun's eyes.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not surprised to be suddenly questioned by members of the White Fox clan. It was highly likely that most people in the White Fox clan had heard of his name…</p>
<p>The reason was none other than the confrontation between Luo Huo'er and Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Yi Yun slightly cocked his head and looked at Princess White Fox. In the White Fox clan, Princess White Fox enjoyed a lofty status, a status not inferior to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>"He's Yi Yun?"</p>
<p>Wufeng's reaction was rather plain, but for the other disciples of the White Fox clan, they did not remain calm when they heard Yi Yun's name.</p>
<p>"So he is the one who declared that our White Fox clan's Princess White Fox was not worthy to be his travel partner?"</p>
<p>"His cultivation level is at the beginning stages of the Heaven Ascension realm. His foundation is passable, but his physique is extremely weak. He would have been annihilated by me if he was in the White Fox clan for daring to speak so arrogantly."</p>
<p>"Do you think that he truly doesn't want to partner with our princess in her travels? He probably yearns for it deeply, but knows that it's impossible so he put on an arrogant front. However, to be able to act arrogant, one has to have the appropriate strength and status. He doesn't have any of that."</p>
<p>A few of the male White Fox clan youths discussed in whispers as they sized up Yi Yun without any reservations. Their perceptions blanketed Yi Yun as they checked his foundation and lifeblood strength.</p>
<p>They had heard of the matters over the past few days and they were incensed over the matter. They wanted to know what the arrogant man looked like.</p>
<p>Although the discussion were as quiet as murmurs, their conversation could be heard by others. Princess White Fox frowned slightly and turned around. She glanced at those youths that were speaking, a displeased look on her face.</p>
<p>"The Luo Divine Hall trials have just begun. Our every action and word represent the White Fox clan. By being verbally provocative before the trials, it does nothing but make others think lowly of us." Princess White Fox sent a voice transmission.</p>
<p>The few White Fox youths choked up, and they did not dare to refute her.</p>
<p>"Your Highness, your teachings are sensible. Words mean nothing. When the trials begin, we will let that arrogant fellow know the strength of our White Fox clan."</p>
<p>They knew about the bet about the trials between Luo Huo'er and Bai Yueqing. Bai Yueqing had also specially informed them of the importance of the trials. Other than the bet, if they were able to crush the Luo clan in the trials, they would also gain the upper hand in the upcoming forging of the alliance between the Luo clan and the White Fox clan!</p>
<p>Without a doubt, those who managed to obtain good results at the trial would make a name of themselves.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, aren't you coming down?" At this moment, Wufeng said to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>In the land mass where the Luo Divine Hall was, the laws in the void were chaotic, making it difficult for the youths to fly. Previously, the Shadow Twins had worked together to stride down the void and calming the laws. It was truly fascinating.</p>
<p>Wufeng understood of Yi Yun's feats. He was very curious about a person who could use the seventy-two introductory moves to refine an 'outstanding' relic.</p>
<p>Instantly, many people were looking at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Although many of the White Fox clan disciples frowned upon Yi Yun, it was still very easy to fly in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Those with strong nomological insights would be able to find the gist of it instantly, allowing them to stabilize their footing.</p>
<p>Those with weaker laws would stagger from beginning to end, almost never finding balance.</p>
<p>They wanted to see how long Yi Yun would take to find his balance.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the void outside the spirit cruiser. Musing slightly, he took his first step out.</p>
<p>When his center of gravity shifted out of the spirit cruiser, Yi Yun immediately saw the chaotic laws that belonged to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>The space here were filled with a variety of primordial energy.</p>
<p>Unformed energies of Yin-Yang, the five elements, Creation, spatial-temporal…</p>
<p>These energies surged into his body as they wantonly burst through his meridians.</p>
<p>If his nomological insight was insufficient, the myriad of energies that mixed into his bodies would result in him plummeting if he failed to control them, just like the other Luo clan disciples from before.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's pace was not fast. He took one step after another. In the Purple Crystal's energy vision, the chaotic energy looked like countless disordered threads. Yi Yun stepped on the nexus points of these threads like he was walking a tightrope. It looked rather interesting to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Walking stably was not difficult in fact, but with his energy vision, Yi Yun had several thoughts.</p>
<p>"Oh? What is that Yi Yun doing?"</p>
<p>People noticed that Yi Yun was walking very slowly in the void. Every step was taken very cautiously. His eyes were staring at his feet, as though he was walking along a cliff's edge, worried that he would fall at any time.</p>
<p>This strolling that looked like a snail's crawl could not be considered as elegant. Compared to Wufeng, Luo Mo and company, he was far inferior. They were able to find their balance in less than a second.</p>
<p>"Why is Yi Yun so slow at trying to adapt himself to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven's chaotic laws and maintain his balance?" A youth from the White Fox clan chuckled.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to deride Yi Yun, he was suddenly stunned. He noticed that there were faint ripples beneath Yi Yun's feet, just like the ripples the Shadow Twins had formed.</p>
<p>However, the ripples that Yi Yun created were much fainter. It looked like he had yet to proficiently grasp it, but even so, this astounded the youth that was about to speak.</p>
<p>"He's mimicking the Shadow Twins!" The youth from the White Fox clan said as his voice broke.</p>
<p>He never expected that Yi Yun was able to mimic the Shadow Twins in his first step into the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. It was quelling the chaotic and violent energies just by using their legs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he actually managed to do it!</p>
<p>Although he did not do it in as collected a manner as the Shadow Twins, people knew that this was not the first time that the Shadow Twins had stepped into the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. They had been here before!</p>
<p>Beside Princess White Fox, the Shadow Twins were watching Yi Yun. A look of astonishment flashed on their identical faces as they said, "Princess, that Yi Yun truly has impressive perception!"</p>
<p>Chapter 882: Ancient Fey Soul Remnant</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins had always been outstanding in the White Fox clan. As twin sisters, they had simultaneously awoken their Ancient Nine-Tailed Fox bloodline. Coupled with their pedigree and beauty, they were obviously highly sought after. Hence, under the present situation, those who could be praised by them were few and far between.</p>
<p>However, what Yi Yun had done had truly astonished them. The primordial universe's chaotic laws were like churning waves in the sea. The sea waves easily changed their shape, but if one wanted to attempt to use their feet to flatten the waves, that was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun's mimicry was relatively inchoate compared to the Shadow Twins, it was still extremely rare and valuable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the more Yi Yun walked, the more plain-sailing it became for him. He was also slowly speeding up!</p>
<p>The White Fox clan geniuses that had previously mocked Yi Yun were momentarily at a loss for words when they saw the situation. They might have extremely strong combat ability, but they themselves knew that they could not use their feet to flatten the chaotic energies.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wufeng spoke, "Do not look down on the geniuses of the Luo clan. Although you are the cream of the crop in the White Fox clan, and this batch of juniors in the White Fox clan far exceeds the past, the Luo clan is also filled with talent. Don't forget that the Luo clan has existed for an even longer period of time. They have amassed a great foundation.</p>
<p>When the surrounding White Fox clan geniuses heard this, some of them fell silent while others were unconvinced.</p>
<p>"Being able to flatten the chaotic energies in the void is based on one's superiority in laws. Yi Yun is a human, so it is normal for him to be better than us on this. I heard that at a Luo clan collective training, his nomological insights were outstanding. However, what will be compared next is actual combat! Actual combat is what we are best at!"</p>
<p>"Right! Actual combat is everything. What's the use of laws alone!?"</p>
<p>The moment that actual combat was mentioned, the White Fox clan disciples immediately perked up. The Luo Divine Hall trials' final results depended on actual combat, which had the greatest weighting.</p>
<p>Wufeng did not speak. The Fey race was indeed proficient at actual combat. Even for Wufeng himself, nomological insights was his weakness, while actual combat was his strength.</p>
<p>In terms of actual combat, he was absolutely confident!</p>
<p>Of course, compared to Princess White Fox… he was completely no match for her.</p>
<p>Not only was Princess White Fox an instance of atavism, but she was also equally outstanding in laws, which the Fey race viewed as their weakness. She did not have any weaknesses!</p>
<p>If not for Princess White Fox being well-matched with Luo Huo'er, the White Fox prince would not have been so confident.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Wufeng glanced at Princess White Fox, who wasn't too far away from him.</p>
<p>At this moment, Princess White Fox was looking at Yi Yun with a wistful look. Her eyes were concentrated on Yi Yun's toes. Her eyes were very pure, like a bright surface of a lake. Every ripple formed by Yi Yun's feet was clearly reflected in her pupils.</p>
<p>"Nongyin, if this was the first time that you came to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, will you be able to do what he did?"</p>
<p>Nongying was the elder sister of the Shadow Twins, while the younger sister's name was Nongyue.</p>
<p>Nongying frankly shook her head and said, "No."</p>
<p>Just as Nongying said this, the red-dressed woman beside her spoke. The red-dressed woman was leading the White Fox clan on this expedition — Fairy Red Fox.</p>
<p>"Xue'er, that sort of footwork was created by Nongying and Nongyue with trial and error. The difficulty of pioneering is much higher than imitating. Yi Yun is only imitating." Fairy Red Fox gave Yi Yun a deep glance and said, "Of course, he is much stronger than I originally imagined."</p>
<p>"That's right. He's only imitating us." Nongyue, the younger sister, said with a slight frown. Yi Yun's imitation of their actions made Nongyue rather displeased. "If he has the ability, he should pioneer a footwork that belongs to himself. If so, I'll have a high opinion of him. If not, he's just a person who imitates!"</p>
<p>"Ordinary people might not be able to do so even if they want to imitate." Princess White Fox shook her head.</p>
<p>With the Luo clan and White Fox clan disciples gathered, the Luo Divine Hall trials also began.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the two spirit cruisers of the White Fox and Luo clan lifted off simultaneously. It flew away from the land mass where the Luo Divine Hall was. With that, the two spirit cruisers tunneled through the void, and before long, they used Void Transference to vanish completely.</p>
<p>"His Supremacy has left."</p>
<p>"He will come to pick us up in eighteen year's time."</p>
<p>Seeing the two spirit cruisers disappear, the elites present had mixed emotions. The White Fox clan most likely had another Supremacy powering the spirit cruiser. If not, they would not have been able to break through the spatial barrier of the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>And from beginning to the end, they had not seen the White Fox clan's Supremacy disembark from the spirit cruiser. Other than Princess White Fox and a few others, the rest did not know who the Supremacy that powered the spirit cruiser was.</p>
<p>A few of the Luo clan geniuses had managed to catch a glimpse of Supremacy Gulan only because of Empress Xuan. After all, there was a battle for the throne, so Empress Xuan had personally sent off the geniuses into the spirit cruiser. Supremacy Gulan had given the empress face and he had shown his face for a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>Following that, they did not even get to see Supremacy Gulan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the difference between them was too great. Be it the White Fox clan geniuses or the Luo clan geniuses, they were unqualified to have a Supremacy pay attention to them. Supremacy Gulan had lived for tens of thousands of years, and he had to send a batch of disciples to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven every sixty years. He had seen many so-called 'geniuses', so many that he was already numb to them.</p>
<p>But in fact, the number of geniuses who would truly mature were rare. A general calculation was that even the person who came first in the Luo Divine Hall trials had a one in ten thousand chance of becoming a Supremacy!</p>
<p>Hence, most major clans would cast a wide net when nurturing their young geniuses. Through tens of thousands of times of hard work being used to nurture millions of good saplings, having one of them mature was sufficient.</p>
<p>Many of the elites present understood this, but understanding was one thing, if they truly thought of it, their pride would still receive a setback.</p>
<p>For them to mature from a young age made them a remarkable existence. But in the backdrop of the entire clan, they were just one in several million. How could they feel reconciled with the fact of being belittled by others?</p>
<p>Hard work!</p>
<p>They had to produce good results!</p>
<p>Everyone was led by the Luo Divine Hall Elders as they flew towards the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>Upon landing, they saw the main palace and the surrounding towers, which immediately made these disciples feel tiny.</p>
<p>It was too magnificent, as though they were mountains that sprouted out of the ground.</p>
<p>The stone slates that lined the ground were also different from the Luo clan royal capital's. The material was unknown, but for them to last so long under the chaotic laws, they had to be extremely robust.</p>
<p>Looking up at the Luo Divine Hall made it even more spectacular. It had levels after levels that linked it to the sky.</p>
<p>"Go in." Elder Shi coldly said.</p>
<p>The first level of the Luo Divine Hall was extremely wide. It could accommodate more than ten thousand people. Despite the large group of disciples entering, it still appeared extremely spacious.</p>
<p>The vast grounds spun like gorgeous stars. Looking up, it was complete darkness. Everyone seemed to be standing alone in the universe, in the void of nothingness.</p>
<p>And at different positions around these stars were dozens of gigantic rocks.</p>
<p>These gigantic rocks emanated splendid chaotic auras, as though they were in constant flux. They did not appear real.</p>
<p>"This is the front hall of the Luo Divine Hall, called Astral Palace." The bearded Elder Duanmu said. Elder Shi did not appear like he had the patience to introduce such matters.</p>
<p>"Your first trial will be held here. Once this hall is closed, it will not be opened again. You will not be able to find an exit." The bearded Elder said with a rare smile. "None of you have ever battled an Ancient Fey before, right?"</p>
<p>The disciples pricked up their eyebrows as some of them honestly answered, "No."</p>
<p>"Then, all of you will soon have a chance." As the bearded Elder spoke, he flung an incantation onto one of the gigantic rocks.</p>
<p>A trail of light flashed past the stellar backdrop and following that, a growl was suddenly heard from the darkness above their heads.</p>
<p>This growl went straight to their hearts!</p>
<p>Following that, drastic changes occurred as black gases gathered together into clouds, and in a blink of an eye, a gigantic head appeared.</p>
<p>The head poked out of the darkness as a humongous eye glanced nonchalantly at the disciples below with a scarlet flash in its eyes.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this head, the disciples felt as though their hearts had been wrenched.</p>
<p>Dragon! A true Fey dragon!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also greatly taken aback. Back in Black Wind Valley's training, he had only encountered a land contaminated by a rotting Fey dragon after its death. And now, what he was facing was a true dragon itself.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The gigantic dragon flew down and it landed on the ground. Its massive body resembled a mountain. Its breathing made many disciples involuntarily tense up.</p>
<p>"The Primordial Empyrean Heaven is a world that failed to take form! Not only do the astronomical bodies or great worlds fail to take form, even an Ancient Fey born in primal times can fail in its evolution too!"</p>
<p>"Most of the Ancient Fey who fail to evolve would turn to ash under the immense river of time. However, there will be some who leave behind their soul essence that get wrapped in the most primordial gases of Chaos. This allows them to last till the present day!"</p>
<p>"Our Luo clan has collected a few Ancient Fey soul essence to establish this palace!"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's words caused Yi Yun to secretly falter.</p>
<p>Not only could a world fail to take form, even an Ancient Fey could fail to evolve. This allowed the production of valuable Ancient Fey soul essences.</p>
<p>These Ancient Fey soul essence were restored through the use of the Luo clan's array formations. It allowed the depiction of such an incredibly realistic divine dragon.</p>
<p>"This Ancient Fey soul essence isn't unique to the Luo clan, right?" Yi Yun asked Gu Qing in a low voice.</p>
<p>Gu Qing nodded and said, "Naturally, our Luo clan only occupies a portion of the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. These Ancient Fey soul essences can be owned by other clans and Fey countries. For example, the White Fox clan's White Fox trials are very similar to our Luo Divine Hall trials."</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. Both clans were in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, so the resources they possessed were fairly identical. Hence, it was understandable that the trials they created were also similar.</p>
<p>Yi Yun took another look at the divine dragon. The Ancient Fey phantom image conjured by the array formation had the soul essence of an Ancient Fey that failed in its evolution imbued into it. Its powers were obviously incomparable to a true dragon, but it was definitely not easily beaten.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Shi spoke.</p>
<p>"The gigantic rocks in front of you are known as Fey Refining Rocks. They are similarly produced from the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. Such special divine rocks can seal the soul essence of an Ancient Fey that failed in its evolution and store them for along time. It is also one of the heritage cornerstones of our Luo clan!"</p>
<p>As Elder Shi spoke, Elder Duanmu dispersed the incantation on the Fey Refining Rock. Following that, the conjured dragon dissipated into countless points of light.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu added on, "From now, we will begin testing your actual combat. Everyone will enter the array formation and battle with the Ancient Fey soul essence in the Fey Refining Rock. I will be outside here and watch how well you will fight!"</p>
<p>Chapter 883: Jian Zhu</p>
<p>Battle with a true Ancient Fey?</p>
<p>Although it was a wisp of soul essence, it was still enough to excite everyone. The young geniuses present were basically all Heaven Fey other than Yi Yun.</p>
<p>As descendants of the Ancient Fey, the Heaven Fey were proud of their blood heritage. At the same time, they would be excited about anything that had to do with Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>The eyes of many people lit up as fighting spirit shimmered!</p>
<p>All they had previously seen was the phantom images of Ancient Fey conjured using bloodlines. And now, they had an opportunity to interact with a true Ancient Fey soul essence. This combat experience was priceless!</p>
<p>Seeing that the elites present were so excited, Elder Shi did not think much of it as he said, "Inject your spiritual energies into the Fey Refining Rock, and the battle will begin. However, it is impossible for you to gain victory in the battle. The Ancient Fey soul essence in the Fey Refining Rock will constantly be reborn. Every rebirth increases its strength by several times. The Ancient Fey soul essence can go under nineteen rebirths in total! And that is to say, if you can kill the Ancient Fey soul essence nineteen consecutive times, it would be equivalent to clearing the trial, but that is impossible!" Elder Shi said indifferently.</p>
<p>The young elites present frowned slightly when they heard this.</p>
<p>Impossible?</p>
<p>Although they also knew that they had a long way ahead on their martial paths, they still felt under the weather when they were completely denied by others.</p>
<p>Especially with Elder Shi's expression, it was as though he could not be bothered to speak another word. It was as though most of the young elites present were ants to him, not worthy of his attention.</p>
<p>"If the Ancient Fey soul essence can be killed eighteen times, how powerful would it be at the nineteenth time?" Yi Yun cocked his head and asked Gu Qing.</p>
<p>Elder Shi's words had sparked his curiosity.</p>
<p>Gu Qing shook his head and said, "I only know that the Fey Refining Rocks are difficult to clear, but I have no idea how difficult the nineteenth round is either… "</p>
<p>Just as Gu Qing spoke, a pleasant-sounding voice resounded, "At the nineteenth time, it's probably when one approaches the level of a Supremacy would one be able to beat it, I guess."</p>
<p>Many people heard this when it was said.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a jolt.</p>
<p>Approach the level of a Supremacy!?</p>
<p>That is way too ridiculous!</p>
<p>"Or it should be said that everything from the fifth round onwards is not prepared for us."</p>
<p>The person who spoke was the black-dressed youth. His face was slightly pale, and his eyes were black with a luster. He had short hair and he had a white bone sword on his back that appeared blunt. There was a bird on his shoulder as well.</p>
<p>This person was the mysterious youth from the Luo clan. Other than Luo Mo, no one present knew him.</p>
<p>"Typically, a person who can kill the first Ancient Fey soul essence's incarnation at the moment they step into the Primordial Empyrean Heaven is extremely rare. In fact, most people will be repelled out of the Fey Refining Rock at the moment they enter. Even at the end of the eighteenth year, they would barely be able to kill it once or twice." The mysterious youth spoke, and as he did so, he gave Princess White Fox a glance.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Princess White Fox was the strongest person amongst everyone present!</p>
<p>"It's this girl that Master specially pointed out. He said that she would be my greatest opponent… " The mysterious youth said in his mind.</p>
<p>After arriving in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, his Master had transmitted his voice into his ear, telling him to pay attention to this fox-eared girl in white.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other than his Master wanting him to do his best to surpass her, he had also added — "Whatever will be, will be. There is no need to be disheartened."</p>
<p>It was as though losing to her was normal. This had ignited the refusal of defeat in this mysterious youth's heart.</p>
<p>He would like to see how many times Princess White Fox could kill the Ancient Fey soul essence.</p>
<p>"This... Young Brother, may I ask who you are… ?" Gu Qing could not resist asking.</p>
<p>He was also a member of the Luo clan, but he had never heard of this person. It was as though he had appeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>And most critical of all, this black-dressed youth appeared pretty impressive. Be it his stance or knowledge, he had completely surpassed him.</p>
<p>"Me? I'm Jian Zhu, Supremacy Gulan's personal disciple. As I have always been cultivating with Master, I seldom am in the royal capital." The mysterious youth said in a carefree manner.</p>
<p>His identity was not something that needed to be kept a secret.</p>
<p>"Supremacy Gulan's disciple?" Gu Qing instantly felt choked.</p>
<p>The surrounding young elites from the Luo clan were also dumbfounded when they heard this.</p>
<p>They had already guessed that his pedigree was extremely high, but they had never expected him to be a Supremacy's disciple!</p>
<p>There were very few Supremacies in the Luo clan. They only knew a handful of names of the Supremacies. Even if the reclusive existences were added, it was a number no more than two digits.</p>
<p>Most Supremacies had become ascetics, and did not meddle with the political matters of the royal capital. They and the royal court were two different systems.</p>
<p>These Supremacies were the true foundation of the Luo clan!</p>
<p>There were extremely stringent restrictions for a Supremacy to take in a disciple, especially a personal disciple. They were far and few in number. After all, a personal disciple would inherit their mantle. All sorts of top resources would be spent on the personal disciple generously.</p>
<p>A Supremacy's fortune was not unlimited either. They had to be very meticulous in taking in a personal disciple. There might even be Supremacies who only took in one personal disciple their entire lives.</p>
<p>The status of a Supremacy's personal disciple was understandable. It was no wonder that Luo Mo was so respectful to the youth.</p>
<p>After knowing the mysterious youth's identity, Ran Xueyi and Donglin Yu looked each other in the eye. They could only give a wry smile.</p>
<p>Their titles as the 'royal capital's four great young masters' were a joke in front of Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>The so-called royal capital's four young masters would change every few decades, so it was practically useless. As for a Supremacy... their Xushui Ran clan and Donglin clan had not produced a Supremacy in the past few millenniums.</p>
<p>If the top few family clans in the Luo clan were as such, there was obviously no need to mention the other family clans.</p>
<p>"Supremacy Gulan's personal disciple… "</p>
<p>Princess White Fox looked at the black-dressed youth with a tiny bird on his shoulder. She was somewhat astonished, but that was all to it.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan also had personal disciples of Supremacies. However, even the personal disciples of Supremacies were slightly inferior to her.</p>
<p>The status of a royal progeny was also determined by one's talent and strength.</p>
<p>Supremacies might seem out of reach to others, but for Princess White Fox, she could easily interact with them. She had received advice from Supremacies as well.</p>
<p>"Begin attempting the trial. The Fey Refining Rock arrays can accommodate twenty disciples a time. You can use your thoughts to choose the Ancient Fey that you want to challenge. The form of the Ancient Fey is not important, because regardless of the form, the Ancient Fey's strength are similar."</p>
<p>"From the third round of killing the Ancient Fey onwards, you will receive rewards! The rewards will be weapons or treasured materials. From the fourth kill onwards, you can obtain core heritage of the Luo clan, as well as Ancient Fey bones!"</p>
<p>At that moment, Elder Duanmu spoke. The words he said gave everyone a burning desire to do battle.</p>
<p>It was difficult, but the rewards made their blood boil with excitement.</p>
<p>Evern Yi Yun also felt slightly stirred. Ancient Fey bone!</p>
<p>He had previously absorbed a single Ancient Fey bone, which had great benefits to his body and bloodline.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's bloodline and physique were still too weak, so an Ancient Fey bone was like a timely gift.</p>
<p>However… that would need him to kill the Ancient Fey soul essence four or even five times!</p>
<p>Chapter 884: Difficulty</p>
<p>Less than half a year had passed since Yi Yun arrived in the 12 Empyrean Heavens. Yi Yun did not know what level his actual combat had reached.</p>
<p>However, reason told him that actual combat was his weakness.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal, he had a great advantage in the Desolate Heaven technique and his nomological insights far exceeded the common members of the Fey race.</p>
<p>But for actual combat…</p>
<p>Even at Mt. Azure Billow, Yi Yun had defeated Luo Tian and Ran Yu without using his true combat ability.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced at Jian Zhu. Taking him as an example, he had accompanied a Supremacy since he was young. He obtained the personal guidance of a Supremacy and he had cultivated top cultivation techniques. The pills and relics he used were top-grade. Even the people who sparred with Jian Zhu were great talents.</p>
<p>By growing up in such an environment, Jian Zhu's strength was understandably strong!</p>
<p>Compared to himself, he started in the Cloud Wilderness and only began cultivating at the age of twelve. In the first few years of cultivation, the cultivation resources that were available to him were extremely mediocre. His horizons and the things he encountered could not be compared to the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>Of course, with the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun was able to experience certain opportunities Jian Zhu might not have, but to convert that to actual strength needed time.</p>
<p>"Do you find it difficult?" Gu Qing cocked his head and asked Yi Yun. Yi Yun noticed that Gu Qing did not seem relaxed.</p>
<p>Gu Qing was also a famous figure himself, but in front of the top geniuses of the Luo clan and White Fox clan, Gu Qing felt somewhat disheartened.</p>
<p>"Fight it out and put in your greatest effort! The Luo Divine Hall trials will last very long. It's only the beginning."</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not anxious. He was not even forty years of age yet. His martial path had just opened up. A moment's loss was nothing.</p>
<p>At this moment, there were people who had already entered the Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>There were a total of about forty Fey Refining Rock in Astral Palace. The main rock in the middle was the size of a house.</p>
<p>Twenty people could go in at the time. As they stood in front of the largest Fey Refining Rock, a beam from the Fey Refining Rock immediately absorbed twenty people as a whole.</p>
<p>"Oh? Even the body is absorbed in. Looks like it's not a consciousness battle, but a true physical battle… "</p>
<p>Most of the elites present were waiting for the battle outcomes of these twenty people. Many of them were eager to battle an Ancient Fey so that they could make a name for himself.</p>
<p>Regardless if it was Elder Shi's disdain for them or the identities of Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu, they had stimulated the competitive streak amongst these young elites.</p>
<p>They were all proud children of heaven, so they had pride in their hearts.</p>
<p>A successor of a Supremacy was powerful, but the final outcome needed to be compared. Even if they truly lost, they did not want to lose too badly.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was having various thoughts.</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>With a dull thud, a Luo clan disciple was expelled in about thirty seconds after entering the Fey Refining Rock!</p>
<p>He slammed heavily onto the ground as his face turned pale.</p>
<p>"Fail."</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu seemed to value his words with gold, so he did not even say an additional word.</p>
<p>This Luo clan disciple did not even manage to kill an Ancient Fey phantom image. He only lasted for about thirty seconds.</p>
<p>The gap was just too great.</p>
<p>One did not mean much, but following that…</p>
<p>"Bam! Bam! Bam!"</p>
<p>One trial-taker after another was expelled. It was not limited to the Luo clan disciples. Even trial-takers from the White Fox clan did not create any miracles. After lasting for about five minutes, they were also expelled out of the rock!</p>
<p>After all, the White Fox had chosen the elites from their clan to participate in the Luo clan's trials. Those who were chosen were naturally not too bad. Those who were just chosen to make up the numbers were probably left in their own clans.</p>
<p>However, despite being handpicked, these people did not defeat the first Ancient Fey soul essence.</p>
<p>"All the twenty who had entered the Fey Refining Rock first have failed!" Elder Shi calmly announced the outcome.</p>
<p>Clearly, the outcome was within his expectations.</p>
<p>"All… All of them failed. Even Lin Yu has failed. She only lasted for about three minutes… She is the top genius of the five states in the southwest. It was believed that Lin Yu would be able to dazzle at the Luo Divine Hall trials, but who knew… that she would fail right at the beginning."</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciple who spoke also came from the five states in the southwest. He was confident of himself, but after seeing Lin Yu fail so miserably, he was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He did not know how strong a Supremacy's successor was, but he knew very well of Lin Yu's strength.</p>
<p>He knew that he was much weaker than Lin Yu. If Lin Yu only managed to endure for five minutes, he would most likely not be able to last more than three minutes, much less defeat the first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Many people had such thoughts when they saw this. Everyone believed that they were extraordinary and that a miracle would happen to them. However, reason told them that it was highly unlikely that they would even clear the first stage.</p>
<p>After the first batch of disciples exited, the second batch of disciples was up. Yi Yun saw a familiar person amongst the crowd — Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>There were too many people who were qualified to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials. Yi Yun, Gu Qing and company were of higher status than ordinary disciples. They were situated in front of the group. As for Luo Fengling, Luo Tian and company, they were mixed in the group. And because of this, Yi Yun was able to notice Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling smiled at Yi Yun. She did not have any hopes of creating a miracle. She knew very well that there was always someone better and that she was still far from the mark.</p>
<p>"If you are able to persist on, it's best to last as long as possible. Those who can persist longer than five minutes would be given more opportunities in this trial. If you can't even last five minutes, you might not be able to obtain a thing from this trial."</p>
<p>Seeing many disciples appear uneasy, a rare instance of Elder Duanmu's tone turning soft happened.</p>
<p>Five minutes…</p>
<p>In the previous test, only one out of twenty people managed to last five minutes!</p>
<p>Even lasting five minutes appeared extremely difficult.</p>
<p>"Fail!"</p>
<p>"Fail!"</p>
<p>"Fail!"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu constantly said the same word. Up to now, not a single person had managed to threaten an Ancient Fey soul essence.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"All have failed. Next batch!"</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, another few dozen people were eliminated.</p>
<p>Few could even last five minutes, much less kill an Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, most of the disciple had entered the Fey Refining Rock. Following that was the time for the true elites of the Luo clan and White Fox clan.</p>
<p>"It's your turn. Do not be too disappointing." Elder Duanmu said with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox giggled, "Hehe, your Luo clan's Fey Refining Rock array is more difficult than my White Fox clan's. But even so, I believe Elder Duanmu would not be disappointed any further. Nongying, Nongyue, go on up!"</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox nonchalantly chose the twins.</p>
<p>Nongying! Nongyue! The White Fox clan's Shadow Twins!</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu frowned slightly. He knew very well that at this Luo Divine Hall trials, the Luo clan was very likely going to lose to the White Fox clan. Firstly, this generation of the White Fox clan was very strong. Secondly, many of the elites of the Luo clan had been sent to the White Fox clan to participate in the White Fox clan's trials. Those left behind in the Luo Divine Hall were naturally inferior to the White Fox clan's elites.</p>
<p>However, despite knowing this, be it Elder Duanmu or Elder Shi, they would still be displeased if they really lost.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu glanced at Jian Zhu. The only person left to hold the ground in the Luo clan was Jian Zhu alone!</p>
<p>However, the White Fox clan's geniuses were many in number. It was not even Princess White Fox's turn, but the Shadow Twins. After the Shadow Twins, there was Wufeng, whose strength was relatively similar to theirs.</p>
<p>It would be too early to use Jian Zhu at this point in time.</p>
<p>Upon thinking of this, Elder Duanmu looked at the rest. The upper echelons of the Luo clan had instructed that they were not to weaken their stance at the trials. Elder Duanmu also had a general understanding of the strength of all the elites present.</p>
<p>Sweeping his gaze across the Luo clan disciples, there was no one comparable to the Shadow Twins. They were all far too weak!</p>
<p>They were destined to lose this stage to the White Fox clan. It was an outcome without question.</p>
<p>"Forget it. We can only choose a general from among dwarves as long as we do not lose too badly."</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Elder Duanmu nominated —</p>
<p>"Ran Xueyi! Donglin Yu! Gu Qing! Yi Yun! All of you, go on up!"</p>
<p>He was nominated.</p>
<p>Yi Yun exhaled deeply and he walked towards the Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>"The opponents are the Shadow Twins. Elder Duanmu nominated us probably for us to be cannon fodder." Beside Yi Yun, Gu Qing said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Gu Qing usually thought highly of himself, but in front of the Shadow Twins, he could not feel any pride. He could only resign himself to fate and accept the reality.</p>
<p>Yi Yun declined to comment. He glanced deeply at the Shadow Twins, Nongying and Nongyue. They were both tall, not much shorter than he was. Their legs were long and straight as though they were measured against a ruler.</p>
<p>Their beauty was impeccable, and their bearing was extremely powerful. With the twins standing in front of the Fey Refining Rock, they became the focus of attention.</p>
<p>The two girls were truly unfathomable.</p>
<p>After coming to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, Yi Yun had fought with too few people. He had only fought a few miscellaneous chores disciples at Mt. Fengling. He had yet to fight with true Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven geniuses. Yi Yun could not estimate how powerful they were.</p>
<p>Yi Yun truly did not have much confidence when it came to the true combat competition with the Shadow Twins.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the Fey Refining Rock, Nongyue glanced at Yi Yun. "You learned the footwork of me and my sister."</p>
<p>Nongyue appeared to bear a grudge with Yi Yun's learning of their footwork.</p>
<p>Uh…</p>
<p>Yi Yun was rendered speechless as he did not know how to respond.</p>
<p>Nongyue said again, "Your name is Yi Yun, right? Princess Xue'er had complimented your Desolate Heaven technique and even said that you might be a match of me and my sister at this trial. However… I do not believe so. Many elites would bear wasting time on the Desolate Heaven technique in their youth. Just being good at the Desolate Heaven technique is nothing. Strength is everything."</p>
<p>"I know your forte is nomological insights. At the Luo Divine Hall trials, there will be a competition on laws. I will defeat you on the nomological insights that you pride yourself in!"</p>
<p>"Of course, all of this needs you to be able to last five minutes in the Fey Refining Rock array!"</p>
<p>After Nongyue said this, her elegant body flashed and disappeared into the Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was rather speechless looking at Nongyue's back. He had only learned her footwork and he had been targeted. Of course, what Princess White Fox had previously said probably made Nongyue treat him as her opponent.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Yi Yun glanced at Princess White Fox and took a step forward and stepped through the Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>With a flash, Yi Yun entered a completely unfamiliar space.</p>
<p>Chapter 885: Battling the Ancient Fey</p>
<p>What unfolded in front of Yi Yun was a desolate grass plain. Tall grass that reached his hips endlessly stretched throughout the plain.</p>
<p>Other than Yi Yun, everyone else had disappeared, even the Luo Divine Hall had disappeared.</p>
<p>"Choose the Ancient Fey you want to battle!" A voice suddenly pierced through Yi Yun's mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, information regarding the Ancient Fey was injected into his mind.</p>
<p>More than a hundred Ancient Fey of all shapes and sizes appeared.</p>
<p>Yi Yun even saw the three-legged Golden Crow and the Nine Neonate amongst them.</p>
<p>The three-legged Golden Crow and Nine Neonate were considered two of the more powerful Ancient Fey. Yi Yun had a good understanding of them since they were his Aspect Totems.</p>
<p>However… just understanding them was not very useful.</p>
<p>After all, all the Heaven Fey, who entered the Fey Refining Rock, had their own corresponding Ancient Fey ancestors. They obviously understood their own ancestors very well. Yet, it remains to be seen who had defeated an Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he chose an Ancient Fey that cultivated in the same laws as him, the amount of damage that he could inflict would be greatly limited if he were to use those laws. For example, if Yi Yun wanted to use pure Yang laws to kill a three-legged Golden Crow?</p>
<p>Difficult!</p>
<p>The three-legged Golden Crow's pure Yang laws would only surpass Yi Yun's!</p>
<p>Defeating an Ancient Fey, even if it was just a soul essence, was something very difficult for the present Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"I choose… the Ranyi Fish!"</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish was the ancestor of the Xushui Ran clan.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish was not considered very powerful amongst the Ancient Fey. Furthermore, after having a vendetta with the Xushui Ran clan, he had an understanding of the Ranyi Fish.</p>
<p>By choosing an Ancient Fey that he was familiar with and one that was countered by pure Yang laws, it would make things easier for him.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun made his choice, the vast grass plains disappeared and it changed into a roaring sea. Floating above the sea surface, a strange fish appeared out of the sea. It had a snake's head and a fish's body. It had six legs and two rows of sharp teeth.</p>
<p>"In thirty seconds, the battle will begin. Choose your weapon freely! Self-brought weapons, puppets, pills are not to be used." The voice boomed again.</p>
<p>Following that, several kinds of weapons appeared in Yi Yun's perception. However, all the weapons were of the same quality.</p>
<p>In addition to not being able to use pills and puppets, this battle was truly considered fair for everyone.</p>
<p>"The pure Yang broken sword, the Sun Shooting Nine Deaths Bow and the God Advent Tower can not be used!" Yi Yun gasped slightly.</p>
<p>All the treasures he had was considered top-grade, especially the God Advent Tower. During the battle of the Black-armored Demon God, it had played an important role, but now it could not be used. Furthermore, his opponent was an Ancient Fey spirit essence. Such a battle was too difficult.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>A sword with a metallic luster appeared in Yi Yun's hand. When Yi Yun injected his Yuan Qi into it, he realized that other than the sword being hard, it did not gain any augmentation from his Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Sinking his thoughts, his spiritual energy interfaced with the Black-armored Demon God puppet, but he discovered that the connection had been severed. Only the Draco First True Gold remained available.</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold could still be used?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slightly surprised. Upon careful thought, it was understandable. The Draco First True Gold possessed a part of his soul, so in terms of aura, it was identical to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The Fey Refining Rock array probably banned all treasures without any life to it. Since an avatar was also part of his strength, it was not excluded.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Ranyi Fish let out a scream. It opened its humongous mouth and spat out a blue water column. The water column dispersed in the sky and it split into droplets of water that shot straight at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The clear water droplets contained tremendous power in them. Each of them was as hard as divine metal, and they were powerful killing devices!</p>
<p>Yi Yun retreated in a hurry as he slashed outwards!</p>
<p>"Cha! Cha! Cha!"</p>
<p>His sword beams interweaved into a net as they struck the water droplets, bursting them apart. However, after they exploded, they did not dissipate. Instead, they coagulated very quickly. As for Yi Yun's sword beams, they only pierced through the gaps between the droplets, not affecting them at all.</p>
<p>A sword could not stop the flow of water, and as a water-based Ancient Fey, the Ranyi Fish was equally proficient in water laws. It coagulated the water droplets that attacked Yi Yun from every direction.</p>
<p>Thousand Snow Domain!</p>
<p>With a thought, a sea of flying sabers formed around him.</p>
<p>They were not the Thousand Snow flying sabers as all Yi Yun could use was an ordinary saber array. Although the quality of the sabers was weaker, the conjuring of the saber array still remained powerful.</p>
<p>The water droplets were once again sliced through!</p>
<p>The wantonly dancing saber beams sliced the countless water droplets into a water mist. However, Yi Yun knew very well that the water mist would immediately coagulate. He had very little time for himself.</p>
<p>"Sou!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body shot forward like an arrow. He used the hundredth of a second that the water droplets needed to coagulate, and charged through the water mist to attack the Ranyi Fish!</p>
<p>To kill the Ranyi Fish, he needed to strike its body!</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun approached the Ranyi Fish, it opened its jaws and attempted to bite Yi Yun!</p>
<p>At the instant when the Ranyi Fish opened its mouth, a raw and fishy wind emitted from it. It did not resemble a phantom image in any way. It was like a true Ancient Fey. This was probably the effects of being constructed by a soul essence.</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>Yi Yun circulated the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' as all his pure Yang power burst out. A burning strike that resembled the sun slashed out!</p>
<p>This strike contained the Pure Yang Sword Palace's sword intent. The single strike caused the sky to change colors!</p>
<p>The sea in which the Ranyi Fish was lurking was split apart by Yi Yun's strike. A blue ravine seemed to open up as the water surface rose up like cliffs. Large amounts of seawater began to pour down like a waterfall.</p>
<p>"Cha!"</p>
<p>Blood splattered!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish had been injured by Yi Yun's strike!</p>
<p>However, at the moment that the sword beam pierced through the Ranyi Fish's body, Yi Yun's heart skipped a beat. He sensed that at the moment that the sword beam pierced through the Ranyi Fish, its innards seem to dodge the strike like a water flow. The beam did not truly injure the Ranyi Fish's vital organs.</p>
<p>Was this an effect of water laws as well!?</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not have time to consider this. The injured Ranyi Fish still possessed terrifying offensive power. It opened its mouth and spat out a blue sword, formed completely from water laws.</p>
<p>At such a close distance and the sword's extremely fast speed, it was nearly impossible to dodge!</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>There was a flash as the Draco First True Gold appeared in front of Yi Yun. It held a saber in its hand to block the sword strike, but the terrifying power still sent the Draco First True Gold flying backwards.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish's fish came biting once again. Just as it was about to bite Yi Yun's head, Yi Yun slanted his head.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>999 Thousand Snow flying sabers formed a silver band where Yi Yun's head previously was, shooting out straight into the Ranyi Fish's mouth!</p>
<p>As the flying saber pierced through the Ranyi Fish's fish throat, Yi Yun could feel that strange feeling again. The Ranyi Fish's body was like water. Its flesh dispersed to the sides like water. Although the flying saber had pierced through it, causing blood to spill, it was not severely injured.</p>
<p>"This defensive strength… "</p>
<p>Yi Yun's heart sank. Indeed, every Ancient Fey had something terrifying about them. There had been so many Luo clan and White Fox clan geniuses who failed at killing a single Ancient Fey. With so many failures, it was obvious how difficult it was.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew very well that he too would not win if he were in their shoes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At this moment, outside the Fey Refining Rock array, Elder Shi and Elder Duanmu were looking at the largest Fey Refining Rock in silence.</p>
<p>As the controllers of the arrays, Elder Shi and Elder Duanmu could obviously see what was going on.</p>
<p>However, Fairy Red Fox could not. Although she could not see what was happening, she was not worried about the Shadow Twins at all. However, on the Luo clan's side, it was different. If it was the successor of a Supremacy, it was probably still worth watching, but if it were anyone else, the person would probably be greatly lacking.</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox asked with a smile, "Elders, what do you see. Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's eyelids moved as he said, "The battles are very intense. Many of them are close to their limits."</p>
<p>"Heh heh heh!" Fairy Red Fox laughed seductively. "It's not bad to be able to last this long. It seems that the Luo clan disciples you sent out this time are still not bad. I wonder how the two little girls on my side are doing?"</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox's tone annoyed Elder Duanmu extremely.</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox was a junior to Duanmu at best, so he was obviously displeased of a junior acting so smugly in front of him.</p>
<p>Furthermore… she had the things to back her smugness.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu slightly frowned as he said, "Nongying and Nongyue have each killed an Ancient Fey… "</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said this, all the disciples were confounded.</p>
<p>Already killed one!?</p>
<p>The people before had all failed. They could only be graded based on the length of time that they lasted. The person who lasted the longest did not last past six minutes. And now, at just three minutes, the Shadow Twins had each killed an Ancient Fey!?</p>
<p>The... gap was just too huge.</p>
<p>The faces of the geniuses present turned ugly. They felt it jarring!</p>
<p>Everyone was an elite, but why were they so far from Nongying and Nongyue?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Elder Duanmu's reply, Fairy Red Fox said with a smile, "Nongying and Nongyue are skilled at combined attacks. By separating them, their combat power will decline greatly. Killing an Ancient Fey in three minutes is still passable."</p>
<p>Chapter 886: Killing the Ranyi Fish</p>
<p>When Fairy Red Fox said this, the surrounding Luo clan elites were rendered speechless.</p>
<p>Despite having killed an Ancient Fey in three minutes, Fairy Red Fox had claimed that the Shadow Twins were skilled at combined attacks, not fighting alone.</p>
<p>Although they knew that Fairy Red Fox was saying those words intentionally to posture, they had also guessed that what she said was true. As twins, Nongying and Nongyue were probably able to be of one mind. They could definitely obtain double the results with half the effort when cultivating in combined attacks.</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins seemed lofty and unreachable. They stood on a pedestal so high that it could only be reached by Jian Zhu out of all the younger generation of the Luo clan currently present in the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, many people looked at Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>With a bone sword behind his back, Jian Zhu looked at Elder Duanmu and asked, "Senior Duanmu. Other than the Shadow Twins, how are the others?"</p>
<p>"The others… " Duanmu shook his head. "They are already gradually approaching their limits. Ran Xueyi would probably be able to last the longest. He has been conserving his strength all this time and he has about 60% of his stamina left. As for Gu Qing… his foundation is still relatively weak. He will be defeated faster than Ran Xueyi."</p>
<p>"Conserving his strength? That sure is a 'smart' way of doing things." Fairy Red Fox chuckled as she said sarcastically.</p>
<p>In the Fey Refining Rock array, if one could not kill the Ancient Fey, it would then depend on the amount of time that they lasted. The longer one lasted, the better it would reflect on them. Hence, with the mind of conserving his stamina, Ran Xueyi had begun evasive maneuvers the moment he entered the array to stall for time.</p>
<p>He could obviously last for a long while in such a situation, but it was equivalent to giving up the possibility of defeating the Ancient Fey. In contrast, someone truly outstanding would use an indomitable spirit to fight for that ray of hope to defeat an Ancient Fey, even if the odds were against them.</p>
<p>"What about Yi Yun? How's Yi Yun?" Jian Zhu asked again.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun is battling fiercely and he is expending a great deal of his stamina. If this goes on, he might not be able to last five minutes."</p>
<p>"Less than five minutes? Then, wouldn't he be expelled very soon?"</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun was human, he was still a member of the Luo clan. Many of the Luo clan disciples present still wished for Yi Yun to gain some face for the Luo clan. Even if he lost, they did not wish for him to lose too terribly. Although it was impossible to defeat a single Ancient Fey soul essence, it would still reflect well on them if he could last for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>"He should not be able to last much longer, however… Oh?"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's heart suddenly skipped a beat as a look of surprise appeared in his eyes that were staring at the Fey Refining Rock…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Boom!"</p>
<p>The Draco First True Gold avatar was thrown backward as it took a hard knock for Yi Yun once again.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>A fiery arrow burning with pure Yang flames shot straight at the snakelike neck of the Ranyi Fish. As it pierced through the Ranyi Fish's body, a blood of rain burst out!</p>
<p>However, the liquefaction phenomenon happened in the Ranyi Fish's body again. It diffused most of the arrow's power and it was only left with minor injuries.</p>
<p>With such a strange defensive method, Yi Yun knew very well that he was bound to lose if this carried on.</p>
<p>"Golden Crow!" Yi Yun roared as a three-legged Golden Crow Aspect Totem appeared behind him!</p>
<p>At the same time, the Tang Valley phantom image appeared behind him as well!</p>
<p>The raging flames in the valley connected the land to the sky. Above the valley, a Fusang tree stood erect and on its crown hung ten blinding suns.</p>
<p>Ten Suns from Fusang, Who Masters Pure Yang!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish used water laws for its defense, causing its body to act like flowing water. Slashes at it resulted in nearly zero reaction. Only the power of pure Yang could deal it a bit of damage, but it was not enough.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Yuan Qi was decreasing. If he was to compete in expenditure with the Ranyi Fish, he was bound to lose eventually.</p>
<p>He had to attain victory in one strike!</p>
<p>Yi Yun roared and the three-legged Golden Crow shrieked as it merged into the sword in Yi Yun's hands!</p>
<p>The sword burned with a shimmering flame as though it was about to melt.</p>
<p>"Ah&ndash; "</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish let out a cry as it opened its mouth and bit at Yi Yun!</p>
<p>This was the common means of attack for the Ranyi Fish, and Yi Yun was also waiting for this instance. He circulated the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' to its limits and together with his sword, he charged into the Ranyi Fish's gaping mouth.</p>
<p>One with the sword!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun charged straight towards the Ranyi Fish's belly as the pure Yang flames around him burned!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish's body liquefied once again as it wanted Yi Yun to pass through its body.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Yi Yun resolutely made up his mind as all the pure Yang power in his key acupuncture points spewed out like an erupting volcano!</p>
<p>Golden Crow Inferno Immersion, Blazing Into the Ether!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's surroundings had turned into a sea of fire. With pure Yang laws, Yi Yun endured the horror of the inferno's blazing. But even so, his skin ruptured from the burning!</p>
<p>Instantly, it was as though the sun had risen in the Ranyi Fish's mouth. Tongues of fire swept around as billions of gallons of seawater were evaporated. The Ranyi Fish's body bloated as though it was about to explode.</p>
<p>This time, it could not expel the raging pure Yang flames with the water elemental laws that it knew!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish let out a cry as blood gushed out of its mouth, but the blood was instantly evaporated by the flames. The Ranyi Fish's lifeforce rapidly drained away from its body as well.</p>
<p>However, this was a method that damaged the enemy and dealt nearly the same damage to oneself as well. Yi Yun had to withstand the impact of the terrifying energy explosion. Although his body had been reconstituted with the Ancient Fey bone at Mt. Azure Billow, there was too little time and the strength he gained from it was far from enough.</p>
<p>The strong impact left Yi Yun's arms covered in blood. However, he still gripped the sword tightly as he pointed the sword tip forward.</p>
<p>Split!</p>
<p>Yi Yun and his sword pierced through the Ranyi Fish's body!</p>
<p>His body was stained with blood. Some of it was his, and some of it was the Ranyi Fish's. His Yuan Qi was completely depleted and he could no longer stand up straight!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had bore a huge hole through the Ranyi Fish's body. Its innards had been burned into a mess, but an excruciating pain came from his arms. The bone in his arms had been fractured.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish slowly stopped struggling. Its corpse floated to the surface of the sea. The seawater was boiling because of the pure Yang flames and it was later dyed red with the Ranyi Fish's blood.</p>
<p>Was it finally over… ?</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun collapsed completely. He lost control of his body as he plummeted towards the sea.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the moment that Yi Yun delivered his desperate strike, in an internecine assault on the Ranyi Fish, Gu Qing had also been expelled from the Fey Refining Rock!</p>
<p>At this moment, five minutes had just passed!</p>
<p>Although it was barely five minutes, the two Luo clan Elders would still consider Gu Qing's combat performance during the results evaluation. Launching a blitz attack was obviously different to constantly dodging.</p>
<p>"Gu Qing managed to last for five minutes. As for Yi Yun, he managed to do so for more than five minutes."</p>
<p>At this juncture, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. At least did they not lose too terribly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from what Elder Duanmu said, Yi Yun had been desperately fighting from the moment he had entered the Fey Refining Rock array.</p>
<p>It was truly commendable for him to last this long while engaging in such a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Chapter 887: Severely Injured</p>
<p>In the grand hall, the Fey Refining Rock array shimmered. When Gu Qing was expelled, Elder Duanmu said 'Fail' nonchalantly, but his attention was still focused on the Fey Refining Rock array.</p>
<p>"How are the rest?" Fairy Red Fox swirled her hair and asked.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's eyebrows moved as he said with a deep voice, "Nongying and Nongyue have wounded the second Ancient Fey."</p>
<p>Wounded the second Ancient Fey?</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox smiled. She was very satisfied with Nongying and Nongyue's combat strength. After all, the second Ancient Fey was many times stronger than the first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins were still able to wound the second Ancient Fey after engaging in a full battle with the first Ancient Fey. They had far surpassed all the disciples before them.</p>
<p>"What about the others?" Fairy Red Fox asked as the corners of her mouth curled.</p>
<p>"Ran Xueyi still has a lot of stamina left. He should still be able to last for a while. As for Yi Yun… he is about to come out… "</p>
<p>"Coming out? To be able to last five minutes with the first Ancient Fey is still not bad." Fairy Red Fox nodded and she did not despise Yi Yun in any way. After all, with his background, such a result was pretty good.</p>
<p>However, compared to the Shadow Twins killing the first Ancient Fey in three minutes and wounding the second Ancient Fey, he was still a good deal away.</p>
<p>"Bam!"</p>
<p>The Fey Refining Rock shimmered as Yi Yun was expelled.</p>
<p>Gu Qing and Yi Yun nearly came out at the same moment, but Gu Qing only had a pale face with a few injuries, but for Yi Yun…</p>
<p>He was covered in blood and he had completely fainted.</p>
<p>"This is… "</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun about to collapse to the ground, Elder Duanmu pointed into the void and held Yi Yun's body, preventing him from falling to the ground.</p>
<p>He was so severely injured?</p>
<p>Not a single part of Yi Yun's body was fine. His Yuan Qi had also been completely drained.</p>
<p>It was just a trial's array, was that a need to go to such extent… ?</p>
<p>Battling an Ancient Fey in the Fey Refining Rock was not an illusion. It was a true battle in an interspatial zone. Although Elder Duanmu was watching, and the chances of death were unlikely, being too severely injured could affect the subsequent trials.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that the Ancient Fey was too strong, many people began keeping a distance once they realized that they were no match. Few people were like Yi Yun who fought so desperately.</p>
<p>"He's injured so badly? That punk is foolhardy. He might as well have conserved some strength for his cultivation. There's no prize from being so badly injured."</p>
<p>Many people were shaking their heads. Although Ran Xueyi's tactics were rather underhanded, it was still considered quite a good tactic. Dragging out time by using hit and run tactics was much better than being so miserable like Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was waiting for Elder Duanmu to declare Yi Yun's failure, they were surprised to see Elder Duanmu looking at Yi Yun in silence.</p>
<p>"Why? Elders, what are the two of you looking at?" Fairy Red Fox asked Elder Shi and Elder Duanmu with a smile.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu remained silent for a while before saying, "Yi Yun won. He killed the first Ancient Fey. Although he did so at his limits, he had still won... "</p>
<p>Huh? He won?</p>
<p>Everyone was confounded when they heard this.</p>
<p>Yi Yun… actually won?</p>
<p>No one would be surprised if the Shadow Twins won. The Shadow Twins were two of the top geniuses in the White Fox clan. As for Yi Yun… he was unknown before this and he had just suddenly appeared with his lowly beginnings. In everyone's heart, Yi Yun's strength was weaker than Gu Qing's.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun had managed to last for five minutes just like Gu Qing. Gu Qing's defeat was unsurprising, but Yi Yun… had managed to kill the first Ancient Fey?</p>
<p>"I thought he would lose. The strength he showed in battle was even weaker than Ran Xueyi's by a tiny bit, but Ran Xueyi is still stalling for time while battling with the Ancient Fey. As for Yi Yun, he had struck back, and by expending most of his Yuan Qi, he launched a fatal strike, hitting the Ancient Fey's weakness. So… he won… "</p>
<p>His strength was slightly weaker than Ran Xueyi, but he was able to win?</p>
<p>Everyone was amazed when Elder Duanmu said this. Although an individual's strength played a decisive role in the outcome of a battle, at times, one's fighting spirit, techniques, will, and insights could play important roles.</p>
<p>For Yi Yun to be able to defeat the first Ancient Fey in the absence of sufficient strength was truly surprising.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun actually… managed to defeat the first Ancient Fey… " Gu Qing was startled. As one of the Luo clan disciples who had just experienced fighting an Ancient Fey, he knew how powerful the Ancient Fey that he encountered in the Fey Refining Rock was. He was no match for it.</p>
<p>And as a Heaven Fey, Gu Qing had a sense of awe towards Ancient Fey. Furthermore, it was not an illusionary realm, it was a true battle, so the suppressive feeling was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Yet, Yi Yun had managed to strike back and kill an Ancient Fey under such circumstances!</p>
<p>Gu Qing found this matter incredulous.</p>
<p>At this moment, a White Fox clan disciple's lazy-sounding voice was heard. "He only killed the first Ancient Fey, but that was at the cost of going unconscious. To put it bluntly, it's just an internecine struggle. Do you need to have such great reactions? Those who aren't aware of it might think that he had consecutively killed two or three Ancient Fey! Don't forget that our White Fox clan's Shadow Twins are still in an intense battle inside the Fey Refining Rock. And at the three minute mark, they had each killed the first Ancient Fey!"</p>
<p>The surrounding White Fox clan disciples echoed in unison when this was said. "That's right. Yi Yun only relied on desperation for him to luckily clear the stage. What is of true value is still strength. We have so many talents from the White Fox clan this time. Senior Sisters Nongying and Nongyue have only just begun."</p>
<p>When the White Fox clan disciples said this, the Luo clan disciples fell silent.</p>
<p>Indeed, although Yi Yun's performance was not bad, the reason why he garnered attention was because of Yi Yun's low starting point. To many geniuses, Yi Yun was not much different from them. Under such circumstances, it was surprising for Yi Yun to kill the first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>However, compared to the geniuses in the White Fox clan, he was indeed nothing much.</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins were truly terrifying!</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins would truly leave Yi Yun in the dust upon comparison.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Fey Refining Rock shimmered as two figures were expelled from the Fey Refining Rock several seconds apart.</p>
<p>"So painful… "</p>
<p>Nongyue rubbed her delicate wrist. Her forearm was stained with blood. From the way she winced her nose, it looked somewhat adorable.</p>
<p>"I couldn't beat it. That bull's hide was too tough. Stabbing it with a sword, the wound was a foot deep, but there was no reaction despite me stabbing it a few dozen times." Nongyue grumbled. However, her words caused people to gulp.</p>
<p>Nongyue was battling the second Ancient Fey that was several times stronger. Not only did she last long in battle, she had also managed to stab the Ancient Fey a few dozen times?</p>
<p>Not only so, Nongyue had managed to escape relatively unharmed. Despite being injuries, compared to Yi Yun…</p>
<p>Yi Yun was currently the one with the best results amongst the Luo clan disciples, but he was unconscious.</p>
<p>Fairy Red Fox beamed as she stroked Nongyue's head and said, "Well done."</p>
<p>"Eh, why is Yi Yun unconscious?"</p>
<p>Only then did Nongyue notice Yi Yun. As Yi Yun had previously mimicked her footwork, this young lady was still bearing a grudge.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun did inordinately well and he managed to luckily kill the first Ancient Fey, but his strength was ultimately insufficient, so he was severely injured. There's no need to mind him. The strongest person from the Luo clan is Jian Zhu. He is the only opponent at this Luo Divine Hall trials that is worthy of your and Nongying's attention.</p>
<p>When Fairy Red Fox said this, Nongying and Nongyue glanced at Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>Although Princess Xue'er was strong, her opponent was Luo Huo'er. Her and her sister's mission was to beat Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>Be it Nongying or Nongyue, they did not believe that they would lose.</p>
<p>"Aunt, don't worry. I will definitely beat Jian Zhu." Nongyue waved her fist and said confidently.</p>
<p>She did say it with a Yuan Qi transmission, so although it was not very loud, everyone could hear it with their powerful hearing.</p>
<p>Elder Shi took a meaningful glance at Jian Zhu and said, "I'll take Yi Yun away to treat him. Jian Zhu, you are up."</p>
<p>With the declaration of war made, they obviously had to face them in battle. Without Princess Purple Spirit around, Jian Zhu was the face of the Luo clan!</p>
<p>Jian Zhu could not lose, or at least, he could not lose to the Shadow Twins.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu took a deep breath and he walked towards the Fey Refining Rock. Immediately following him was a burly man from the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>He was filled with a murderous intent, and there was a light ivory-colored scar on the middle of his eyebrows. A heavy sword hung behind his back. His name was Wufeng.</p>
<p>Wufeng versus Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present turned nervous. Compared to Yi Yun, they were certainly more concerned about Jian Zhu's results.</p>
<p>Chapter 888: Primordial Space</p>
<p>Six hours had passed by the time Yi Yun had regained consciousness. He slowly opened his eyes and he saw a gray ceiling. Looking around, he realized he was lying in a stone chamber.</p>
<p>The stone chamber was extremely spartan. The surrounding black rock was cut into furniture which looked heavy and cold.</p>
<p>"Your ability at recovery exceeds my expectations for you wake up in six hours. Your physique might not be strong, but strangely, the energy from a relic that you consume is absorbed very fast by you. This allowed you to regain consciousness so fast. If not, you would truly have missed important events at the trials."</p>
<p>A cold-looking elder was also in the stone chamber. Yi Yun remembered this elder to be Elder Shi.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Senior."</p>
<p>Yi Yun was cognizant of the fact that it was all thanks to the Purple Crystal that he was able to absorb the energy so fast. Even in a state of unconsciousness, the Purple Crystal was still able to absorb energy and help his body recuperate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Purple Crystal's existence surpassed anyone's perception. Even with Yi Yun lying there motionless, Elder Shi's probing was to no avail. He could not understand why Yi Yun absorbed the energy at such a rapid pace, because there was no way for him to find the Purple Crystal.</p>
<p>The Purple Crystal was too amazing. Its existence was beyond Yi Yun's comprehension.</p>
<p>Elder Shi was indeed very curious. When he probed Yi Yun's body but failed to find the exact reason, he could only conclude that Yi Yun had a special bloodline that resulted in him absorbing energy at an extremely fast rate. After all, life was complicated. There was a myriad of bloodlines, so it was understandable that there were bloodlines he did not understand.</p>
<p>Yi Yun sat up from the stone bed and stretched his body. He realized that he had recovered most of his Yuan Qi. This made Yi Yun marvel at the amazing effects of the Purple Crystal. With a supreme-grade recuperation relic, the Purple Crystal could allow the relic's effects to reach its maximum effect.</p>
<p>"Senior, this junior wants to ask how were the results of the people who later entered the Fey Refining Rock?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was already unconscious when he was expelled from the Fey Refining Rock array. He was eager to know how strong the Shadow Twins and Princess White Fox were.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's question was within Elder Shi's expectations. He said, "After you, the Shadow Twins also came out of the Fey Refining Rock array. The sisters had not only killed the first Ancient Fey, but they had also severely injured the second Ancient Fey. The Ancient Fey's energy expenditure reached about 50%. This was with the Shadow Twins holding back. If they were to fight as desperately as you did, this ratio would probably be higher."</p>
<p>"As for Wufeng... he was stronger by a bit. He managed to drain 70% of the second Ancient Fey's energy. Wufeng's combat strength is very outstanding. You can probably sense the thick bloodthirst aura from his body. He must have encountered several life and death fights."</p>
<p>"Finally, Princess White Fox. She was the only one who managed to kill the second Ancient Fey. Furthermore, against the third Ancient Fey, she had managed to hold on for a minute. She had even managed to injure the Ancient Fey." Elder Shi nonchalantly said this as Yi Yun drew a gasp.</p>
<p>The gap!</p>
<p>He had given all he had to kill the first Ancient Fey as well as a stroke of luck. After killing the Ancient Fey, he had fell unconscious immediately and was expelled from the Fey Refining Rock array. He did not even encounter the second Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>As for Princess White Fox, not only did she kill the second Ancient Fey, but she had also injured the third Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>The difficulty of the Fey Refining Rock array had geometric growth as it progressed. How powerful was the third Ancient Fey supposed to be?</p>
<p>"What about the Luo clan?" Yi Yun hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>"For our Luo clan, Luo Mo was about similar to you. After killing the first Ancient Fey, he was already unable to fight the second Ancient Fey and he was expelled. As for Jian Zhu, his performance was the best. At least his results were much better than Wufeng's, allowing him to defeat the Shadow Twins as well. So he did win back some face for the Luo clan."</p>
<p>"Thank you." Yi Yun clenched his fists subconsciously.</p>
<p>His path was still long. He had to charge, and race towards them step by step.</p>
<p>"From your eyes, you did not seem disheartened. Very well." Elder Shi nodded. "I'll be taking you to the Primordial Space. Everyone who managed to last five minutes on the first level or managed to injure the first Ancient Fey are allowed to enter the Primordial Space!"</p>
<p>As Elder Shi said this, he grasped Yi Yun's hand. With a nonchalant step forward, the surrounding space distorted.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt dizzy as traversing through the chaotic laws of the Primordial Empyrean Heaven was taxing on his mental strength.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Yi Yun had already arrived at a gigantic cloister. This cloister was tall and wide that reached out a thousand feet. Even if a massive Ancient Fey was here, it could easily pass through it.</p>
<p>The cloister was built from unknown rocks and at the end, there was a rustic bronze door.</p>
<p>The door was as tall as the cloister and there were all sorts of glyphs of divine beasts carved onto the door. It was majestic and impressive.</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Elder Shi appeared like ants in front of the cloister. This feeling could not help but make Yi Yun curious about the things behind the door.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Shi had already put his hand out to press on the door. Following that, the thirty-foot-thick door that was of immeasurable weight was pushed open by Elder Shi.</p>
<p>Seeing the scenery behind the bronze door, Yi Yun's heart skipped a beat. Behind the door was empty space.</p>
<p>The space was permeated with a nebulous fog, and it was unknown how wide it was.</p>
<p>The magnificent cloister disappeared at to this point, as though it became part of the void.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples and White Fox clan disciples that had been selected had already been waiting in this space.</p>
<p>Yi Yun noticed that there were a few rustic rocks floating amidst the nebulous fog. They did not have any color to them and they were all gray. It was as though they had been abandoned at a particular corner of the world for billions of years.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not help but probe the rocks with his mental energies. He discovered that these rocks were somewhat similar to the Fey Refining Rocks on the first level, but the aura that they emanated was completely different to the Fey Refining Rocks.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, are you fine?" Seeing Yi Yun appear, Gu Qing was surprised as he immediately came up to him.</p>
<p>"You recovered so quickly?"</p>
<p>Everyone had seen the scene of Yi Yun being expelled. They were very aware of how injured he was. Even with the conditioning of a supreme-grade relic, it was difficult to recover so quickly. After all, the higher the relic's grade was, the more powerful its medicinal essences were. It made the absorption slower.</p>
<p>"You sure recovered pretty fast! It looks like your strength might be weak, but your ability to take a beating is rather good!" Nongyue said with a grin.</p>
<p>She was not being sarcastic with Yi Yun, but she was just outspoken. However, Nongyue's words sounded harsh on the ears.</p>
<p>Nongying stared at her younger sister. "Yue'er, don't be unreasonable."</p>
<p>Nongyue stuck her tongue out and no longer spoke. Yi Yun could not be bothered either as he said to Gu Qing, "It was nothing serious. Elder Shi had just mentioned Primordial Space to me. What's the matter with this place? What's so special about it?"</p>
<p>Gu Qing felt a hint of excitement when the Primordial Space was mentioned. He said, "Elder Duanmu had just mentioned that this Primordial Space is an ancient space left behind at the formation of the universe. It has existed for billions of years and our Luo clan happened to chance upon this space while exploring the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, so this place was stored.</p>
<p>"There are many mysteries to this space. Look at the nebulous fog. Elder Duanmu had just mentioned... that the nebulous fog is the most ancient gas of Chaos. What is even more fascinating are those rocks... They are Chaos Stones formed at the beginning of the Universe."</p>
<p>"These are Chaos Stones!?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was alarmed. He obviously knew about Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>World Stones were used as currency in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. They were the crystallization of energy and laws at the birth of a world.</p>
<p>As for Chaos Stones, their value was several times higher than World Stones. They were the crystallization of the gasses of Chaos and Origins energy at the birth of the Universe. They even contained the most nomological Origins of the Universe.</p>
<p>The energy contained in World Stones allowed them to be used as currency. As for Chaos Stones, they were typically not sold as their value was immense. They could be used as one of the foundations of a mighty faction.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, these Chaos Stones not only possess laws. From what Elder Duanmu said, these Chaos Stones are just like the Fey Refining Rocks. Sealed within them are auric charms of ancient Fey. However, it's no longer Ancient Fey soul essence, but… the true auras of Fey Gods!"</p>
<p>Fey Gods!?</p>
<p>Gu Qing's words gave Yi Yun a fright.</p>
<p>The twelve ancient Fey Gods were the coagulation of the supreme laws. Back at Mt. Azure Billow, Yi Yun had seen the divine column and the carvings that the Luo clan constructed for the twelve Fey Gods. However, those divine columns were left behind by Luo clan ancestors after all.</p>
<p>The Luo clan ancestors might be strong, but they were considered weak when placed in the entire 12 Empyrean Heavens. Due to the limitations of their cultivation levels and nomological insights, the divine columns that they produced could not replicate the true laws of the Fey Gods.</p>
<p>Compared to the Chaos Stones that had the auras of the Fey Gods sealed within them, the divine columns could not even be compared as a night and day difference.</p>
<p>This was also the limitations of the Mt. Azure Billow Ancient Fey Edifice. However, in the Primordial Space, such a situation did not exist. This was the aura of the Fey Gods sealed in the Chaos Stones. It was true Origins laws!</p>
<p>"These Chaos Stones will be lent to us?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun was also excited. No wonder Gu Qing was so excited when he mentioned the Primordial Space's utility.</p>
<p>"I guess so… " Gu Qing was also eagerly anticipating it. Even with Gu Qing's background, this was the first time that he had seen a Chaos Stone!</p>
<p>"There are few Chaos Stones, far fewer than the number of us here. Although it can be lent to us, there should be a time restriction. It's unknown how the time will be allocated. Furthermore, we will need to share them with the White Fox clan... The White Fox clan... "</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Gu Qing gave the White Fox clan geniuses an unnerved glance. "Junior Brother Yi, you might not be aware that the White Fox clan is one of the most intelligent races with extremely high perception amongst the Fey race. Furthermore, those who awaken their Nine-tailed White Fox bloodline are extremely proficient in nomological insights. For example... the Shadow Twins are such a case."</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins had managed to use their feet to flatten the chaotic energy flows when they came to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. It was evident how high their nomological perception was!</p>
<p>Gu Qing's words were heard by the sharp-eared Nongyue.</p>
<p>She looked over with a grin. She revealed a smile as though it was a show of might. "What you understand is pretty good, and you weren't wrong. I'm not good at killing, but when it comes to nomological insight, I like them the most!"</p>
<p>Chapter 889: Only Soup Left</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu stood in front of the Luo clan and White Fox clan disciples as he looked at the ancient rocks floating amidst the nebulous fog.</p>
<p>"This Primordial Space is the core of the Luo Divine Hall. The auras of the Fey Gods that are sealed in the Chaos Stones are 'Fey God Stones'. There is a total of twenty-seven Fey God Stones here!"</p>
<p>"The twenty-seven Fey God Stones differ in size and quality. When you meditate with them, you are free to select them according to your preferences."</p>
<p>As Elder Duanmu said this, he waved his hand. Dozens of white beams shot out of his sleeves, and they landed in everyone's hand.</p>
<p>Yi Yun caught one of the white beams of light. It was a jade slip.</p>
<p>Yi Yun sank his consciousness into it. The jade slip introduced the Fey God aura sealed in each Fey God Stone, as well as the quality of each Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>The largest Fey God Stone was about a square foot in size, but it was so heavy that Yi Yun found it unbelievable. A Fey God Stone that was a square foot in size was heavier than a hundred mountains. If it were thrown onto the ground, it would sink straight to the core of a star, due to its stunning weight.</p>
<p>Probably as a result of this reason, the Fey God Stone that was a square foot in size was called 'Penetrating Star Rock'.</p>
<p>Although the Penetrating Star Rock was the biggest stone, it was not the most valuable one. There was a Fey God Stone that was rarer than the Penetrating Star Rock, named 'Three God Seal'. The Three God Seal stone was about half a foot long. Sealed within it were three different auric charms of Fey Gods.</p>
<p>The three auric charms of Fey Gods had merged into one in this Fey God Stone, causing its value to far exceed the rest of the Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>The Penetrating Star Rock and Three God Seal were basically the best Fey God Stones in the Primordial Space. The rest were far worse.</p>
<p>Yi Yun put down the jade slip and scanned the people behind him. There were about seventy disciples that had the right to enter the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>However, there were only twenty-seven Fey God Stones. There was not enough for everyone.</p>
<p>Many people realized this problem as they looked at Elder Duanmu.</p>
<p>"After reading the Fey God Stones' introduction, return the jade slips."</p>
<p>"The number of disciples that entered the Primordial Space total seventy-one people."</p>
<p>"The disciples that fail to kill the first Ancient Fey can only stay in the Primordial Space for eight hours a day!"</p>
<p>"Those who managed to kill the first Ancient Fey are allowed to stay in the Primordial Space for sixteen hours a day!"</p>
<p>"As for the choice of the Fey God Stones, Princess White Fox will choose first, followed by Jian Zhu, then Wufeng, the Shadow Twins, Luo Mo and then Yi Yun!" Elder Duanmu recited the names of those who had obtained the best results at the Fey Refining Rock array in order.</p>
<p>The better the results, the higher the priority they had.</p>
<p>Furthermore, everyone was not limited to one Fey God Stone. For example, Princess White Fox's choice took precedence over everyone else. She could spend sixteen hours a day to choose any of the Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>If Princess White Fox were to choose the most profound 'Three God Seal', she would gain exclusive use of the 'Three God Seal' for two-thirds of the time.</p>
<p>As for the remaining one-third would most likely be taken by Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>Just two people could horde the Three God Seal.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu still had plenty of time left, and it was typical that he would choose the 'Penetrating Star Rock' that was the second most valuable.</p>
<p>As for the remaining time for the 'Penetrating Star Rock', it was no doubt going to be taken by Wufeng and the Shadow Twins.</p>
<p>By the time it was Yi Yun and Luo Mo's turns, there would be little time left for the best Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Luo Mo could only wait for Princess White Fox to temporarily abandon the Three God Seal when she failed to gain any insights from it so as to win the precious time that they needed to study the Three God Seal.</p>
<p>As for the rest, those who did not even kill the first Ancient Fey had no chance to even touch the Three God Seal.</p>
<p>Upon understanding the allocation rules, many people had ugly expressions.</p>
<p>One of them was Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>Amongst all the disciples that did not kill the first Ancient Fey, Ran Xueyi had lasted the longest, a total of nine minutes.</p>
<p>With this result, Ran Xueyi was feeling rather complacent. However, when he exited the Fey Refining Rock array, he was informed that Yi Yun, who had entered the array together with him, had managed to kill the first Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>This did not really matter, but now, he was informed that because of his failure to kill the first Ancient Fey, the amount of time that he gained to obtain insight from the Fey God Stones was half of theirs. Furthermore, he had to wait for the rest to choose first. As such, how could he feel appeased?</p>
<p>"Elder Duanmu... How can this rule work? Aren't we conceding the best resources of our Luo clan to the White Fox clan?"</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi was anxious.</p>
<p>There were only eighteen years for the Luo Divine Hall trials. It was extremely precious, and it would largely determine their future success to a large extent.</p>
<p>However, under the regulations, Ran Xueyi was only able to gain insight into a tiny amount. He was bound to be left in the dust by Jian Zhu and company. He might even end up being inferior to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ran Xueyi's voice transmission, Elder Duanmu frowned and said coldly, "Conceding them to the White Fox clan is because you did not live up to expectations. The rules are this. The White Fox clan might obtain more resources in the Luo Divine Hall, but Princess Purple Spirit would also obtain greater resources from the White Fox clan. What everyone gets is based on their own merits!"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu gave him a good scolding right to Ran Xueyi's face, rendering him speechless. What else could he say? At the Fey Refining Rock trial, he had failed to beat Yi Yun, whose strength was weaker than his.</p>
<p>"Princess White Fox, you can begin. If you wish, you can join the time allocated for your meditation each day. You can even study it for a month in one go."</p>
<p>The jade slips only had a general introduction of the Fey God Stones. One needed to take a personal look to see if it was suitable for one's self.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Senior Duanmu."</p>
<p>Princess White Fox smiled and she stepped into the nebulous fog of the Chaos gasses.</p>
<p>Her body turned blurry in the fog, and moments later, she walked out of the fog and said, "I will choose the Three God Seal for twenty days, and the Penetrating Star Rock for ten days."</p>
<p>Princess White Fox made her decision. However, when the Luo clan disciples present heard this, they felt their heart's ache.</p>
<p>Instantly, the two best Fey God Stones were taken up. Furthermore, it was only the first person, and so much time was taken up. How much would there be left when it was their turn?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu was not surprised with Princess White Fox's choice. Amongst all the Fey God Stones, the Three God Seal was the most profound. The laws it contained were the most intricate as well, so it was natural for Princess White Fox to choose it.</p>
<p>"Next... Jian Zhu!"</p>
<p>Jian Zhu had narrowly beaten Wufeng, but now, that bit of advantage was extremely important.</p>
<p>"Senior Duanmu, I've chosen as well. I'll first study the Penetrating Star Rock for twenty days before studying the Three God Seal for ten days."</p>
<p>The time Jian Zhu chose to study the Fey God Stones was complementary to Princess White Fox's.</p>
<p>In the first month, the two best Fey God Stones were monopolized by the two.</p>
<p>Many of the Luo clan disciples present felt bitter. Others had the chance to eat meat, while all they had was soup to drink.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu had monopolized the first thirty days. In accordance with the rules, they would have a period of rest after that.</p>
<p>During this period, the Three God Seal and the Penetrating Star Rock would be free. However, Wufeng and the Shadow Twins would not stand on ceremony to split the idle time.</p>
<p>With that, there was nothing left. And up to this point, it would be Luo Mo and Yi Yun's turns.</p>
<p>Chapter 890: An unexpected twist</p>
<p>MW spoiler: This chapter will link up Martial World to True Martial World.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, it's our turn." Upon seeing this situation, Luo Mo gave a wry smile. He felt wistful and he estimated that for the first half of the year, there was no chance for him to touch the Three God Seal and the Penetrating Star Rock.</p>
<p>Even towards the end, it was probably hard for him to come across a time when Princess White Fox or the Shadow Twins would choose not study the Penetrating Star Rock or Three God Seal. The amount of time left for him to meditate with it was extremely minute.</p>
<p>The Three God Seal was the most profound stone, yet with such a short time given to him, what could he comprehend from it… ?</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Luo Mo was envious of Princess White Fox. She could meditate with any of the Fey God Stones in the Primordial Space. Such an opportunity was something that he had no chance of doing.</p>
<p>Not only did the Luo Divine Hall trials not give them a chance to catch up to top geniuses, it was actually opening up a gap.</p>
<p>This was the rule of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. The best resources were gathered together to develop the best talents.</p>
<p>"Brother Yi, it looks like we have become fellow sufferers." Luo Mo said in a self-deprecating tone.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyebrows moved as well. He found it regretful as well. He also wanted to take a look at the Three God Seal that condensed the auric charms of three Fey Gods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Yi Yun's ranking was behind Luo Mo. Even if Luo Mo had a chance, there was no chance for him…</p>
<p>After the Three God Seal and Penetrating Star Rock, the quality of the other Fey God Stones had an obvious qualitative drop. The better ones were the 'Seven Star Rock' that had seven points of light on its surface, the squarish 'Four Side Slab', and the shimmering gem, 'Lit Star'.</p>
<p>These three Fey God Stones were close in quality, so there was not much difference when choosing any one of the three.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at each stone and he was in no hurry to make a decision. The training at the Primordial Space was an important part of the Luo Divine Hall trials. It was pertinent to choose the correct Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>Even if he knew that he could not choose a supreme-grade Fey God Stone, he could not be careless.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at all of the twenty-seven Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>The first few Fey God Stones were highest in quality, but towards the end, the quality was increasingly inferior. The twentieth Fey God Stone was about the size of a bowl. The auric charm of the Fey Gods contained within it was not even a tenth of the other Fey God Stones before it.</p>
<p>But even so, Yi Yun took a look at every Fey God Stone. However…</p>
<p>"Oh? Why are there Chaos Stones other than the twenty-seven Fey God Stones?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun noticed that there were three rustic stones floating among the Chaos gasses.</p>
<p>These three rocks were about five to six square feet. They were larger compared to the Penetrating Star Rock, and on the surface, they had patterns that looked like ripples. They were engraved by the flow of Chaos gasses over billions of years.</p>
<p>"Are those three Chaos Stones?" Yi Yun asked Luo Mo.</p>
<p>He shook his head, indicating that he was uncertain as well.</p>
<p>With a slight probe, Luo Mo could not sense any auric charms of a Fey God. He said, "It should be an ordinary Chaos Stone. A Chaos Stone that was formed at the beginning of the Universe is still very valuable, even if it fails to seal in the auric charms of Fey Gods. Furthermore, it's such a large Chaos Stone."</p>
<p>Although Luo Mo said this, Yi Yun still felt that something was amiss. These three Chaos Stones gave him a special feeling.</p>
<p>And previously in the jade slip that Elder Duanmu passed him, only the twenty-seven Fey God Stones were introduced. These three were excluded…</p>
<p>"Senior Duanmu, what are they?" Since Luo Mo did not know, Yi Yun could only ask Elder Duanmu.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu was sitting in the nebulous fog as he said, "I can't give you an answer."</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu did not use a Yuan Qi voice transmission. So when everyone heard this, they were surprised. Even Elder Duanmu, the guardian of the Luo Divine Hall, did not know what the three divine rocks were?</p>
<p>"Are they not Chaos Stones?" Luo Mo was somewhat perplexed. From his probing, the three stones were ordinary Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>However, Elder Duanmu said, "They are more profound than ordinary Chaos Stones. As to why they are profound, no one in the Luo clan knows. Actually, not even the Luo clan, even in the other clans of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, there is probably no one who can exactly explain what mysteries these three divine rocks hold… "</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said this, everyone was astounded. Even the other clans of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven did not know?</p>
<p>But if everyone could not understand, how did they determine that it was profound?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu seemed to guess the thoughts of everyone as he said, "I believe that all of you know that there were twelve Fey Gods at the birth of the Universe!?"</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. They obviously knew about the twelve Fey Gods, the ancestors of everything.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, tell me. What are the twelve Fey Gods?" Elder Duanmu said again.</p>
<p>"Yes, Senior." Yi Yun had been to Mt. Azure Billow, and he had entered the Ancient Fey Edifice. In the Ancient Fey Edifice, there were twelve columns, each carved with the twelve Fey Gods. Yi Yun had obtained an Entering Motion and two Hibernation Awakening ratings there.</p>
<p>"The twelve Fey Gods are… "</p>
<p>"Embodiment of pure Yang, the first Fey God — Extreme Yang Illumination."</p>
<p>"Embodiment of pure Yin, the second Fey God — Extreme Yin Nether Glow."</p>
<p>"Amalgamation of the 3000 Great Dao, the third Fey God — Empress Earth Dao Tree."</p>
<p>"The ancestor of dragons — Dragon Emperor."</p>
<p>"The ancestor of all birds — Seven-colored Phoenix."</p>
<p>"Fish and bird in one — Kun Peng."</p>
<p>"Humanoid Fey God — Heavenly Man."</p>
<p>"The river of time — River of Forgetfulness."</p>
<p>"The embodiment of space — Solitary Nothingness."</p>
<p>"There are a total of nine great Fey Gods. But for the remaining three, it was left vacant in the Ancient Fey Edifice. Back then, Lord Cang Mang's explanation was… that the identities of the final three Fey Gods are impossible to confirm. Although many mighty figures have managed to infer their existences, they are unconvincing. Hence, the final three Fey Gods are a mystery."</p>
<p>Upon saying this, Yi Yun took a careful look at the three gigantic Chaos Stones. "Does Senior mean that… ?"</p>
<p>"That's right." Elder Duanmu nodded. "Amongst the twelve Fey Gods, the existence of the last three Fey Gods are still unknown. However, no one doubts that there were twelve Fey Gods at the birth of the Universe. The reason is because… of the traces left behind in Chaos Stones!"</p>
<p>"There are Chaos Stones that seal the auric charms of the Fey Gods scattered in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. There are a total of twelve types of Chaos Stones. The first nine allow us to meditate over their profoundness, resulting in us being able to deduce the true form of the Fey Gods."</p>
<p>"As for the final three, it is difficult to deduce any of their mysteries. Hence, amongst the twelve Fey Gods, there are three vacancies!"</p>
<p>Once Elder Duanmu said this, everyone was enlightened.</p>
<p>Many of them were previously curious as to how people were so certain of the existence of the twelve Fey Gods at the formation of the Universe, and the birth of life. So, it was because of the Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>However… If the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven could not comprehend the last three Fey God Stones, there was no way they could.</p>
<p>The three Fey God Stones were useless no matter how large they were.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Duanmu said, "These three Fey God Stones are stored in the Primordial Space as a symbol. It's considered a form of worship for the twelve Fey Gods. None of you need to care about them! In fact, out of the twelve types of Fey God Stones, the last three are considered by everyone to be the most profound of all Fey God Stones. However, their values are lower than any of the previous nine."</p>
<p>What Elder Duanmu said was rather reasonable. Since no one could comprehend them, their values were obviously low.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded his head while thoughts went through his head. Since so many predecessors were powerless against the three Fey God Stones, Yi Yun did not believe that he could create a miracle.</p>
<p>He was just about to abandon the three Fey God Stones when out of a curious coincidence, Yi Yun stopped when he turned around. As he looked at the three Fey God Stones, a sense of disquietude filled him. Hesitating for a moment, he opened the Purple Crystal's energy vision.</p>
<p>And this act of his made Yi Yun see an inexplicable scene.</p>
<p>The three gigantic Chaos Stones had disappeared and replacing them were three magical items…</p>
<p>The closest object to Yi Yun was a black cubic object that was spinning. The black cube had runes that covered its surface, and it was like it had absorbed all the light around it. Even the space that was suppressed by Chaos gasses was distorted by it. It looked mysterious and ancient.</p>
<p>The thing furthest from Yi Yun was a blood-colored bead. It exuded a boundless bloodthirsty aura. Even with the energy vision, a glance at it made Yi Yun feel like he was plummeting through a blood pool in hell.</p>
<p>And in between the black cube and the blood-colored bead, there was a purple crystal. It looked like it was sculpted from amethyst.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the purple crystal, Yi Yun was completely dumbfounded. He held his breath as his heartbeat stagnated.</p>
<p>Isn't that... the Purple Crystal that had always been hidden in his body!?</p>
<p>Yi Yun subconsciously pressed down on his chest. In the position of his heart, the Purple Crystal quietly lurked. With each heartbeat, it gave a faint energy fluctuation that spread throughout Yi Yun's body…</p>
<p>Chapter 891: Three Fey Gods</p>
<p>The black cube, the crimson bead, and the purple crystal that emitted strange energies…</p>
<p>What Yi Yun had always seen in his energy vision was energy in the form of points of lines and dots for everything. However, these three objects were completely different. Even in the energy vision, Yi Yun could clearly see the individual objects as a whole, as well as the mysterious textures on their surfaces.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun knew very well that the three divine artifacts he saw in his energy vision were just projections because of the portion of the original auric charms that were sealed in the Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>Based on this inference, the Purple Crystal in his body was one of the twelve Fey Gods?</p>
<p>To be precise, the Purple Crystal, along with the crimson bead, and the black cube were three of the most mysterious Fey Gods of the twelve Fey Gods that no mighty figure in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had managed to comprehend…</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it unbelievable that the Purple Crystal was actually a Fey God.</p>
<p>However, were the twelve Fey Gods living beings?</p>
<p>Yi Yun would not be surprised if the Empress Earth Dao Tree, Dragon Emperor, Seven-colored Phoenix, Kun Peng, and Heavenly Man were living beings.</p>
<p>But Yi Yun would find it hard to imagine if one claimed that Extreme Yang Illumination, Extreme Yin Nether Glow, River of Forgetfulness, and Solitary Nothingness were living beings.</p>
<p>Extreme Yang Illumination's shape was just a circular black-colored plane, while Extreme Yin Nether Glow was a white-colored ring.</p>
<p>River of Forgetfulness was just a river of time, while Solitary Nothingness was just an endless void.</p>
<p>Instead of calling them living beings, it was better to call them amalgamation of laws.</p>
<p>As such, Yi Yun would not be surprised if the Purple Crystal was considered to be an amalgamation of laws.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a deep appreciation for the Purple Crystal's power. Now that he discovered that the Purple Crystal was one of the twelve Fey Gods, Yi Yun found the Purple Crystal even more profound and mysterious.</p>
<p>What law did this Purple Crystal, that was born out of the Chaos along with the Universe, amalgamate from?</p>
<p>As for the crimson bead and the black cube, what were they?</p>
<p>Yi Yun fell silent. His eyes were completely fixated on the Chaos Stones that had a portion of the Purple Crystal's auric charm sealed within.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, why do you keep standing in front of the three Fey God Stones? Don't tell me that you are interested in them?"</p>
<p>Luo Mo previously believed that Yi Yun had only asked out of curiosity. But by the looks of it, Yi Yun was very interested in the three Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>"A bit."</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded, surprising Luo Mo, who said in response, "Junior Brother Yi, didn't Elder Duanmu just say… Those three Fey God Stones may contain the auric charms of the last three Fey Gods, but even the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven were unable to sense it, much less us."</p>
<p>"The jade slips previously recorded twenty-seven Fey God Stones, but it excluded these three. It is apparent that the predecessors of our Luo clan do not believe that these three Fey God Stones are of any value."</p>
<p>Although Luo Mo had been defeated by Yi Yun at Empress Luo's banquet, he did not bear a grudge on Yi Yun. Instead, he gave Yi Yun some advice. From Luo Mo's point of view, Yi Yun was too young and he might make a bad choice on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>After all, the best Penetrating Star Rock and Three God Seal had been chosen by Princess White Fox and company. The remaining Fey God Stones were greatly inferior. He believed that Yi Yun, being young and impetuous, might feel indignant with missing out on the opportunity, and he decide to go for broke by choosing the three Fey God Stones that even the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven failed to comprehend. If that was the case, he was just harming himself.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not respond to Luo Mo's words. He was already completely immersed in the world of the Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>He felt as though he was wrapped in the core of the Fey God Stones. The gigantic purple crystal was floating in front of him, and the tinier Purple Crystal Origins was spinning in his heart, making it seem like a shadow of the gigantic purple crystal.</p>
<p>"The purple crystal sleeping in my body should be the true embodiment of the Purple Crystal."</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slowly able to confirm that the auric charm sealed in one of the Fey God Stone was identical to the Purple Crystal's.</p>
<p>That meant that a true Fey God was sleeping in Yi Yun's body!</p>
<p>Among the twelve Fey Gods, the last three Fey Gods were very different to the first nine Fey Gods. As for the their exact differences and connections, they were beyond Yi Yun's comprehension.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun possessed the Purple Crystal, what he had was highly concentrated Origins laws. It was impossible for Yi Yun to gain any insights from the Purple Crystal itself.</p>
<p>However, the Fey God Stone… it had a tiny portion of the Purple Crystal's laws that had been diverted away and were recorded in the Fey God Stone in detail.</p>
<p>Although this portion of laws was a tiny ratio of the Purple Crystal Origin's overall laws, it was like a vast sea to Yi Yun. It was enough for him to study them for years.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a hunch that it was as though this Fey God Stone only existed for him.</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, Elder Duanmu has been waiting for a long time. Are you done choosing?" Luo Mo asked. Only then did Yi Yun awake from the Purple Crystal's illusionary realm. He nodded and said, "I'm done choosing."</p>
<p>Luo Mo gave Yi Yun a worried glance. No matter how he looked, Yi Yun had a confident expression. It did not seem like it would bear any good. Realistically speaking, by missing a chance at the Three God Seal and Penetrating Star Rock, one should not look that happy…</p>
<p>Since he had already given Yi Yun some advice, he wished that Yi Yun would heed it.</p>
<p>Out of the nebulous fog of Chaos, Luo Mo said, "Elder Duanmu, I will choose the Lit Star and Seven Star Rock for fifteen days each."</p>
<p>"Alright!" Elder Duanmu was not surprised at Luo Mo's choice. He recorded it down and looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not immediately answer and instead asked Elder Duanmu, "Elder Duanmu, I would like to inquire about a matter. The rules set by Elder Duanmu previously… those disciples that managed to kill the first Ancient Fey are allowed to stay in Primordial Space for sixteen hours a day, and those disciples who failed to kill the first Ancient Fey are only allowed eight hours. Is the rationale behind this rule a result of there not being enough Fey God Stones?"</p>
<p>The trial-takers present did not expect Yi Yun to ask such a question.</p>
<p>Wasn't this obvious… ? He just needed to choose a few Fey God Stones, but he had lingered inside the nebulous fog of Chaos for so long. Furthermore, when he came out, he had to ask such an obvious question?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu nodded and said, "Yes!"</p>
<p>"If that is the case, I would like to ask. If I were to choose a Fey God Stone that no one else chooses, can I stay in the Primordial Space for the whole time without coming out?"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's question confounded all the trial-takers present.</p>
<p>What was the meaning behind Yi Yun's words? His strength was not considered very strong, and he had barely managed to kill the first Ancient Fey through an internecine struggle. He had paid such a heavy price to have a selection opportunity just second to Luo Mo. Was he planning on leaving aside the Seven Star Rock, Lit Star, and the Four Side Slab for some scrap?</p>
<p>Some of the Fey God Stones in the Primordial Space were the size of bowls, so the laws that they contained were obviously limited. No one wanted them, so was Yi Yun going to choose them?</p>
<p>Everyone could not comprehend him. Even Princess White Fox looked curiously at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"That's right! If no one chooses it, there is no problem for you to stay in the Primordial Space all day." Although Yi Yun's question was odd, Elder Duanmu answered him seriously.</p>
<p>"Thank you Elder Duanmu." With the given permission, Yi Yun was overjoyed. This was truly a pleasant surprise. This meant that he could stay in the Primordial Space all day.</p>
<p>"Then I've already chosen. I'll choose the three Fey God Stones condensed out of the three unknown Fey Gods!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun's voice had bold undertones as it reverberated throughout the area. Everyone was stunned hearing Yi Yun's choice.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu had just introduced the three Fey God Stones to be something that even mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven failed to comprehend. Was Yi Yun mad?</p>
<p>Ignoring Yi Yun, even Princess White Fox, as well as young elites who were far more outstanding than her could not compare their nomological insights with a mighty figure of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. The difference was greater than night and day!</p>
<p>If Yi Yun was attempting to comprehending something that even mighty figures could not comprehend, wasn't that like an ant trying to shake a tree? What a laughable act of overconfidence!</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, you really chose it… " Luo Mo stared at Yi Yun and he was at a loss of words. He had a hunch previously and had advised Yi Yun. However, Yi Yun seemed obsessed to tread the road of no return. "Junior Brother Yi Yun, I know you aren't happy that you couldn't choose the Penetrating Star Rock and the Three God Seal, but the Lit Star and Seven Star Rock aren't that bad either. It's enough for the two of us to study it. You can just complement me on the time."</p>
<p>Luo Mo sighed and shook his head. He found it regretful. Yi Yun's results were very good, but he had wasted an opportunity. It made the people who had worse results than Yi Yun luck out.</p>
<p>And indeed, Luo Mo saw Ran Xueyi's excited expression, on the brink of bursting out laughing.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! The Heavens are truly helping me! Yi Yun actually abandoned the Seven Star Rock and the Four Side Slab. I'll be free to study them!" Ran Xueyi clenched his fists. He felt indignant to have lost to Yi Yun before because he believed that he was stronger than Yi Yun and that he had only lost because he had avoided doing battle. It had particularly embarrassed and aggrieved Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>But now, with the Seven Star Rock and the Four Side Slab, he could diligently reach Yi Yun's level. In time to come, he would leave Yi Yun in the dust.</p>
<p>On the road of martial arts, the most taboo thing was to think too highly of one's self. Yi Yun had clearly entered the path that would lead him astray.</p>
<p>Chapter 892: The Blooming of the Void Orchid (Part 1)</p>
<p>"Yi Yun, are you certain about your choice?" Elder Duanmu paused for a long time, but he noticed no changes in Yi Yun's intentions. "This choice is not just a few months of meditation time. In the future, the ratio will still be the same as your previous choice. I will look at the results of your cultivation in seven year's time. That is to say in the upcoming seven years, each of you will study your own Fey God Stone. Unless you are willing to exchange, there will be no further changes. But I believe that for you, Yi Yun, no one will exchange with you. I'm asking you one last time, are you certain?"</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said this, everyone looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Seven years! The Luo Divine Hall trials lasted for eighteen years. The seven years took up nearly half the amount of time. This was the important stage at which one lay their foundations. It was no joking matter. If he chose the last three Fey God Stones and failed to gain any insights, Yi Yun would have wasted seven years!</p>
<p>Without any exaggeration, the seven years was sufficient to impact Yi Yun's future achievements.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that Yi Yun would flinch, but unexpectedly, Yi Yun nodded without hesitation and said, "Senior Duanmu, I'm certain!"</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's eyebrows pricked up and he seemed somewhat upset, but he still recorded Yi Yun's name down.</p>
<p>Everyone had the right to make their own choices during the Luo Divine Hall trials, but at the same time, they had to be responsible for their own choices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun's performance may be good, but he was not the most important Luo clan disciple that Elder Duanmu valued the most.</p>
<p>The person that Duanmu valued the most was Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>It was not bad if a genius who would attain greatness in the future out of a hundred Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>At the trials, Jian Zhu was the person who was worth expending effort to nurture. As for the others, they were just icing on the cake. Even if Yi Yun were to persist in error, he would not continue to persuade him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun returned to the group and as he was walking back, Ran Xueyi was already striding forward into the nebulous fog of Chaos. The excitement on his face was unconcealed. To Ran Xueyi, this was like a gift that fell into his lap.</p>
<p>And this gift lasted for seven years!</p>
<p>"Junior Brother Yi, although I do not know why you gave this opportunity to me, I still have to thank you." Ran Xueyi said with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously knew what was on Ran Xueyi's mind. He was showing gratitude on his lips, but he was probably treating him like a retard in his heart.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could not be bothered to humor Ran Xueyi in hypocritical politeness. He just remained silent and he pretended not to hear him.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi was not annoyed either as he happily entered the nebulous fog of Chaos to choose the Fey God Stones he wanted to study.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Ran Xueyi had chosen Seven Star Rock and Lit Star.</p>
<p>After Ran Xueyi, people entered the nebulous fog of Chaos to choose their Fey God Stones. Soon, the twenty-seven Fey God Stones were selected. Even the remaining Fey God Stones that were the size of bowls had their meditation schedules filled.</p>
<p>It was fortunate if one could enter the Primordial Space. Even a bowl-sized Fey God Stone that had a true Fey God's auric charm sealed within it. As for most of the trials' disciples who did not even have a chance of entering the Primordial Space, they could only stay in the front hall of the Luo Divine Hall to meditate over Ancient Fey Stones that were inferior in quality.</p>
<p>Comparing an Ancient Fey with a Fey God was like comparing night and day.</p>
<p>"Alright, all of you have made your choice. Next, you are free to cultivate." As Elder Duanmu said this, he snapped his fingers. A gray item the size of a rice grain appeared, it was a seed.</p>
<p>"I will grow a Void Orchid here. When seven flowers bloom, I will come and see the results of your cultivation!"</p>
<p>As Elder Duanmu said this, the Void Orchid seed began to take root and sprout in the void. It was a fascinating plant that could grow in space.</p>
<p>A flower would bloom every year, so seven flowers meant seven years.</p>
<p>"The first batch of disciples who do not get a chance to mediate with a Fey God Stone, please leave the Primordial Space for now. The Luo Divine Hall has already prepared residences for you. Around your residences, there are some array formations that can help test your strength!"</p>
<p>"In addition, the continent on which the Luo Divine Hall lies is extremely extensive! The further you go, the more primordial and chaotic the laws are."</p>
<p>"If you want to gain nomological insights, you can also walk deeper into the Primordial Space. However, the depths of the Primordial Space are extremely dangerous. You might encounter a variety of unexpected objects. So act according to your own ability and do not venture too deep or you might die outside! In previous Luo Divine Hall trials, it is common for disciples to disappear. Many of the times, there corpses that couldn't even be found. All the best!"</p>
<p>As Elder Duanmu said, he led the disciples, who were not temporarily not allocated a Fey God Stone, out of the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>Instantly, the Primordial Space only had twenty-eight people left.</p>
<p>The first twenty-seven Fey God Stones had a corresponding person matched to it, while Yi Yun had the last three special Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>The teleportation nexus of the Primordial Space was temporarily sealed. There was not a sound in the entire Primordial Space, as though it was a forgotten world.</p>
<p>The Void Orchid grew silently, while the twenty-seven gray Fey God Stones quietly floated in the nebulous fog, as though they were mysterious tombs.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was the first to walk in front of the Three God Seal. She immersed her consciousness into the Fey God Stone as she connected her consciousness with the three Fey Gods' auric charm.</p>
<p>She silently stood in the void as her white dress fluttered. Her long hair danced as its shimmered with electric flashes. Her head was tilted up slightly, as though she was listening to something, while revealing the beautiful contour of her neckline.</p>
<p>Seeing Princess White Fox begin to meditate, Jian Zhu also walked in front of the Penetrating Star Rock and he sat down.</p>
<p>Everyone went forward and Yi Yun's location was in the deepest depths of the nebulous fog.</p>
<p>The Primordial Space was filled with the gasses of Chaos. These gasses were the Origin gasses at the formation of the Universe. It was also not easy to gain any insights from this Chaos gasses. The young elites present, including Yi Yun, were not at that stage.</p>
<p>Yi Yun sat in front of the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>Beside Yi Yun was a girl from the White Fox clan, who was meditating with the twenty-seventh Fey God Stone. Looking at the pathetic Fey God Stone in front of her, she muttered to herself, "Sigh, my Fey God Stone is way too tiny."</p>
<p>Her name was Lan Xiaomo. She was not tall and she had navy blue long hair. She was different to purebreds of the White Fox clan, which also indicated that her bloodline was not pure.</p>
<p>In the previous trial, Lan Xiaomo had barely been qualified to enter the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>However… compared to her Fey God Stone, Yi Yun's appeared worse.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo could not help but look to her side. Out of curiosity, she secretly probed the gray black cube Fey God Stone to the left of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>And without any surprises, she did not sense anything. The Fey God Stone felt empty, as though nothing was in there.</p>
<p>"Can anything be figured out from such a thing?"</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo blinked her dewy eyes and she could not comprehend why. Yi Yun did not look dumb either.</p>
<p>"He might gradually give up. No one has the patience to stare at an empty rock for several years. Although the seven years would be a waste, he still has this extensive land mass to gain deeper nomological insights. Although the speed of cultivation is far inferior to mediating with a Fey God Stone, it is at least barely passable."</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Lan Xiaomo immersed her consciousness into the bowl-sized Fey God Stone as she entered a deep meditative state.</p>
<p>Chapter 893: The Blooming of the Void Orchid (Part 2/2)</p>
<p>When Yi Yun's consciousness connected to the ancient Fey God Stone, he felt that everything around him had vanished. The young elites who were meditating around the Fey God Stones, as well as the lingering nebulous fog of Chaos had all disappeared.</p>
<p>Yi Yun came into a completely unfamiliar world.</p>
<p>Wherever he looked, it was the deep depths of the universe. And beneath his feet were brilliant spiraling galaxies with breathtaking beauty.</p>
<p>And in front of Yi Yun was the Purple Crystal Origins with shimmering purple light. It was suspended in the void and it was slowly spinning.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun came to this alternate world, he tried to look into the Purple Crystal that was embedded in his heart countless times, but the Purple Crystal was as mysterious and clear as it ever was. Looking at it made it seem transparent, but Yi Yun had no idea what profound mysteries it possessed.</p>
<p>And today, the Purple Crystal that Yi Yun saw was completely different…</p>
<p>The feeling of not knowing anything had disappeared. In Yi Yun's vision, the Purple Crystal range extended out limitlessly. It gave Yi Yun the a feeling that there was a universe in the Purple Crystal.</p>
<p>The Purple Crystal expanded as it revolved, as it became ethereal. It slowly spread throughout the universe, clouding Yi Yun's field of vision with a misty purple color.</p>
<p>And amid this emanated color of purple, Yi Yun saw a figure with its back facing him.</p>
<p>The person was a man with long hair. He wore a black suit of armor, and he held a spear in his hand. Yi Yun felt that this figure was a good distance away from him, but the moment he saw this person, Yi Yun felt his heart quiver intensely. He felt like he was facing the Universe and the primordial stars.</p>
<p>As the figure slowly turned around, a terrifying pressure surged at him. There was intense killing intent with worldly laws trembling. Amid such magnificent pressure, Yi Yun felt like he was a tiny boat in a storm, and he could be swallowed up at any time.</p>
<p>Who was this person?</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it hard to think. The pressure from the figure and the impact of the nomological forces around him made Yi Yun feel like his body and soul were separating!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun felt an extremely familiar aura from the man with long hair.</p>
<p>It was… the Purple Crystal!?</p>
<p>A purple crystal body shimmered in the man's chest, almost identical to the feeling that Yi Yun had with the Purple Crystal.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not believe that this person was the future him. Could it be the past owner of the Purple Crystal?</p>
<p>Suddenly, the man with long hair waved his hand, sending the spear flying.</p>
<p>The spear constantly expanded in size while it traveled through the universe. It kept expanding and finally, it became an incredulous size. It could string up hundreds of stars!</p>
<p>When the large spear landed beneath the man's feet, there was land, oceans, plants, animals, including Fey beasts and humans growing on the spear.</p>
<p>A spear had transformed into a narrow world strip?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was alarmed. He did not know what sort of concept this was. The man had transformed his weapon into a world!</p>
<p>The world expanded under the man's feet as Yi Yun felt like he had set foot on the narrow piece of land.</p>
<p>In the hazy world, the clouds hung low. There was lightning flashing through the sky, as worldly laws seem to transform into endless fragments. The world seemed to present its Origins powers.</p>
<p>"These are nomological fragments!"</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt his heart skip a beat. He knew very well how valuable all these fragments were!</p>
<p>These were laws of Origins. The 12 Empyrean Heavens had been formed for eons, and the Universe had long taken form. The laws had evolved into a maturity. Could he gain insights of the Origins from such complete laws?</p>
<p>That would be impossible!</p>
<p>This was also why many mighty figures from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had their eyes set on the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. After all, the laws in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven were not complete, making them easier to grasp.</p>
<p>However, the Primordial Empyrean Heaven's laws were chaotic and trivial. It was easier said than done to search for the laws of the Origins from such complex laws!</p>
<p>No one knew if a fragment of the laws of Origins could be obtained, even after an unmeasurable amount of meditation.</p>
<p>But now, in front of Yi Yun, there were fragmentary laws of Origins flying everywhere. Such fragments were easy to absorb. Even Supremacies from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven would probably go crazy when they saw such a scene!</p>
<p>"I… I want to meditate!"</p>
<p>These nomological fragments made Yi Yun covet them. However, he could only see them but not touch them. These laws were too far from him. He could barely see some of what was in there, but the immense pressure that this world emitted made it hard for him to maintain his calm.</p>
<p>He could not meditate over them!</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt his heart bleed for all the fragmentary laws of Origins. It was equivalent to receiving nothing after entering a treasure mountain.</p>
<p>Who was this spear-wielding man in the phantom image? What was his relationship with the Purple Crystal?</p>
<p>This person felt more terrifying than the Pure Yang Sword Palace's owner!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At this moment, it sounded like there were countless thunder booming in the spear-wielding man's body. The fragmentary laws of Origins in the sky began to flow into the man's body. A series of runic patterns condensed around his body!</p>
<p>The runic patterns shimmered and there was a phantom image in every runic pattern.</p>
<p>They were either gods or demons.</p>
<p>Some of the phantom images looked dignified, with lotuses beneath them and a hazy halo behind them.</p>
<p>Some of the phantom images looked ferocious, with blood-stained weapons in hand, as they stepped on countless bloody skulls.</p>
<p>The phantom images were arranged in a circle, and together with the runic patterns, they eventually formed a circular wheel.</p>
<p>10000 Demon Wheel of Existence!</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, this name appeared in Yi Yun's mind.</p>
<p>The man with long hair held the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence that sealed gods and demons while standing in front of him. Yi Yun took in all of the laws in the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly understood that the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was most likely a frightening divine mystical art.</p>
<p>And what he witnessed was the scene of the spear-wielding man's formation of a world and his creation of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. It was most likely an imagery relic of the Purple Crystal. This man was indeed a former owner of the Purple Crystal!</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up into the sky. There were still remnant fragmentary laws of Origins. However, Yi Yun no longer wanted to look at the fragments anymore. He tried hard to widen his eyes as he tried to look at the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence clearly.</p>
<p>However, the pressure that the man emanated was too powerful. As Yi Yun resisted the pressure, he attempted to study the laws, but he felt that his own will was on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>He tried his best to memorize and comprehend, but his mental energy quickly reached its limit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The spiritual world suddenly shattered as everything in front of him vanished.</p>
<p>The scene suddenly changed. Yi Yun had abruptly returned to the Primordial Space. His surroundings were still pervaded with the gasses of Chaos, and in front of him, the three Fey God Stones were still suspended in the void.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt a coldness across his forehead. It was dense beads of sweat that oozed off his forehead.</p>
<p>It was astounding!</p>
<p>Yi Yun never knew that there were such memories left behind in the Purple Crystal.</p>
<p>And furthermore… it might not be limited to these memories.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun's mental strength was limited. He could only see up to this point before not being able to persist on.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew without thinking that the Purple Crystal had existed for an extremely long period of time. What about the images it that were recorded within?</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun had only seen a tiny glimpse of them. Just the fragmentary laws of Origins that formed into the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence were enough to thrill Yi Yun.</p>
<p>What if he could grasp a tinge of the charm of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence through repeated observations?</p>
<p>How high would his strength increase?</p>
<p>"Senior Brother, are you alright?" At this moment, a sweet voice echoed in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>Yi Yun followed the source of the sound and he realized it was his 'neighbor'. It came from the blue-haired young lady who was meditating in front of the twenty-seventh Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>She was younger than him.</p>
<p>"I'm fine."</p>
<p>Yi Yun waved his hand. He was extremely excited!</p>
<p>Although there was still a dull pain in his soul, Yi Yun could not care about the expenditure of his mental energy after catching a glimpse of the endless treasures sealed in the Purple Crystal. All he wanted to do was recover his mental energy before entering the Purple Crystal again to meditate over the laws of Origins and master the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>Translator's Note: No, it's not Lin Ming.</p>
<p>Chapter 894: Two Years</p>
<p>Everyone was cultivating in the Primordial Space, so silence pervaded it. After swallowing a relic to recover his mental energy, Yi Yun began to regulate his breathing to process the relic.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo looked strangely at Yi Yun. Why did he look so eager at such a barren rock?</p>
<p>She really could not understand him.</p>
<p>She knew that Yi Yun must have drained too much mental energy before. It was reasonable. With such a large Fey God Stone, with no obvious point of insertion, it was certain that one's mental energy would drain extremely quickly while meditating with it.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo stopped pondering about the matter as she continued meditating with the twenty-seventh Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>Although it was a bowl-sized Fey God Stone, it was still extremely arduous mediating with it! Lan Xiaomo found the laws that were contained within, numerous and profound, but the insights she gained were limited.</p>
<p>She felt vexed from having to choose the worst Fey God Stone previously, but thinking about it now, it was not necessarily a good thing. The most difficult stones, the Penetrating Star Rock and Three God Seal, were probably only things that absolute geniuses like Jian Zhu or Princess White Fox could gain any insights from…</p>
<p>Of course, what was more difficult than the Three God Seal and the Penetrating Star Rock was the three special Fey God Stones beside her.</p>
<p>During this time, she had discovered that Yi Yun had immersed himself in the Fey God Stone once again. Without the consideration of him being able to gain any insights, just his mental energy consumption was extremely high and rapid.</p>
<p>Previously, when Yi Yun had learned the Shadow Twins' footwork, Princess White Fox had also praised him. But why did such a talented person choose to break his head over these crappy stones?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yi Yun was completely immersed in the Purple Crystal. He felt as though a door to a brand new world had opened in front of him.</p>
<p>The long-haired man stood there with the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence in hand. It was the amalgamation of countless fragmentary laws of Origins.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never expected to see Chaos Stones that had the Purple Crystal's auric charm sealed within them in the Luo clan's trials.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had gone from an inconspicuous tiny world — a tiny Cloud Wilderness — to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven one step at a time. The further he walked, the tinier he felt.</p>
<p>Against the vast cosmos, the lives of people were like ants. It was like how bacteria did not know what it meant for the first and last day of the month, or how mole crickets did not know the seasons. What was a mortal's life to the Universe? Yi Yun did not want to remain like a speck of dust in the Universe. He was determined to pursue a high level of martial arts, and now, with the path towards a more magnificent world under his feet, how could he waste time?</p>
<p>Yi Yun gritted his teeth as he desperately withstood the pressure from the long-haired man.</p>
<p>He seemed to proceed along a road filled with thorns where his mental energy was constantly stabbed by the thorns. As he endured the pain coming from his soul sea, he went through great effort to move forward.</p>
<p>Here, he could not rely on the Purple Crystal, nor could he rely on anything else. He could only persist on with his will.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun discerned a tiny contour of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, he was sent back to the Primordial Space as his mental energy was completely drained.</p>
<p>"There's progress! As long as there's progress." Yi Yun was not daunted. Swallowing another relic, he began to recuperate once again.</p>
<p>For the long-haired man to reach such a stage, he must have undergone an extremely long period of cultivation, with immense fated luck and perseverance to be able to gain insights of the laws of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, so how could it be easy?</p>
<p>As his mental energy being drained again and again, and with him meditating to recuperate again and again, Yi Yun's soul sea was like a reservoir that was constantly being drained and refilled.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo, who was beside Yi Yun, witnessed the entire process of Yi Yun meditating in front of the Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>From her point of view, Yi Yun seemed to fall into a trance. He was huffing and puffing, with cold sweat pouring down his face, but he looked extremely eager.</p>
<p>Is this Senior Brother fine… ?</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo gave Yi Yun a worried glance. Others were meditating in silence, but why was Yi Yun undergoing so many changes, as though he was fighting a war?</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo shook her head. She could not be bothered any longer because her time in the Primordial Space was up.</p>
<p>Even the weakest Fey God Stone had a full schedule. Hence, she needed to rotate the usage of it with two other people. She had already agreed with the other two to have a meditation time of a month each.</p>
<p>With her having to leave the Primordial Space soon, Lan Xiaomo gave the Fey God Stone a reluctant glance before walking towards the teleportation nexus…</p>
<p>The passage of time was unfathomable.</p>
<p>The Void Orchid was growing. It went from sprouting to producing a bud before blooming into a flower...</p>
<p>One year's time had passed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave up on sleep and food. He had lost count of the number of attempts that he made.</p>
<p>The Soul Nurturing Relics that he used to restore his mental energy were quickly used up. He later used World Stones to exchange with others, and he eventually bought some from the Luo Divine Hall's treasury.</p>
<p>But by now, the rate at which Yi Yun consumed Soul Nurturing Relics had decreased because his mental energy had become extremely rich and immense!</p>
<p>The long-haired man in the Purple Crystal had a monstrous aura. Under the impact of such an aura, Yi Yun's mental energy become more coagulated as well. He felt that his mental energy was improving, so even when he was expelled from the Fey God Stone, he would immediately recover his mental energy and enter the world again.</p>
<p>From the point of struggling to his limits to be able to see a contour of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, Yi Yun had slowly managed to discern the complicated runic patterns on the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>He was slowly closing the gap between him and the long-haired man. He was even able to discern the entire process of the long-haired man conjuring the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>There was no sense of time in enlightenment, but Yi Yun knew that he was constantly proceeding forward.</p>
<p>And in his mental world, Yi Yun had finally reached a distance of thirty feet from the long-haired man!</p>
<p>At thirty feet, every single additional step was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>The powerful impact that came from the laws of Origins were like surging waves that assaulted Yi Yun's soul sea. However, such impacts made Yi Yun feel extremely excited. This was truly an opportunity that one could not ask for.</p>
<p>The runic patterns of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence became clearer. Yi Yun felt like he was beginning to come into contact with the boundary of being able to gain insights from it.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The mental world instantly shattered as Yi Yun opened his eyes once again.</p>
<p>He looked at the Void Flower. The second flower was halfway through blooming.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, nearly two years had passed.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lan Xiaomo had happened to awake from her meditation. She was accustomed to Yi Yun who was attempting to gain insights constantly.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo believed that Yi Yun would soon give up, but to her surprise, he persisted on for two years.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo was an animated and lively girl by nature. She could not stand loneliness so, in this silent Primordial Space, she would observe the scenes of the disciples around her cultivating.</p>
<p>She noticed that Yi Yun's meditative state with the Fey God Stone was slowly becoming longer.</p>
<p>He would only be in meditation for less than an hour in the beginning, but now, he could continue in meditation for ten days!</p>
<p>To be able to face a stone of unknown value for ten days at a go for two years, it was unimaginable…</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun took a deep breath as he closed his eyes while regulating his breathing.</p>
<p>"It's about to begin again." Lan Xiaomo shook her head. For the past two years, she had never seen Yi Yun speak, it was as though he was a dead corpse just sitting there.</p>
<p>The others would leave the Primordial Space so as to confirm their comprehension outside.</p>
<p>It also included Lan Xiaomo herself. Her month-long meditation was almost over. She too needed to go into the deeper depths of the land mass so as to combine meditation and actual combat, despite the amount she managed to understand being very little…</p>
<p>It was universally accepted that by combining meditation and actual combat, one's progress was the fastest. As for Yi Yun, he did not verify his comprehension. Was he not afraid of gaining a wrong understanding?</p>
<p>Furthermore, his combat power would not increase as a result!</p>
<p>Chapter 895: Condensing the Wheel</p>
<p>Yi Yun sat in front of the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone cross-legged, and he entered an ethereal state. His consciousness was fully immersed in the Purple Crystal's world. He was oblivious to everything going on around him.</p>
<p>With two years of hard work, he was already standing inside the treasure vault!</p>
<p>It was a brand new world at less than thirty feet from the long-haired man.</p>
<p>This was a world that the long-haired man had grasped, the nomological world of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>While standing less than thirty feet away, the nomological fragments around Yi Yun shimmered.</p>
<p>This experience was too precious.</p>
<p>Yi Yun focused attentively as he seized the opportunity to comprehend the laws floating around him.</p>
<p>Within thirty feet, he could see the runic patterns on the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence very clearly. The nomological fragments also appeared within his reach, but they also depleted his mental energy very quickly.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had a greater mental energy capacity than before, it would just take him a few days before he was expelled from the mental world.</p>
<p>Yi Yun repeated this process day after day.</p>
<p>He did not find it boring at all. He could see new nomological fragments every day.</p>
<p>The long-haired man's repeated creation of the world and the process of producing the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was something that Yi Yun watched over and over again.</p>
<p>Slowly, Yi Yun went from being a bystander to being a participant.</p>
<p>He felt as though he had become one of the nomological fragments. It was like he would condense into runic patterns with the rest to form the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>As days passed, Yi Yun felt as though he had transcended the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence and become the long-haired man.</p>
<p>His consciousness overlapped the long-haired man and he began following the long-haired man in his producing of the world that had transformed from a spear, as well as the process of condensing the laws.</p>
<p>At the moment that the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was condensed, countless illusions of demons and gods appeared as they assaulted Yi Yun's mental sea.</p>
<p>In a trance, Yi Yun saw war break out throughout the 12 Empyrean Heavens. The Luo clan was destroyed by the Fey Phantasm Sect and he was unable to find Lin Xintong to the very end of his life. Finally, he died filled with regrets…</p>
<p>Mental demon!</p>
<p>Yi Yun exhaled. After he began to truly grasp the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence from the long-haired man, it also brought mental demons with it.</p>
<p>Just after having this thought, Yi Yun saw himself still in the Cloud Wilderness in a blink of an eye. He had become the leader of a tribal clan, living together with Jiang Xiaorou in a ordinary but rich life. He led his tribesmen in hunts and after returning, he would see Jiang Xiaorou's warm smile as well as the blissful expressions of her gently dabbing the sweat off his face.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slightly stunned as he shook his head.</p>
<p>Another mental demon. The martial path that he had taken had a long series of footsteps that existed in reality. It was not something that a mere mental demon could wipe away.</p>
<p>Illusions constantly appeared as the demonic voices constantly whispered in Yi Yun's ears, but Yi Yun focused on gathering the nomological fragments.</p>
<p>A runic pattern was formed, but there were countless other runic patterns…</p>
<p>Days passed and the Void Flower quietly produced a bud before it silently bloomed into a flower.</p>
<p>Six years had passed and it was time for Lan Xiaomo to return to the Primordial Space once again.</p>
<p>At the beginning, she would take note of Yi Yun, but slowly, she began ignoring him.</p>
<p>Over the six years, he did not say a word, like he was a stone statue.</p>
<p>And with the passage of time, she felt that Yi Yun's expression began to resemble a stone. Even his aura was the same.</p>
<p>She glanced at the Fey God Stone in front of Yi Yun before looking back at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>That's right, it was exactly identical to the Fey God Stone! Two stone blocks!</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo had such a thought. In fact, Lan Xiaomo did not realize that the reason why she made such an association was because Yi Yun had began to possess an aura from primordial times, just like the Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>Just as Lan Xiaomo was about to begin meditating in front of the Fey God Stone, she heard some White Fox clan's disciples talking within the Primordial Space. Upon focusing on the conversation, Lan Xiaomo froze.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan's Third Prince, Bai Yueqing, was coming here!?</p>
<p>This news surprised Lan Xiaomo. She had previously heard that Bai Yueqing had accompanied the young elites of the White Fox clan at the White Fox clan trials.</p>
<p>After all, Princess Luo Huo'er was currently in the White Fox clan trials. Lan Xiaomo believed that Bai Yueqing would stay with the White Fox clan trials till it ended and she never expected him to come to the Luo clan.</p>
<p>However, the two clans' training grounds were both in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven. It was not difficult if one had an advanced spirit cruiser to travel from one clan's training ground to another either.</p>
<p>Just thinking of Bai Yueqing coming made Lan Xiaomo somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>It was obviously not because she liked the Third Prince. He was a noble and perfect person, so as a little fox with an impure bloodline, she was not worthy of liking him.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo was somewhat reverent of the Third Prince and she was also apprehensive towards him. After all, he was the future heir to the White Fox clan's throne.</p>
<p>"Is His Highness coming here to understand the situation with Princess Xue'er's trial? I heard that His Highness had previously made a bet with Princess Purple Spirit, so he is probably mindful of the outcome. He would pay attention to Princess Xue'er, the Shadow Twins, Senior Brother Wufeng's progress, and maybe the Luo clan's Jian Zhu... If not, His Highness would not make a special trip here."</p>
<p>"There's no hope for me. His Highness probably can't even be bothered to pay any attention to me." Lan Xiaomo's tiny head stooped downwards.</p>
<p>As she glanced at Yi Yun beside her, she suddenly felt like they were in the same boat.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A few days later, the clear chime of bells echoed in the sky above the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>Following that, countless spatial ripples appeared as the space was immediately torn apart. From within, a gigantic ark slowly appeared.</p>
<p>This ark was completely white as jade. The runes that lingered around it emanated a magnificent aura.</p>
<p>Its bow had an extremely exquisite golden bell. It shook gently in the wind, and every shake immediately produced a chime that echoed throughout the sky. And the chimes tore apart the space in front of it. The chaotic laws around it were also forcefully calmed by the chimes.</p>
<p>It was the Celestial Sound Ark, the mount of the Empress Dowager of the White Fox clan. Only such a spirit cruiser could shuttle through the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>On the bow stood a line of people. A man and woman stood right in front, while there were White Fox clan beauties standing behind them in an identical fashion. Their figures and height were exactly the same at a glance.</p>
<p>Such a bevy of girls would attract attention anywhere, but in front of the man and woman, they paled in comparison.</p>
<p>The man was extremely handsome. He wore a fox-fur robe as his white hair drooped down to the ground. His slender eyes seemed to be smiling. As for the woman, her beauty was peerless. Her skin was as white as snow, and there was a red dot in her glabella. She had an extremely sexy bearing.</p>
<p>"Third Prince."</p>
<p>Seeing the people from the White Fox clan arrive, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi stepped forward and greeted them lightly. There was not much of an expression on the two Elders' dry and cold faces.</p>
<p>The two Elders were focused on their cultivation and they were uninterested in the political intrigue.</p>
<p>"Elders, you have worked hard." The Third Prince said with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>At the same time, he gave a junior's greeting. He knew that Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi had a slight chance to improve in their lives to become Supremacies.</p>
<p>Although the likelihood was low, the statuses of these two Elders would be very different if they managed to take that step.</p>
<p>Chapter 896: Losing Control of the Situation</p>
<p>"For Your Highness to make the long trip here, it's presumably because you are concerned about Princess Xue'er and the young disciples of the White Fox clan, as well as their results." Elder Duanmu said lightly.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the two Elders remaining reclusive in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, they had some information of the bet between the White Fox clan's Third Prince and Princess Purple Spirit. Seeing the Third Prince, Bai Yueqing come to the Luo Divine Hall, the Elders obviously knew what his intentions were. He was probably feeling uneasy and he was here to check on their results.</p>
<p>"Elder Duanmu, you sure enjoy joking." The Third Prince chuckled in a bid to liven the atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, when he saw Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi's stiff faces, the words that he was about to say were abruptly swallowed back. He felt that whatever he wanted to say would be meaningless.</p>
<p>He didn't know how many millennia the two old fogeys had lived. They were stuck at the threshold of becoming a Supremacy and they had odd personalities. With them being reclusive in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, they probably had not joked for more than a hundred thousand years. Bai Yueqing found such people, who only dedicated their lives to martial arts, rather boring.</p>
<p>"How is Princess Purple Spirit?" While walking towards the Luo Divine Hall, Elder Shi started a rare conversation.</p>
<p>"Princess Purple Spirit is doing very good. This Prince had long heard of Princess Purple Spirit's amazing talent, and it was truly amazing in person. With such a rich Ancient Fey bloodline, it is no way inferior to the richness of Xue'er's White Fox bloodline. Other than bloodline, Princess Purple Spirit's perception and qualifications were all perfect." Bai Yueqing waved his jaded fan and he pretended to say those words in a relaxed fashion.</p>
<p>However, as he spoke, his expression did not look too good. The muscles around his mouth appeared to be twitching.</p>
<p>Back then, Bai Yueqing believed that he would be happier the more Luo Huo'er revealed her talent. The blood lineage that he would get from a marriage alliance would be better as a result and it would also affirm his suitability for the throne.</p>
<p>However… it later turned out that Luo Huo'er's performance was too good, to the point of it being heaven-defying. It made Bai Yueqing unable to sit still.</p>
<p>With Luo Huo'er's personality, she could not withhold herself, even during the White Fox clan's trials. She practically turned it upside down.</p>
<p>For instance, the Nomological Ladder to Heaven. The Luo clan disciples struggled to climb upwards. Each level was extremely arduous.</p>
<p>But for Luo Huo'er, she was vivaciously bouncing upwards on the Nomological Ladder to Heaven without even stopping. One of the best geniuses left behind in the White Fox clan to hold the ground suffered such a setback from Luo Huo'er that he did not even dare show his face.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's talent was just too high, making the Third Prince helpless at suppressing her. With that, how was he able to convince the arrogant Luo Huo'er? If he could not, what was there to talk about marriage?</p>
<p>Seeing that he was losing control of the situation, the Third Prince made a special trip to the Luo Divine Hall to witness Xue'er's progress.</p>
<p>"Princess Purple Spirit's talent is indeed astonishing."</p>
<p>Elder Shi did not pay attention to the Third Prince's expression as he nodded his head in satisfaction. He had seen Luo Huo'er when she was young. Although he and Elder Duanmu did not participate in the struggle for the throne, as Elders of the Luo clan, they still had some affection for the talented girl in the royal family.</p>
<p>The Third Prince gave a wry smile but he needed to respond regardless of how reluctant he was.</p>
<p>Back then, he had sounded definite during the agreement on the bet, but now, from the looks of it… victory seemed rather uncertain.</p>
<p>"Where is Xue'er? Is she in the middle of a trial?" Bai Yueqing asked out of concern. Xue'er was of greatest importance.</p>
<p>"She's currently meditating over laws in the Primordial Space. In a few days, the disciples in the Primordial Space will switch. Third Prince, you will be able to enter during that period." Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>The Third Prince smiled and he began waiting.</p>
<p>Time was ephemeral in cultivation.</p>
<p>When the door to the Primordial Space was reopened, the disciples that had to switch opened their eyes. Reluctantly, they walked towards the entrance.</p>
<p>"The amount of insight that I gained this time is so little. I wonder if I have reached a bottleneck. Sigh."</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo looked up and scrunched up her face. She held her tiny head as though she was having a headache.</p>
<p>She glanced at Yi Yun and noticed that he was still motionless like a rock. It was unknown if he ever woke up in the middle.</p>
<p>"I wonder if the Third Prince is already here." Just as Lan Xiaomo headed to the entrance, she exclaimed, "Your Highness!"</p>
<p>She noticed a man and woman walking towards the Primordial Space's entrance. The silver-haired handsome man dressed in fox-fur was looking at the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>"It's indeed not bad. Meditating here will gain you double the results with half the effort. By seizing this opportunity, the effects would be better than cultivating outside for fifty or even a hundred years." Bai Yueqing said praisingly.</p>
<p>"The White Fox clan has a similar training ground as well." Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>"My White Fox clan has the Nomological Ladder to Heaven, so it is different to your esteemed clan's Primordial Space. They each have their different characteristics." Bai Yueqing said modestly.</p>
<p>The Nomological Ladder to Heaven was a long ladder formation build by dozens of Fey God Stones. It was situated in the void, having different characteristics but similar purposes as the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>Just like the Luo clan, the White Fox clan's resources would be allocated based on strength. Without a doubt, Luo Huo'er had taken the bulk of it.</p>
<p>And here, Princess Xue'er had also taken the bulk of it. From this point of view, neither side truly suffered. Both sides were using the most stringent methods to pick the best talents before nurturing them with the best resources. As such, the gap between top talents and weaklings would only magnify.</p>
<p>"Princess Xue'er is over there. She is currently meditating with the Three God Seal." Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing saw Princess White Fox through the nebulous fog. At this moment, she was standing there motionless. Her beautiful figure seemed to be frozen.</p>
<p>However, everyone who managed to kill the first Ancient Fey in the Fey Refining Rock array had double the meditation time. Hence, it was still not time for Princess White Fox to switch.</p>
<p>"Xue'er is currently in meditation, so there's no need to disturb her. This Prince will just wait here." Bai Yueqing said indifferently.</p>
<p>"Go ahead then, Third Prince." Elder Duanmu said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>As Bai Yueqing stood there, he naturally become the focus of attention. Many members of the White Fox clan were in no rush to leave the Primordial Space as they stepped forward to bow to him.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing revealed a gentle smile as he would occasionally give them words of encouragement so that the White Fox clan disciples would leave with a smile.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo saw this from afar. Although she worshiped the Third Prince, she did not dare go up to speak to him. She lowered her head and prepared to train outside.</p>
<p>"In that case, the person to be noted in the Luo clan is Jian Zhu." Bai Yueqing nodded as he looked at the youth named Jian Zhu standing in front of the Penetrating Star Rock.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was listening to the Shadow Twins' description of the situation regarding the Luo clan disciples.</p>
<p>"That's right. After Jian Zhu, it's Luo Mo and Yi Yun." Nongyue suddenly said, "They had previously each killed an Ancient Fey. Yi Yun barely did it and you can call it an internecine assault."</p>
<p>"Internecine assault? Then that's just average."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing shook his fan gently.</p>
<p>Chapter 897: Epiphany</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing did not pay too much attention to a trivial person like Yi Yun. However, once Yi Yun was mentioned, Bai Yueqing could not help but recall the snide comments that Yi Yun had made in front of Luo Huo'er. Furthermore, Luo Huo'er had even used Yi Yun as part of the bet. If the White Fox clan were to lose at the trials, Yi Yun had to accompany Xue'er to tour the Luo clan, but Yi Yun had unexpectedly refused.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Bai Yueqing frowned slightly. He asked in a displeased manner, "How's Yi Yun? Tell me about him!"</p>
<p>"His perception is not bad, but it unknown what he's thinking to choose special Fey God Stones." Nongyue explained the situation with Yi Yun choosing the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>"That Yi Yun is still quite a smart person. By choosing that Fey God Stone, it would not look too bad when he loses, even if he were to not gain any insights from it." A White Fox clan disciple standing beside Nongyue said.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing did not say a word. From the way that Yi Yun shared a good relationship with Luo Huo'er, as well as the information that he obtained about Yi Yun, Bai Yueqing could sense that Yi Yun was a person who took an unorthodox path.</p>
<p>He was a human from a lower realm with all sorts of ideas that were unpalatable.</p>
<p>Although Bai Yueqing did not believe that the White Fox clan disciple said was true, there were only two reasons for Yi Yun to choose the special Fey God Stones. Either his mind was not right or it was due to his arrogance. Regardless of which one it was, it was a foolish choice.</p>
<p>Nongyue blinked her eyes as Nongying had a ruminative look on her face.</p>
<p>Smart? Look too bad when he loses? The nomological insights gained here would still belong to each individual, regardless of the results. If Yi Yun had chosen the special Fey God Stones so as to not embarrass himself, his martial heart was probably way too insecure.</p>
<p>How could a person, who had been slightly praised by Princess White Fox, be so superficial?</p>
<p>At this moment, a girl timidly said, "I think Yi Yun is truly gaining insights. He is in nearly constant meditation and he doesn't even move."</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo had heard the conversation just as she was about to leave. It was unknown where she got the courage as she suddenly spoke out.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo subconsciously felt that she could not remain as resolute as Yi Yun. Clearly, the disciple that mocked Yi Yun could not do it as well. His denouncing of Yi Yun's fortitude as a warrior was rather unpleasant to the ears.</p>
<p>As that White Fox clan disciple, the Shadow Twins and the Third Prince were looking at her, Lan Xiaomo grabbed the corners of her clothes and felt her heartbeat accelerate.</p>
<p>This was the first time that she had been looked at by so many pairs of eyes. And one of them was the Third Prince!</p>
<p>"Oh it's Junior Sister Xiaomo. Right, weren't you sitting beside Yi Yun?" The White Fox clan disciple looked over. "You said he was constantly in meditation, then what did he gain out of the meditation?"</p>
<p>"Ah? Uh… " Lan Xiaomo only knew that Yi Yun was constantly in meditation, but she had no idea what he had gained from it.</p>
<p>"Heh!"</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing gave a careless laugh. He had already seen Yi Yun in the depths of the thick nebulous fog. Indeed, as Lan Xiaomo said, Yi Yun was sitting motionless like a statue.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun's performance, the hint of displeasure in Bai Yueqing's heart vanished.</p>
<p>It was unknown what Yi Yun was thinking or was up to. He was working so hard meditating in front of a Fey God Stone that even the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven were helpless against. Was he about to crack the mystery of the last three mighty Fey Gods?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing gave a dismissive laugh as he continued conversing with the White Fox clan disciples. Bai Yueqing was very amiable and harmonious. In the White Fox clan, Princess Xue'er had the most number of admirers, but his prestige was not much lower either.</p>
<p>Ten days quickly passed with the passage of time.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing did not have any feelings of impatience. In another month, Princess Xue'er's meditation would come to an end.</p>
<p>But at this moment, three different auric charms suddenly emanated from the Three God Seal. They began spreading in all directions like a wave. The disciples in the primordial space glanced over in surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh? Her Highness is ending her meditation early?" A White Fox clan disciple said.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing looked at the Three God Seal as well. A strange glint flashed in his slender eyes. This did not look like the end of a meditation session.</p>
<p>Following that, the three auric charms emitted a hazy divine light that were of three different colors. The divine light was not expansive and it was even rather weak. But this hazy light was enough to make the hearts of people quiver.</p>
<p>The Three God Seal contained the auric charms of three Fey Gods!</p>
<p>The three beams of hazy light hovered above Princess White Fox's head. They seemed to look down on her, with an indifference that came from a lofty attitude above all life.</p>
<p>In front of the ancient aura, Princess White Fox looked like a delicate flower.</p>
<p>This moment only lasted for a few seconds before the three beams of light slowly sank back into the Three God Seal and disappeared, as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, they never gave Princess White Fox any laws or opportunities.</p>
<p>But even so, this was enough to astonish everyone.</p>
<p>They were ancient Fey Gods!</p>
<p>Even a drop of the vast auric charm was extremely terrifying. However, the auric charms had emanated out of the Three God Seal because of Princess White Fox had lasted for a few seconds.</p>
<p>After the three auric charms sank back into the Three God Seal, a holy light burst out of Princess White Fox's body.</p>
<p>She bathed in the resplendence of this holy light as her body floated up, as though there were lotus flowers blooming around her.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, all the disciples could not help but hold their breaths.</p>
<p>At this moment, Princess White Fox was emitting a mysterious aura. A pair of snow-white fox ears grew above her head, as the phantom image of nine large tails appeared behind her back.</p>
<p>Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox!</p>
<p>"For such a phenomenon to happen, has Her Highness received an epiphany?" Nongying was mesmerized seeing this as she said softly.</p>
<p>She and Nongyue had unique talents in nomological perception. She felt that such a situation was the epiphany that warriors wanted, but it was something that came by not by searching for it.</p>
<p>"Xue'er has indeed had an epiphany. The process of nomological insights is a process of constant accumulation. Just like how dripping water can pierce a rock, all the insights gained from before are in preparation for this moment of epiphany. That was the instant that the rock was pierced."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing recovered from his reverie as he revealed a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>No, it was far more than a satisfied smile. It was pleasant surprise!</p>
<p>He did not expect to witness Princess Xue'er having an epiphany on his trip here. It appeared that even without his exhortations, Princess Xue'er's performance were still excellent.</p>
<p>"Having said so, not all accumulation can achieve that moment of epiphany. It requires top talent and great amounts of fated luck."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was in a good mood. With Princess Xue'er's epiphany, there was a tiny possibility that they could beat that arrogant Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Now from the looks of it, Luo Huo'er might be talented, but her capricious nature was inferior to Xue'er's calmness.</p>
<p>"Epiphany? Is it an epiphany because of the phenomenon?" At this moment, a Luo clan disciple suddenly asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was giving a nonchalant speech when everyone was still reeling in shock, so he never expected to be interrupted.</p>
<p>"Phenomenon is just one of the marks of it. An epiphany is from within, so how can phenomena appear that easily?" Bai Yueqing was slightly unhappy, but he continued explaining.</p>
<p>"His Highness is speaking, why are you shooting your mouth?" A White Fox clan disciple knew how to read the situation and he immediately and bluntly called out the disciple who had previously spoken. How dare he interrupt their Third Prince's speech?</p>
<p>All the Luo clan disciples looked at the White Fox clan disciple that had spoken with unpleasant feelings.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had received an epiphany…</p>
<p>Although Princess White Fox had a sacred beauty that prevented others from looking away, she was still the princess of the White Fox clan, an opponent of theirs.</p>
<p>By receiving an epiphany, the Luo clan disciples, including Jian Zhu and the other geniuses immediately seemed overshadowed.</p>
<p>But at this moment, the Luo clan disciple said with a grievance, "I wasn't trying to offend His Highness, but… but… it seems that on Yi Yun's side, some phenomenon is happening!"</p>
<p>Chapter 898: Spirit Taking Form</p>
<p>"Yi Yun has produced a phenomenon? You must be seeing things. Do you think that phenomena are sold cheaply on the streets? It's obvious that Princess Xue'er would produce one, but how can it be possible for Yi Yun?" The White Fox disciple, who previously reprimanded, said while turning towards where Yi Yun was.</p>
<p>Before he even finished saying his words, he was like a duck that had its neck pinched. The rest of his words were stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was sitting there, with space around him distorted, as though countless Dao ripples were constantly emanating outwards. The disciple in question fell into a trance momentarily when he saw Yi Yun.</p>
<p>This trance only lasted for a few seconds, as he suddenly regained his state of mind, but his expression was that of shock.</p>
<p>Just a while ago, his mind had been affected!</p>
<p>This White Fox disciple hurriedly looked at Bai Yueqing and he noticed that Bai Yueqing was looking seriously at Yi Yun. The White Fox disciple's heart skipped a beat and he wished that he could smack himself in the mouth.</p>
<p>It was all his fault for being so talkative. Having seen Princess Xue'er experience an epiphany, he had a sense of superiority over the Luo clan. He had intended to leave a good impression on the Third Prince, but his face was smacked just after saying a few words. It would probably be quite good if the Third Prince did not have negative feelings for him.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Yi Yun, and quite a number of disciples were like this White Fox disciple. A fleeting vacant look flashed in their eyes before they recovered.</p>
<p>Why were their minds affected?</p>
<p>The twins, Nongying and Nongyue were not affected, but they were astonished.</p>
<p>Was this Yi Yun's epiphany?</p>
<p>He was meditating with the Fey God Stones that had the auras of the three unknown Fey Gods sealed within them. How was it possible to have an epiphany?</p>
<p>They believed that Yi Yun had extremely high perception, but they refused to believe that Yi Yun was able to gain any insights from the three Fey God Stones that even the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven were helpless against.</p>
<p>Junior disciples lacked the insight as to phenomena that occurred during meditation. However, it was definitely impressive to have a phenomenon.</p>
<p>Among the Luo clan disciples, the Luo clan disciple that had been suppressed by the White Fox clan felt vindicated as he said, "It appears like phenomena are no big deal. Which White Fox brother was it that said that phenomena can only appear during Princess Xue'er's meditation?"</p>
<p>"That fellow!" The Luo clan disciple's words made that White Fox disciple extremely unhappy. It really touched a tender spot.</p>
<p>With the Luo clan disciple speaking, many people looked at Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Among everyone present, Bai Yueqing had cultivated the longest. Be it his knowledge or cultivation level, they were on a completely different level to these young disciples. The disciples might not be able to judge what the phenomenon happening around Yi Yun was, but Bai Yueqing could.</p>
<p>"It is is indeed a phenomenon, but it might not be an epiphany." Bai Yueqing said with a deep voice.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wufeng also spoke, "Your Highness is right. Yi Yun's phenomenon is different to Her Highness's."</p>
<p>Nongying nodded as well and said, "Yes, the Princess' epiphany was inducing the auric charms of the Fey Gods in the Three God Seal. It was a phenomenon from the Fey God Stone, but Yi Yun's phenomenon seems to have nothing to do with the Fey God Stone."</p>
<p>With this said, the disciples realized that Yi Yun's phenomenon appeared to be induced from within his body?</p>
<p>Space distorted with him being in the center. The ripples were also emanating out from his body, bursting in rings.</p>
<p>And at Yi Yun's glabella, a silver mark slowly condensed. On a careful look, it was a silver sword.</p>
<p>"This is… " Jian Zhu suddenly said in surprise. "That's will taking form?"</p>
<p>"That's right, as a result of his mental strength overly powerful, it has condensed into something tangible… "</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing shook his fan as he said this.</p>
<p>With this, he finally understood why Yi Yun was able to induce a phenomenon.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun's many years of meditating with the three Fey God Stones that seal that unknown Fey Gods have condensed his spiritual energy through the meditation process, regardless if he gained any insights. This allowed his spirit to condense into something tangible, inducing a metamorphosis and a phenomenon!"</p>
<p>"The condensation of the spirit into something tangible is extremely rare amongst young warriors, but for warriors who have condensed a Dao Fruit, it is rather common. However, for warriors who have condensed a Dao Fruit, it would not necessarily allow them to produce powerful combat power, even if their spirit condenses into something tangible. Unless they specialize in being a warrior that cultivates mental laws, the effects would be average!"</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was very knowledgeable, so he said a few words to explain the reason behind the phenomenon that Yi Yun had produced.</p>
<p>When everyone heard this, they suddenly saw the light. It was no wonder that they fell into a daze for a few seconds. It was because of the mutation of Yi Yun's spirit that affected their consciousness.</p>
<p>"I heard your master is Supremacy Gulan? This Prince remembers that Supremacy Gulan is knowledgeable with laws that use mental energies as attacks." Bai Yueqing said as he looked at Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>"Yes." Jian Zhu said with a nod.</p>
<p>"Yeah… Actually, spiritual energy attacks might not necessarily be very powerful. It's also easy to receive backlashes. Among the mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, few use such techniques. This kind of spiritual energy mutation is useful for a warrior, but it is not that helpful. If it is to meditate over laws, a typical warrior's spiritual energy is sufficient. After Bai Yueqing said this, the Luo clan disciples immediately revealed wistful looks.</p>
<p>So it was just Yi Yun's spiritual energy condensing into something substantial, and not a phenomenon induced from the Fey God Stone. And from what Bai Yueqing said, the spirit mutation was helpful to warriors, but unless one specially focused on laws that deal with spiritual energy attacks, its effects would be discounted.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun had gained an epiphany, they would now feel ashamed in front of the White Fox clan.</p>
<p>However, it was understandable on further thought. The Fey God Stone in front of Yi Yun was a Fey God Stone that mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven could not grasp any insights from. How could Yi Yun perceive anything? It can't be said that Yi Yun's perception was greater than all those mighty figures, right?</p>
<p>"That Junior Sister from before is right. Yi Yun is indeed resilient. He is able to mediate using a Fey God Stone that leaves others helpless to the point of mutating his spiritual energy." Nongying said with some tones of admiration.</p>
<p>Although he did not gain an epiphany with the Fey God Stone, being able to condense his spiritual energy during the meditation process, to the point of breaking through and making his spirit condense into something tangible, with his will as a sword. This also proved that he was extremely talented.</p>
<p>Other than Princess White Fox, none of the other disciples present received any epiphanies or condensation of their mental energies into something substantial while meditating with their Fey God Stones.</p>
<p>"He truly has amazing perception. In the Primordial Space, his performance would be brilliant if Xue'er wasn't here." Bai Yueqing said lightly.</p>
<p>Upon hearing these words, many disciples shook their heads secretly. Princess White Fox's talent was too formidable that made them feel as though they had been left in the dust. This was not something that an ordinary genius could compare with.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun was excellent, Princess White Fox's performance was stunning. This made the halo around him immediately appear dimmer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Towards the matters that were happening around him, Yi Yun, who was immersed in his mental world, knew nothing about them.</p>
<p>At a distance twenty feet from the long-haired man, Yi Yun was onerously enduring the immense pressure that came at him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt as though a membrane in his mental world cracked, producing the light cracking sound of a chicken egg being hatched.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun took another step forward. This step was extremely heavy, as though Mt. Tai was pressing down on him. It was like wading through deep mud, taxing and impossible to pass.</p>
<p>At the moment that Yi Yun's foot landed, countless fragments exploded with a boom. It was as though a shackle on his mental world had been released, as it constantly spread out.</p>
<p>Oh? He had made a breakthrough in his spiritual energy?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's spiritual energy was just a tiny pond, but after the repeated draining and refilling, this pond had finally expanded into a lake!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was finding it tough to stand twenty feet from the long-haired man, but now, he felt his strength increase greatly!</p>
<p>Not only could he take a step forward, his vision had also turned much clearer. The runes on the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence appeared as though a mist had blown away from them, presenting itself clearly in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They were all nomological fragments!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was pleasantly surprised. The sudden mutation in his spiritual energy allowed him to easily see all the nomological fragments. They were clearer than ever before!</p>
<p>He began to study them with a ravishing appetite.</p>
<p>This was a treasure mountain, and he finally walked into the treasure mountain at that very moment!</p>
<p>Each nomological fragment was priceless, but there they were, free for him to choose.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wanted to take all of them. He wanted to study all of the nomological fragments.</p>
<p>After he made a breakthrough in his spiritual energy, Yi Yun's spiritual energy was now immense. He constantly memorized and he no longer needed to worry about exhausting his spiritual energy to the point of being expelled from the mental world.</p>
<p>Yi Yun completely immersed himself in this tiny mental world. Every move of the long-haired man was perfectly reflected in Yi Yun's eyes.</p>
<p>Chapter 899: End of the Seven Years</p>
<p>After Princess White Fox had entered an epiphanic state, a few months had quickly passed. During this period, the meditation time for Princess White Fox was up.</p>
<p>However, Princess White Fox did not wake up. An epiphany was something that you chanced upon, so even though her time was up, no one disturbed her. The time that she spent could be made up later.</p>
<p>About seven months later, Princess White Fox finally awoke from her epiphany.</p>
<p>Her body had a converged radiance as she exuded an indescribable aura.</p>
<p>People found her more perfect than before. Her beautiful eyes were as deep as the night, with electric bolts constantly flashing around her. She gave people a deep sense of mystery.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan was inordinately beautiful to begin with. Regardless if they were men or women, they possessed a special charm, but this charm could not be seen on Princess White Fox. There was no need for that charm because just her flawless beauty was enough to naturally attract the attention of others.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing walked towards her with a smile. He asked, "Xue'er, what's the outcome of your epiphany? How far have your nomological insights gone?"</p>
<p>Princess White Fox responded with a smile, and this smile made countless disciples fall into a momentary daze.</p>
<p>"The result is still pretty good, but it needs a period of consolidation. Brother, you came here for me… probably because Princess Purple Spirit's results at the trials are outstanding?" Princess White Fox did not directly answer him, but she responded with a question.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing felt somewhat helpless. Princess White Fox always had such a character. She would not rush to a conclusion, unless the matter was certain. It was terrifying just thinking of her being in a epiphanic state for seven months, but even so, she kept quiet about it.</p>
<p>However, it was an epiphany in front of the Three God Seal, a rare opportunity that happened in ten thousand years, so how bad could the insights gained be?</p>
<p>However, Bai Yueqing had a headache once Xue'er mentioned Luo Huo'er. From news that came from the White Fox trials, Luo Huo'er's progress was divine. Even the Elders that presided over the training grounds were impressed.</p>
<p>"This Prince has indeed underestimated Princess Purple Spirit's talent. However, Xue'er, you have given me a pleasant surprise. It appears the bet might not be lost… " Bai Yueqing said with a smile.</p>
<p>After all, the bet between the two clans depended on the overall result.</p>
<p>"The bet is meaningless to me, but the trials here are very useful to me. I'll do my best." Princess White Fox said.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing nodded. He knew Xue'er might appear soft, but her heart was firm in her pursuit of martial arts.</p>
<p>"Then This Prince is relieved. You do not have any opponents here. Supremacy Gulan's disciple is much weaker than you. Although Yi Yun managed to mutate his spirit, making it take form, he is still not a threat to you." Bai Yueqing said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a mutation in his spirit?</p>
<p>"Is that so? He actually managed to receive something." Princess White Fox looked at Yi Yun with her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>"His talent is not bad, but it is incomparable to yours." Bai Yueqing lightly said.</p>
<p>Regardless of how powerful Yi Yun was, he was only the cream of the crop amongst ordinary geniuses. He was not someone who would catch his attention.</p>
<p>However… why hasn't Yi Yun woken up yet?</p>
<p>Even Princess Xue'er's epiphany had ended. It was unknown what Yi Yun was gaining insight on. For him to meditate for so long over a mysterious Fey God Stone that mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven failed to do so, had he gone down the wrong path?</p>
<p>After Princess Xue'er woke up, she left the Primordial Space, so Bai Yueqing naturally did not stay in it any longer. There were few people who paid attention to Yi Yun. During this period, only Lan Xiaomo would look at Yi Yun to see if he had woken up while meditating with her Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was just like the Fey God Stone in front of him, having turned into a cold rock.</p>
<p>The Void Orchid began to bloom, and when the seventh flower bloomed, the entire Void Orchid produced a strange glow.</p>
<p>Seven years was like a tree ring to the Void Orchid. Elder Duanmu had set the time to be seven years, which also happened to be the moment that the Void Orchid would enter a full bloom.</p>
<p>On this day, after the Void Orchid emitted a strange glow, the Primordial Space's teleportation nexus gradually lit up.</p>
<p>All the disciples woke up from their meditation.</p>
<p>"Sigh, I only grasped a tiny bit." A disciple looked at the Fey God Stone in front of him, being somewhat unwilling to leave it and being somewhat frustrated.</p>
<p>Many people had the same reaction as him. With the constant rotation throughout the seven years, the time allocated to them was too short. Although they had gained something, they felt that there were many unsatisfactory areas.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun meditated for the longest. Who knows if he gained anything?" A disciple looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"That's an unknown Fey God Stone, so how can it be easy? But even if he did not gain anything, his spirit has mutated, and he might be stronger than us." Another disciple said in envy.</p>
<p>Inside the mental world.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Yi Yun was in constant meditation in the state of the long-haired man's consciousness overlapping, while conjuring the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>Each nomological fragment slowly condensed into a runic pattern. With countless runic patterns forming together, it became the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun sketched out the final runic pattern, he gently placed his hands together. The runic patterns began to spin as though they were in a whirlpool, as they surrounded and enclosed him within.</p>
<p>Numerous phantom images of gods and demons flashed. With a loud bang, the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence appeared beneath Yi Yun's feet!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The long-haired man instantly collapsed after transforming into a purple beam of light.</p>
<p>However, before the long-haired man disappeared, Yi Yun saw a fuzzy shadow in the deep depths of the mental world.</p>
<p>The figure looked blurry, but he could vaguely tell that it was a woman. Her body was beautiful and her aura was ethereal. She looked like a goddess that came from ancient times.</p>
<p>Her back was facing Yi Yun, with black hair cascading down her back. Yi Yun tried his best to discern anything, but failed. Instead, he felt a stab in his mental consciousness.</p>
<p>This was the first time that Yi Yun encountered such a situation after his spirit mutated!</p>
<p>What a terrifying aura!</p>
<p>At this moment, the woman suddenly stretched out her slender hand.</p>
<p>Following that, she quickly dabbed her fingers nine times in the air.</p>
<p>Nine ripples formed nine flower petals!</p>
<p>The nine flower petals condensed together, turning into a tiny Nine Transformations Red Lotus.</p>
<p>This red lotus appeared to be lacking in power, but Yi Yun could sense terrifying nomological fluctuations from the red lotus.</p>
<p>Out of the 3000 Great Dao, there were countless laws. However, laws too were ranked. The five elements — Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth — were commonly seen laws. For example, the Luo clan was proficient in fire-elemental laws. Sabers had nomological saber Dao, while swords had nomological sword Dao. Time was a law in itself as well. To be able to grasp any of these laws —not simply proficiency — but total mastering of it, was an accomplishment in martial arts.</p>
<p>And above these laws, there were laws of Origins, like Yin-Yang, Life-Death and Chaos, that were superior. These laws were almost equivalent to Heavenly Dao. Typical warriors could not even understand them. To these warriors, these laws truly existed, but they were ephemeral and impossible to grasp, let alone master.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun sensed that this red lotus contained laws of Origins!</p>
<p>Who was this woman?</p>
<p>Yi Yun found it unbelievable. The man's appearance in the Purple Crystal at the beginning had already astonished Yi Yun. His aura was terrifying to the point of it exceeding the Pure Yang Sword Palace owner's.</p>
<p>But on further thought, this man must have been the former owner of the Purple Crystal, so Yi Yun could understand it.</p>
<p>But following that, who was this black-haired woman?</p>
<p>It appeared as though a long misty river of space and time separated him from her, preventing him from seeing clearly.</p>
<p>The Purple Crystal was too mysterious, but how many more secrets did it have?</p>
<p>However, at this moment, his mental world was shattered. Yi Yun opened his eyes and he realized he was back in the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>At the moment that he opened his eyes, it was as though his eyes were like a kaleidoscope, with infinite runic patterns flashing through them.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Yi, you have awoken… Ah!" Lan Xiaomo turned her head and she happened to see Yi Yun's eyes. Her eyes immediately glazed over, but she soon regained her consciousness. She hurriedly looked at Yi Yun's eyes again.</p>
<p>It was now normal…</p>
<p>Was that spirit energy? Every disciple already knew that Yi Yun's spirit had mutated.</p>
<p>Purple Crystal… Yi Yun took a deep look at the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone in front of him before standing up.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's long hair cascaded down from his back as the glint in his eyes remained converged. He was like a scion of the mortal world, with a bearing that seemed beyond elegant.</p>
<p>"Why do I feel like Senior Brother's aura has changed… ?" Lan Xiaomo thought in her heart, but she subconsciously spoke as well.</p>
<p>Yi Yun smiled and he did not respond.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lan Xiaomo looked at the tiny Fey God Stone in front of her. Thinking back to the time when she was repulsed by this Fey God Stone, but after seven years…</p>
<p>"I kind of miss you now. Boohoo." Lan Xiaomo felt as though she had feelings for the Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>"Time is up. It's time to leave." Lan Xiaomo shook her head as she walked towards the teleportation nexus.</p>
<p>Chapter 900: Battling Again</p>
<p>All the disciples returned to Astral Palace after seven years.</p>
<p>Seven years was just a fleeting moment to the Luo Divine Hall that stood on the floating land mass for billions of years.</p>
<p>When the disciples returned to the Astral Palace, they began to feel that this place had a feeling of eternity. They were changing, but this place did not. It was a strange feeling. It was as though time had stopped in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven after it failed to take form as a universe.</p>
<p>"When all of you first came to Astral Palace, other than a handful of people, the rest had average or even terrible results. In fact, amongst the handful of people, only one reached the standard of a genius." Elder Duanmu scanned the ground as he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Upon hearing him say this, everyone looked at each other. Elder Duanmu did not specify who it was, but it was clear that he meant that Princess White Fox was the genius.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was indeed extraordinary, with no room for debate. But what about the Shadow Twins, Wufeng, Jian Zhu, Luo Mo and Yi Yun? Were they considered average or slightly above average?</p>
<p>Their results were much better than the rest, so wouldn't the rest be unbearable to watch?</p>
<p>The Shadow Twins, Jian Zhu and company frowned. There was a gap between themselves and Princess White Fox, but it was apparent from Elder Duanmu's statement that Princess White Fox had only reached the standard, but she was not one of the top geniuses. How high was this standard!?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu gave a grim smile and said, "You do not need to be indignant. The performances that you had previously can only be considered passable in the Astral Palace's tens of millions of years of history. Let's see the fruits of your seven-year meditation."</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's expression remained indifferent, but a hint of disappointment flashed in her beautiful eyes that looked like the starry night. She was… not at the top… ?</p>
<p>The aspiration to do better was sparked in the other disciples as a result of Elder Duanmu's words. They were geniuses from their own states where people stood in awe at them, but only at the Luo Divine Hall trials did they experience the difference. However, they never expected to be considered existences that failed to even rank and could only line the bottom.</p>
<p>They went through seven years of meditation and honing, without a day of slacking. How could they resign themselves to lining the bottom?</p>
<p>Amongst the crowd, Ran Xueyi coldly looked at Yi Yun. He had managed to last nine minutes previously, believing that the results were not bad, only to be informed that Yi Yun had engaged in an internecine struggle with the Ancient Fey before coming out.</p>
<p>He was clearly stronger than Yi Yun, but he had been relegated beneath Yi Yun. This made Ran Xueyi extremely upset.</p>
<p>And in the Primordial Space, he had believed that Yi Yun was foolish, giving up the great opportunity to meditate with the Seven Star Rock and Lit Star to him. He believed that the gap between them would only expand, but he never expected that Yi Yun's spirit would mutate.</p>
<p>However, Bai Yueqing had also said that the mutation of a spirit was very limited to the increase in strength.</p>
<p>"I belittled you during the trial from before. But back then, your strength did not truly exceed mine. This time, I will not give you an opportunity."</p>
<p>"I've meditated and validated repeatedly over the past seven years. My strength has already greatly increased. I was stronger than you to begin with. At this trial, I will show my strength!"</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi was filled with fighting spirit. He could not wait to prove himself.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Fey Refining Rock, as a hint of fighting spirit flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>He did not step out of the Primordial Space for seven years, so he was eager to verify his meditation and results.</p>
<p>"Then let's begin." Elder Duanmu said, "We shall proceed according to the order of the last trial, from last to first."</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said this, Bai Yueqing said while fanning himself, "Elder Duanmu, why don't we reverse the order? I believe that everyone wants to see the purest of battles. This Prince is looking forward to the performance of the top geniuses from each clan."</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was most eager to see Princess White Fox's progress in strength. This was the greatest goal here. As for Jian Zhu, Shadow Twins and company, he would just take a look in passing. As for the rest, he couldn't be bothered with them.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu pondered slightly before saying, "Alright then, we shall begin from the front."</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said this, all the young elites felt their hearts stir. They believed that people like Princess White Fox, Jian Zhu and company would be at the end, but now, they had to start at the beginning?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing smiled and he looked at his younger sister. However, Princess White Fox did not say a word and just took a step forward.</p>
<p>"My sister and I will go as well." Nongyue said.</p>
<p>Wufeng did not say a word as he silently stood behind Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan's geniuses were assembled.</p>
<p>In the Primordial Space, Princess White Fox's epiphany made everyone marvel her. In comparison, the most promising opponent of hers, Jian Zhu of the Luo clan, had rather plain results.</p>
<p>If the Luo clan were to lose terribly in the first round, the White Fox clan was bound to turn arrogant.</p>
<p>"Jian Zhu." Elder Duanmu called out Jian Zhu's name.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu appeared clam. His body was straight like a sword as he took a step forward without a word. However, everyone could sense the fighting spirit exuding from his body. The fighting spirit was constantly gathering, to the point of manifesting a black swirl of air that lingered around his bone sword.</p>
<p>A disciple that was the closest to him was affected by this fighting spirit as sweat oozed from his forehead.</p>
<p>"Jian Zhu has changed too."</p>
<p>"This aura is very powerful!"</p>
<p>"He is preparing himself. When he unsheathes his sword, it is unknown how powerful he will be."</p>
<p>"Jian Zhu has been silently gaining insights over the past seven years. I'm curious to know how deep his comprehension is after staying for so long in the deep depths of the Primordial Space." A Luo clan disciple said.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu was Supremacy Gulan's disciple, so he did not lack in talent or diligence. His brilliance was only shrouded due to Princess White Fox and Yi Yun's phenomena.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu looked at Jian Zhu and he nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jian Zhu did not disappoint him. Just his aura gave people the feeling that he had formed the Heart of the Sword.</p>
<p>"Luo Mo, Yi Yun and Ran Xueyi." Elder Duanmu called out three names.</p>
<p>"It will be a clash right from the beginning. It's going to be stressful." Luo Mo said with a smile.</p>
<p>It was good to be stressed! The journey of martial arts was to continue forging forward. This stress was all used as motivation to force one to continue progressing.</p>
<p>Seeing the top disciples from each clan stand forward, the other disciples were filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>"Watch, Princess and the rest will definitely win." A White Fox clan disciple proudly said.</p>
<p>"That might not be the case." A Luo clan disciple did not want to be outdone.</p>
<p>They were all looking forward to Jian Zhu's performance. At this moment, his aura was the strongest. Just looking at him would sting the eyes, as though they were being cut by blades.</p>
<p>Clearly, the insights that Jian Zhu gained in the Primordial Space was no trifling matter!</p>
<p>The Fey Refining Rock could accommodate twenty people at a time. Other than these people, the White Fox clan and the Luo clan chose six other disciples each.</p>
<p>Twenty people stood in front of the massive Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>"Let us begin."</p>
<p>As a light flashed across his eyes, the space where Yi Yun was instantly changed.</p>
<p>It was a vast plain, just like it was seven years ago.</p>
<p>"Choose the Ancient Fey you want to battle!"</p>
<p>"I choose the Ranyi Fish!" Yi Yun's choice was still the Ranyi Fish!</p>
<p>Back then, Yi Yun had suffered serious injuries in order to kill the Ranyi Fish first. He wanted to know what the result would be in his rematch with the Ranyi Fish.</p>
<p>Chapter 901: Dao Domain</p>
<p>A roaring wave instantly appeared beneath Yi Yun's feet. Looking at the gigantic fish that had a snake's head, Yi Yun took a light breath and stretching out his hand, saying, "Come sword!"</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, the battle began!</p>
<p>At this moment in Astral Palace, everyone was waiting silently.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing waved his fan and suddenly said with a smile, "Elders, it's truly boring to just wait here while doing nothing. Why don't you project the scenes of their battles?"</p>
<p>"Battle projection?" Elder Duanmu glanced at Bai Yueqing. This Third Prince of the White Fox clan sure was troublesome.</p>
<p>Many formation arrays had the ability to project the scenes that were happening within. As this Fey Refining Rock was much more exquisite than other formation arrays, it could obviously do so as well. Before activating the projection, only the people who controlled the formation array, like the Luo Divine Hall Elders, could see what was happening.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Bai Yueqing's suggestion, all the disciples' eyes lit up. The people like Princess White Fox, who entered the trial, were geniuses much more talented than them. If they could watch the battles, they might be able to learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>"That's right, Elders. Why don't you open up the formation array and let everyone have a look?" Fairy Red Fox said with a smile.</p>
<p>"There's no harm in doing so." Elder Shi nodded with a deadpan expression. Immediately, he sent an incantation into the Fey Refining Rock.</p>
<p>Above the heads of everyone, ripples began appearing in the night sky. As though it was a picture scrolled being rolled opened, the figures of Princess White Fox and company were projected on this gigantic panorama. Everyone could see them, as though there was a membrane separating them. It was like they could see into another dimension, with everything being extremely lucid.</p>
<p>It was unknown how much energy was expended for such an array.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing immediately looked at Princess White Fox. He wanted to witness the improvement of Princess White Fox. As for the others, he was not interested at all.</p>
<p>"The Princess chose the… Ah! Could it be the Fey dragon!?" A White Fox clan disciple suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Fey dragon was the one that Elder Duanmu summoned when they first step into Astral Palace. It had given all these disciples a great shock.</p>
<p>The strength of most of the Ancient Fey were equally brutal, but a few of them were exceedingly strong. This Fey dragon's aura was much more powerful than the Ancient Fey that they had chosen.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox actually chose to do battle with the Fey dragon?</p>
<p>She was standing on withered land filled with yellow sand. Dark and oppressive clouds hung in the sky as lightning constantly flashed. As for the gigantic dragon, its figure was looming within the clouds.</p>
<p>In comparison to the horrifying phenomenon and the gigantic Fey dragon, Princess White Fox's figure appeared extremely weak.</p>
<p>"Interesting. Jian Zhu chose the Fey dragon as well." Elder Duanmu suddenly said.</p>
<p>Everyone quickly scanned through the twenty disciple's figures and they saw a black-clothed Jian Zhu standing in front of a gigantic dragon.</p>
<p>The two top geniuses of the two clans had spontaneously chosen the same Ancient Fey at the Luo Divine Hall trials?</p>
<p>All the disciples were excited. What was a confrontation? This was it!</p>
<p>Both geniuses were facing the same Ancient Fey. How far could they go?</p>
<p>"Elder Duanmu, please project Xue'er and Jian Zhu's projection together." Bai Yueqing said with a smile.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly looking forward to the battles of the two geniuses. However, Princess White Fox's figure on the projection was too far from Jian Zhu's, so it was inconvenient to watch both.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu pondered for a moment before enlarging Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu's projection into the middle. The remaining people were relegated to the corners of the picture scroll.</p>
<p>"The battle begins." Elder Duanmu said while looking at the picture scroll.</p>
<p>The two dragons roared simultaneously and they charged out of the clouds!</p>
<p>Dragons came from the clouds, while tigers accompany the winds. With the two dragons moving, the black clouds rumbled immediately, as the world discolored!</p>
<p>The dragon's head approached Princess White Fox as though it was a hill. The dragon's terrifying might and its indifferent eyes made the disciples outside the array involuntarily hold their breaths.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox floated up as her graceful figure stood mid-air. She reached out her fair jade-like hand, and gently tapped out at the charging dragon.</p>
<p>Upon tapping, a sacred and massive phantom image of a fox appeared in front of her out of thin air. The fox head's fur was silver and it had slender eyes. Its gaze was cold, as though it had seen the passing of time. Across space, the disciples watching the battle felt their bodies being penetrated by its gaze.</p>
<p>"It's the Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox!"</p>
<p>"How strange." The Luo clan disciples were alarmed, but the White Fox clan disciples were extremely excited. This Nine-tailed Heavenly Fox was also an Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>The fox looked at the dragon, as a strange glint flashed in its eyes. The dragon came to a halt, and its indifferent eyes seemed to glaze over.</p>
<p>At this moment, the phantom image of nine white fox tails suddenly appeared behind Princess White Fox. Taking a step forward, with a gentle tap like before, a fissure appeared in the eyes of the dragon's head, before it cracked open.</p>
<p>The dragon roared before exploding, splattering blood everywhere!</p>
<p>The first dragon, dead!</p>
<p>"It's spatial dimension laws!" Fairy Red Fox's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Not only that, there were also whitish-silver bolts flashing around Princess White Fox. It was as though she was isolated by the bolts in another dimension.</p>
<p>"Xue'er has attained Dao Domain." Bai Yueqing snapped his fan and slowly said, "Because of the laws that she has grasped, the space around her becomes a spatial domain. This is a manifestation of Dao Domain."</p>
<p>"Third Prince is right." Elder Duanmu's tone could not hide his appreciation. "Low-level disciples do not pay attention to nomological insight because laws are too distant to them. However, once martial arts are cultivated to a certain stage, one would have reached the end without laws. Only laws can open up the path to a higher level. It can even reach the core of the Universe's birth, Origins. At this stage, you would be on the same existence level as the Universe. With you being the Universe, that is the true extreme of martial arts."</p>
<p>Elder Shi lightly said, "That's too hard. Even Supremacies are unable to grasp the laws of Origins."</p>
<p>"That's right. To be able to grasp a single Heavenly Dao laws, that would allow you to become a Supremacy. At your level, it is already extremely talented to be able to attain Dao Domain." Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>They were studying the laws in the Empyrean Heavens so they could reach the level of Heavenly Dao, allowing them to become Supremacies.</p>
<p>"Dao Domain, Great Dao, Heavenly Dao, Chaos, and Origins. The grasping of laws is extremely difficult. The Dao Domain is just the beginning. But those who have yet to attain Dao Domain are equivalent to not having even started." Elder Duanmu looked at the disciples as he bluntly said.</p>
<p>Not even started... When the disciples heard this, they felt the immense gap. They too had studied the laws, so they obviously knew about their difficulties. Princess White Fox was able to draw out the auric charms of the Fey Gods from the Three God Seal. After months of an epiphanic process, she had attained her Dao Domain!</p>
<p>With her Dao Domain, just a single strike of hers was enough to kill the Fey dragon!</p>
<p>This attack was extremely profound and terrifying!</p>
<p>This was the terrifying aspect of laws. It directly mobilized the laws of the world in battle. It was equivalent to using the powers of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>This was truly something that they had no hope of chasing up to.</p>
<p>And after that, there was Great Dao and Heavenly Dao. To what extent was their difficulties?</p>
<p>"Jian Zhu has also killed the Fey dragon" A disciple suddenly said.</p>
<p>So fast? Did Jian Zhu also attain the Dao Domain!?</p>
<p>Chapter 902: Slaying the Ranyi Fish</p>
<p>"Oh?" Everyone was still feeling amazed by Princess White Fox's strength when they heard that Jian Zhu had also slain the Fey dragon. Immediately, they looked over at him.</p>
<p>All they saw was the Fey dragon in front of Jian Zhu turning into a corpse as it slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>They missed it!</p>
<p>Everyone was feeling wistful as the killing speed was just too fast. He was a few seconds slower than Princess White Fox. They were pondering about Princess White Fox's Dao Domain and were fully focused it, so they had failed to notice Jian Zhu's killing processing.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Duanmu waved his hand as Jian Zhu's projected image flashed. The scene was rewinding itself.</p>
<p>"If you want to watch it, go ahead. All the scenes are recorded in the array formation." Elder Duanmu said lightly.</p>
<p>Everyone felt excited for the opportunity to see Jian Zhu's slay the Fey dragon properly.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, Jian Zhu held his bone sword while facing the dragon that was a hundred times bigger than he was. He slowly took three steps forward.</p>
<p>Every step caused his aura to rapidly rise.</p>
<p>When his final step was taken, Jian Zhu's aura had reached a cumulative maximum. At this moment, he could not abstain from attacking, even if he did not wish to attack because the killing intent would end up harming him!</p>
<p>Sou!</p>
<p>Like a pale moonlight suddenly flashing past, everyone felt the horizon in front of them disappear for an instant. Only the Elders, Bai Yueqing, and Fairy Red Fox were not affected. They could clearly see that Jian Zhu had grabbed the bone sword behind him and stabbed forward instantaneously.</p>
<p>At that instant, his actions accelerated extremely quickly. There was nothing fancy except for its speed.</p>
<p>With the bone sword stabbing forward, the sword's blade seemed to disappear in the process. Immediately following that, the dragon's head appeared in front of him! At such a close distance, the dragon had opened its mouth, intending to swallow Jian Zhu's sword. But the sword's blade had torn straight through its throat with sword beams tearing the dragon's body apart, killing it in one strike!</p>
<p>That was it!?</p>
<p>Everyone stared at the projection with widened eyes. Jian Zhu's strength as well as his will seemed to gather around his strike. Yet, with the Fey dragon's powerful defense and lifeforce, it had failed to withstand the strike. This amount of destructive power was appalling!</p>
<p>Compared to Princess White Fox's elegance, Jian Zhu's savage slaying of the Fey dragon gave them another form of shock!</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing pricked his brows slightly. The bone sword was so fast that it had nearly broken through the limitations of space and time?</p>
<p>"Jian Zhu might not have gained insights in other nomological Dao Domains, but he has attained his own Heart of the Sword. Using the Heart of the Sword to form one's own Dao is also a path. The 12 Empyrean Heavens have Divine Lords of the Sword as well. Through their swordsmanship, they form their own Dao, allowing them to receive the Divine Lord Royal Seals as they destroy all obstacles." Elder Duanmu said as he stroked his beard. "Jian Zhu is not bad. It's no wonder that he is fancied by Supremacy Gulan."</p>
<p>His voice was not very loud, but when all the disciples present heard this, they felt powerless and frustrated.</p>
<p>The Divine Lord Royal Seals were too far for them. They were Dao Marks formed from laws at the birth of the Empyrean Heavens. The entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven only had seventy-two Divine Lord Royal Seals. A few of them had seemed to have gone missing. Even most Supremacies did not have the qualification to wield a Divine Lord Royal Seal.</p>
<p>Those who could wield the Divine Lord Royal Seal were peerless mighty figures who surpassed Supremacies. If a Supremacy were to be able to attain this step, it would be even more terrifying. They were the freaks amongst Supremacies. And when such a person surpassed a Supremacy, they would become part of the top figures of the Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>This kind of legendary figure was neither within sight nor within reach for them. Just the level of Supremacy was somewhat of a legend to them.</p>
<p>To form one's Dao through the Heart of the Sword… Although one wasn't mastering the laws of the Universe, one would immerse themselves in the sword for decades to eventually hone their Heart of the Sword and establish their own Sword Dao. For someone to be able to wield the Divine Lord Royal Seal, it was enough to prove how terrifying Sword Dao could be.</p>
<p>"It's impressive, but even with the Heart of the Sword formed, it is still far from a nomological Dao Domain." Bai Yueqing said with a smile.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had attained her Dao Domain through an epiphany while meditating with the Three God Seal. As for Jian Zhu, he had yet to reach the Dao Domain.</p>
<p>In terms of combat ability, Princess White Fox had yet to use her full strength clearly.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu was still much weaker than Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was never worried about Jian Zhu. He was only nonchalantly watching Jian Zhu's growth. He was certain that no one in the Luo Divine Hall trials could pose the slightest threat to Princess White Fox. It was only Luo Huo'er at the White Fox trials... Just thinking about Luo Huo'er made Bai Yueqing's brows twitch involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Princess White Fox is already battling the second Fey dragon!" The disciples were watching with rapt attention. Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu had each killed the first Fey dragon. The disciples were all astounded, but they failed to gain any insights from the battles. They had to watch carefully during the second ones!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As soon as the second Fey dragon appeared, it stretched one of its large claws out. Wherever the dragon claw passed, the void would tear open! Black spatial rifts appeared with raging spatial storms within.</p>
<p>Terrifying!</p>
<p>The disciples standing in Astral Palace could not even beat the first Ancient Fey, so they did not even have the chance to see the second Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Now, through watching the projection, they only felt their bodies stiffen slightly!</p>
<p>And this was just them watching a projection. If they were standing where Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu were, it was obvious how immense the pressure that they would feel while facing the second Fey dragon!</p>
<p>This made many people depressed. From the looks of it, despite their seven years of hard work, they were still no match for the Ancient Fey. It would be pretty good if they could kill the first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Just as everyone's focus was fixated on Princess White Fox, someone suddenly let out an exclamation.</p>
<p>"Senior Brother Yi seems… to have also killed an Ancient Fey."</p>
<p>The person who spoke was a White Fox clan disciple and she was none other than Lan Xiaomo.</p>
<p>She had also inadvertently swept her gaze past Yi Yun. This was probably because she would tend to look at Yi Yun's stone-like figure over the past seven years. She now had a sense of familiarity with him, so just a scan would allow her to notice him.</p>
<p>Now, everyone was watching Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu's battle with the second Fey dragons. That was the exciting thing, so no one had the mind to watch the battles of others. Furthermore, Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu's battle scenes were projected right in the middle. The other disciples were relegated to the edges to serve as a border. Even Lan Xiaomo was initially focused on Princess White Fox, but she had inadvertently noticed Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Lan Xiaomo's words gave quite a number of people pause.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had also killed an Ancient Fey!?</p>
<p>They hurriedly looked around the projection. Where… was Yi Yun!?</p>
<p>There was a total of eighteen disciples along the edges. The images projected were just too tiny. The disciples who were not familiar with Yi Yun had to spend some time before they could find him out of the series of projections.</p>
<p>When they saw Yi Yun, the Ranyi Fish beneath his feet had sunk into the water, leaving a tiny portion of its body above the water surface.</p>
<p>"Junior Sister, you must be mistaken. Isn't it alive?" When a disciple saw this Ranyi Fish, he immediately lost interest.</p>
<p>"He really killed it. That is already the second fish!" Lan Xiaomo hurriedly argued.</p>
<p>She had just seen the Ranyi Fish's corpse vanish!</p>
<p>The corpse that was divided into two had released a shower of blood!</p>
<p>"The second one?" The disciple was astonished.</p>
<p>If this was already the second Ranyi Fish, then wouldn't it mean that the time that Yi Yun took to kill the first Ancient Fey was not much slower than Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu!?</p>
<p>It was no wonder that this disciple's first reaction was that Lan Xiaomo was mistaken. Yi Yun was weaker Luo Mo and Ran Xueyi seven years ago, but now he was able to kill the first Ancient Fey in a few seconds?</p>
<p>Wasn't it said that he only had a spirit mutation, and had no nomological epiphany?</p>
<p>"It's indeed the second Ranyi Fish." Elder Duanmu said, affirming Lan Xiaomo's words.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu was somewhat surprised as well. The speed at which Yi Yun slew the Ranyi Fish was much faster this time. The speed at which his strength improved was very exaggerated.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun was able to kill a Ranyi Fish in the past. This time, he isn't injured and the battle was finished swiftly and cleanly. With his spirit mutation, his judgment in battle has become more precise." Elder Duanmu spoke with a hint of praise in his tone.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Yi Yun had already slain the first Ancient Fey, Bai Yueqing's gaze sank, but he did not say a word.</p>
<p>Beside Bai Yueqing, the other White Fox clan disciples were feeling displeased.</p>
<p>If it was Princess Xue'er, she was within sight but beyond reach, so it was fine even if they were no match for her. They were not on the same level after all. It was like commoners looking at nobles. They did not feel the need for comparison. But Yi Yun was not much stronger than them, to begin with. He was like their neighbor, but he had suddenly become a wealthy merchant. This feeling was naturally unpleasant.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun actually managed to kill the first Ancient Fey in such a short period of time? How did he do it? He was only a few seconds slower than Princess White Fox!" A Luo clan disciple said.</p>
<p>His words stirred the displeasure of the White Fox clan disciples. The manner in which it was said made it appear as though Yi Yun was on the same level as Princess White Fox, so how could they accept it?</p>
<p>"Hmph, don't compare him with Princess Xue'er. They are not on the same level at all. Against the first Ancient Fey, Princess Xue'er did not even have the opportunity to use her full strength. Furthermore, what Princess Xue'er killed is a Fey dragon. As for Yi Yun, he only killed a Ranyi Fish. Although the Ranyi Fish is powerful as well, it is much weaker than a Fey dragon. Towards the end, the gap between Princess Xue'er and Yi Yun will only expand, and she will leave Yi Yun far behind." A White Fox disciple said.</p>
<p>His words made the Luo clan disciple, who had spoken, frown. You don't even have the qualification to partake in the battle, so how dare you say that Yi Yun was inferior to Princess White Fox?</p>
<p>However, despite it sounding unpleasant, the Luo clan disciple had to admit that the gap between Yi Yun and Princess White Fox was not trivial. Her starting point was just too high.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, the others had struggled in their battles with an Ancient Fey, including Yi Yun, who ended with an internecine outcome. As for Princess White Fox, she had killed two Ancient Fey herself, and she had even seriously injured the third one!</p>
<p>Now, Princess White Fox had had an epiphany of the Three God Seal, forming her Dao Domain. Her strength was formidable and it could not be compared!</p>
<p>"Well… Elder Duanmu, can you replay Junior Brother Yi's battle scene?" The Luo clan disciple from before requested. Everyone was interested when they heard this. They too were curious as to how Yi Yun had slain the first Ancient Fey so quickly.</p>
<p>Chapter 903: Golden Crow Spreads its Wings</p>
<p>Yi Yun's increase in strength was just too ridiculous. What had happened to his body over the past seven years for him to be able to kill the first Ancient Fey so quickly?</p>
<p>With everyone looking at him, Elder Duanmu stretched his hand out and waved it with a deadpan expression. Immediately, the projection returned to the moment that the battle between Yi Yun and the Ranyi Fish unfolded.</p>
<p>Boom! The Ranyi Fish raised its fish tail and slammed the surface of the sea. A monstrous wave immediately surged straight at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not bat an eyelid. He raised the sword in his hand as Yuan Qi surged around him, even the sword, which could only be considered an ordinary weapon, emitted a dazzling golden shimmer.</p>
<p>A glaring radiant sun appeared above Yi Yun's sword.</p>
<p>"Boom!" Yi Yun charged into the wave, sword and person as one amidst burning pure Yang flames.</p>
<p>Wherever the sword's blade passed, large amounts of sea water was evaporated, and during this period of time, Yi Yun had charged into the Ranyi Fish's body with the sword in hand!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish had grasped water-elemental laws. Its body could separate like water. However, when Yi Yun slashed with his sword, the aura around the blade distorted. Large amounts of pure Yang flames spread out as the Ranyi Fish cried out in pain. Its water-elemental flesh and blood were being burnt and evaporated by the pure Yang flames!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>As the pure Yang energy gathered together, a terrifying explosion happened. The Ranyi Fish's body was torn apart from its head, splitting into two!</p>
<p>That was... it!?</p>
<p>The disciples were appalled. There were no tricks. He had burned the Ranyi Fish to a crisp with a single strike, just using pure Yang laws!</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Elder Duanmu had evaluated it as being swift and clean.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's strength had improved so much over what it was seven years ago.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun's perception is astonishing. He is able to mutate his spirit during the meditation process. Now, from the looks of it, his pure Yang laws have also been enhanced. Could it be that his spirit's mutation has allowed his pure Yang laws to take another step forward?" A Luo clan disciple asked.</p>
<p>It was not strange to have some refinements to one's laws brought about by spirit mutation, but this improvement was way too much!</p>
<p>"I wonder how many Ancient Fey Yi Yun will be able to slay." Another Luo clan disciple commented.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's current performance was already much better than Wufeng and the Shadow Twin's. It could be considered as him vindicating the Luo clan.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a White Fox disciple said, "Wufeng and the Shadow Twins have all killed their first Ancient Fey at almost the same time."</p>
<p>His voice sounded somewhat wistful. The time that Wufeng and the Shadow Twins had taken to kill the first Ancient Fey were inferior to Yi Yun's timing. They had allowed Yi Yun to steal the limelight for nothing.</p>
<p>"Hmph, our clan has had four people killing the first Ancient Fey already, and all they have is Yi Yun and Jian Zhu. Besides... How is Princess Xue'er someone that they can compare with?" A White Fox disciple had a change in tone as he said proudly.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Mo and Ran Xueyi were still engaged in battle with their first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>They were still relatively weaker. It would still take some time for them to kill their first Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>And at this moment, a White Fox disciple's eyes lit up as he said, "Her Highness has slain the second Ancient Fey!"</p>
<p>Slain the second one? How long has it been!?</p>
<p>Everyone's eyes immediately moved away from Yi Yun as they looked at the zoomed in projection of Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>In the picture scroll, Princess White Fox was floating mid-air. In front of her was another dead dragon!</p>
<p>She had really slain it... Everyone found it incredulous. They were still immersed in the shock of the first Ancient Fey being slain, but they never expected Princess White Fox to slay the second Ancient Fey so quickly.</p>
<p>Immediately, they had an odd feeling that maybe the second Ancient Fey was not much stronger than the first?</p>
<p>However, they looked at Jian Zhu, whose projection was beside Princess White Fox's. At this moment, Jian Zhu still had a redoubtable aura. His every strike was as fast as lightning. Everyone saw countless sword Qi wrapped around the figure and attacks flashing at the dragon's claws.</p>
<p>After every flash, large swaths of blood would burst out of the dragon's body.</p>
<p>The dragon roared angrily as its attacks turned more violent.</p>
<p>Countless spatial rifts appeared around the dragon's claws as black clouds loomed. The dragon's might was formidable. The crowd could not help but hold their breaths while watching this.</p>
<p>These disciples began to imagine themselves facing this dragon. They would probably last less than a minute, or maybe be defeated in less than half a minute!</p>
<p>Jian Zhu attacked with great ferocity, but he could only attenuate the dragon by adding new wounds to it. It would probably take a period of time before he could defeat it. He was unable to reach the point of killing the first Ancient Fey with a single strike.</p>
<p>Only Jian Zhu's battle was in line with the crowd's imagination.</p>
<p>As for Princess White Fox, the speed at which she killed the first and second dragons seemed completely indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Even her gestures… even the moves were the same!</p>
<p>Was… that truly the second dragon?</p>
<p>"Her Highness is indeed awesome!" A White Fox disciple said in admiration as he leered at the Luo clan disciples.</p>
<p>What was the point of comparing the slaying of the first Ancient Fey? Their Princess White Fox had already slain the second one!</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing listened to the battle of tongues of the two factions, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>Slaying the first Ancient Fey was nothing much, even if it was done in one strike. By being able to slay the second Ancient Fey with the same strike, that was strength!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox, who had attained Dao Domain, had an immense increase in strength. She had completely integrated the laws into her moves already, and she would become stronger when facing the strong!</p>
<p>"The third Ancient Fey begins." Bai Yueqing said as he flapped his fan.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A thousand-foot long dragon descended.</p>
<p>The dragon claws appeared first, but while it was still mid-air, a large fissure had appeared on the ground!</p>
<p>Compared to the second dragon, these disciples could still maintain their composure on the surface. After all, it was just watching an array formation's projection.</p>
<p>However, at the instant when the third dragon appeared, they could not help but take a step back!</p>
<p>The powerful dragon's might was already projected out of the array formation!</p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine how terrifying it would be to face the dragon themselves.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's delicate figure stood there silently. She observed the dragon and then stretched out her slender hand.</p>
<p>Everyone was astonished. Why was it the same move again!?</p>
<p>At this moment, Jian Zhu was still engaged in battle with the second dragon. The Shadow Twins and Wufeng had each begun battling the second Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>It was not that no one was paying attention to their battles. While looking at Princess White Fox, the crowd would also take some time to look at their performances.</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples would look at the Shadow Twins and Wufeng from time to time. They were similarly looking forward to the moment when the three geniuses would be able to make up for the loss to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>As for the Luo clan disciples, they were eagerly looking forward to Jian Zhu killing the second Ancient Fey and for him to catch up to Princess White Fox's progress. If not, the gap would only become bigger.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu's bone sword had an alarming destructive power. The dragon's body was already plastered with wounds!</p>
<p>It was bleeding so much blood that it formed a river on the ground.</p>
<p>Sou!</p>
<p>As Jian Zhu struck out again, the dragon gave an unwilling roar as it began to stagger!</p>
<p>"Just another two or three more strikes will kill it!" The Luo clan disciples' eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's battle with the third Ancient Fey had only just begun. This would mean the gap wasn't too great!</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Duanmu suddenly said in astonishment, "How did he kill the second one so fast!?"</p>
<p>"Elder Duanmu, what do you mean fast... ? Also, it's not even dead yet… " A Luo clan disciple just spoke when he noticed that Elder Duanmu was not looking at Jian Zhu's direction.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciple traced Elder Duanmu's gaze and he saw that in the projection, Yi Yun was floating above the surface of the sea. Beneath his feet was a gigantic Ranyi Fish's corpse that was floating on the sea surface. The water had been dyed red.</p>
<p>This Ranyi Fish had been split into two from the middle. Its innards were consumed by flames, as large amounts of lifeblood had been evaporated. It looked like it was grilled completely, making it evident how terrifying the attack was! And behind Yi Yun, a three-legged Golden Crow bathed in pure Yang flames had its wings spread out as it screeched.</p>
<p>The scene of Yi Yun having a foot on an Ancient Fey corpse, and a Golden Crow with its wings spread behind him was reflected into the eyes of everyone, not to be forgotten in time to come.</p>
<p>Chapter 904: Eye of the Skyfox</p>
<p>The Golden Crow Aspect Totem was glaring as the pure Yang flames pervaded everyone's vision. Even though it was just a projection, everyone could feel as though waves of surging heat were coming at them in a suffocating manner. This was the power of laws. When pure Yang laws achieved a particular realm, it was enough to penetrate array formations, creating true oppressive feelings.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breaths. Yi Yun had really slain the second Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>He had clearly slain the first Ancient Fey later than Jian Zhu, but he had slain the second Ancient Fey faster than Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>They had witnessed the battle process between Jian Zhu and the dragon. It was extremely intense.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun being able to slay the second Ranyi Fish at such a fast speed, didn't that mean his offensive strength was much stronger than Jian Zhu's?</p>
<p>This had subverted the knowledge of everyone.</p>
<p>"Impossible!" A White Fox disciple exclaimed subconsciously.</p>
<p>Just as his voice faded away, he saw Bai Yueqing's eyes glance at him. Immediately his heart skipped a beat as he shut his mouth in a hurry.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing's eyes had flashed a hint of displeasure.</p>
<p>He could ignore the fact that the Luo clan disciples were surprised, but even his own clan's disciple had joined in in making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p>So what if Yi Yun had slain the second Ancient Fey? Princess White Fox was still leading.</p>
<p>However, what was going on with Yi Yun? It was normal for his strength to increase, but how did his strength increase by so much?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing did not like Yi Yun, to begin with. In the past, Yi Yun was just a trivial character, someone Bai Yueqing belittled. Hence, he did not find him an eyesore.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun had surpassed Jian Zhu. He was right in front of him, in hot pursuit behind Princess White Fox!</p>
<p>Although there was still a gap between Princess White Fox and Yi Yun, the gap was smaller than it was seven years ago. This meant that Yi Yun's rate of improvement exceeded Princess White Fox!</p>
<p>How could this make Bai Yueqing happy!? In his eyes, Princess White Fox was not only strong, her cultivation speed was also very fast. She was someone no one should be able to reach.</p>
<p>"Haha, this child, Yi Yun, is truly not bad." Elder Duanmu mused. Even a smile that appeared on his blank face appeared cold.</p>
<p>He had previously thought highly of Jian Zhu. But for Yi Yun, he was really mistaken.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had given him a pleasant surprise!</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu had not paid too much attention to Yi Yun's battle from before. Only when Yi Yun was about to slay the Ranyi Fish did it catch his attention.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's killing of the first Ranyi Fish could only make Elder Duanmu feel slightly appreciative of him. However, by slaying the second one, Yi Yun made Elder Duanmu look upon him in a very different light!</p>
<p>"It's indeed not bad. With his cultivation realm, it's truly not easy to reach such a stage. It appears that the improvement in his laws was nothing trivial. Elder Duanmu, can you replay the battle process of Yi Yun again?" Bai Yueqing asked.</p>
<p>"Yi Yun is about to begin his battle with the third Ancient Fey. Why don't you just continue watching if Third Prince is so interested?" Elder Duanmu said dismissively.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's also perfect to watch it along with Xue'er's battle." Bai Yueqing said. A cold look flashed in his eyes. How could he be interested in Yi Yun? He was only feeling unhappy and wanted to see how strong Yi Yun had become.</p>
<p>No one had believed that Yi Yun was capable of killing the second Ancient Fey before Jian Zhu. Therefore, the people who saw the battle process was limited to Elder Duanmu. Maybe Elder Shi, who did not say a word, had also seen it.</p>
<p>"Elder Duanmu, please project Junior Brother Yi's battle image towards the middle." A Luo clan disciple said.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu waved his hand and the scene beside Princess White Fox on the picture scroll abruptly changed. It was the battle scene of Yi Yun. As for Jian Zhu's projection, it was lined to the side with all three scenes displayed side-by-side.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing frowned slightly once again. By lining three people side-by-side, he could ignore the fact that two of the three spots were taken up by the Luo clan, but Yi Yun was taking up the middle.</p>
<p>At this moment, Princess White Fox and the third Fey dragon was already under way.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's tapping with her finger this time did not appear as relaxed as before. Her movement was extremely slow. Although she tapped gently on the void, it was as though she was crushing down with a pressure that was no different than a huge mountain gave. As her finger slowly landed, everyone could feel the coagulated nomological aura through the array formation.</p>
<p>As for the Nine-tailed phantom image behind Princess White Fox, they were constantly swirling around as they engaged in a battle with the Fey dragon.</p>
<p>The ground began to fissure. Even rifts began to appear in the sky as spatial storms appeared everywhere.</p>
<p>The third Fey dragon was able to distort the space around it just with its body's strength.</p>
<p>It appeared as though it could annihilate an entire world if it indulged in its rampage.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's finger finally managed to press down fully with her finger!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As though an invisible barrier shattered, a bloody scar appeared on the Fey dragon's head.</p>
<p>The bloody scar slowly tore open from a thin crimson line. Immediately following that, the Fey dragon experienced a pain that made it produce an incensed roar!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Her strike had failed to instantly kill the third Fey dragon!</p>
<p>Everyone finally managed to understand what had happened from watching this process. Princess White Fox's finger had changed the laws of a tiny volume of space at the gigantic dragon's glabella.</p>
<p>Even though it was a tiny volume of space, it was enough to instantly kill the first and second dragon. This was the terrifying power of laws.</p>
<p>In a battle against humans, if the laws of a tiny volume inside the opponent were changed, the opponent could be killed even without a direct attack.</p>
<p>If the opponent were warriors with poor nomological insights, they might die without even knowing how.</p>
<p>This was the great difference in martial arts — having nomological insight or not. It was like a gigantic ravine that separated people.</p>
<p>However, Princess White Fox was unable to slay the Fey dragon in a single strike. As her palms were held together, her thumbs pointed at one another as four of her fingertips on each hand touched the corresponding fingertips on the other. Her hands formed a triangle where a fox's eye emerged out of it.</p>
<p>"Eye of the Skyfox!" Bai Yueqing immediately could not compose himself!</p>
<p>After Princess White Fox attained her nomological Dao Domain, she was able to summon the Eye of the Skyfox!</p>
<p>The Eye of the Skyfox was the coagulation of the Skyfox bloodline in her body. By resonating with the dispersed Nine-tailed Skyfox aura in the Universe, she was able to summon the Eye of the Nine-tailed Skyfox. Without sufficient perception and talent, it was difficult for Princess White Fox to achieve this at her cultivation realm.</p>
<p>However, she had managed to summon it!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this eye, the Luo clan disciples felt as though the world around them had disappeared. The eye appeared to constantly expand in front of their eyes. Eventually, it filled everything they could see.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Intense palpitating heartbeats could be heard in their ears, while their blood was boiling as though they would explode to their deaths.</p>
<p>Suddenly, what seemed like a gentle breeze blew past them, jolting these disciples awake immediately.</p>
<p>"Don't stare at it." Elder Duanmu said. As he looked at the Eye of the Skyfox, he said, "This is the Nine-tailed Skyfox race's avatar. I've previously seen your father use it before. It is pretty good for Princess White Fox to be able to produce a Eye of the Skyfox at her present realm."</p>
<p>"Father had once summoned the Eye of the Nine-tailed Skyfox to annihilate a faction. The faction lost themselves in madness as they slaughtered one another. Xue'er still has a long way to go." Bai Yueqing said humbly.</p>
<p>The disciples did not dare to stare at the Eye of the Skyfox any further. It was too strange. The White Fox disciples were unaffected by it due to the White Fox bloodline they had. Instead, they looked in Princess White Fox with arduous passion.</p>
<p>First, it was her nomological Dao Domain, and next, it was her Eye of the Skyfox. What Princess White Fox had achieved truly left others in the dust.</p>
<p>"Whew!"</p>
<p>A blazing white light shot out from the Eye of the Skyfox, stabbing straight into the Fey dragon's glabella!</p>
<p>The Fey dragon's body quivered as its amber eyes glazed over, as though it had lost its sanity. And at this moment, Princess White Fox tapped her finger out once again. As she did so, Princess White Fox seemed like a white flower that gently floated in the wind before arriving in front of the Fey dragon.</p>
<p>Despite her tapping at such a close distance, the Fey dragon did not put up any resistance even when her finger landed on its forehead.</p>
<p>"Peng!"</p>
<p>The entire Fey dragon's head sank downwards with the position of Princess White Fox's finger at its center. Its skull fractured as blood splattered!</p>
<p>The third Fey dragon was dead!</p>
<p>This strike had a stifling effect on others. Such an oppressive Fey dragon had its skull shatter and sink the moment it was gently touched by Princess White Fox. She looked just like a soft and light flower that floated around! The impact such a bloody battle scene had given them was staggering. They were rendered speechless for a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>Chapter 905: Nomological Sword</p>
<p>After witnessing Princess White Fox's terrifying combat strength, the Luo clan disciples no longer had any demands for Jian Zhu. They did not wish for Jian Zhu to have a fast slaying speed, all they wished was for Jian Zhu to kill the third Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>However… wasn't it easier said than done? The third Ancient Fey was too powerful.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Jian Zhu had just managed to kill the second Fey dragon. In the blink of an eye, Jian Zhu and Princess White Fox had a huge gap separating them.</p>
<p>"I wonder how it will be when Yi Yun faces the third Ancient Fey." Yi Yun had slain the second Ancient Fey before Jian Zhu. His battle with the third Ancient Fey was about to begin. All the Luo clan disciples were looking forward to Yi Yun's performance.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun could slay the third Ancient Fey at a passable speed, the gap would not be too great.</p>
<p>From Yi Yun's previous performance, there was still some hope for him to achieve this.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan disciples took a dim view towards the eagerness of those disciples.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples did not know the terror of the Eye of the Skyfox.</p>
<p>At this moment, a few figures were ejected in succession.</p>
<p>Their faces were pale as they gasped for breath.</p>
<p>One of them was Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>He had managed to slay the first Ancient Fey, and he had injured the second Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>Such a result was a great improvement from the one seven years ago.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi did not believe that he had done too badly. Although he was injured all over, he was very satisfied with his results!</p>
<p>After he was ejected, he had appeared behind a few Luo clan disciples. Having just experienced a fierce battle, the extremely excited Ran Xueyi did not notice what these Luo clan disciples were doing. He said, "What a pity. I nearly killed the second Ancient Fey!"</p>
<p>Just as he finished saying that, Ran Xueyi noticed that the Luo clan disciples were looking upwards.</p>
<p>Looking up, he was taken aback. A projection?</p>
<p>That meant that their battling process had been seen by the crowd, including the Elders and the White Fox clan's Third Prince?</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's face seemed to burn. The words he had just said had an exaggerated embellishment to them. He had failed to even severely injure the second Ancient Fey, let along 'nearly killing' it.</p>
<p>He had exaggerated it so as to trample on Yi Yun, but he never expected that the battle process could be seen by all!</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi felt like he wanted to find a hole to burrow himself into. He gaped as he racked his brains to justify himself before he suddenly stared upwards with widened eyes.</p>
<p>What was this?</p>
<p>The enlarged scene placed in the middle was not Jian Zhu or Princess White Fox's, but… Yi Yun's!?</p>
<p>The figure standing above the surface of the sea... was that Yi Yun!?</p>
<p>What gave him the right to be enlarged? Why was he in between Princess White Fox and Jian Zhu!?</p>
<p>He hurriedly began to look for the position of his battle projection. Although he had already been ejected, the images were still there.</p>
<p>Was he actually given such a tiny corner? Who would pay any attention to such a small picture!?</p>
<p>And at this moment, a Luo clan disciple that heard Ran Xueyi's words leered at him and casually said, "That's pretty good."</p>
<p>It was fine if the disciple did not say that, but when he said that, the already embarrassed Ran Xueyi's face flushed a deeper red. All that was left in his heart was anger.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one had paid attention to him at all!</p>
<p>Luo Mo was ejected after Ran Xueyi. He quickly noticed the projection above them. When he saw Yi Yun's enlarged projection, he was also taken aback.</p>
<p>"That is… "</p>
<p>"Yi Yun's battle has begun." A Luo clan disciple said, interrupting the about-to-speak Ran Xueyi.</p>
<p>"He is now beginning his second battle, right? What's there to see?" Ran Xueyi said with a livid expression.</p>
<p>He did not plan to focus on Yi Yun, but with such an enlarged picture, it was just too harsh on the eyes.</p>
<p>He had worked so hard, cultivating for seven full years, so as to regain the position that should have belonged to him today. However, when he was ejected, he realized that he had been placed in the corner. His above average result had not been seen by anyone. As for Yi Yun's battle scene, it was placed right in the middle.</p>
<p>"Second? That is now his third battle!" The Luo clan disciple said.</p>
<p>Third!?</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi did not dare to believe his own ears!</p>
<p>He stared at Yi Yun's battle screen with widened eyes. At this moment, Yi Yun's battle had already begun.</p>
<p>In the rough waters of the black sea, there were severe storms brewing across the surface of the sea. And in this storm, Yi Yun was holding a sword in his hand. On the surface of the sea, a large but strange fish loomed. Its eyes were extremely cold, and it was staring at Yi Yun, who was above it, while hiding in the dark waters.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's body trembled. He had already faced the second Ancient Fey, but the aura that was exuded by the strange fish was no doubt far greater than the second Ancient Fey's.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the strange fish surfacing, Ran Xueyi realized that Yi Yun was battling the Ranyi Fish. It was his ancestor!</p>
<p>Killing my ancestor?</p>
<p>Although it was just a wisp of the Ancient Fey's aura, it still was rather depressing for Ran Xueyi. Furthermore, what had happened to Yi Yun's strength?</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Yi Yun was still inferior to him!</p>
<p>And now, after receiving better cultivation resources and arduous cultivation for seven years, he was inferior to Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi had not seen Yi Yun's battle process with his own eyes, so he found it unacceptable.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun moved!</p>
<p>Against the terrifying weather and the Ranyi Fish that hid in the sea, Yi Yun charged down with the sword in his hand!</p>
<p>The sword's blade slashed the dense rain apart. A blank and white mark emerged out of the rain. With the white mark, Yi Yun thrust his sword straight at the Ranyi Fish.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish opened its huge mouth as seawater immediately flowed into it. Following that, it spat out the seawater as a gigantic column of water burst out of the surface of the sea. It came flowing at Yi Yun while blotting out the sky.</p>
<p>The force of the water column was redoubtable, enough to topple a mountain.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not have any intention to dodge such a water column.</p>
<p>Inferno Golden Wheel!</p>
<p>Golden light suddenly burst forth from Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>In between the dark seawater, a blazing inferno exploded.</p>
<p>The water column was slashed apart by Yi Yun!</p>
<p>The seawater was split into two. And at this moment, the seawater suddenly surged back.</p>
<p>The terrifying power made the watching disciples hold their breaths. Once the seawater halves hit each other, wouldn't the person in the middle be instantly reduced to a meat pulp?</p>
<p>But at this moment, Yi Yun still did not retreat!</p>
<p>The sword in his hand trembled and suddenly, countless mysterious runic patterns appeared on the sword's body.</p>
<p>This was one of methods of using the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. After seven years of meditation, Yi Yun was now testing the power of his sword!</p>
<p>"Nomological fragments?" Seeing Yi Yun's move, Fairy Red Fox was taken aback. Did Yi Yun gain nomological insights from the unknown Fey God Stones?</p>
<p>With a nomological sword in hand, Yi Yun slashed at the Ranyi Fish once more!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's slash was not only targeted at the Ranyi Fish's body, but its water-elemental laws as well!</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish flipped around in the water as the two tumultuous water columns surged straight at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Disintegrate!" With golden light scintillating, the sword's blade flashed across them!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Numerous tiny wounds appeared on the Ranyi Fish's gigantic body from its head to tail.</p>
<p>It was obviously one strike, but the effects of its attack was rather odd.</p>
<p>If it was a warrior that was weaker than the Ranyi Fish, their bodies would be instantly diced into countless tiny meat pieces, they would die without a doubt.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish's fish stiffened and following that, the tiny wounds began to heal!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the Luo clan disciples, who were staring intently at the battle projection, found it regretful.</p>
<p>This strike was unable to slay the Ranyi Fish.</p>
<p>Ran Xueyi's mind went blank!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was already so strong!</p>
<p>Even if Yi Yun was unable to slay the third Ranyi Fish, he was still much stronger than himself.</p>
<p>Against Jian Zhu, or even if Luo Mo had such an improvement, he would feel only envious, but he would never doubt himself.</p>
<p>He stared blankly at the battle projection.</p>
<p>At this moment, the infuriated Ranyi Fish nearly stirred the entire sea as water columns burst straight into the sky.</p>
<p>These water columns were splattering water droplets everywhere. Just being in their vicinity meant injury, touching them meant death!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's previous strike was very powerful!</p>
<p>But against the Ranyi Fish, that strike was not enough.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had summoned the Eye of the Skyfox, while Yi Yun... He did not have any especially powerful Ancient Fey bloodline, nor did he have any bloodline heritage.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun stretched his hand out and waved it. Around him, 999 flying sabers that shimmered suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Thousand Snow saber array!</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the Ranyi Fish. If one wasn't enough to slay it, what about a hundred or a thousand?</p>
<p>Although they didn't have the true power of the Thousand Snow flying sabers, with nomological augmentation, the flying sabers made by the Luo clan could still produce an explosive attack.</p>
<p>Cha! Cha! Cha!</p>
<p>As though it was snowing, snowflakes began fluttering towards the Ranyi Fish. All of the flashing brilliance contained a murderous blow. Every flying saber had a runic pattern!</p>
<p>This was a saber array constructed from nomological fragments.</p>
<p>"This array contains more than a thousand laws, so it can crack your water-elemental laws!" Yi Yun followed straight behind the saber array and he thrust his sword forward</p>
<p>"Die!"</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>With the dazzling brilliance exploding, it was like there was a temporary moment of silence in the world. Immediately following that, there was a gigantic boom as the Ranyi Fish's gigantic snake mouth burst open. Blood and seawater splattered everywhere!</p>
<p>The water columns that the Ranyi Fish was controlling collapsed beside Yi Yun. In the dark billowing waves, Yi Yun stood high in the air. Standing above the Ranyi Fish's corpse, he held a sword in his hand and there was blood still dripping from its tip.</p>
<p>The third Ancient Fey was dead!</p>
<p>"Snap!" Bai Yueqing's fan was fiercely closed!</p>
<p>Chapter 906: Nine-tailed White Fox</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing still found Yi Yun slaying the second Ancient Fey acceptable. After all, Jian Zhu, Wufeng and company had also managed to do the same. But now, Yi Yun's slaying of the third Ancient Fey was not much slower than Princess White Fox's.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was already on a completely different level when compared to Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>Be it Jian Zhu, the Shadow Twins or Wufeng, they could still easily cope with the second Ancient Fey, but they would be embroiled in a tough battle when facing the third Ancient Fey. This meant that Yi Yun had transcended the second-tier like Jian Zhu, and he had truly entered the first-tier level of existence. Even if he was still inferior to Princess White Fox, he was still qualified to be her opponent.</p>
<p>At this point, Bai Yueqing had no reason to ignore Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing felt fidgety as he said to Elder Duanmu, "Yi Yun has really surprised us. He will begin to fight the fourth Ancient Fey at the same time as Xue'er. But isn't his opponent, the Ranyi Fish, a little weak?"</p>
<p>The joy on the Luo clan disciples' faces sank. Bai Yueqing obviously meant that the Ranyi Fish was not as powerful as the Fey dragon and that Yi Yun was actually still much weaker than Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>And when Ran Xueyi heard this, he felt a stiffness in his chest. He truly wanted to vomit blood.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slaying his ancestor, but now, his ancestor was prejudiced as being not strong enough.</p>
<p>The words that he had said in front of Yi Yun had now turned into a joke. Furthermore, Yi Yun had never even targeted him. He no longer had the qualification to compete with Yi Yun.</p>
<p>"Since you think the opponent is too weak, a change would do." Elder Shi suddenly said as he waved his hand.</p>
<p>The crowd did not know what Elder Shi had done, but at this moment, Princess White Fox's battle with the fourth Ancient Fey had begun.</p>
<p>The fourth Ancient Fey's strength was several times stronger than the third one. And before the battle, a minute of preparation time was given to the trial-takers, but that time was just too short. It was not even enough for them to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>Against the fourth Fey dragon, Princess White Fox immediately summoned the Eye of the Skyfox.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of the Eye of the Skyfox, some of the fourth Fey dragon's power was restrained at the moment it appeared.</p>
<p>Obviously, Princess White Fox was using her true strength right from the beginning so that she could end the battle fast.</p>
<p>The Eye of the Skyfox, the finger tap and the shattering law required her to expend a great deal of Yuan Qi in order to maintain them. As for the fourth Fey dragon, its body was extremely powerful. If it became a battle of attrition, Princess White Fox would probably be bogged down.</p>
<p>"Well done." Bai Yueqing was very in favor of the battle strategy that Princess White Fox employed.</p>
<p>However, when he looked at Yi Yun's battle scene, his expression had changed drastically.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was standing on the corpse of the Ranyi Fish when he suddenly saw the scene around him become blurry. Following that, he suddenly appeared above a layer of clouds.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish's corpse had vanished.</p>
<p>The clouds were white and speckless. The sky was azure blue and there was a lingering mist that elevated one's spirit.</p>
<p>Yi Yun thought for a moment, what was going on?</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun suddenly sensed the emergence of a shadow behind him.</p>
<p>He immediately turned around and he was surprised to see a gigantic fox coldly staring at him.</p>
<p>The fox was silverish-white in color and it had nine long tails. It had a lofty attitude and it was standing on the layer of clouds. It seemed to have an air that belittled trivial existences, while it nonchalantly looked at Yi Yun, who was beneath it.</p>
<p>The Ranyi Fish had changed into a Nine-tailed White Fox!?</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at the Nine-tailed White Fox in front of him, he was filled with questions. He did not understand why the Ranyi Fish had changed into a Nine-tailed White Fox.</p>
<p>In the Tian Yuan world, the Desolate race had a White Fox Sacred Spirit, but compared to the Nine-tailed White Fox in front of him, its aura could be as different as the difference between night and day.</p>
<p>The Desolate race's Sacred Spirit possessed the bloodline of the Nine-tailed White Fox, but it did not manage to mature properly.</p>
<p>But the being in front of him was the condensation of a real Ancient Fey's aura. It was very strong! It was much stronger than the Ranyi Fish!</p>
<p>"This is also good." A glimmer of fighting spirit flashed in Yi Yun's eyes.</p>
<p>Although the Ranyi Fish was good, its water-elemental laws were restrained by his pure Yang laws. He was truly in need of a more powerful opponent in order to affirm several of his theories.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"Elder Shi, what's the meaning of this?" Outside the Fey Refining Rock array, Bai Yueqing looked at Elder Shi unhappily.</p>
<p>Was the switch of Yi Yun's battle opponent to the Nine-tailed White Fox a result of Elder Shi's wave of his hand?</p>
<p>This Nine-tailed White Fox was the ancestor totem of his White Fox clan!</p>
<p>"The Nine-tailed White Fox's strength is on the same level as the Fey dragon's. Furthermore, Yi Yun will have to face a fourth-level Nine-tailed White Fox immediately, lacking any prior combat experience. This will offset the advantage that he had gained from the previous three rounds." Elder Shi appeared as though he did not see Bai Yueqing's ugly expression.</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox was also an Ancient Fey, so it was obviously selectable for battle.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing's expression was ugly. The ancestors of others could be slain, but his ancestor could appear in the Fey Refining Rock array as well?</p>
<p>As for facing the fourth-level immediately... What Elder Shi was saying was clear. The difficulty of Yi Yun's fourth battle is more difficult than Princess White Fox's. This was clearly smacking Bai Yueqing in the face because of his statement from before.</p>
<p>"Elder Shi… " Bai Yueqing could not help but utter.</p>
<p>"Why, does Third Prince have any comments about my arrangements?" Elder Shi nonchalantly glanced at Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing fell silent. The Elders had no interest in power struggles, so they did not care about his status as Third Prince. Furthermore, if he were to ascend to the throne, it would still result in him not being able to directly offend these old fogeys, who could very likely become Supremacies. Even if the chances of them becoming Supremacies were minute.</p>
<p>The picking of the White Fox clan's ancestor incensed Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>"Hmph, that old bastard is digging a grave for Yi Yun. If Yi Yun were to fight the Ranyi Fish, he might be able to last for a while, but the battle against the Nine-tailed White Fox has a much higher difficulty. He will only be defeated faster and embarrass himself even more!" Bai Yueqing thought to himself as he looked at Yi Yun's figure on the picture scroll.</p>
<p>As a descendant of the Nine-tailed White Fox, how could he not know about its terrifying strength?</p>
<p>He was waiting to see how Yi Yun would die.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The minute of preparation time was up!</p>
<p>Yi Yun and the Nine-tailed White Fox's battle begun. Half of the Nine-tailed White Fox's body was hidden in the clouds as it revealed its gigantic head like it was a god. Its cold eyes were focused on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun brandished his sword as runic patterns shimmered on it.</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>A resplendent sword beam tore through space and it instantly arrived in front of the Nine-tailed White Fox. As for the Nine-tailed White Fox, it remained motionless. All it did was stare at the sword beam that Yi Yun produced with cold eyes that lacked any color.</p>
<p>It was such a silent stare…</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>The sword beam Yi Yun produced shattered directly!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was alarmed as he retreated several hundred feet.</p>
<p>A single sword beam had been shattered by a single stare of the Nine-tailed White Fox!?</p>
<p>What sort of stare was it?</p>
<p>"It's the Eye of the Skyfox, the Eye of the Skyfox!" Upon seeing this scene, the White Fox disciples were immediately excited.</p>
<p>Previously, Princess Xue'er had summoned the Eye of the Skyfox, and now, the Nine-tailed White Fox had used it.</p>
<p>This was a true Ancient Fey. Even though it was just a wisp of the Ancient Fey's soul essence, the Eye of the Skyfox that it used was the true Eye of the Skyfox. It was even more powerful than the Eye of the Skyfox produced by Princess Xue'er, which relied on the power of her bloodline!</p>
<p>Chapter 907: Nine-tailed Domain</p>
<p>"Let this punk challenge our White Fox clan's ancestor and let him witness the power of our White Fox clan's Eye of the Skyfox!"</p>
<p>The White Fox clan elites present found it vindicating.</p>
<p>As the ancestor of the White Fox clan, the Nine-tailed White Fox was often consecrated and worshiped by the White Fox clan. The reverence for the Nine-tailed White Fox was deeply engraved in the hearts of every White Fox disciple.</p>
<p>Elder Shi's choice of letting Yi Yun challenge the Nine-tailed White Fox obviously made the White Fox disciples feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Now, their anger was somewhat vented.</p>
<p>Not only was the Nine-tailed White Fox strong, but it was also proficient in laws. The way it attacked was extremely bizarre. If one did not understand what they were facing, they would only suffer!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun and the Nine-tailed White Fox were looking at each other in the array formation. The White Fox's eyes were dark but bright, as though it contained the galaxies in the sky that were connected to another dimension.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun saw that pair of eyes, he spaced out momentarily. He felt as though the eyes were the core of darkness, a source of darkness.</p>
<p>But there was not a single speck of dust on the Nine-tailed White Fox's fur that was as white as fresh snow. The black and white formed a sharp contrast.</p>
<p>Ocular technique?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised. He knew that in martial arts, there were mystic techniques that allowed the cultivation of ocular techniques. These ocular techniques were commonly related to illusions and spiritual attacks.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun felt that the eyes of the Nine-tailed White Fox were definitely no ordinary illusionary technique. The scenes that were reflected in its eyes contained Great Dao laws, as though it was the birth and death of worlds.</p>
<p>It appeared as though fragmented laws formed during the formation failure of this Primordial Empyrean Heaven were reflected in its eyes, forever etched within them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun suddenly sensed a darkness emanate from the Nine-tailed White Fox's eyes. The darkness seemed to turn into an actual substance that was spreading black Chaos. It consumed the surrounding space as it began compacting towards him!</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly felt as though he had arrived in a boundless void of darkness. There was nothing in the void, but he could vaguely see a White Fox at the ends of the void. Its body had shrunk to about an inch in size, as though it was rapidly distancing itself from him.</p>
<p>And just as Yi Yun came up with this thought, the White Fox was already the size of rice grain, as though it was about to disappear any time.</p>
<p>If it disappeared, Yi Yun would be the only one remaining in this space. The White Fox would disappear into infinity.</p>
<p>A sealing ocular technique?</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly had such a thought. Once he was sealed, he would lose this match!</p>
<p>Seeing the seal about to close in on him, Yi Yun roared!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Behind Yi Yun, the three-legged Golden Crow spread its wings as surging pure Yang flames emanated around him. The dark space was consumed by the flames!</p>
<p>Even if it was a sealed space with absolute darkness, Yi Yun was able to use pure Yang flames to set it on fire!</p>
<p>This Universe was an endless darkness of emptiness and silence originally. It was because of the existence of stars that the Universe was illuminated.</p>
<p>And these stars were burning with the flames of pure Yang.</p>
<p>Break it for me!</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook the sword in his hand as nomological runes gathered around it. The Thousand Snow saber array was also summoned by Yi Yun as it dispersed in all directions!</p>
<p>Amid the snowflakes, Yi Yun produced sword beams that penetrated the snowflakes.</p>
<p>Chi La!</p>
<p>The dark void was slashed apart by Yi Yun!</p>
<p>With his sword in hand and the 999 flying sabers spiraling around him, he stepped on the Golden Crow while bursting out of the void.</p>
<p>This was also the scene that everyone saw. They saw Yi Yun being instantly consumed by the void, and this caused the Luo clan disciples to hold their breaths. But thirty seconds later, they saw Yi Yun tear through the void and walk out.</p>
<p>"What a close call!"</p>
<p>"Yi Yun seems... to be struggling a bit!"</p>
<p>"This fox makes me flustered. I do not to dare look straight into its eyes."</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present were all nervous and distraught.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was indomitable from the beginning, but now, he finally seemed to be caught in a quagmire. He could not slay the White Fox easily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the White Fox had its body hidden in the clouds from the very beginning, having not moved at all…</p>
<p>The gap was slowly revealing itself. On the other side, Princess White Fox had already injured the fourth Fey dragon!</p>
<p>The gigantic Fey dragon had been stabbed in the back by Princess White Fox with a sword. She had nearly penetrated through the body as blood burst out of the wound!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Bai Yueqing revealed a satisfied smile. The final outcome would not change. It would obviously be much easier on Yi Yun if he were battling the Ranyi Fish. He might have been able to severely injure the fourth Ranyi Fish, but now, against the Nine-tailed White Fox that had strange offensive tactics, Yi Yun was unable to make use of his strength.</p>
<p>This was the repression that came from laws.</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox was one of the Ancient Fey that was closest to the Heavenly Dao. Even the laws known by a wisp of soul essence far exceeded Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>When he thought about this, Bai Yueqing gave a cursory glance at Elder Shi. The old man's act of rashly switching to the Nine-tailed White Fox was equivalent to moving a stone to smash his own foot.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Nine-tailed White Fox moved. Its massive body slowly revealed itself as its nine tails fluttered, as though they were burning white flames.</p>
<p>Its eyes were staring at Yi Yun. With the Nine-tailed White Fox's eyes as the center, different circular rings of different colors burst out.</p>
<p>After these circular rings spread out to a distance of several thousand feet, they disappeared into the void. However, they did not truly disappear, but instead, they began to seal the space.</p>
<p>Domain!?</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present gasped. They were talents meticulously nurtured by the various Luo clan states or factions, so they were obviously well-read.</p>
<p>They could tell that after these circular rings merged with space, they had formed a sealing domain. However, with so many circular rings, and with all of them being different colors, was each of these circular rings a different domain in itself?</p>
<p>As though she guessed the thoughts of the Luo clan disciples, a female White Fox disciple spoke.</p>
<p>"That is the Nine-tailed Domain. The Nine-tailed White Fox has nine domains! The domain you are seeing is the amalgamation of nine domains. By fusing these domains, it will cause the internal structure of the domain to be like a complete world. It is nearly indestructible. Just the domain itself can kill whatever is trapped inside. Now that the domain has closed, Yi Yun, who lacks the knowledge of the mysteries behind the Nine-tailed Domain, will not be able to escape." The female White Fox disciple said proudly. Yi Yun was suffering because he did not understand the Nine-tailed White Fox's offensive means. If not, he should have rushed out prior to the domain's closure.</p>
<p>It was already too late.</p>
<p>The outcome was fixed once he was sealed in the indestructible Nine-tailed Domain!</p>
<p>At this moment, in the Nine-tailed Domain, Yi Yun's expression sank slightly. He sensed that the surrounding laws of this space had changed. The Nine-tailed White Fox appeared to be a god and overlord of this space, in charge of life and death.</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously knew about matters regarding domains. With a thought, the Thousand Snow saber array flew out!</p>
<p>"Cha! Cha! Cha!"</p>
<p>The saber beams danced around like flying snow. However, when the Thousand Snow flying sabers reached a range of one thousand feet, they appeared to have struck an invisible wall.</p>
<p>With the sounds of 'ding ding ding ding', all the flying sabers bounced back!</p>
<p>Chapter 908: Illusions Abound</p>
<p>“Oh? The Nine-tailed White Fox's domain boundary is that powerful!?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at his surroundings. The space that he was in appeared to be sealed off by invisible barriers, but the barriers did not truly exist. They were formed from laws, and it was the change in the laws of nature of this space that had blocked his Thousand Snow flying sabers.</p>
<p>But not only that, the domain contained an invisible pressure!</p>
<p>The pressure was not only a pressure that targeted his body and energy, it was also a pressure that targeted the soul!</p>
<p>The domain was lorded over by the Nine-tailed White Fox, and this repressive feeling came right from the soul…</p>
<p>Yi Yun saw death and hell. He saw the Black-armored Demon God in the Tian Yuan world!</p>
<p>The Black-armored Demon God had long been subdued by Yi Yun, but now, he had appeared in Yi Yun's mental world once again.</p>
<p>The Black-armored Demon God brandished his lance and wherever he passed, massacres would occur with massive losses of life!</p>
<p>“This is… an illusion? Scenes that I fear in my heart?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun came to this realization. Illusion attacks typically attacked one's mental demons. Back when the Black-armored Demon God was wreaking havoc, there was a period of time that Yi Yun was powerless against him, so the Black-armored Demon God was really a mental demon of his.</p>
<p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>
<p>The Black-armored Demon God roared with a resounding bellow. Yi Yun could see the wanton flashes of blood shuttling through his body, as though they were ripping him to pieces.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It was not only limited to Yi Yun. Even the young elites outside the Fey Refining Rock array immediately felt illusions appearing around them as they watched the Nine-tailed White Fox and the Nine-tailed domain it formed.</p>
<p>Battle! Blood! Murder! Wraiths! Mental demons!</p>
<p>All sorts of illusions surged at them like a flood, as though it would wipe their sanity away.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, cold sweat began oozing out of the foreheads of many people. The illusions had an effect on their minds. Whatever happened in the illusions were the things that they feared the most. They seemed like dreams, but they also seemed real, preventing them from escaping from their deepest fears.</p>
<p>The powerfulness of illusions was the impact that it gave you despite you knowing that it was fake.</p>
<p>Not only were the Luo clan disciples affected, even the White Fox disciples, who were feeling proud because of the Nine-tailed White Fox, were in a similar situation. Although they kept saying the words 'Eye of the Skyfox' or 'Nine-tailed Domain', those were abilities that people who had truly awoken the White Fox bloodline had. Ordinary White Fox disciples could only brag about it with their mouths to find a sense of pride, but in fact, it had nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Shi coldly harrumphed.</p>
<p>It as though a large gong had reverberated in the ears of everyone. The disciples who were lacking in strength awoken. They were gasping for breaths as though they had experienced a huge battle.</p>
<p>Many people began feeling a belated fear. They could tell that it was an illusion in the beginning, but unknowingly, they fell deeper into the illusions.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples noticed that the White Fox disciples were not one bit stronger than they were.</p>
<p>A Luo clan disciple could not help but quip, “That bunch of foxes were still bragging a while ago, and now, aren't they just like us!?”</p>
<p>The competition between the two sides was so intense to the point of all decorum being lost. That Luo clan disciple did not use a Yuan Qi transmission and he had said it out loud instead. Although it was not said in a very loud voice, the White Fox disciples heard him clearly.</p>
<p>Immediately, the expressions on the White Fox disciples' faces turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>As disciples of the White Fox clan, their performance in front of their ancestor's illusion was equally as bad as the Luo clan disciples. It was very shameful!</p>
<p>A White Fox disciple could not help but retort, “Hmph! My art is not intricate enough and I have a weak bloodline. So what if I'm affected by the illusions? This shows how powerful the talent of our White Fox clan's blood lineage is! The true Nine-tailed White Fox is not something that any of you can imagine! Just from the projection of the array formation can result in such repercussions as a result of the illusions. If you were truly in the Nine-tailed Domain, you would have suffered a mental collapse!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples immediately turned worried when they heard the White Fox disciple's words.</p>
<p>Yes, just the projection itself was horrifying, then how bad would it be inside the Nine-tailed Domain? Wouldn't the intensity of the illusions that Yi Yun faced be a hundred times higher than theirs? It would really result in a mental collapse!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples present turned their heads to the Fey Refining Rock array's projection and they saw Yi Yun silently standing in the Nine-tailed Domain. His entire being looked he had been cast in stone making him motionless. And around Yi Yun, there was a gray mist that lingered in the Nine-tailed Domain. The mist was constantly in motion, at times forming a ghostly image that enveloped Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“What's that gray mist? Is Junior Brother Yi fine? Why is he motionless? He hasn't been defeated, has he!?”</p>
<p>“Don't say such disheartening words. Maybe Junior Brother Yi is battling the fox in his mental world. The outcome is still unknown.”</p>
<p>No one undermined themselves while uplifting others, but when the Luo clan disciples said such things, the White Fox disciples sneered.</p>
<p>“The outcome is still unknown? Our ancestor, the Nine-tailed White Fox, is the father of the laws of illusion. How can it lose to a human in battle while in a mental world?”</p>
<p>A female White Fox disciple said with a proud tone, but just as her voice faded away —</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>A black beam of light shot out of Yi Yun's glabella, penetrating the void!</p>
<p>It was a black-colored sword of light!</p>
<p>The sword was black in color, but it was blinding, like it was tearing straight through the souls of the crowd.</p>
<p>Be it the Luo clan disciples or the White Fox disciples, they felt as though a sword was being held against their glabellus. It made their hairs stand.</p>
<p>Sword of the Will!?</p>
<p>This thought streaked past the minds of everyone present. For a sword of light to shoot out of one's glabella, it was very likely to be a Sword of Will.</p>
<p>A sword that slayed all monsters and demons, dispersing the gray mist in a single sweep, vanquishing them into nothingness!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox's massive body quivered because of this sword as it retreated.</p>
<p>A single Sword of Will had broken the illusions of confusion in the Nine-tailed Domain and it had even made the Nine-tailed White Fox retreat?</p>
<p>People held their breaths. All of them knew that Yi Yun had been in meditation for seven long years, eventually culminating in a mutation of his spirit. Having awoken his Sword of Will, it now appeared that the black light was the usage of the Sword of Will.</p>
<p>They had lost themselves in the illusion attack just by watching a projection. Yet, Yi Yun, who was in the domain itself, was able to tear it apart with a single strike. The gap between his strength and theirs was huge.</p>
<p>When the White Fox disciples present saw this situation, the words they were planning to say were drowned in their bellies.</p>
<p>They stared at the Fey Refining Rock array with astounded looks on their faces.</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox's illusion attack was broken just like that?</p>
<p>They knew that Yi Yun had experienced a spirit mutation, but after the Nine-tailed White Fox conjured its domain, even the White Fox disciples were left speechless at the powerfulness of the domain. As a result, everyone had forgotten about Yi Yun's spirit mutation.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if they recalled it, they would never expect that Yi Yun's Sword of Will would be so resilient for him to tear apart the mental illusions!</p>
<p>Chapter 909: Fusing with the Heaven and Earth</p>
<p>“That punk… was just lucky. Mental battles must be his forte, so it makes it easier for his Sword of Will to shatter the illusion!”</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples were feeling depressed. The greatest advantage that the Nine-tailed White Fox held happened to be countered by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“No problem. The Nine-tailed White Fox is more than just that. Even if he had broken through the mist of illusions, he still will not be able to break the Nine-tailed Domain! And the Nine-tailed White Fox is invincible inside the Nine-tailed Domain!”</p>
<p>Being the amalgamation of nine domains, the Nine-tailed Domain was the highest manifestation of the Nine-tailed White Fox's mastered laws. If Yi Yun had known about the combat techniques that the Nine-tailed White Fox employed ahead of time, he could have avoided them in advance, but now, Yi Yun was already sealed in the domain.</p>
<p>In the Nine-tailed Domain, Yi Yun looked at the Nine-tailed White Fox with a strange feeling. He felt as though the White Fox was the world itself.</p>
<p>“Is this the effect of a domain… ?”</p>
<p>With a thought from Yi Yun, his Golden Crow Aspect Totem emerged behind him. The phantom image of the Tang Valley with Fusang emerged as well!</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook the sword in his hand and slashed it at the Nine-tailed White Fox!</p>
<p>“Cha!”</p>
<p>The sword beam tore through the void, hitting the Nine-tailed White Fox straight in its head. However, just at the moment that the sword beam hit the Nine-tailed White Fox's head, a very strange phenomenon seemed to happen. Like water ripples, the Nine-tailed White Fox's body split apart, making way for the sword beam!</p>
<p>It was like Yi Yun was slashing a phantom image! This was completely different from how the Ranyi Fish used water-elemental laws to dodge attacks. The Ranyi Fish was injured in the process at least, but the Nine-tailed White Fox escaped completely unscathed. Yi Yun's blade had missed it!</p>
<p>“An illusion?” The Luo clan disciples stared at the projection. Even the Nine-tailed White Fox's body itself can become an illusion itself?</p>
<p>But just as they had this thought.</p>
<p>“Cha!”</p>
<p>A fox claw that was as sharp as a blade swiped at Yi Yun. It brought a breathtaking sharpness with it, as it slashed at Yi Yun's side!</p>
<p>Yi Yun dodged the claw, but the enchanted clothes he wore were ripped apart by the winds that the claw stirred!</p>
<p>“It's not an illusion!”</p>
<p>It was not an illusion when it was attacked, but it would become an illusion when it defended?</p>
<p>Wouldn't this make it practically unbeatable?</p>
<p>Many people had such thoughts because they did not understand the Nine-tailed White Fox's combat methods.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun's mind remained clear in the Nine-tailed Domain. The inkling that he had from before was not wrong. The Nine-tailed White Fox had actually integrated itself with the domain. The Nine-tailed Domain was the Nine-tailed White Fox, and the Nine-tailed White Fox was the domain as well!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox had manifested itself as a world. If this domain was not shattered, there was no way to defeat the Nine-tailed White Fox!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you seem to have overdone it.” In front of Yi Yun's battle projection, Elder Duanmu transmitted his voice to Elder Shi.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun was battling the Ranyi Fish, he might have severely injured it already.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was lacking in experience when it came to battling the Nine-tailed White Fox, which had all sorts of bizarre combat techniques. It was very disadvantageous for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Elder Shi faltered slightly and then said, “It's not true that this domain doesn't have a weakness, but it will be very difficult for Yi Yun to find the weakness. However, that's fine as well. By letting him know what sort of bizarre and multifaceted battle moves exist in the martial world, it is worth the tiny loss against the young lass from the White Fox clan.”</p>
<p>During Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi's conversation, Princess White Fox had seriously injured the fourth Fey dragon already!</p>
<p>It was the fourth Ancient Fey, yet it did not seem to put a stop to Princess White Fox's advancement.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was in a stalemate.</p>
<p>As for people like Jian Zhu, the Shadow Twins, and Wufeng, they had already been expelled because of defeat. Only Jian Zhu and the older one of the Shadow Twins, Nongying, had barely managed to kill the third Ancient Fey. They were no match for the fourth Ancient Fey when they faced it.</p>
<p>As for Nongyue and Wufeng, they had only managed to severely injure the third Ancient Fey, but they ended up being defeated before falling short of killing the third Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>At the moment they were expelled by the Fey Refining Rock, they saw the two large projections of the Fey Refining Rock array.</p>
<p>“Princess Xue'er, and the other one is… Yi Yun!?”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is battling the Nine-tailed White Fox!? Furthermore, it has already conjured its Nine-tailed Domain!?”</p>
<p>Nongying and Nongyue came to a realization as to what had happened in the other battles. As descendants of the White Fox, the gigantic Nine-tailed White Fox astounded them!</p>
<p>They did not need to ask which Ancient Fey that Yi Yun had reached because they knew just from the aura of the Nine-tailed White Fox and the feeling that the Nine-tailed Domain gave them that the Nine-tailed White Fox that they were seeing was much stronger than the third Ancient Fey that they had been fighting!</p>
<p>“Could it be that Yi Yun is fighting the fourth Ancient Fey!?”</p>
<p>The twins found it unbelievable!</p>
<p>“That's right! The fourth one!” Bai Yueqing said as he gripped the fan in his hand tightly!</p>
<p>Even though Yi Yun was now at an impasse, Bai Yueqing was still unable to understand why Yi Yun had become so strong.</p>
<p>“Cha!”</p>
<p>In the Nine-tailed Domain, another claw swiped at Yi Yun. Three bloody marks smeared through the Nine-tailed Domain where the claw's tips were. The consequences were obvious if the bloody marks landed on Yi Yun's body!</p>
<p>Yi Yun dodged them in the nick of time. At this moment, Yi Yun remained extremely calm while he faced the Nine-tailed White Fox.</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed Domain was something that he had never been exposed to. The superposition of nine domains gave Yi Yun an experience that he had never felt before in combat.</p>
<p>This was a challenge, but wasn't it also an opportunity for him to train himself?</p>
<p>Yi Yun had mediated over the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence through the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone. Although he had gained insights into it over a period of seven years, the gap between his and the long-haired man's realm was still like the difference of night and day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to go from insights to actual combat skill required a process.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wanted to use this actual combat to complete a perfect fusion between the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's laws and his actual combat skills.</p>
<p>Cha!</p>
<p>The fox claw swiped at Yi Yun, but this time, not only did Yi Yun dodge, he had even slashed out as a response!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's blade shimmered with purple runes. The purple runes were the runic patterns that came from the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's present realm, summoning the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence in its entirety was too difficult. It would nearly consume all of his strength, resulting in him not being able to continue fighting.</p>
<p>That was to say that if Yi Yun were to summon the complete 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence and kill the fourth Ancient Fey, that would be as far as he could go for this Fey Refining Rock array. That was not the outcome Yi Yun wanted.</p>
<p>And if he distilled the complete 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence into nomological runes and augmented his weapons with them, it would save a lot of energy!</p>
<p>Saber beams appeared as 999 flying sabers shot out from Yi Yun's surroundings. Each flying saber was inscribed with a rune.</p>
<p>The flying sabers flew freely as they arrived at the boundaries of the domain!</p>
<p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
<p>As metal struck the nomological barrier, it issued a jarring sound.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun's sword, it was devoted to battling the fox claws!</p>
<p>Every flying saber slammed into the domain's barriers and were repelled, as though it was in vain.</p>
<p>But in fact, Yi Yun was choosing a different point of attack every single time!</p>
<p>To Yi Yun, every strike of the saber array was a clash of laws. The feeling was completely different.</p>
<p>In the battle, he began deducing the way to crack the Nine-tailed Domain through the collision of laws.</p>
<p>At the same time, this was a form of training for Yi Yun's use of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence!</p>
<p>As he attempted to crack the domain, he was enhancing his comprehension of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. Yi Yun believed that no matter how powerful the Nine-tailed White Fox was, it was greatly inferior to the long-haired man hidden in the Purple Crystal's phantasm.</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed Domain's laws were inferior to the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence after all!</p>
<p>Saber beams flew in all directions like flying snowflakes. As for Yi Yun, he was in a dangerous situation as the fox claws attacked him. It was like he would be defeated at any moment!</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yi is embroiled in a bitter battle!” The Luo clan disciples were extremely nervous.</p>
<p>As for the White Fox disciples, it appeared as though victory was at hand. “Yi Yun is still flinging his flying sabers around at this moment. Does he think he can crack the Nine-tailed Domain? What naivety!” A White Fox disciple said when suddenly a loud cheer erupted from the White Fox disciples.</p>
<p>“Princess Xue'er! Princess Xue'er has killed the fourth Ancient Fey!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples were stunned as they turned their heads quickly. There, they saw a long dragon's corpse floating above a deep blue sea. Its body was covered in wounds!</p>
<p>As for Princess White Fox, she floated mid-air, while crimson dragon's blood slowly flowed down her sword tip.</p>
<p>“Pa Da! Pa Da!”</p>
<p>The heavy dragon's blood fell into the sea.</p>
<p>The scene of clothes as white as snow, while blood dyed the sea was fixed in the irises of many disciples as they felt their entire beings going into shock.</p>
<p>Momentarily, the Luo clan disciples were silent in front of the Fey Refining Rock projection.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was too powerful!</p>
<p>Invincibility was a form of loneliness. Amongst the younger generation participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials, Princess White Fox was probably an invincible existence. Thankfully, the Luo clan still had Luo Huo'er to match her.</p>
<p>Chapter 910: Fox Blood Stained Clothes</p>
<p>After slaying the fourth Ancient Fey, there was a two minute rest period before the battle against the fifth Ancient Fey began. Although it was a short period of time, it was sufficient for Princess White Fox, who had a tremendously powerful bloodline, to recover a substantial amount of Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was about to challenge the fifth Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>In this regard, the White Fox disciples were excited! But at this moment, even they were not optimistic that Princess White Fox would be able to slay the fifth Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>She did not have an easy time killing the fourth Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>And since the fifth Ancient Fey was stronger than the fourth, for her to defeat the fifth one? Difficult!</p>
<p>Time passed as Princess White Fox began to meditate and regulate her breathing. And outside the array formation, the Luo clan disciples were watching the battle between Yi Yun and the Nine-tailed White Fox nervously.</p>
<p>In the Nine-tailed Domain, Yi Yun had no way to attack the Nine-tailed White Fox's body itself. He could only passively defend, while seemingly attack the Nine-tailed Domain's boundaries in vain.</p>
<p>The Thousand Snow flying sabers would launch a thousand attacks in a few seconds, but every single attack would be repelled by the domain boundaries.</p>
<p>“He still can't crack it!”</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yi's Yuan Qi is dropping drastically!”</p>
<p>The battle projection of the Fey Refining Rock array gave everyone the feeling that they were there in person. It reflected the moves, the Ancient Fey's aura and suppression, as well as the challenger's Yuan Qi intensity.</p>
<p>Everyone could clearly sense that Yi Yun's Yuan Qi was only about 80% of his full capacity.</p>
<p>Once his Yuan Qi intensity went below its optimal state, then be it attack or defense, it would be more taxing on him. As such, his Yuan Qi would deplete even faster, resulting in a vicious cycle. If this went on, defeat was a matter of time.</p>
<p>At this moment…</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>The crisp sound of metal shattering was heard as one of Yi Yun's flying sabers exploded in the Nine-tailed Domain!</p>
<p>“His saber shattered?”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples stared at the projection. Although they did not understand the Thousand Snow flying sabers, they knew that Yi Yun was using a form of saber array. The number of flying sabers that formed the array were fixed. With one fewer saber, the saber array would no longer be perfect, resulting in a decrease of its strength!</p>
<p>In the Fey Refining Rock array, all the weapons were standard and lacking in quality. If a warrior injected Yuan Qi into them, it was possible to make it indestructible.</p>
<p>However, if insufficient Yuan Qi was injected while having to sustain high levels of impact, it was normal for the weapon to shatter!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was controlling 999 flying sabers, and with his Yuan Qi being divided into so many portions, in addition to his drop in stamina, this resulted in one flying saber exploding!</p>
<p>Just as people were having such thoughts, the sound of another flying saber shattering into two was heard!</p>
<p>Every flying saber that shattering resulted in Yi Yun's offensive weakening.</p>
<p>“That punk finally can't handle it. He really gave me a fright.” Bai Yueqing thought to himself before exhaling.</p>
<p>He was truly afraid that Yi Yun would be able to defeat the Nine-tailed White Fox. That would result in him catching up with Princess White Fox. After all, it was not certain that Princess Xue'er was able to slay the fifth Ancient Fey. When the time came, even if Princess White Fox's battle outcome against the fifth Ancient Fey was much better than Yi Yun's, it would look not much different if she failed to slay it.</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Bai Yueqing relaxed. He casually flapped his fan and said, “Yi Yun is not bad either. Unfortunately, he's challenging the Nine-tailed White Fox. As the totem of our White Fox clan, even a wisp of its soul essence has strength beyond his imagination. How would he be able to deal with it?”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing's words made the Luo clan disciples frown, but they did not retort. After all, Yi Yun's flying sabers were constantly being shattered in the domain. In the short time span, more than ten had shattered.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples' hearts sank. As they looked at Princess White Fox again, two minutes was enough for her to restore a sizable amount of her Yuan Qi. She was about to begin challenging the fifth Fey dragon!</p>
<p>The gap was widening!</p>
<p>But even so, Yi Yun could be proud of himself. With his background and age, it was truly a miracle that he achieved so much up to this point.</p>
<p>In the Nine-tailed Domain, Yi Yun's forehead was dripping with sweat as he panted. By using the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's laws in actual combat, what limited his strength the most was his weak cultivation level.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Yuan Qi was insufficient to support the use of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. Even if he were using the nomological fragments, his energy was quickly depleting!</p>
<p>“I need to maintain 70% of my stamina to reach the fifth stage at least. Only then will I have the slightest chance of winning. For now, I can only use 10% of my energy to crack this Nine-tailed Domain!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun powered the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' to its maximum. The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was an offensive technique after all. What truly affected a warrior's cultivation level and Yuan Qi reserves was one's cultivation technique.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' was the top-level cultivation technique that Yi Yun possessed. It was a great boost for Yi Yun, but now, with the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' was insufficient. This resulted in the Yuan Qi reserves being Yi Yun's weakness.</p>
<p>“More than twenty flying sabers have shattered. That punk is truly at his limits.” Elder Duanmu said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Despite already knowing Yi Yun's performance was stunning, he subconsciously hoped that Yi Yun would create a greater miracle.</p>
<p>“There are many shattered, but don't you find it odd? The punk seems to be deliberately conserving strength at this point in time?” At this moment, Elder Shi suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu was stunned as he looked at the projection. He realized that Yi Yun did not seem to be going all out as well. It was as though he had reservations…</p>
<p>“What is that punk doing? Doesn't he know the urgency of the situation? Why isn't he not using all of his strength? Even if he doesn't crack the Nine-tailed Domain, by freely attacking, it would allow his results to look better.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu was left perplexed. Rewards were awarded through the clearance of the Fey Refining Rock array. The better the results were, the better the rewards were.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is persisting in a difficult situation indeed. He has used every means possible, but I noticed that the flying sabers that shattered seem interesting. The twenty or so flying sabers that shattered seem to give me a special feeling when linked together… ”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Elder Duanmu pricked his eyebrows. “Senior Brother, what do you mean? Are you telling me that Yi Yun has found a way to crack the domain?”</p>
<p>Elder Shi dismissed it, “Unlikely. If it were me, even if I had the Heaven Ascension cultivation level, I would have a hundred means of cracking the Nine-tailed Domain. However, Yi Yun is not using any one of the hundred. I do not think he can find a method that exceeds my methods.”</p>
<p>“But since he hasn't found a solution, Yi Yun is still attempting it. However, his attempts make me find it rather special. As to saying that there's something profound about it, it's unlikely!”</p>
<p>Elder Shi shook his head. He had lived for hundreds of thousands of years. His cultivation level was formidable and he was well-read. He could understand the profoundness of the laws and the moves of a junior, even if it was the first time he saw them.</p>
<p>He could not comprehend the profoundness in Yi Yun's moves, which only meant that it probably lacked any.</p>
<p>Just as Elder Shi said this, a series of 'Peng Peng Peng Peng Peng Peng' noises was heard. Dozens of flying sabers shattered at that instant.</p>
<p>Adding the ones from before, a total of hundred flying sabers had been shattered!</p>
<p>No one noticed that after every flying saber shattered, the nomological fragments injected into the flying sabers had transformed into golden runes that affixed themselves to the Nine-tailed Domain's boundary.</p>
<p>A hundred flying sabers had left behind a hundred golden runes.</p>
<p>When the runes were linked together, they seemed to form a giant wheel.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Yi Yun's body suddenly flashed as he arrived at the center of this wheel!</p>
<p>He faced the spatial boundary with his back facing the Nine-tailed White Fox!</p>
<p>As he had flown to this point while disregarding everything, he was unable to block the Nine-tailed White Fox's attack in time. A fox claw followed swiftly behind Yi Yun. Yi Yun was about to be torn to shreds!</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yi!”</p>
<p>People screamed. It was like Yi Yun did not know that the Nine-tailed White Fox was attacking him!</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi stirred as they circulated their Yuan Qi. They planned on saving Yi Yun in the nick of time.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Yi Yun ignored the Nine-tailed White Fox. With his sword in hand, he stabbed the core of the wheel!</p>
<p>Break!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The hundred runes exploded simultaneously! The entire spatial boundary of the Nine-tailed Domain began to crack like an eggshell through this intense blast.</p>
<p>As for the Nine-tailed White Fox, which was located in the middle of the Nine-tailed Domain, it had already merged with the domain. It was the domain, and the domain was it.</p>
<p>At the instant that the domain shattered, the Nine-tailed White Fox's body shattered as well. It let out a horrifying scream as its body was torn apart, spraying blood everywhere!</p>
<p>The fatal claw was reduced to dust just as it was about to strike Yi Yun's back.</p>
<p>With the sword in his hand, Yi Yun's back faced the collapsing Nine-tailed White Fox. His body was soaked in the rain of fox blood. It was a bloody patch!</p>
<p>This sudden change in the scene exceeded everyone's expectations!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was just about to fail, and he had even been hit by the fox's claw, but in an instant, everything was reversed. Yi Yun's sword had cracked the Nine-tailed Domain and the Nine-tailed White Fox was killed as a result!?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi stared at Yi Yun with an inexplicable look on their usually indifferent and cold faces, much less the complete daze the Luo clan and White Fox disciples were in.</p>
<p>What the hell happened?</p>
<p>Chapter 911: Sea of Lightning</p>
<p>“The Nine-tailed Domain has been cracked by Yi Yun!?”</p>
<p>Seeing the White Fox blood that rained down the sky, the White Fox disciples gasped. The Nine-tailed White Fox was their species' totem. They would only occasionally see the Nine-tailed White Fox's phantom image during their White Fox clan worshiping rituals. To the White Fox clan, the Nine-tailed White Fox was a paramount existence. Now, it had been slain by Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Furthermore, this was the Nine-tailed White Fox that had conjured its Nine-tailed Domain, merging one with it.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had cracked the domain and slain the White Fox. At this moment, Yi Yun had more than 800 flying sabers flying around him, with a great deal of flying saber fragments as well. His entire body was dyed red by the fox's blood while he gripped his sword tightly in his hand. The sticky blood dripped down his cut face. His brows resembled sharp swords, and his eyes were like the morning star.</p>
<p>He was a warrior that came from the lower realm, and he was younger than most people present. Yet, with his cultivation level at the early stages of the Heaven Ascension realm, he was catching up to Princess Xue'er, who the White Fox clan had nurtured with full dedication. Even though he had yet to chase up to her, he was already at the pinnacle of a what a genius was!</p>
<p>Every matter had its pinnacle, and the moment's pinnacle was undoubtedly Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>He was in his heyday, a young hero. With a three-foot sword, he slew everything!</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples present did not even speak. Bai Yueqing griped his fan, as though he wished to snap the fan.</p>
<p>As for the Luo clan disciples, they were extremely excited. After all, Yi Yun and them were considered clansmen. When against something foreign, the Luo clan would still be rather united.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Yi is too powerful!”</p>
<p>“That's right. After the Luo Divine Hall trials end, Junior Brother Yi's reputation will definitely spread throughout the royal capital. When the time comes, his fame might be matchless. Probably many large factions will throw olive branches at Junior Brother Yi, and some powerful family clans might even want to betroth their daughters to Junior Brother Yi!”</p>
<p>As the Luo clan disciples spoke of this, many were feeling envious. Such a life was truly something to yearn for!</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, what was this about…?”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu looked at a speechless Elder Shi, who was still staring blankly at the projection's Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He had just commented on Yi Yun's battle arrogantly on account of his seniority. He was certain that Yi Yun would not find a way to crack the domain, but in a blink of an eye, the Nine-tailed Domain was shattered.</p>
<p>Elder Shi was at a loss for words. He found it fortuitous that he had made the judgment through a voice transmission with Elder Duanmu, and he had not said so publicly. If not, his old face would probably not be able to withstand such a blow.</p>
<p>“I don't know as well. This punk has truly exceeded my expectations.” The corner of Elder Shi's lips twitched as the wrinkles on his face heaved. He believed that he was well-read, but he truly could not understand what had happened. This was the first time that it had happened in his long tenure as guardian of the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>“It's truly odd. I've seen so many geniuses, Luo clan geniuses, who have gone further in the Fey Refining Rock array than Princess White Fox and also being younger than Yi Yun. I have even guided a few of them, but for me to be completely wrong, to the point of not even understanding what had happened, it's truly a first.” Elder Shi murmured.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu said, “Indeed, it's true that there were others who were more talented than Yi Yun in the Luo clan's history, but when it comes to the person with the fastest improvement, Yi Yun is probably ranked first. Senior Brother, for Yi Yun to come this far, could it be that he had truly gained insights from that mysterious Fey God Stone?”</p>
<p>“About that…” Elder Shi felt as though his heart nearly skipped a beat.</p>
<p>That's impossible!</p>
<p>While the two Elders were engaging in a voice transmission conversation, the other White Fox clan and Luo clan disciples had similar thoughts.</p>
<p>What did Yi Yun comprehend over the past seven years? From the looks of it, it was definitely not as simple as awakening his Sword of Will!</p>
<p>But thankfully, Yi Yun's absurdity had its limits.</p>
<p>Yi Yun may have slain the fourth Ancient Fey in his battle, but his Yuan Qi had dropped significantly. It was already less than 70%.</p>
<p>With his Yuan Qi decreasing so drastically, he clearly lacked the strength to battle the fifth Ancient Fey any further.</p>
<p>“During his battle with the fourth Ancient Fey, Yi Yun had pulled out all the stops. Even if he still had 100% of his stamina, it would be difficult for him to beat the fifth Ancient Fey, not to mention that he has less than 70% of his stamina left.”</p>
<p>“That's right, even a tiny drop in stamina will result in his attacks being far less sharp than before. For Yi Yun's stamina to drop below 70%, it means he fought too desperately. Now, against the fifth Ancient Fey, Yi Yun's offensive and defensive power would only be 70% of the amount he had while he was battling the fourth Ancient Fey. As for the fifth Ancient Fey, its strength is several times stronger than the fourth Ancient Fey. As a result of this, he will probably last a brief moment before being defeated.”</p>
<p>As people began having such thoughts, they saw the Nine-tailed White Fox's corpse disappear. Even the fox blood that had dyed Yi Yun's body red disappeared as well.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had two minutes to meditate and regular his breathing, but the amount he could recover in two minutes was completely trivial when it came to fighting the fifth Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Just as people came to this realization, a Luo clan disciple suddenly shouted, “Look at Princess White Fox!”</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Everyone looked over towards the projection by the side. The scene had zoomed out. The dark blue sky had already turned into a bluish-purple sea of…lightning!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox stepped through the void as her silver hair flared upwards, as though she was a goddess descending into the world.</p>
<p>As though she was fated to rule over heavenly armies, she pointed her sword towards the sky. Thousands of divine lightning were invoked by Princess White Fox's sword!</p>
<p>Countless lightning bolts gathered around her until it took up a substantial form. A sword that seemed to make up of thousands of bolts cleaved down at the Fey dragon!</p>
<p>This power surged out of the Fey Refining Rock array's projection. It was nearly suffocating to the elites present. It was too terrifying!</p>
<p>They knew that Princess Xue'er had a Body of Lightning Spirit. She was extremely well-versed in lightning laws. But before this, Princess Xue'er did not use much of her lightning laws.</p>
<p>That also meant that Princess White Fox was conserving her strength from the very beginning. Even against the fourth Fey dragon, Princess White Fox did not use her full strength. Instead, she used a battle strategy that conserved the most amount of Yuan Qi, in preparation for the fifth battle!</p>
<p>Right from the beginning, Princess White Fox had already treated the fifth battle as a goal! Now, she was expending all her Yuan Qi without any reservations so as to use all her strength!</p>
<p>In that case, Princess White Fox…might even be able to defeat the fifth Ancient Fey!</p>
<p>Upon realizing this, the White Fox disciples turned excited.</p>
<p>Defeat the fifth Ancient Fey? It was exciting just thinking of it!</p>
<p>“Princess, you're invincible!” A White Fox clan youth, who worshiped Princess Xue'er, could not help but shout. His eyes were filled with an agitated glimmer!</p>
<p>In the mortal world, there were actors that were idolized by others or worshiped to the point of madness, so what more a warrior's world? Martial arts was not acting, but the fundamental foundation of a warrior's world. Who was she? A perfect proud daughter of heaven, a princess who had excellent talent. She was outstanding in every way. There was probably members of the White Fox clan who were willing to die for her.</p>
<p>The battle was more intense than ever! In Princess White Fox's exhilarating battle with the Fey dragon, she could do it without worries. There was no need for her to conserve her stamina as well. She could go all out.</p>
<p>For such a fantastic and interesting battle, even the Luo clan disciples could not help but shower praises on her. Furthermore, they were infected by Princess White Fox's lofty and mighty appearance. They could not help but cheer for her!</p>
<p>This was the pinnacle of one's life. If it were said that every matter had its pinnacle, now was the pinnacle that belonged to Princess White Fox. This pinnacle had even exceeded Yi Yun's!</p>
<p>“The Fey dragon has been injured! And it doesn't look light! Princess White Fox has managed to severely injure the fifth Fey dragon!”</p>
<p>“The intense battle has lasted for ninety seconds. What terrifying endurance. Princess White Fox's bloodline is truly powerful. Despite going through four battles, Princess White Fox is still able to conserve so much of her stamina.”</p>
<p>The ninety-second battle made everyone hold their breaths. At this moment, a Luo clan disciple suddenly said, “Junior Brother Yi's meditation is over. He is about to challenge the fifth Ancient Fey as well!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciple, who spoke, sounded slightly agitated. But compared to Princess White Fox's all out battle with the fifth Fey dragon, there were fewer people who paid attention to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Only when the Luo clan disciple spoke did others look over. Indeed Yi Yun had already stood up from his meditation and ascended into mid-air.</p>
<p>Chapter 912: 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence</p>
<p>With his two minutes of resting time over, the scene in front of Yi Yun was still the deep blue sky and endless clouds.</p>
<p>“Choose your opponent!” The emotionless voice of the array resounded in Yi Yun's ear.</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I choose the… Nine-tailed White Fox!”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The clouds opened up as the gigantic head of the White Fox emerged from the clouds. Its pair of black eyes were cold and emotionless as they reflected Yi Yun's face.</p>
<p>At the moment the fifth Ancient Fey — the Nine-tailed White Fox whose strength escalated once again — appeared, it was like it had become the only thing that existed in this world.</p>
<p>The turbulent aura from its body was like roaring waves, hitting Yi Yun's body and mind.</p>
<p>Yi Yun clenched the long sword in his hand. This was his final battle in the Fey Refining Rock array!</p>
<p>“Why is Yi Yun's opponent still my White Fox clan's ancestor?” Bai Yueqing frowned slightly.</p>
<p>As the Nine-tailed White Fox was the White Fox clan's totem, Bai Yueqing found it uncomfortable for it to be used as an opponent in the Fey Refining Rock array. Previously, Bai Yueqing was questioning if the Ancient Fey that Yi Yun had slain was too weak, resulting in Elder Shi changing the Ranyi Fish to the Nine-tailed White Fox. Bai Yueqing could only blame himself. Why did he have to shoot his mouth? But now… it was happening again?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing looked at Elder Duanmu, but Elder Duanmu threw up his hands and said, “Don't look at me. Yi Yun chose the Nine-tailed White Fox himself. It has nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun chose it?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing faltered for a moment. He did not choose a weak Ancient Fey, but he ended up choosing the powerful Nine-tailed White Fox? Did Yi Yun find it insufferable enough? Although Yi Yun had won the previous battle, it was a Pyrrhic victory. If he were fighting the Ranyi Fish, how could he have expended that much energy?</p>
<p>“Your Highness, it might have something to do with Yi Yun knowing that it's impossible for him to kill the fifth Ancient Fey, so he's going for broke. By choosing the Nine-tailed White Fox, it might look better even if he were to lose.” Someone from the White Fox clan said.</p>
<p>But Bai Yueqing harrumphed.</p>
<p>“Even if he knows he will lose, choosing a weaker one will reduce his suffering. Unless he plans to admit defeat straight away… If not, once the battle begins, he might be severely injured by the Nine-tailed White Fox and it might even affect his future cultivation.” Bai Yueqing said lightly.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he was hoping that Yi Yun would not be defeated too early. That would be too boring.</p>
<p>“That punk! For him to dare choose the Nine-tailed White Fox as his fifth Ancient Fey, he really doesn't know how the word death is written.”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing slowly opened his hand fan, seemingly restoring his usual calm composure. After all, in the projection scene to the side, Bai Yueqing had seen the hope of Princess White Fox slaying the fifth Fey dragon. Even if she failed, she was able to severely injure the fifth Fey dragon at least. The gap between Princess White Fox and Yi Yun would still be large.</p>
<p>Just as Bai Yueqing was thinking this, he noticed Yi Yun, who was in the middle of the dark blue sky, wave his hand, discarding rows of flying sabers.</p>
<p>The shiny flying sabers shimmered with fearsome cold beams, but they were discarded just like that.</p>
<p>“Splash! Splash!”</p>
<p>As the flying sabers dropped into the sea, they stirred up tiny ripples but those quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>“He even discarded his sabers?”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was stunned. Yi Yun had lost more than a hundred flying sabers in the fourth battle, and logically speaking, he should have requested for the corresponding number of flying sabers to mend the saber array from the Fey Refining Rock array. But now, he had even discarded the remaining flying sabers?</p>
<p>“Is Yi Yun planning on throwing in the towel?” A White Fox disciple said.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing frowned and said, “That punk sure is crafty. With his stamina weakened, he will directly admit defeat. Although this can prevent risk of severe injuries, it will weaken his martial resolve. His martial resolve will lack the warrior's courage against all odds and an indomitable momentum!”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing was feeling extremely upset. Yi Yun had just shown off a moment ago, but now by admitting defeat, he could retire after winning some merit. All the benefits were his!</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Yi Yun was planning to admit defeat, what did he summon the Nine-tailed White Fox for? Was he teasing him?</p>
<p>Just as Bai Yueqing was having such thoughts, he suddenly saw a cold glimmer appear in Yi Yun's palm.</p>
<p>Those are… flying sabers!?</p>
<p>“Cha! Cha! Cha!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun stretched his hand out as flying sabers shot out from Yi Yun's body as they floated midair, with their tips pointing in every direction.</p>
<p>There was an estimated hundred sabers.</p>
<p>He did not discard all of them?</p>
<p>What was going on? Yi Yun had 800 flying sabers, and he had deliberately discarded about 700, leaving a hundred behind. What was he planning to do?</p>
<p>A typical saber array would be flawed at the moment it lacked a single saber. But now, there was less than 10% of Yi Yun's saber array left. How was this even usable!?</p>
<p>Just as people were feeling perplexed, the Nine-tailed White Fox roared and attacked Yi Yun!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox would not wait for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At the moment that the Nine-tailed White Fox attacked, a halo expanded around its body. The surrounding space was distorted by the divine light.</p>
<p>It was a domain again!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox was conjuring its domain!</p>
<p>This was the domain of the fifth Nine-tailed White Fox, a domain that was on a completely different level to the fourth Nine-tailed White Fox's. Yi Yun had expended 30% of his stamina and his all in order to crack the Nine-tailed Domain. It was nearly impossible for him to crack a stronger domain this time!</p>
<p>The domain expanded and enveloped Yi Yun. Once he was devoured by the domain, the outcome was decided!</p>
<p>At this moment, no one knew what Yi Yun was planning to do. He did not dodge the domain, nor did he throw in the towel.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>In an instant, Yi Yun's Yuan Qi suddenly burst out, like it was a torrential flood that surged in all directions.</p>
<p>People could sense that Yi Yun's energy was rapidly being depleted!</p>
<p>The remaining 70% of Yuan Qi was sucked out in a split second till almost nothing was left, as all of it surged towards —</p>
<p>The hundred flying sabers in front of him!</p>
<p>The hundred flying sabers were injected with immense energy as their bodies began to hum and vibrate, as though they were about to explode!</p>
<p>Yi Yun held his hands together as the hundred flying sabers flew towards Yi Yun's body. At this moment, they were gathered around him, and mysterious runes emerged on the saber blades. These runes were dark and moving in and out of existence. As though no matter how one focused on them, it was impossible to see the runic patterns on the runes!</p>
<p>A hundred flying sabers merged as one, forming a circular shaped saber array that spun at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>Yi Yun used all his energy to push the circular saber array out!</p>
<p>Weng!</p>
<p>Space seemed to tear apart as the saber array smashed towards the Nine-tailed White Fox's gigantic head!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox had already been conjured. Inside the Nine-tailed Domain, as long as the domain was not taken down, the Nine-tailed White Fox would nearly be invincible!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox roared as it sent a claw at the flying sabers. The saber array was clearly reflected on the spinning saber array.</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>With an explosion, the saber array shattered along with the noise!</p>
<p>The hundred flying sabers shattered under the powerful explosion!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, everyone held their breaths. It was over!? That was a strike that drained Yi Yun of his remaining 70% energy?</p>
<p>In a thousandth of the time that it took to blink, the thought that just aroused to which they did not even have time to react, they saw that faint black runic lines left behind where the shattered saber array was.</p>
<p>The saber array had been broken, but the mysterious runes augmented on the blades were left behind?</p>
<p>The runes, when aligned together, were still in the shape of a circular disk. It looked like a gigantic wheel!</p>
<p>The wheel was revolving. Despite the fierce collision, its rotation speed became uncannily slo, as though time had come to a standstill.</p>
<p>“Aw—”</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox let out a scream as it clawed at the wheel, but the moment its claw touched the wheel, its claw was torn apart by the slowly revolving wheel!</p>
<p>Flesh and bone separated as blood splattered everywhere!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox screamed. The look of fear finally flashed in the depths of its cold and emotionless black pupils. It wanted to retreat, but the black wheel seemed to traverse across space and time, appearing right in front of the Nine-tailed White Fox's body.</p>
<p>“Wo! Wo! Wo!”</p>
<p>As though a spatial black hole had formed inside the Nine-tailed White Fox's body, the Nine-tailed White Fox, which had merged as one with the Nine-tailed Domain, had its body minced by the spatial black hole. Its innards burst as blood sprayed everywhere!</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed Domain began to tremble violently. It was on the verge of collapse!</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed Domain exploded, while the Nine-tailed White Fox's body was torn apart. Minced meat mixed with fresh blood flew in every direction.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who had completely exhausted himself, was sent flying back from the blast. His body was covered by the fox's blood and minced meat. It was like he had crawled out of Shura Hell.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun fell into the sea. The sea had been dyed red. His last bit of energy was only sufficient to ensure that his body floated on the surface, or he would have sunk.</p>
<p>He floated on the surface of the sea in a sprawl, welcoming the sensations of the red rain — the blood of the Nine-tailed White Fox — that bombarded him.</p>
<p>Pada! Pada! The blood that was still warm had a special feeling when it hit his face.</p>
<p>It was over!</p>
<p>The fifth battle was also Yi Yun's final fight. The moment the battle began, Yi Yun used his trump card.</p>
<p>As with the remaining Yuan Qi he had left, Yi Yun was only able to barely summon the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. If he had used any other move before summoning the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, it would make it difficult for him to have any more Yuan Qi left to continue on.</p>
<p>And it was because of this, Yi Yun did not even have the strength to move his fingers after that one strike.</p>
<p>He looked to be in like he was a sorry state, but outside the Fey Refining Rock array, the scene of him weakly floating above the red sea surface was forever engraved in the minds of the crowd. Even many years later, after some of these young elites had achieved greatness, they still found it difficult to forget this scene —</p>
<p>The youth that used flying sabers had used a hundred flying sabers that were remnants of a whole to kill the fifth Nine-tailed White Fox that appeared in the Fey Refining Rock array in a near-impossible situation.</p>
<p>How did he do it?</p>
<p>There was total silence. Even Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi stared at the projection with their mouths agape. There was no reaction to what had just happened.</p>
<p>And beside Yi Yun's projection, where Princess White Fox was fighting, it was already at its most intense moment. However, no one was paying any attention to her, like they had forgotten about her.</p>
<p>In their vision, there was only Yi Yun, who was facing the sky while he bathed in the rain of blood.</p>
<p>Regardless of how intense Princess White Fox's battle was, it was not as shocking as Yi Yun's instant kill!</p>
<p>Yes, an instant kill. Against Yi Yun, the fifth Ancient Fey, which was so powerful that it made one lack the courage to resist, was… instantly killed!</p>
<p>Chapter 913: Outcome of Battle</p>
<p>As the cold seawater washed against Yi Yun's skin, Yi Yun experienced the raining blood while feeling an inexplicable sense of calm. It was most likely the comfortable feeling after experiencing a life and death battle.</p>
<p>This was the first time that Yi Yun used the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence in true combat. Throughout the entire battle, although he had only barely conjured a weakened form of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence at the final moment, Yi Yun's body seemed to attain a familiarity with the laws of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>He was taking advantage of the serenity of the moment to digest the realizations that he was receiving.</p>
<p>The blood rain quickly disappeared, but the smell of blood continued to linger in the air, as though there were strands of blood floating across his face from time to time.</p>
<p>Yi Yun refused the chance to battle the sixth Ancient Fey. In his present condition, he was already unable to carry on.</p>
<p>As such, after Yi Yun's Fey Refining Rock array battle ended, he was transported out of the independent space.</p>
<p>The moment he exited the Fey Refining Rock array, Yi Yun sensed everyone's gazes being fixed on him.</p>
<p>The gazes were extremely complex.</p>
<p>There were looks of shock, fear, envy, and worship. One strike would more or less result in some feelings of disbelief. The process of Yi Yun killing the fifth Ancient Fey was like a dream to them.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun had only slain the fourth Ancient Fey, the Luo clan disciples might have surrounded Yi Yun while congratulating him. But now, Yi Yun had instantly killed the fifth Ancient Fey. Furthermore, there was a killing aura emanating from Yi Yun's body. Although the Nine-tailed White Fox's blood had vanished, for some reason or another, people still felt a faint sense of blood lingering around Yi Yun. Such an aura prevented anyone, even the Luo clan disciples, to make conversation with Yi Yun. The area fell into temporary silence.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Shi was the first to speak. He said, “Yi Yun, your results in the Fey Refining Rock array are impressive. The rewards promised by the clan will be handed to you very soon.”</p>
<p>Rewards!</p>
<p>Upon hearing Elder Shi mention rewards, the young elites present were filled with envy. The rewards were no trifling matter. All the Fey empires and large sects of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven would gather the best resources to nurture the geniuses under them. Now, Yi Yun had clearly reached the point where the Luo clan would focus on nurturing him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senior.” Yi Yun said, while having walked to a corner. He wanted to further ponder on the insights gained from the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>And at this moment in time, the deadlock in Princess White Fox's battle had broken. Princess White Fox, who had used all her strength, had managed to defeat the fifth Fey dragon!</p>
<p>However, Princess White Fox had barely managed victory. Not only had she expended all her stamina, she was also severely injured. Her tenacity was the only thing that kept her going to slay the fifth Fey dragon with great difficulty.</p>
<p>If this were any time in the past, the White Fox disciple would have shouted out in excitement while receiving Princess White Fox, as though they were receiving their goddess of war.</p>
<p>But now, although they were cheering for her, it was much more subdued. This resulted in the first few people to cheer realizing the lack of an atmosphere. Seeing how it was meaningless to cheer, their voices also lowered.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox, who was originally stunning in every way, had only managed to equal Yi Yun's results.</p>
<p>But in terms of killing speed, as well as the shock of annihilating the Nine-tailed White Fox into a blood mist with one strike, Princess White Fox was far inferior to Yi Yun. As such, the White Fox clan themselves lacked the mood to even cheer.</p>
<p>After slaying the fifth Fey dragon, Princess White Fox had already reached her limit.</p>
<p>“Choose your opponent!” After the fifth Fey dragon died, the cold voice of the array resounded in Princess White Fox's ears.</p>
<p>“I give up.”</p>
<p>Princess White Fox took a deep breath. She was already a spent force, so it was meaningless to persist on.</p>
<p>With a flash, Princess White Fox appeared in the hall.</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone's gazes was focused on Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had an indifferent character to begin with. She walked her own martial path, and she did not concern herself with how others looked at her. But even so, she guessed that her slaying of the fifth Ancient Fey should have astounded the White Fox clan geniuses.</p>
<p>But from the looks of it, their reactions seemed to be a bit different from what she expected.</p>
<p>A few White Fox disciples were cheering for her, but there were people who had odd looks.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was slightly surprised. What had just happened?</p>
<p>She looked around and she saw Jian Zhu, Wufeng, the Shadow Twins, Yi Yun, Luo Mo and company, who had all entered the Fey Refining Rock array with her. They had all come out. She was the last, and also the one that had lasted the longest.</p>
<p>This was not odd since she fought the longest, the number of Ancient Fey that she killed was most likely the most as well.</p>
<p>As for the others, it was not Princess White Fox being haughty, but according to the difficulty of the array, she was absolutely sure that other than her, the rest could not even slain the fourth Ancient Fey, much less the fifth. It exceeded the limits of their strength.</p>
<p>Being able to kill the first three Ancient Fey was already an excellent outcome.</p>
<p>These people having been eliminated ahead of her was within her expectations, but… why did they have such weird expressions?</p>
<p>Furthermore, she noticed that some people were looking at Yi Yun, which made her involuntarily glance at Yi Yun as well. Yi Yun had expended a great deal of energy. His Yuan Qi was nearly drained, but he was uninjured. This shocked Princess White Fox. Typically, with the stamina of a warrior being drained to such levels, be it offensive or defensive strength, they would be weakened, so it was not easy to be unharmed.</p>
<p>“Xue'er, you did well.” Bai Yueqing said with a sullen face.</p>
<p>However, his words did not sound anything like he was praising Princess White Fox. Clearly, he was in a terrible mood.</p>
<p>“It was alright. My strength can only reach this stage. There should still be progress in the future… ” Princess White Fox answered with some questions on her mind. She looked at Nongying and transmitted her voice, “What just happened? How many Ancient Fey did Jian Zhu kill?”</p>
<p>Could it be that Jian Zhu's results had exceeded her expectations, which resulted in this effect?</p>
<p>“Three.” Nongying answered slowly with a voice transmission.</p>
<p>“That result is normal. The fourth Ancient Fey is indeed rather difficult. It's not surprising to not succeed in killing it. What about the others?” Princess White Fox had casually asked, but she never expected Nongying to give her an answer that left her astounded.</p>
<p>Nongying answered, “Sister, Wufeng and I were nothing to talk about, but for Yi Yun, he… also killed the fifth Ancient Fey, just a while ago… ”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's eyebrows pricked up. “Yi Yun killed the fifth Ancient Fey?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… he was faster than you… Actually… he only used one move, instantly killing the fifth Ancient Fey. Besides that… ” When Nongying reached this point, she revealed a wry smile, “What he killed was the Nine-tailed White Fox that had conjured its Nine-tailed Domain… ”</p>
<p>The Nine-tailed White Fox that had conjured its domain? An instant kill with one move?</p>
<p>Princess White Fox was completely flabbergasted. She looked at Yi Yun in disbelief. Her cherry-shaped lips opened slightly, and they did not close for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Chapter 914: Death Reclusion</p>
<p>Anyone who killed the third round Ancient Fey onwards in the Fey Refining Rock array would receive rewards.</p>
<p>However, these rewards were nothing much considered to the reward given to the person who came in first.</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Princess White Fox had both defeated the fifth Ancient Fey, but Yi Yun had finished earlier. With this reason, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, who were biased towards the Luo clan disciples, obviously determined that Princess White Fox had narrowly lost. Hence, Yi Yun clinched first place.</p>
<p>The reward for being first in the Fey Refining Rock was an Ancient Fey bone. But even Ancient Fey bones were of different qualities.</p>
<p>The Ancient Fey bone Yi Yun previously obtained at the Black Wind Valley trials was a peripheral part of the Ancient Fey's skeleton. The amount of Ancient Fey energy it contained was not much.</p>
<p>Better Ancient Fey bones came from areas such as the sternum or spine — core parts of the Ancient Fey's torso. These spots were where large amounts of energy of the Ancient Fey were deposited in the skeleton.</p>
<p>As for the Ancient Fey bone rewarded to the person who came in first, it was also a peripheral part. The only difference was that it contained a tiny bit of bone marrow.</p>
<p>An Ancient Fey's skeleton contained immense energy, but the essence of an Ancient Fey did not lie in its skeleton but in its blood marrow.</p>
<p>After an Ancient Fey's death, its blood marrow would dissipate into the ether, returning to the Universe. Only an extremely tiny portion would be left within the skeleton.</p>
<p>This reward was something all geniuses from large family clans would desire. Their family clans might be influential, but it was also not easy obtaining an Ancient Fey bone that contained bone marrow, much less giving it to them.</p>
<p>The better the reward Yi Yun obtained, the worse Bai Yueqing's mood became.</p>
<p>The reason he came to the Luo clan trials was because he wanted to see Princess White Fox's performance so as to get some reassurance for his bet.</p>
<p>However, before he even received any assurance, he ended up getting so infuriated that he had to suppress his anger. The suppression nearly caused him to suffer from internal injuries.</p>
<p>“Because of the Third Prince's arrival, my Luo clan's disappointing disciples must have been imperceptibly motivated. Finally, they managed to squeeze out a bit of potential. Thank you Third Prince, it must have been hard on you.” Elder Shi said.</p>
<p>The corner of Bai Yueqing's eyes twitched. Elder Shi might be a man of few words, but he had a strong sense of retaliatory streak in him. All Bai Yueqing had done was to question if the Ranyi Fish that Yi Yun had chosen was not as powerful as the Fey dragon, but this remark had been constantly on Elder Shi's mind.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, not really…”</p>
<p>“I wonder how many more days does Third Prince want to stay?” Elder Shi said again.</p>
<p>Stay further? Bai Yueqing no longer had the mood. If he stayed any longer, he felt like he would really suffer a mental collapse.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing quickly bade farewell. When he came, he came swaggering, but when he left, he left in a hurry. His spirit cruiser quickly tore through the void and vanished above the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi stood in midair while watching this happen. Elder Duanmu stroked his beard and said, “Senior Brother, the closer it is to your breakthrough reclusion, the more I find you becoming petty.”</p>
<p>“Before a reclusion, one's state of mind is extremely important. One should act as one pleases. Furthermore, this reclusion will last to my death if I fail to break through. Even the Heavens do not know if I'll be able to come out alive. In that case, why must I worry over so much?” Elder Shi said.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's lips quivered but he did not say anything. All he did was let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“There's no need for you to sigh. Although I am determined to enter a death reclusion, it is still in preparation. I've been pursing martial arts my entire life. Being a Supremacy is the ravine that stops me in my martial path. One is willing to die in the evening if the truth could be heard in the morning. As long as I probe it, I'll die without regrets.” Elder Shi said.</p>
<p>“No wonder you think so highly of that kid's martial heart.” Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>Elder Shi did not say a thing. In the past, he only found Yi Yun mildly interesting, but after Yi Yun killed the fifth Ancient Fey, he began to truly pay close attention to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“The little fox isn't bad too. Unfortunately, she's not from our Luo clan.” Elder Duanmu added, “But, it's no big deal. She can definitely become one of us.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu stroked his beard as a smile flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>This time, Elder Shi opened his mouth. “Yea.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>White Fox training ground. Celestial Platform.</p>
<p>The Celestial Platform was made of countless floating rocks.</p>
<p>This independent space was extremely special. It did not have any land to it. Rocks of all shapes and sizes were floating in the air. The small ones were the size of millstones, just enough for one person to stand on, while the big ones were hundreds of feet wide.</p>
<p>The rocks that formed the Celestial Platform were powered by an array formation, forming a ladder platform that reached the heavens. The higher one went, the more difficult the trial became.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er had already broken through to the 19th level!</p>
<p>This was a boulder about a hundred feet across. The higher one went on the Celestial Platform, the more chaotic the laws became.</p>
<p>The difficulty here had already halted the progress of most of the trial-takers!</p>
<p>Only a few trial-takers, for example, Xuan Junyue, were still struggling in the 15th and 16th levels.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of hope for Xuan Junyue to reach the 17th level.</p>
<p>He looked up at the boulder. Although it was just the distance of one level, every level up had a steep rise in difficulty in the Celestial Platform.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er was sitting on a boulder at the 19th level to meditate.</p>
<p>The disciples who were lacking in strength could not even sit here properly. The chaotic laws might even cause their Yuan Qi circulation to turn turbulent, causing them to die by exploding.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was sitting here, dressed in a thin dress. Her hair had turned fire-red in color, while her pupils had turned scarlet red, as though they were dancing flames.</p>
<p>The 19th level was somewhat difficult for Luo Huo'er. However, awakening her bloodline made it trivial.</p>
<p>This was because her Ancient Fey bloodline was extremely rich. The Ancient Fey were born out of the Universe itself, so their insights into laws were very high.</p>
<p>Everyone else was trying their best to move up another level, but Luo Huo'er was extremely laid back. She was in no hurry and was even planning on sitting here for some time.</p>
<p>Since no one could exceed her, why did she need to rush herself? She might as well take a good rest.</p>
<p>At this moment, a fire-red charm suddenly flashed in front of her.</p>
<p>The Celestial Platform was a training ground of the White Fox clan, but as a princess of the Luo clan, a heir designate, Luo Huo'er obviously enjoyed certain privileges. This voice transmission charm was one of her privileges.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was somewhat surprised. What matter was so urgent that a voice transmission had to be sent to her during her trial?</p>
<p>At the moment the voice transmission charm shattered, a voice entered Luo Huo'er's ears.</p>
<p>“What, Little Yun is that awesome!?”</p>
<p>The information in the voice transmission was regarding Yi Yun's performance at the Luo Divine Hall's trials.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stared in surprise. Yi Yun had killed the fifth Ancient Fey using a lesser time than Princess White Fox!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had seen Princess White Fox's talent. Princess White Fox was definitely no ordinary person, so although Luo Huo'er was proud, she still thought highly of an opponent like Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>“Little Yun actually beat Princess White Fox…” Luo Huo'er found it incredible.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had truly given her one surprise after another after their reunion in the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>“Little Yun did very well. That male seductive fox will definitely lose the bet he suggested. Who knows if that little fox princess will end up having Little Yun to accompany her on her travels. I wonder what expression a particular brother of mine will have when he learns of this matter.” Luo Huo'er's delicate face revealed a sinister smile.</p>
<p>However, as she smiled, she suddenly smacked her palms.</p>
<p>“Aiyah, that's bad! If this keeps going, what happens if I were to lose to Little Yun? Wouldn't that be so embarrassing? I have to rush up!”</p>
<p>The White Fox Elder that was monitoring the situation of the trial suddenly sensed motion on the 20th level of the Celestial Platform!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er reached the 20th level?</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples, who had already suffered terrible mental setbacks, immediately noticed that Luo Huo'er's strength suddenly rose sharply…Could it be that she was not using all her strength previously?</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples had tears flowing down their faces!</p>
<p>They were also elites of the White Fox clan, but participating in a trial with Luo Huo'er was masochism. Those who did not have a resolute mind might receive such a heavy blow that tore them to pieces.</p>
<p>Chapter 915: Blood Dragon's Blood Marrow</p>
<p>Two days after the Fey Refining Rock trial was over, Yi Yun suddenly received a voice transmission from Elder Duanmu.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall was extremely palatial, and one of its many levels was the Astral Palace where the Luo clan disciples cultivated.</p>
<p>And the summoning led Yi Yun to the seventh level.</p>
<p>The seventh level of the Luo Divine Hall was very different to the Astral Palace.</p>
<p>It looked extremely extensive, as though the place was boundless. Floating in the air were countless golden dots of light which were constantly in motion. Yi Yun saw a dot of light stop in front of him and he was surprised to discover that the dots of light were actually tiny golden birds. Each one was wrapped in a layer of golden light as they flew around.</p>
<p>“I wonder if the birds are living creatures… Fascinating.” Yi Yun stood in the main hall and he watched them while reflecting over the sight.</p>
<p>“This seventh level is an independent space, named Treasure Pavilion.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly saw phantom figures flash in front of him as two people appeared. He hurriedly saluted them, “Greetings to Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi.”</p>
<p>“There's no need for such decorum. Oh?” Elder Duanmu's vision swept across Yi Yun's body and he said, “You have already recovered completely. Your cultivation realm has increased slightly as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Yi Yun responded.</p>
<p>Although he wasn't injured when he slew the fifth Ancient Fey, he had used all of his power to release a weak 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. All of his Yuan Qi was consumed, which meant that Yi Yun could not even move.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu had previously witnessed Yi Yun's recovery rate, so he laughed. “Although you are a human, your recovery rate is still pretty good. The only problem is that your physique is slightly lacking. I know that you have absorbed the Heaven Devouring Wyrm's Fey bone in the past, but the quality of that Fey bone was terrible.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu spoke frankly, while Yi Yun revealed a trace of helplessness. Not only was his physique bad, his cultivation realm was low as well. He could barely conjure a weakened 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. Furthermore, using it once would drain all of his strength.</p>
<p>“The reward this time is an Ancient Fey with blood marrow. After giving it to you, quickly absorb it and strive to perform well in the remaining trials.” Elder Duanmu now thought very highly of Yi Yun as well. The reasons that the Elders remained in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven to man the Luo Divine Hall was firstly to gain nomological insights while being in reclusion, and secondly, to nurture more talents for the Luo clan. Years ago, they too had gone through the same path.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Elders. However, I plan to enter reclusive cultivation in the Primordial Space immediately following that.” Yi Yun said.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu faltered slightly, “Reclusive cultivation? For how long?”</p>
<p>“I don't know.” Yi Yun shook his head. If he entered reclusion in the Primordial Space, years might pass without him even knowing. If he was disturbed during this period, it would greatly affect the outcome.</p>
<p>“I see… The Luo Divine Hall does has the Primordial Space as its core. The value gained from cultivating in there is the highest. There will be some losses incurred if you do not participate in the trials after this, but… it's still alright!”</p>
<p>Elder Shi gave it a thought and he said with a nod, “So what if you don't participate in them!? You are extremely talented, and the path of martial arts is full of vicissitudes. You have to know that there were even more geniuses in the past that possessed exceptional talent, and they were aided by great fate, but they eventually perished. This path is a very difficult one.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun drew a gasp and said, “I understand.”</p>
<p>He looked calm and determined. Back then, he was just an unimportant youth. From his climb upwards that began from the Cloud Wilderness, he already recognized the difficulty of the martial path.</p>
<p>Regardless of how difficult this path was, Yi Yun chose to continue forging ahead.</p>
<p>Within the Purple Crystal, the long-haired man and the red lotus woman who later appeared, they stood at a vantage point that was so much higher than where he was.</p>
<p>Was he able to use his own feet and hard work to reach where they stood and see what they saw?</p>
<p>“Since you want to enter reclusion, then you will not be given a blood marrow Ancient Fey bone.” Elder Shi said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was stunned. Not giving it to him?</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Shi followed up, “Yes, the rewards were meant to be given to you progressively along the way, but since you aren't participating in those trials, you will miss those rewards. If that's the case, I might as well give you the best one in one fell swoop. In the history of the Luo Divine Hall trials, such an item has only been handed out a few times. This is the highest reward in the Luo Divine Hall trials.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother… ” Elder Duanmu glanced at Elder Shi, but he eventually did not speak another word.</p>
<p>“Here!” Elder Shi beckoned with a stretched out hand.</p>
<p>A blood-red bird tore through the sky like lightning as it suddenly stood on Elder Shi's palm.</p>
<p>It was crimson red in color… Yi Yun had failed to discover the crimson bird out of the numerous golden birds here.</p>
<p>The bird emanated an extremely peculiar aura. As Yi Yun looked at it, he had the feeling that his heartbeat, blood flow, and Yuan Qi circulation were being induced by the bird, as though his entire being was in an extremely sublime rhythm.</p>
<p>At this moment, the bird suddenly chirped and it transformed into a blood-red crystal.</p>
<p>In the middle of the crystal, there was a line of blood that was constantly in flux, as though it possessed life.</p>
<p>“That is… ” Yi Yun's eyes stared intently at the crystal. He could sense the extremely unusual value of the crystal.</p>
<p>“This is the blood marrow of a degenerated Blood Dragon,” Elder Shi said. “You have previously been to Mt. Azure Billow's Black Wind Valley during the collective training? This is the blood marrow left behind by that degenerated Blood Dragon, a blood marrow that was in the dragon bone's vertebral keel.”</p>
<p>The degenerated Blood Dragon's blood marrow!?</p>
<p>Yi Yun drew a cold gasp.</p>
<p>After the degenerated Blood Dragon died, its flesh and blood's decomposition caused the place to become a forbidden ground where it nourished and produced blood specters. The power of its blood marrow was unimaginable!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had previously absorbed a Heaven Devouring Wyrm Fey bone, and although a Heaven Devouring Wyrm was a grade higher than a degenerated Blood Dragon, the value of its Fey bone was incomparable to a degenerated Blood Dragon's blood marrow!</p>
<p>“This blood marrow is one of the treasures of the Luo Divine Hall. Each one we give out depletes the limited stock we have. This wisp of blood marrow is of the highest quality. Its energy was preserved the best. But it would be even more difficult for you to absorb it with your poor physique. Take it and enter reclusion. How much you can absorb will depend on your destiny.” Elder Shi threw the crystal at Yi Yun. He had chosen to give it to Yi Yun, but it would depend on Yi Yun himself as to whether he could rise up as a dragon.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun caught the crystal, he felt as though the blood marrow in the crystal was alive. It was constantly in motion as though it would fly out of his hands at any time.</p>
<p>The best wisp of blood marrow — its value was probably unimaginable.</p>
<p>“The both of us are old. We do not know how many more years the Luo Divine Hall can be manned by us. Seeing how talent has been dwindling after the Luo clan's war… ” Elder Duanmu spoke midway before shaking his head and stopping.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at them, he felt that there was something between the lines of what Elder Duanmu had said.</p>
<p>Their strength and cultivation realm were like the clouds to him. It was something that numerous warriors yearned to reach.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun saw something different from their expressions.</p>
<p>“Thank you Elder Shi, thank you Elder Duanmu!” Yi Yun gave them a solemn salute.</p>
<p>Having come to the Luo clan, his feelings for the Luo clan was mostly due to Luo Huo'er as he had a friendship with her. Furthermore, Yi Yun was also in need to join a faction, so he had naturally chosen the Luo clan. Having received the goodwill of a faction, he obviously had to contribute back to them. And today, the feelings that the two Elders had for the Luo clan, as well as the expectations that they had for the Luo clan geniuses, had moved Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He gripped the crystal tightly. The hopes of the two Elders were embodied in the crystal.</p>
<p>Chapter 916: End, Departure</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall trials continued, but no one saw Yi Yun participating anymore.</p>
<p>After the Fey Refining Rock array evaluation, Yi Yun had become the idol of a good deal of the Luo clan disciples. When Elder Duanmu informed them that Yi Yun would enter reclusive cultivation and that he would no longer participate in the trials, the disciples were rather upset, but they felt envious at the same time.</p>
<p>To enter such a long reclusion proved that Yi Yun had reaped great benefits from the seven years of meditation and the Fey Refining Rock array. When he completely digested the benefits, his strength would definitely improve by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was much stronger than them already. To what extent would he reach after improving his strength? The potential already shown by Yi Yun made them scared to think any further.</p>
<p>“He was only cast in the limelight at the Fey Refining Rock array, and there he is, trying to hide away. He was actually able to clinch victory only with that strange move at the end. Without that strange move that instantly killed the Nine-tailed White Fox, Yi Yun's combat ability is far inferior to Her Highness'.”</p>
<p>“And in the following trials, there are tests on physique and bloodline, but he does not plan on participating. He is clearly worried that his physique and bloodline are inferior to Her Highness'.” Nongyue grumbled in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Although she knew in her heart that Yi Yun had beat Princess White Fox through the use of the strange move at the end, she knew that even without the move, Yi Yun could easily thrash her and her sister. This point left a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>However, when it came to the Fey race's bloodline, Nongyue was convinced that Yi Yun was absolutely inferior.</p>
<p>Just as Nongyue's voice faded, she saw her her elder sister, Nongying staring at her.</p>
<p>Nongyue stuck out her tongue and she hurriedly shut her mouth.</p>
<p>When Princess White Fox heard Elder Duanmu's words, there was a gentle flash in her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>He is going into reclusion… ?</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had been a top elite from a young age. She did not have a rival at a similar age other than Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox had obtained a detailed description of Yi Yun's battle with the fifth Nine-tailed White Fox from Nongying and Nongyue.</p>
<p>“I never got to witness that battle with my own eyes… I'll look forward to you coming out of reclusion.” Princess White Fox whispered.</p>
<p>Yi Yun may have entered reclusion, but couldn't she enhance her own strength as well?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Primordial Space.</p>
<p>A huge door that was so big that it went from the ground to the sky, and it isolated the Primordial Space from the outside world.</p>
<p>The entire Primordial Space was misty as a dead and bleak aura permeated it.</p>
<p>It was a dead world. The auric charms of the Fey Gods sealed in the Fey God Stones were the only evidence of the world's past existence. What was in here was life that had failed to fully evolve.</p>
<p>Silently sitting in front of the three mysterious Fey God Stones, Yi Yun closed his eyes tightly. He breathed silently, as though he had incorporated himself in the dead world.</p>
<p>His consciousness was fully projected on the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>He still saw the long-haired man on his entry into the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had already grasped the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, but it was not as advanced as the long-haired man's.</p>
<p>If the long-haired man was said to have mastered the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence to its end, Yi Yun was only just at the beginning.</p>
<p>With his Sword of Will, Yi Yun approached the long-haired man. At this moment, he saw the long-haired man push the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence out.</p>
<p>This casual push wrapped the heaven and earth. Countless nomological fragments flew past as thousands of phantom images of gods and demons appeared. Each one of them stepped on the ground and each one was a thousand feet tall.</p>
<p>A terrifying pressure smashed on Yi Yun like a mountain.</p>
<p>Yi Yun resisted against it with all his strength. Bam!</p>
<p>All of his Yuan Qi was drained as the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence shattered. His vision went black immediately!</p>
<p>“Phew&ndash; ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly opened his eyes as he noticed himself returning to the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>With his nomological insights increasing in profoundness every day, Yi Yun was able to see more things. And at the same time, the pressure inflicted on Yi Yun was higher.</p>
<p>A casual gesture of long-haired man produced nomological pressure that he could not withstand, even the Sword of Will was insufficient.</p>
<p>“Who knew that there would be such a change after entering the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone again. I'm still too weak.” Yi Yun muttered to himself, but his heart was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Being able to witness how the long-haired man did things was an opportunity that one could not ask for.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu's master was Supremacy Gulan, but Supremacy Gulan was in reclusion for extended periods of time. He seldom had the time to illustrate laws for Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>As for this long-haired man, his strength was far from what a Supremacy could compare with.</p>
<p>Where could one find such an opportunity?</p>
<p>“Strength should be increased first!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun wiped his interspatial ring as a crystal appeared in his palm.</p>
<p>Blood dragon's blood marrow.</p>
<p>This wisp of Fey dragon blood marrow seemed to sense something as it began to frantically scurry around the crystal.</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a deep breath.</p>
<p>'Kacha!' He crushed the crystal.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wisp of blood dragon's blood marrow flew out of the crystal.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was long prepared as he grabbed at it.</p>
<p>Immediately, the space surrounding the blood dragon's blood marrow was sealed. It struggled within the space, scurrying left and right, but it could not break out of the seal.</p>
<p>Its shape was constantly in flux, yet it failed to escape its shackles.</p>
<p>Yi Yun quietly regulated his breathing and a few days had passed unknowingly.</p>
<p>Only when his body recovered to its optimal state did Yi Yun open his eyes. Looking at the blood dragon's blood marrow, he beckoned at it.</p>
<p>The blood dragon's blood marrow was pulled by an invisible force as it constantly came closer to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>As though it realized that there were no means of escape, the blood dragon's blood marrow bloodlust suddenly surged as it shot straight at Yi Yun's glabella!</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not dodge!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>As though his body was thrown into a pool of magma, Yi Yun's body immediately heated up!</p>
<p>A degenerated blood dragon was violent and bloodthirsty by nature. Its blood marrow was one of the most violent and dangerous tonics.</p>
<p>However, it was only a wisp of blood marrow. If Yi Yun used his Yuan Qi to suppress it, he could slowly absorb it.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not choose to do so.</p>
<p>At the beginning, he was planning on circulating his Yuan Qi, but when the blood marrow surged into his own blood marrow, Yi Yun discovered that his pure Yang bloodline had been activated by the blood marrow's oppressive energy. He felt that his body had become a furnace.</p>
<p>And this blood marrow had become the flame that burned in the furnace, scorching his meridians.</p>
<p>Yi Yun closed his eyes tightly as sweat constantly oozed out of his forehead. Thunderous rumblings echoed out of his body. Even his clothes were burnt into ash. The blood vessels beneath his skin seemed to be dykes for flowing magma.</p>
<p>At this moment, anything that approached Yi Yun would be burnt into ash from the high temperatures emitted by Yi Yun;s body. His entire being was like a simmering volcano as a raging energy surged wantonly around his body.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Yi Yun would sweat. But slowly, his aura vanished. He turned into a rock once again, with the occasional flashing of his body indicating that he was still alive…</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, how far do you think that kid Yi Yun will be able to absorb the wisp of blood marrow?” In the Luo Divine Hall, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were watching Yi Yun in the mist through an array projection.</p>
<p>“A typical disciple can only absorb 10-20%. A talented disciple, maybe 30-40%. However, I can't be sure about Yi Yun. I heard that at Mt. Azure Billow, the effects of him absorbing the Ancient Fey bone were astounding. I believe that this kid will surprise me this time as well.” Elder Shi said lightly.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu shook his head and said, “Let's hope so. Senior Brother, by giving him the blood marrow so early, with his present cultivation realm, it is still too early to absorb such a blood marrow.”</p>
<p>“Early? It's not. Let him work hard to improve himself. The Luo clan's catastrophe has yet to pass… ”</p>
<p>Elder Shi appeared as though he was muttering to himself. With a wave of his hand, the projection in front of him disappeared…</p>
<p>Cultivation knew nothing about time. Year after year passed as the Luo Divine Hall trials were coming to an end.</p>
<p>Over the eighteen years, the Luo clan and White Fox clan elites had improved significantly. And after the first seven years, Yi Yun had never appeared again.</p>
<p>On the last day, two spirit cruisers tore through the void and appeared above the Luo Divine Hall. They were spirit cruisers at the Supremacy level. They were here to take the Luo clan and White Fox clan elites from the Primordial Empyrean Heaven back to their respective clans.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who had been in reclusion in the Primordial Space all this time, slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Having entered reclusion for eighteen years, it was an unprecedented experience for Yi Yun. Over the eighteen years, he was like a sharp enchanted sword. He was like a sword that had been placed in a scabbard to hide its sharpness.</p>
<p>His hair had grown so long that it reached the floor, spreading completely apart. Even though he was in the Primordial Space, Yi Yun could sense the environment outside and he knew that the spirit cruisers were here.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood up, his eyes like lightning in the dark night. With a thought, a Thousand Snow flying saber flew out of his interspatial ring, cutting his overly long hair.</p>
<p>It was time to leave the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>Chapter 917: Dao Manifestation Realm</p>
<p>With the existence of voice transmission charms and arrays, the proliferation of news was extremely fast.</p>
<p>Especially the Luo Divine Hall trials could be said to be highly-anticipated. It was a big deal to the Luo clan. Before the disciples that participated in the Luo Divine Hall trials returned, the results of the trials had proliferated at an astonishing speed in the royal capital.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had beaten Princess White Fox in the Fey Refining Rock array, crushing the Shadow Twins, Wufeng, and a Supremacy's disciple, Jian Zhu. Just this news along stirred quite a storm in the Luo clan royal capital!</p>
<p>Although they also learned that Yi Yun did not participate in any of the other tests of the Luo Divine Hall trials in the eleven years after them, it did not matter. Just the trial in the first seven years was enough to make Yi Yun famous in the royal capital.</p>
<p>In the past, Ran Xueyi and Luo Mo were influential figures in the upper circles of the royal capital, where their names were the talk of the town. But Luo Mo and Ran Xueyi were nothing compared to seclusive geniuses like Jian Zhu and the Shadow Twins.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he surpassed everyone else, including Princess White Fox, a publicly recognized genius. Yi Yun was even slightly younger than Princess White Fox. With his background as a commoner and his unparalleled speed at improving himself, he was now idolized by numerous youths in the royal capital, especially those from ordinary backgrounds.</p>
<p>The title of being first up till the seventh year of the Luo Divine Hall was something that eclipsed the four great young masters of the royal capital.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>From the moment that the results of the Luo Divine Hall trials were out, copious numbers of factions paid attention to the rankings. After all, only a couple of dozen people from the entire Luo clan's 196 states and the royal capital were ranked on the Luo Divine Hall Trials rankings every sixty years.</p>
<p>Large factions had their own machinations, while small factions had their own tricks. But whoever was ranked on the Luo Divine Hall trials' ranking, regardless if they ranked way below the top ten, would be clamored for by the entire Luo clan!</p>
<p>Many factions in the royal capital were trying to woo these people. Other than a few that could not be wooed, most of the other disciples would choose to stay in the royal capital.</p>
<p>As for the other 196 states, even the large family clans of those states would only get the leftovers.</p>
<p>As for those ranked in the top ten, there was nothing to think about them. They were exclusive to the Luo clan ancient family clans or even the Luo clan royal family.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Yi Yun returned to the royal capital, he disembarked the spirit cruiser, and accompanying him was Luo Fengling.</p>
<p>She ultimately failed to leave her name on the Luo Divine Hall trials rankings. She did not even get a chance to enter the Primordial Space. She could only meditate in front of the Ancient Fey stones outside, and those were obviously much more inferior to the Fey God Chaos Stones.</p>
<p>The outcome of not being ranked meant that Luo Fengling had to return to the Fire Cloud State. She needed to stay in the royal capital for a few days, and since Yi Yun and Luo Fengling were both warriors from the Fire Cloud State, and had a friendship, they naturally stayed together. Since Yi Yun's viscount residence was large, it could easily accommodate Luo Fengling's temporary lodging.</p>
<p>Considering how she had saved the severely injured Yi Yun eighteen years ago with a Fire Cloud State spirit cruiser, that scene was like a dream. Who would expect that such a youth would come this far?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's viscount residence was built near a mountain. When Yi Yun returned to his viscount residence, he saw many spirit beasts perched on the mountain behind the residence, with more than ten spirit vessels parked near it.</p>
<p>“Oh? This is… ”</p>
<p>When Yi Yun saw the spirit beasts and spirit vessels, he was surprised. He then saw a servant girl from the viscount residence welcome him like she was welcoming her master.</p>
<p>Upon asking the maidservant, he found out that the spirit beasts and spirit vessels were ridden by the ambassadors of large family clans who were here to visit Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They knew that Yi Yun was someone in Empress Xuan's camp, so no faction had the guts to steal from Empress Xuan. Even if they did, it was impossible to steal Yi Yun from her. However, they knew that they had to establish a good relationship with Yi Yun. They sent expensive gifts to express their congratulations on Yi Yun's results at the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>After learning of the reason, Yi Yun was also somewhat astonished. He never expected that being first in the first seven years of the Luo Divine Hall trials would create so much influence.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not being arrogant to the visitors, but it was because he did not have the time to entertain each and every one of them. Thankfully, Empress Xuan had included servants when she gave the viscount residence to him. He could just get the servants to deal with the affairs.</p>
<p>Luo Fengling was deeply envious of all of this. She felt that it was impossible for her to indulge in such a scene herself in whatever life she had left.</p>
<p>At this moment, a purplish-red voice transmission charm lit up in front of Yi Yun. It came from Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, some important guests came to the Luo clan royal palace a few days ago, it looks like they were discussing something.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, Father will be summoning all of the best participants of the trials to the royal palace. There will also be my brother, Crimson Firmament, Princess White Fox, as well as that male seductive fox named Bai Yueqing!”</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er spoke, her voice turned excited. Clearly, this girl looked forward to meeting Bai Yueqing. It was a good opportunity to smack Bai Yueqing in the face, so how could she miss it? Furthermore, Princess White Fox would have to travel with Yi Yun! Luo Huo'er was eager to see the expression on Crimson Firmament's face.</p>
<p>“Oh? His Majesty is summoning us?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised. As the leader of the entire Luo clan dynasty, Emperor Luo was not someone who was easily seen. Even the top cultivators of the Luo Divine Hall trials that happened after this one might not have the chance to meet Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>It was unknown what the legendary Emperor Luo was like… Even figures like Empress Luo and Empress Xuan had to be mindful about gaining and losing his favor. After all, Emperor Luo would determine who the person that would inherit the throne was.</p>
<p>Yi Yun replied to Luo Huo'er and he settled Luo Fengling before returning to his room to have a good rest.</p>
<p>He had not slept like a mortal in a very long time. In the Primordial Space, he basically spent all of the time meditating while sitting down. He did not slack for a moment and that solitude and loneliness was something that many people could not endure.</p>
<p>As for the path to martial arts, it was filled with such long reclusions. Very few weak-minded warriors could guarantee that they could wholeheartedly pursue martial arts.</p>
<p>Over the eighteen years, Yi Yun's cultivation level went straight to the Heaven Ascension perfection realm. The next step up from the Heaven Ascension realm was the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>By manifesting one's Dao, one could grow Dao fruits on the Heaven Ascension Dao Tree.</p>
<p>To top geniuses, the rising of an intermediate realm was not difficult, and it could be done very casually. Some top geniuses would meditate for decades. With their Dao foundations established, they were able to rise their cultivation level from the beginning stages straight to the peak in just a few short years.</p>
<p>To geniuses, the hardest thing to raise was a large cultivation realm. It was not that it was difficult to raise, but it was difficult to raise it perfectly.</p>
<p>This was most pertinent from the Heaven Ascension realm to the Dao Manifestation realm. The manifestation of Dao fruit was a big deal to every Heaven Ascension realm genius!</p>
<p>The more varied the insights in the Dao that geniuses had, the more Dao fruits they manifested!</p>
<p>Most warriors would only be able to condense a single Dao fruit when they enter the Dao Manifestation realm. After all, a young genius had a limited amount of time. It was already very difficult to comprehend a single law. If one tried to focus on too many Dao, it would be biting off more than they could chew. It was a waste of their time and potential.</p>
<p>Mastering only one law was the safest approach. It could guarantee a smooth manifestation of Dao. Even the geniuses, who were qualified to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials, would mostly do so.</p>
<p>However, there was an extremely tiny number of people who could manifest two Dao fruits. These people had exceeding perception. At a young age, they were able to multitask, cultivating two laws at the same time. The difficulty was not as simple as twice the difficulty of mastering one law.</p>
<p>And even further up, the manifestation of three or four Dao fruits was nearly unheard of.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if such people existed, they were not necessarily a positive example.</p>
<p>The number of Dao fruits manifested was not the most important thing, it was the quality of the fruits!</p>
<p>If a genius like Princess White Fox wanted to manifest several Dao fruit, she just needed to study many laws. It would not be a problem to manifest five Dao fruits after that.</p>
<p>However, Princess White Fox would obviously not do so. Five low-quality Dao fruits were not as valuable as a single high-quality Dao fruit!</p>
<p>Dao fruits had nine qualities. Every rise in quality would make a leaf grow on the fruit stem.</p>
<p>One leaf was the poorest quality of Dao fruit. The person would basically go no further than the Dao Manifestation realm in their entire lives.</p>
<p>With every additional leaf, the warrior's potential would be greatly elevated!</p>
<p>By the time it was six or seven-leaf Dao fruits, it was already exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>An eight-leaf Dao fruit could be said to be the standard of a peerless genius of an entire sect. As for nine-leaf Dao fruits, they were nearly a legend. After all, most Supremacies would only have eight-leaf Dao fruits when they entered the Dao Manifestation realm!</p>
<p>Of course, they might have all sorts of opportunities in the future, even with eight-leaf Dao fruits. The leaf count of a Dao fruit did not entirely determine a person's future success. It was even rumored that a Divine Lord that was in control of a Divine Lord Royal Seal only had a eight-leaf Dao fruit. Yet, he had reached a height that even nine-leaf Dao fruit geniuses could not reach.</p>
<p>The future was anyone's guess!</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun was at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm. He was already preparing to start manifesting his Dao fruit. But of course, it still would take a lot of time.</p>
<p>Many geniuses did not dare to take this step because a lot was at stake at the Dao Manifestation realm. It determined a lot of their future achievements to a large extent.</p>
<p>Therefore, they would typically spend a century or two consolidating their foundations and meditating over the laws before they stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm, accepting the sentence of the law!</p>
<p>However, if they stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm too late, it would be a waste of potential even if the quality of the Dao fruit was increased. This was truly a hard for one to resolutely make the choice!</p>
<p>Chapter 918: Luo Clan Royal Palace</p>
<p>The Luo clan's royal palace was located at the top of the royal capital. It towered above all, overlooking everything!</p>
<p>Flying was banned in most regions of the royal capital. This meant that people had to walk towards the inner sanctums of the Luo clan royal palace.</p>
<p>If one looked up, they would see a long empyrean staircase winding around the mountain all the way until it disappeared into the clouds. A grand and majestic golden palace loomed at the top.</p>
<p>In between the steps, there were cloud dragon stone carvings. The designs of the stone carvings constantly changed along the way.</p>
<p>There were Heaven Fey, Ancient Fey, sages of the Fey race, as well as Fey God totems!</p>
<p>Many ministers and young talent had to stop at the bottom of the stairs. They would then respectfully bow towards the stairs before walking up them.</p>
<p>Only people who enjoyed a very high status in the Luo clan or people who had particular special merits and honors had the right to walk further up the stairs that led into the clouds.</p>
<p>At this moment, an extremely luxurious sedan that was the size of a house seemed to flutter over towards the stairs. There were more than ten servants making way for it, as it arrived in front of the steps.</p>
<p>The sedan was being carried by hundred-foot tall strongmen. They had two horns on their heads and their faces were crimson in color. They walked as fast as the wind.</p>
<p>“What a large sedan!”</p>
<p>“Who can be carried in a sedan here while still being able to continue to proceed higher?”</p>
<p>Warriors turned their heads around to take a look.</p>
<p>“Look at the emblem on the sedan. It's someone from the Oracle Fey Empire!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I recognize that emblem as well.”</p>
<p>“I heard my sect Elders say that a number of important guests have arrived in the royal capital recently. I never expected that people from the Oracle Fey Empire would come as well.”</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Empire was one of the largest factions of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It was located in an ancient independent space, forming a world for itself.</p>
<p>Since it was a sedan of the Oracle Fey Empire, it was also normal for them to be able to be carried up the stairs.</p>
<p>However, the Oracle Fey Empire seldom made contact with the external world. What were they doing here today?</p>
<p>The strongmen carried the sedan as they moved up and soon, they disappeared into the clouds.</p>
<p>Warriors watched with astonishment, but very quickly, a gigantic black fish flew past them in the sky!</p>
<p>This gigantic black fish flew over their heads and it landed on a square at the foot of the mountain. It was the size of a hill.</p>
<p>“Sea Devouring Fish?”</p>
<p>“It's not a real Sea Devouring Fish, but one of its descendants with an extremely rich bloodline. However, it's extremely rare in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. That is someone from the World Margin Sect.</p>
<p>“What special occasion is it? Why are there so many ambassadors from large factions gathering here today?”</p>
<p>“Oh? I've finally recognized one of those factions. That's the White Fox clan's nebulous cloud!”</p>
<p>The warriors looked over. The White Fox clan was one they were rather familiar with.</p>
<p>The guests of various large factions passed them or flew over them. It was very overwhelming for the lowly warriors.</p>
<p>However, although the esteemed guests had the qualification to fly above the royal palace, they still needed to walk when they reached the long flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Amongst these people that made a grandiose entrance, a man standing on a golden condor appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>“That is… Eh, what's that?”</p>
<p>It was an ordinary golden condor, one of the most common birds in several sects.</p>
<p>Yet, how was this commonly-seen bird flying above the royal capital? Furthermore, it was flying alongside extremely well-known Ancient Fey descendants that everyone knew in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?</p>
<p>“There's someone on it!”</p>
<p>“Who is that? It looks like someone from the younger generation.”</p>
<p>Typically, a person who could fly above the royal palace was someone who enjoyed an extremely high status. Most of the time, those people were not young, so it was very rare to see someone young doing so.</p>
<p>As though he had noticed the commotion below, Yi Yun, who was flying on the golden condor, glanced down as he quickly flew across the sky.</p>
<p>This was a special privilege that Yi Yun enjoyed after the Luo Divine Hall trials. People of honor were allowed to fly above the royal palace.</p>
<p>Of course, he still had to walk once he reached the stairs, but it was an extremely high honor already. The ambassadors of those large factions were given the same treatment.</p>
<p>Flying above the royal palace was an unprecedented experience. However, the mount that Yi Yun had was limited to a single golden condor, so he had casually used it.</p>
<p>However, this nondescript golden condor stood out amid the progeny of Ancient Fey. As such, the warriors beneath were all craning their necks to look at him.</p>
<p>Before Yi Yun arrived, he was informed by Luo Huo'er that the people who came were important figures of various large factions. It was unknown why these people were gathering here today.</p>
<p>Xiao—</p>
<p>Yi Yun's golden condor landed in front of the stairs.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun's golden condor landed, he got off and began walking up towards the Luo royal palace.</p>
<p>The royal palace was majestic, as though it was built on clouds. Looking down from the top, there was a panoramic view of mountains and rivers that extended far out.</p>
<p>Although the flight of stairs was long, it was not much effort for warriors to traverse it.</p>
<p>“Who is that person?”</p>
<p>On one side of the royal palace, there was a tiny garden. In it, there were artificial hills and ponds. A few pavilions were constructed around a pond — temporary resting spots for those meeting Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>There were already many people gathered near the pond.</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately noticed Luo Huo'er amongst the crowd. She was like a brilliant flame burning in the crowd. It was difficult not to notice her.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, you sure are slow.” Luo Huo'er said with a grin. She was sitting in the seat of honor in one of the pavilions. Beside her was Jian Zhu and Xuan Junyue.</p>
<p>The moment that Luo Huo'er spoke, many people immediately looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“He's Yi Yun?”</p>
<p>Even some of the Luo clan disciples present did not know Yi Yun. Many people had gone to the White Fox clan for the trials, so they obviously did not get to witness Yi Yun's prowess.</p>
<p>They had only heard that Yi Yun had surpassed Princess White Fox at the Fey Refining Rock array. As for Princess White Fox, she was no better or worse than Luo Huo'er!</p>
<p>This made many people, including Xuan Junyue, very uncomfortable. They even had their doubts.</p>
<p>They had not participated in the Luo Divine Hall trials, but at the White Fox clan trials, Luo Huo'er's outstanding performance was something that they experienced in person. It was a complete blow to their entire beings. It struck them as though they would never be able to chase up to her.</p>
<p>The lad in front of them had what it took to match Luo Huo'er?</p>
<p>Didn't this mean that this human of a commoner background who didn't seem to be mighty, would also give them the feeling that they would never be able to chase up to him?</p>
<p>This was something that they found unacceptable no matter how it was phrased.</p>
<p>“Uh… It was a bit slow. I don't have any good mounts. I came here on a golden condor. The bird flew rather slowly.”</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said this, the geniuses around Luo Huo'er felt even more speechless. Was this lad truly an existence that they were too inferior to bear comparison to?</p>
<p>“I'll get Mother to send you a mount tomorrow. This matter can be discussed in the future. Little Yun, let's go. Let's have a seat at the White Fox clan's pavilion and have a chat!”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had a penchant for chaos. She was eagerly waiting for Yi Yun to come so she could take Yi Yun to the White Fox clan to smack Bai Yueqing's face. What a joy would that be?</p>
<p>There were several pavilions connected by stone bridges in the area. Using them, Luo Huo'er dragged Yi Yun towards the White Fox clan's pavilion.</p>
<p>At this moment, Prince Crimson Firmament was also at the White Fox clan's pavilion. Bai Yueqing and Princess White Fox were certainly not absent.</p>
<p>They could see Luo Huo'er bringing Yi Yun from afar. Princess White Fox did not react to them, but Bai Yueqing's expression turned extremely ugly.</p>
<p>Especially when he saw that exquisite smirk on Luo Huo'er's face. There was obviously a teasing look to it, and Bai Yueqing knew that this princess of the Luo clan was not someone to be trifled with.</p>
<p>Chapter 919: Bearing Witness</p>
<p>By walking into the pavilion, Luo Huo'er was in the same pavilion as Princess White Fox. With two blessed daughters of heaven in the same pavilion, even disciples from other pavilions could not help but look towards their pavillion.</p>
<p>“Brother, Your Highness Third Prince, Princess Xue'er.” Luo Huo'er was elegant as she said this with a slight bow.</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Huo'er being so graceful and engaging in such proper etiquette, Yi Yun was feeling somewhat speechless watching this from behind. She was clearly here to stir shit, yet she remained so polite.</p>
<p>The corners of Bai Yueqing's mouth twitched. He silently placed his teacup down. Back at the White Fox clan's trials, Luo Huo'er's mischief had completely battered the White Fox clan geniuses silly. That truly made Bai Yueqing witness how powerful the little demoness was.</p>
<p>Sweeping his gaze behind Luo Huo'er, Bai Yueqing noticed Yi Yun and that made him even more upset.</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit.” Princess White Fox nodded her head slightly at Luo Huo'er as a form of reciprocating respect.</p>
<p>After that, she looked at Yi Yun and gently nodded.</p>
<p>“Sister Purple Spirit, I invited you over to sit, but you didn't come. Now, you have finally given me the honor.” Prince Crimson Firmament said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>He obviously knew why Luo Huo'er was here. However, he still had complete disregard for Yi Yun, as though he did not even see him. At this moment, he was wearing luxurious clothing and he was sitting in a great state, with a regal air to him.</p>
<p>Back when Yi Yun first met Prince Crimson Firmament, he found his aura unfathomable. Now, with his cultivation realm being higher and having grasped the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, Yi Yun could sense different things from Prince Crimson Firmament's body when he looked at him.</p>
<p>The space around Prince Crimson Firmament's body was slightly distorted. His aura was sealed in this space, so when others looked at him for a slightly prolonged period of time, they would find their eyes beginning to swell up. His aura made people feel like it was just a black hole.</p>
<p>“I was afraid to disturb Brother. However, Yi Yun, Princess Xue'er, and His Highness Third Prince all know each other, so I brought him here to meet you.”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er sat down, she turned her head to Yi Yun, and said, “Yi Yun, come over here and sit.”</p>
<p>When this was said, the White Fox disciples in the pavilion immediately felt edgy.</p>
<p>Most of the White Fox disciples in the pavilion had stayed behind for their clan's trials. They had also heard of Yi Yun, but they did not recognize his face.</p>
<p>Only when they heard Luo Huo'er call Yi Yun's name out and how she wanted him to sit did they know that this young-looking man was Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He was the one that once surpassed Princess White Fox by a tiny bit?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Luo Huo'er's words, Yi Yun did not refuse either. He adjusted his pale white robe that was made out of heaven silk before sitting down.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun sit together with all the princes and princesses, some of the White Fox disciples felt upset. Many of them came from stunning backgrounds, but they still had to stand in the pavilion. Even if they could sit, they could only sit at a lower level seat. How could they sit on the same table as Luo Huo'er?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun did not stand on ceremony, nor did he refuse. It felt as though it was only natural for him to share a table with the princes and princesses. Who the hell did he think he was?</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing frowned slightly. Although sitting on the same table as Yi Yun made him uncomfortable, he did not speak a single word. As for Prince Crimson Firmament, he completely ignored this matter.</p>
<p>“Your Highness Third Prince, do you still remember our bet?” Luo Huo'er asked with a grin.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing quietly opened his fan and said lightly, “Bet? I certainly remember it.”</p>
<p>“It's good that you remember it. Brother Crimson Firmament, why don't you bear witness? Back then, the bet entailed that in the White Fox clan and Luo clan trials, the White Fox clan has to account for 60% of the results. If the Luo clan were to lose, I would stay behind in the White Fox clan for a year of travel. If the White Fox clan were to lose, Princess White Fox would have to stay behind in the Luo clan to travel a year, and I'll assign a genius to accompany Princess White Fox in her tour. Wasn't that so?”</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er spoke, she glanced at Prince Crimson Firmament. Yi Yun was rendered speechless while listening to her. He knew that Luo Huo'er was planning on 'assigning' him to princess White Fox. This was going to happen in front of Prince Crimson Firmament, while Prince Crimson Firmament was already gearing up to enter a marriage with Princess White Fox. No one knew what was on Prince Crimson Firmament's mind.</p>
<p>But at least from the surface, Prince Crimson Firmament did not seem unhappy at all.</p>
<p>“This prince as witness? Sure. From this prince's point of view, that tiny bet is nothing more than motivating the elites of both clans. Its goal has been reached. As for both the trials, this prince has a detailed understanding of them. Sister Purple Spirit, you were undoubtedly ranked first in the White Fox clan trials!”</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament said slowly, “As for the Luo Divine Hall trials, Princess White Fox was ranked first. Therefore, the first ranks on both sides are equally matched. As for the other disciples, the White Fox clan was indeed slightly better than our Luo clan's younger elites… ”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Luo Huo'er stared with her beautiful eyes at him, “Who did you say was first at the Luo Divine Hall trials?”</p>
<p>“Princess Xue'er was first. This is the result that was eventually decided after the Luo Divine Hall trials ended. There's nothing questionable about that, right!? Princess Xue'er eventually managed to clear the sixth level of the Fey Refining Rock array, killing the sixth Ancient Fey. As for the others, Yi Yun was the next highest having killed the fifth Ancient Fey. As for the others… Jian Zhu, the Shadow Twins, and Wufeng, they had managed to kill the fourth Ancient Fey.”</p>
<p>“Other than the Fey Refining Rock array, there were trials that were related to bloodline. This was undoubtedly where Princess Xue'er was miles ahead. And from what I learned, Yi Yun did not even participate in the bloodline trials. Even if he had participated, with Yi Yun's thin Fey race bloodline, he probably would not have much to show for it. He would be beneath the Shadow Twins.” Prince Crimson Firmament said very calmly.</p>
<p>At this moment, he finally glanced at Yi Yun. It had a hint of derision in it.</p>
<p>Without mentioning the Fey Refining Rock trial, Yi Yun had been absent for all the trials after that, staying inside the Primordial Space in reclusive cultivation. When Prince Crimson Firmament knew about this, he found it amusing.</p>
<p>The Luo Divine Hall was filled with treasures everywhere. Countless disciples yearned to enter the Luo Divine Hall so as they could enjoy the resources inside, but Yi Yun abandoned all of these resources, all for a Primordial Space.</p>
<p>The Primordial Space was indeed a great opportunity, but seven years of meditation was not enough. He even meditated for eighteen years.</p>
<p>Didn't he know that a true expert was not created through reclusion? It needed constant actual combat, experiencing life and death battles. Only then could one increase one's strength through battle, eventually become a member of the generation's strong people!</p>
<p>But thankfully, Yi Yun was dumb, giving him an excuse. The final results that the Luo Divine Hall trials produced did not rank Yi Yun. This was because Yi Yun was absent in too many of the trials, so it was impossible for him to be ranked.</p>
<p>It was finally recognized in the rankings that Princess White Fox was first in the trial.</p>
<p>If not, to let Yi Yun really accompany Princess White Fox to tour the Luo clan? How could he salvage his reputation as an heir to the throne? If Princess White Fox were to one day become the Luo clan's Empress, wouldn't this matter make him the laughing stock of the world?</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament's words made Luo Huo'er's eyebrows prick up.</p>
<p>“So that's the case. I was wondering why Brother Crimson Firmament was sitting so stably. So you've already thought of an excuse, and would rather die than admit it?” Luo Huo'er derided him ruthlessly.</p>
<p>She was enemies with Prince Crimson Firmament to begin with, so she didn't care.</p>
<p>“What did this prince say wrong?” Prince Crimson Firmament sipped a mouthful of tea and slowly said, “Strength does not exist in talk, it exists in actual validation. I saw the scenes of Yi Yun battling the fifth Ancient Fey. He was using a mystic technique to defeat the fifth Ancient Fey. He clearly was only able to use the mystic technique once. After defeating the fifth Ancient Fey, how was he going to battle the sixth Ancient Fey?”</p>
<p>“As for Princess Xue'er, she had used her true abilities to slay the fifth Ancient Fey. She did not use any mystic techniques. Princess Xue'er surpasses Yi Yun in every way, other than that special mystic technique. She experienced the trials in the Luo Divine Hall for eleven years before being able to slay the sixth Ancient Fey. Furthermore, she still had energy left after the slaying! That is the difference!”</p>
<p>“I'll not talk about the difference in the Fey Refining Rock array and talk about the bloodline trials. Yi Yun was absent, and if he truly participated, would his tiny bit of bloodline be qualified to compare with Princess White Fox?”</p>
<p>Chapter 920: Chu Yunjian</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament was clearly refusing to agree that Luo Huo'er had won.</p>
<p>Although everyone knew this, what he said was something that many of the White Fox disciple agreed with. Even if bloodline was not mentioned, just based on strength alone, Yi Yun lacked the advantage. Yi Yun had used a mystic technique to defeat the fifth Ancient Fey. It was not Yi Yun being powerful, but the mystic technique being powerful.</p>
<p>As for Princess White Fox, she had used her own abilities to slay the sixth Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Offensive mystic techniques had wondrous effects, but they were like weapons. They were considered to be foreign objects. At an even higher realm, there was even a need for change. What truly was powerful was a warrior's nomological insight and their cultivation realm.</p>
<p>“Princess, let's go. There's nothing to dispute about this.” Yi Yun said to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>He did not care about the outcome. So what if his strength was recognized by the White Fox clan or not?</p>
<p>As for accompanying Princess White Fox on her tour, that was something that he was even more disinterested in. Lin Xintong had yet to be found. The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was extremely expansive. He did not even know how or where to start finding her, so how could he accompany a female stranger, who he did not have much of a friendship with, on her travels? This was just a maleficent plan of Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er grunted. Prince Crimson Firmament's high and mighty appearance compelled her to give him a merciless punch in the face.</p>
<p>“Little Yun! I say, when you participated in the trial, why the heck did you keep a low profile for? At the end, you should have come out and had a go at the Fey Refining Rock array. By doing so, what can they still say!?” Luo Huo'er transmitted her voice unhappily.</p>
<p>Yi Yun lightly said, “It's meaningless if they see it or not. One's Strength is one's own.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Yi Yun stood up.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yi Yun was about to leave, there was no reason for Luo Huo'er to stay any longer. She unhappily stood up.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you leaving just like that? Why don't you stay behind for some tea?” Prince Crimson Firmament said with a faint smile, his demeanor looking laid-back and complacent.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing laughed out loud as well. He opened his fan again and he slowly flapped it.</p>
<p>“If one doesn't want to stay, staying behind to drink tea would feel make one feel uneasy. This prince won't be sending you off, so help yourselves.” Bai Yueqing said.</p>
<p>Again, it was a fluttery sentence that entered Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, I know you verbally say it as if you don't care, but you actually feel indignant in your heart. Do not think that it's something impressive defeating the fifth Ancient Fey with a mystic technique. A mystic technique is not a law after all. It's just from a mystic manual, a move only. After you step into the Dao Manifestation realm, your laws can be condensed into Dao fruits, but mystic techniques can't.”</p>
<p>“The Dao Manifestation largely determines your future success. If the Dao fruit that you condense is lacking in quality, so what if your mystic technique is powerful? Xue'er had attained Dao Domain during the first seven years of the Luo Divine Hall trials. Can you?” Bai Yueqing said those words softly, but it could be heard from afar.</p>
<p>Many people could not help but agree with them when they heard this.</p>
<p>Indeed, a mystic technique could not condense a Dao fruit. It was not very helpful for a warrior's foundation. It could only increase one's combat power.</p>
<p>“Hmph, how do you know that the Dao fruits that Yi Yun will condense will be poor in quality? Bai Yueqing, be careful of what you say, for they might smack you right back in the face.” Before Yi Yun even said anything, Luo Huo'er had spoken first.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing chuckled and said, “Princess Purple Spirit, you seem unconvinced. This isn't only just my view. I was just discussing with someone what would happen when the both of you step into the Dao Manifestation realm… ”</p>
<p>As Bai Yueqing spoke, he glanced at a pavilion nearby.</p>
<p>Not far away, there was a small ivory-colored pavilion. It was much smaller than the pavilion where Bai Yueqing and Prince Crimson Firmament were sitting.</p>
<p>Yi Yun glanced in that direction and he saw two people sitting in the pavilion.</p>
<p>One of them was in black clothes, with his back facing Yi Yun. As for the other person, he was dressed in fox fur, with a pair of swords, one long and one short, beside him.</p>
<p>The person wearing fox fur had delicate looks. His bright eyes had a life to them. He was sitting there drinking wine, as though he was integrated with the surroundings.</p>
<p>These two people, especially the man in the fox fur facing him, caught Yi Yun's attention.</p>
<p>“It's Chu Yunjian… ” Luo Huo'er's eyebrows pricked.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is he very famous?”</p>
<p>“Sort of.” Luo Huo'er nodded. “He used to be a itinerant cultivator before settling down in the White Fox clan, becoming a White Fox disciple. He had participated in the previous White Fox trials. As for this time, as his age had exceeded a hundred years old, he could not participate in it again.”</p>
<p>“Chu Yunjian stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm a few years ago. He condensed a four-leaf Dao fruit and two seven-leaf Dao fruits.”</p>
<p>“Three Dao fruit?” Yi Yun was slightly surprised. Three Dao fruits was indeed quite a lot. However, having one four-leaf and two seven-leaf Dao fruits did not seem to be up to the standard of a worldly genius…</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er could tell what was on Yi Yun's mind as she said, “A seven-leaf Dao fruit is already pretty powerful. Furthermore, the crux of the matter was that the seven-leaf Dao fruits that Chu Yunjian condensed were extraordinary!”</p>
<p>“The four-leaf Dao fruit was a condensation of Sword Dao, as for the other two seven-leaf Dao fruits, they were both Great Dao — one a condensation of time, and the other a condensation of space. By gaining insights into both space-time laws, he had managed to condense two seven-leaf Dao fruits at the age of a hundred. That's already very amazing.”</p>
<p>“Space-time laws together with Sword Dao, so Chu Yunjian's strength is rather terrifying. If he were ten years younger, he would have been in time for the recent Luo Divine Hall trials. Yi Yun, you would have had another strong opponent.”</p>
<p>“Dao of space-time with Sword Dao?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was taken aback momentarily. Space-time was born along with the formation of the universe. It was just like Yin and Yang. They were the Great Dao amongst the Great Dao. They were much harder compared to the Dao of the five elements — Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth — or the Creation Dao —Wind, Rain, Lightning. After comprehending them, a warrior's strength would also be even stronger!</p>
<p>Comparing the same seven-leaf Dao fruit, a fire-elemental seven-leaf Dao fruit was naturally inferior to space and time seven-leaf Dao fruits.</p>
<p>As for Sword Dao, although it was inferior to the Dao of space and time, it was not a lowly Dao either. With a sword, one could wield a Divine Lord Royal Seal, becoming a Divine Lord. There were many such instances in the 12 Empyrean Heavens. For example, the Azure Yang Lord was one of them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er added on, “Chu Yunjian's status in the White Fox clan is extraordinary, so Bai Yueqing views him as a high level guest. Not only is he very strong, his eyes are sharp as well. He must have evaluated you just now, but who knows how he evaluated you… ”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was somewhat concerned about this. She did not see the process of Yi Yun's Luo Divine Hall trials. As for the effects of Yi Yun's reclusive retreat, she did not know either.</p>
<p>Although she had an inexplicable sense of confidence when it came to Yi Yun, she was still curious about how a keen-eyed person like Chu Yunjian would evaluate Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“I do not need others to evaluate me.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head. During Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er's conversation, Chu Yunjian was constantly drinking wine with the person across him. He did not even glance at Yi Yun, as though whatever was happening around him did not concern him.</p>
<p>This was not arrogance, but a swordsman that was dedicated to martial arts. He paid no attention and he was indifferent to everything that happened around him.</p>
<p>To them, all they needed was having a sword in the heart and laws.</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er were conversing, the door to the Luo clan's royal palace slowly opened.</p>
<p>A majestic and luxurious aura emanated as Yi Yun looked at the slowly opening palace doors. He did not know why so many powerful factions were gathered at the royal palace and as to what had happened. But now, there was most likely an outcome.</p>
<p>Chapter 921: Summoning</p>
<p>When the doors to the Luo clan's royal palace was fully opened, a Fey Demon with a large head walked out and swept his gaze over the crowd in the pavilions.</p>
<p>“His Majesty summons you.” His voice was deep and dull, like it was thunder ringing in their ears.</p>
<p>The crowd stood up rapidly.</p>
<p>It was rather rare for Emperor Luo, who supposedly held the highest power in the Luo clan, to summon others.</p>
<p>“Let's go.” Prince Crimson Firmament stood up. With the goal of being the next emperor of the Luo clan, he was first to walk in front. Bai Yueqing, Princess White Fox, and other prominent figures walked alongside him.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, let's go as well.” Luo Huo'er sneered and she took Yi Yun to walk right in front.</p>
<p>She was a princess, so there was certainly no one who would stop her. As for Yi Yun, who was walking beside her, he was in the first row like the other regal progeny.</p>
<p>Even Chu Yunjian was behind him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's figure was rather striking in that group of people.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is really composed.” Luo Mo said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament had verbally humiliated Yi Yun, but Yi Yun had no intention of entering any contention with him, nor was he afraid.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament enjoyed a high standing, so much so that numerous people treated him with reverence and fear, yet Yi Yun did not care at all.</p>
<p>The hall of the royal palace was extremely grand. When the group of people walked in, they felt like they were standing in a boundless square.</p>
<p>The walls were thick and tall. There were towering pillars that reached high up into a cloudy mist. The thickness of the pillars was probably the combined arm span of seven or eight people. The roof was very wide, with exquisite murals of gods and demons painted on the dome.</p>
<p>The moment that Yi Yun entered, he sensed a terrifying aura spreading from the top of the pillars. Looking up, he saw a person sitting on each pillar.</p>
<p>These people were shrouded by the mist, preventing others from seeing their faces.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up and he sensed someone glancing down from the top.</p>
<p>He immediately felt like he was being stared by a real primordial Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>Just a simple gaze from that person overlooking them made the disciples silent.</p>
<p>There was a tall and large misty platform in front of them, with a gorgeous regal seat that could fit dozens of people. In the middle of that seat sat an extremely large figure dressed in dragon robes.</p>
<p>“Greetings Father Emperor, my respects to all esteemed ambassadors.”</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament took the lead to bow. As juniors, they were ineligible to sit on the misty pillars, so they could only sit on golden lotus seats on the two sides of the hall.</p>
<p>There were probably thousands of golden lotus seats, so if the hall was filled with elites from everywhere, it was unknown how spectacular the scene would be.</p>
<p>“The last time that there were ambassadors from other factions here was when I was one.” Luo Huo'er transmitted her voice to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The corner of Yi Yun's lips moved. Luo Huo'er was evidently rather proud about this.</p>
<p>However, this also indicated how outstanding Luo Huo'er's talent was. If not, there would not be ambassadors coming to participate in the celebrations. She would not have become Prince Crimson Firmament's competitor as well, considering her personality.</p>
<p>Having the top talent in the warrior's world indicated that one would obtain greater achievements, and strength was very important.</p>
<p>Everyone sat down, with many sitting in a very formal and restrained manner. Even Luo Huo'er only looked ahead.</p>
<p>The figure on the regal seat spoke. His voice was extremely commanding, with a hint of lethargy in it.</p>
<p>“The young disciples have arrived. Duke Wuxiao, please repeat what you had just mentioned.” Emperor Luo slowly said.</p>
<p>His voice was not loud, but it gave people the feeling that they had to listen.</p>
<p>“Alright.” A male hoarse voice came from one of the pillars.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked over, and Duke Wuxiao was sitting opposite him. He was a red-clothed man who was hidden in the mist, and behind his back was a pair of gigantic wings.</p>
<p>“I'll not beat about the bush. All of you present, the disciples of the White Fox and Luo clan have been undergoing training trials for the past eighteen years. Those who are qualified to come here are those who have passed the trials. As for young elites of the other factions, they are also rushing to the Luo clan's royal capital now. However, the disciples of my Cloud Trail Empire will not be coming.”</p>
<p>“They were not much different to you all, but… they all died during our trials!” When Duke Wuxiao said this, his tone turned heavy.</p>
<p>The disciples in the hall were alarmed. The dead Cloud Trail Empire disciples were geniuses who participated in the trials just like they did. How did they all die?</p>
<p>“It was the Fey Phantasm Sect!” Duke Wuxiao's tone had a lingering hatred. “They attacked our spirit cruiser on the disciples' return trip. All the talented disciples were taken away by the Fey Phantasm Sect. Their outcome was extremely terrible!”</p>
<p>Fey Phantasm Sect!</p>
<p>Yi Yun thought for a moment. Wasn't that the sect that nearly destroyed the Luo clan?</p>
<p>Back then, it had entered a huge war with the Luo clan, causing the Luo clan to experience a shortage of geniuses. Furthermore, Yi Yun knew that the Fey Phantasm Sect from before had gone to war with several other factions.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know the purpose of the Fey Phantasm Sect waging war. Was it just for the plundering of resources?</p>
<p>He could not help but ask Luo Huo'er through a voice transmission, “Why is the Fey Phantasm Sect offending so many factions at the same time? Even if it's powerful, there's no need for it to frequently wage war. Isn't it afraid that it will weaken its strength?”</p>
<p>After Yi Yun asked this question, he saw what was a rare tinge of hatred appear on Luo Huo'er's face.</p>
<p>“The Fey Phantasm Sect is only eager to wage war. The more war there is, the stronger it becomes.”</p>
<p>“The Fey Phantasm Sect specializes in the refinement of puppets and Fey corpses for sale. In the 12 Empyrean Heavens, there are various species. Some species do not have strong physiques, such as humans. Their physical bodies are weak. Some mighty human figures might have their bodies destroyed in battle. They could then find a powerful body of a member of the Fey race to possess. And this would be when they would patronize the Fey Phantasm Sect.”</p>
<p>“Through such methods, the Fey Phantasm Sect accumulates a great deal of resources and wealth through the other Empyrean Heavens. They have already become a cancer of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven and they are extremely infamous.</p>
<p>Sale of puppets and corpses?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised. This business was truly vicious. No wonder they had plundered the geniuses of the Cloud Trail Empire, probably using them to make Fey corpses!</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's Fey race was well known for its strong physiques. There was probably a lot of buyers from other Empyrean Heavens that were interested in this. It was truly a windfall.</p>
<p>And in order to gain these Fey race bodies, a war had to be waged so as to plunder the population.</p>
<p>Yi Yun said, “By doing this, isn't the Fey Phantasm Sect being the enemy of everyone? If this goes on, wouldn't the large factions of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven annihilate the Fey Phantasm Sect sooner or later?”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er shook her head slightly. “It's not that easy. The Fey Phantasm Sect is powerful to begin with. Furthermore, their headquarters is in the Sinkhole. The Sinkhole is boundless, and the space in it is complex and filled with disorder. It's very difficult to annihilate them!”</p>
<p>Duke Wuxiao from the Cloud Trail Empire felt the pinch in his heart when he said this, “Those geniuses were nurtured at great cost by the Cloud Trail Empire. They were the disciples that stood out from millions of disciples. However, they ended up being refined into Fey corpses alive, while we also lost an extremely valuable spirit cruiser.”</p>
<p>Duke Wuxiao was filled with boundless hatred!</p>
<p>At this moment, Emperor Luo sighed and said, “The Fey Phantasm Sect's Grand Elder, Ji Wuhen, has already obtained a Divine Lord Royal Seal, becoming a Divine Lord.”</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>The elites present were horrified.</p>
<p>The ambassadors of the other factions like Duke Wuxiao clearly knew about this, but when they heard Emperor Luo say it again, they could only shake their heads.</p>
<p>Divine Lord!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was alarmed.</p>
<p>He recalled the Azure Yang Lord, who was once a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>Divine Lords represented strength and status in the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>Even after he was severely injured, he was still able to traverse the Universe, and managed to create the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' with the Great Empress.</p>
<p>Even a treasure like the God Advent Tower was just one of his many treasures.</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect actually had one Divine Lord?</p>
<p>“Ji Wuhen has great ambitions. Having become a Divine Lord and him in control of the Fey Phantasm Sect, he has unified many of the smaller factions in the Sinkhole. There is almost nothing that can stop the Fey Phantasm Sect from its expansion.” Emperor Luo said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the young disciples, who were excited from being summoned, felt like they were struck by lightning!</p>
<p>There was no certainty when they would be plundered by the Fey Phantasm Sect and transformed into Fey corpses for the possession of others!</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned slightly and he was considered rather calm.</p>
<p>Although the Fey Phantasm Sect was terrifying, there was likely counter measures against the crisis to be announced by having all these factions gathered here and younger disciples being summoned.</p>
<p>Chapter 922: Felicitous Rain Lord</p>
<p>Sitting in the hall, Yi Yun could sense Emperor Luo's commanding gaze sweep across all of them.</p>
<p>“In order to resist the Fey Phantasm Sect, all of our factions will form an alliance from today henceforth! The various Fey empire's strength will be united so we can fight against the Fey Phantasm Sect.” Emperor Luo said.</p>
<p>With the Fey Phantasm Sect's forces growing stronger, the number of factions that were threatened by the Fey Phantasm Sect would increase as well. Now, the Fey Phantasm Sect was making a comeback, and the Fey Phantasm Sect had a Divine Lord in it. If these factions did not form an alliance, they would probably be destroyed one after another.</p>
<p>However, could an alliance alone gain victory over the Fey Phantasm Sect?</p>
<p>“The various Fey empires have reclusive Elders and hidden techniques. It is no different for our Luo clan. It won't be so easy for us to be taken down.” Luo Huo'er's voice transmission echoed in Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>However, she had a rare sense of seriousness in her expression.</p>
<p>Back then, the Fey Phantasm Sect did not have a Divine Lord and the Luo clan nearly suffered annihilation. This time…</p>
<p>Emperor Luo continued, “After the alliance is established, the Cloud Trail Empire will offer an ancient array formation, named the Ten Thousand Fey God-slaying Array. This array is no trifling matter. Back in ancient times, it is said that more than ten thousand mighty figures of the Fey race in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven formed this large formation to slay the Ancestor Gods. That was how the array got its name. The Cloud Trail Empire has obtained it, but even though it is just a replica of the Ten Thousand Fey God-slaying Array created in ancient times, it is still extremely impressive!” Emperor Luo said, “This Ten Thousand Fey God-slaying Array replica will have a Divine Lord at its core, with other positions allocated to Supremacies to preside over it. The entire array will have more than ten thousand people powering it.”</p>
<p>Divine Lord?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Emperor Luo's words, the crowd was stunned. When did their alliance have a Divine Lord!?</p>
<p>Be it the Luo clan or the White Fox clan, none of them had Divine Lords. If there was a Divine Lord holding down the situation, there would probably be no fear of the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>Emperor Luo continued, “The activation of the Ten Thousand Fey God-slaying Array is extremely draining on the people presiding over it, so it will be the last measure against Ji Wuhen, used only as a last resort. It's one of the means that will not be used unless its necessary.”</p>
<p>Having the Ten Thousand Fey God-slaying Array as a trump card, it made most of the disciples present heave a sigh of relief. Even without a Divine Lord, it was most likely still possible to barely use the array formation?</p>
<p>However, would a castrated array formation that lacked a Divine Lord presiding over it truly be able to withstand the Fey Phantasm Sect?</p>
<p>However, Emperor Luo had mentioned just one of their means, so there was likely other corresponding solutions.</p>
<p>The lofty important figures had discussed it behind closed doors, so it was unlikely that they would reveal everything to these disciples.</p>
<p>“This array formation also requires a large number of Dao Manifestation and Heaven Ascension realm warriors. In the future, you might be selected to partake in this array formation.” Emperor Luo said.</p>
<p>Selected to partake in the array formation?</p>
<p>Being able to fight alongside Supremacies and these mighty figures was an absolutely perfect opportunity for many people present.</p>
<p>And with danger at hand, they had to rise up as warriors. Many disciples could not help but reveal a look of anticipation.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was silent. It was most likely very dangerous for lower-level disciples to participate in combat at that level. However, with him now being a member of the Luo clan, there was no way for him to avoid it. If he wanted to ensure his well-being during the war, he had to quickly improve his strength.</p>
<p>“There is another matter to be announced.” Emperor Luo switched gears and looked at someone from the Oracle Fey Empire. “Brother Tianfeng, why don't you tell us about it?”</p>
<p>Emperor Luo's extremely polite tone surprised Yi Yun slightly. The people that came from the various factions were only ambassadors. None of the sovereigns themselves came.</p>
<p>Emperor Luo's status was arguably the highest, but now, with Emperor Luo addressing the person as 'Brother Tianfeng', it was apparent that something was different. Furthermore, the person's position in the hall was most prominent, with him being just beside Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Yu Tianfeng tersely responded and he had a harsh expression. His gaze swept across everyone as he calmly said, “Most of you probably know that the person truly presiding over my Oracle Fey Empire is the Oracle Imperial Patriarch. In his youth, Imperial Patriarch toured the world and he had the privilege to befriend a Divine Lord. Back then, the esteemed Divine Lord's strength was similar to Imperial Patriarch's, and through the machinations of fate, the esteemed Divine Lord owed a favor to Imperial Patriarch. After he became a Divine Lord, he remembered this favor and he promised to help out when the Oracle Fey Empire is ever in danger but only once!”</p>
<p>“Most of you should have heard of this Divine Lord's title. He is Felicitous Rain Lord.”</p>
<p>Just as Yu Tianfeng's voice faded, the young disciples present were left stunned.</p>
<p>A Divine Lord was indebted to the Imperial Patriarch of the Oracle Fey Empire?</p>
<p>This was no trifling matter!</p>
<p>At the cultivation level of a Divine Lord, it was atypical to be indebted to others as it tainted their karma. If a Divine Lord were to help the Oracle Fey Empire, the position that the Oracle Fey Empire enjoyed in the alliance would be completely different. It was no wonder that Emperor Luo was so courteous to Yu Tianfeng, who was just an ambassador!</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain Lord?” Yi Yun asked with a voice transmission.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er answered, “Felicitous Rain Lord is a rather young Divine Lord in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. He became a Divine Lord tens of thousands of years ago. The sect that he was in was destroyed before he attained the rank of Divine Lord. Now, he is touring the cosmos and he does not belong to any faction. He is a wandering Divine Lord, but it is precisely because of this that his fame is exuded.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. He had seen the Azure Yang Lord's memories, and the Azure Yang Lord had also established an empire.</p>
<p>By running a faction, it was more convenient for one's cultivation. It also allowed one to acquire more power. A wandering Divine Lord sounded free, but by being a lone person, it was easier for others to challenge them.</p>
<p>“After Felicitous Rain Lord became a Divine Lord, he was constantly challenged, but it has reduced a lot in recent years. The reason is none other than those who challenged him never returned.” Luo Huo'er said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's questions were clarified. A Divine Lord, especially one that was reigning high, allowed the Oracle Fey Empire to ascend higher than the other factions in the alliance because of his debt. It made the Oracle Fey Empire a supernatural existence in the alliance.</p>
<p>It could even be said that the entire alliance would be led by the Oracle Fey Empire. These ambassadors that had gathered in the Luo clan royal capital were not here to negotiate the matters of the alliance with Emperor Luo, but they were mainly responsible for the passing of messages.</p>
<p>With the threat of the Fey Phantasm Sect, Emperor Luo would not refuse any condition unless they were too punitive.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun understood this point, he finally understood why Yu Tianfeng sounded so proud.</p>
<p>Just being the receiver of a debt of a Divine Lord gave them such value, so if it was the Divine Lord himself…</p>
<p>Upon thinking about this, Yi Yun felt extremely wistful. The 12 Empyrean Heavens was a world where strength was supreme. Becoming a Divine Lord was extremely glorious in the 12 Empyrean Heavens!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Tianfeng added, “This is not the only news regarding Felicitous Rain Lord. What shall follow is information that has much to do with all of you!”</p>
<p>When Yu Tianfeng said this, everyone pricked up their ears. Has much to do with them?</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain Lord has been touring my Oracle Fey Empire recently. When Felicitous Rain Lord met Imperial Patriarch, he mentioned his intentions of taking in a disciple. Felicitous Rain Lord might choose one disciple from our alliance! The Imperial Patriarch ordered us to inform you all of the intentions of Felicitous Rain Lord. This is a great opportunity for all of you.” Yu Tianfeng said this sentence rather grudgingly.</p>
<p>He actually felt that Felicitous Rain Lord could have chosen a disciple from the Oracle Fey Empire itself. As the saying went, keep the benefits within the family, but Felicitous Rain Lord insisted on spreading a wider net for his selection.</p>
<p>When the young elites present heard this news, it was as though a burning meteorite had hit a calm water surface!</p>
<p>A Divine Lord was accepting a disciple!?</p>
<p>Many disciples immediately turned excited!</p>
<p>What did it mean to become a disciple of a Divine Lord?</p>
<p>As long as one became the disciple of a Divine Lord, that was truly a single leap into success! Regardless if you were a Supremacy's disciple or an heir to the throne, they were nothing comparable. And as for the lesser status of being a disciple of a large family clan, they were equivalent to shit in front of of a Divine Lord's disciple.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, as long as they became a disciple of a Divine Lord, they would become the best amongst the younger generation of all the factions present. Even the emperor of the faction that the person resided in had to treat the Divine Lord's disciple politely as a guest.</p>
<p>A Divine Lord controlled a great deal of resources. Even a tiny bit that leaked out of his fingers would benefit them all their lives!</p>
<p>Even Yi Yun was tempted. There were too many benefits to becoming a Divine Lord's disciple. Even the Fey Phantasm Sect probably did not dare to kill a Divine Lord's disciple without any thought.</p>
<p>Chapter 923: Standards for Disciple Selection</p>
<p>How was one to become a disciple of a Divine Lord? What were the standards that Felicitous Rain Lord demanded in a disciple?</p>
<p>The young elites present were all extremely excited. Everyone that could sit in the gathering was a blessed child of heaven. It was not only limited to the cream of the crop that had participated in the Luo Divine Hall trials and the White Fox clan trials, there were young geniuses who were older, to the point of them being two to three hundred years old.</p>
<p>They had confidence in their own talents, so how could they miss this opportunity that could aid them in reaching the heavens in a single leap?</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was a truly important figure in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Just him alone was enough to make the Fey Phantasm Sect tremble before him. After all, the Fey Phantasm Sect only had one Divine Lord for themselves. The Divine Lord of the Fey Phantasm Sect would not be afraid of offending an existence at the same level, but what about the people of the Fey Phantasm Sect? They would be easily slaughtered.</p>
<p>The young disciples present were basically from the Luo clan and the White Fox clan. These two factions had close relations and it was just a matter of time before they formed an alliance between themselves. As for the Oracle Fey Empire, its relationship with the two factions was much poorer.</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng was unhappy with the fact that Felicitous Rain Lord had gone beyond the Oracle Fey Empire and into the entire alliance to search for a disciple. Now, seeing the Luo clan and White Fox disciples so excited as they fantasized about how such a great opportunity had landed in their laps, Yu Tianfeng's eyes reveal a hint of disdain.</p>
<p>They were just a bunch of toads lusting after a swan's flesh. Was becoming a Divine Lord's disciple so easy? What made them even qualify?</p>
<p>My Oracle Fey Empire's present younger generation is filled with talent. Yet, when so many talents were shown to Felicitous Rain Lord, all he did was give a smile and reserve comment.</p>
<p>The yardstick of a Divine Lord was extremely elevated. But even so, when the best person of my Oracle Fey Empire's younger generation revealed his Great Dao Dao Domain, he had only made Felicitous Rain Lord nod his head.</p>
<p>It was something worth being proud of to make a Divine Lord nod his head.</p>
<p>Although Felicitous Rain Lord later insisted on expanding the scope of the disciple selection to the entire alliance, Yu Tianfeng was confident that the windfall would ultimately land on the Oracle Fey Empire!</p>
<p>The elites of the other factions were there just to serve as a foil.</p>
<p>“Ambassador, did Felicitous Rain Lord set any standards such that if they are reached would lead to a chance of becoming his disciple?” At this moment, as one of the leading characters of the Luo clan's younger generation, Prince Crimson Firmament spoke up.</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng did not put him at heart, even though he was a prince of the Luo clan that would very likely inherit the throne. He glanced at Prince Crimson Firmament for a moment before slowly responding, “Felicitous Rain Lord did not set any standards and he only revealed that he had intentions of taking in a disciple. He did not say if he would definitely accept a disciple. Don't keep your hopes up. For the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. However, I believe if any of you were able to condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit, it would not be difficult to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple.”</p>
<p>“Nine-leaf Dao fruit?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yu Tianfeng's words, the crowd was rendered speechless. It was difficult to condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit even for smaller Dao below the five elements or creation Dao. Although the geniuses present were confident of themselves, they did not believe that they had the ability to condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Being able to condense an eight-leaf Dao fruit was a grand event that could stir the entire clan.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of becoming a Divine Lord even if one stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm while possessing a nine-leaf Dao fruit was still rather small.</p>
<p>After all, a Divine Lord enjoyed a long lifespan. He could take in many disciples, but out of these disciples, the possibility of producing a new Divine Lord was extremely minute. It was just too difficult to become a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>“What is that Yu Tianfeng so arrogant for!? It's just the Imperial Patriarch of the Oracle Fey Empire knowing a Divine Lord, not Yu Tianfeng himself. What nine-leaf Dao fruit? I don't believe that their Oracle Fey Empire's geniuses can condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he's completely looking down on us by saying the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. He just doesn't want us to compete with the Oracle Fey Empire.”</p>
<p>The White Fox clan and Luo clan's geniuses began to discuss with each other through private transmissions.</p>
<p>Yi Yun understood what was going on, but Yu Tianfeng's response was reasonable. From Yu Tianfeng's point of view, the so-called geniuses present were not fit to enter the Divine Lord's eyes. That was because the Oracle Fey Empire themselves had geniuses that had a chance to come into contact with a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>The opportunity was brought by the Oracle Fey Empire, so the disciple selection was naturally from within the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>The two matters were announced during the Luo clan royal palace's grand summoning. The Fey Phantasm Sect was making a comeback and a Divine Lord was taking in a disciple. As the latter brought the allure of an opportunity with it, the repressed mood because of the Fey Phantasm Sect's invasion had inexplicably been soothed.</p>
<p>If one were to become a disciple of a Divine Lord, was there any need to fear the Fey Phantasm Sect?</p>
<p>After the meeting ended, Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er left the palace together.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, any comments on Felicitous Rain Lord taking in a disciple?” Luo Huo'er asked. She could tell that compared to many of the younger disciples, Yi Yun appeared much calmer.</p>
<p>“It's definite that becoming a Divine Lord's disciple will greatly aid one's martial path, but to not even know the standards, it would still be difficult to become a Divine Lord's disciple. I plan on entering reclusion once I get back, taking a few months to digest the insights gained from the Primordial Space.”</p>
<p>“Another reclusion?” Luo Huo'er was somewhat stunned. “You have already been in reclusion for eighteen years. Why more?”</p>
<p>“I have some insights that need some honing when used in actual combat.” Yi Yun answered.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er nodded, “I think there's a need for actual combat as well. You missed a lot of the trials at the Luo Divine Hall, so now it's time to make up for it. I'll request Mother to let you use the Heavenly Slaughter Array. The Heavenly Slaughter Array is meant to train young elites' actual combat power. Cultivating in the Heavenly Slaughter Array might allow your strength to increase by leaps and bounds.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that would be good as well.” Yi Yun was immediately pleased as he nodded.</p>
<p>“Then, if there's any important news regarding Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple selection, I'll get someone to inform you so that you can exit reclusion early. Don't miss out on the Felicitous Rain Lord's selection. I have a lot of confidence in you.” Luo Huo'er said as she grinned at Yi Yun. Taking Yi Yun along, they flew towards Fenghua Palace</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er and Yi Yun were traveling to meet Empress Xuan, a spirit cruiser was silently traversing through deep space outside the Luo clan's royal capital.</p>
<p>The grade of this spirit cruiser was slightly poorer than the spirit cruiser that the Luo clan used to travel to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>The Primordial Empyrean Heaven spirit cruiser used by the Luo clan was the vessel belonging to a Supremacy or Emperor Luo, but the owner of this spirit cruiser was just a young man.</p>
<p>At this moment, the young man was standing on the bow, looking into the far and deep cosmos. Far away, a land mass with nebulae shrouding it floated in the darkness. As the spirit cruiser coasted, it slowly closed the distance.</p>
<p>“That is the Luo clan's royal capital, right?”</p>
<p>Beside the young man was a beautiful woman. She wore a veil that covered her enchanting body. Her skin was not snow-white, but it had a malty gloss, allowing her to exude a healthy beauty.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is the first leg of our trip, and it is also the most important leg. Felicitous Rain Lord did not give the standard required for me to become his disciple, so I'll create a standard for Felicitous Rain Lord.”</p>
<p>“I'll make Felicitous Rain Lord pay attention to me.” The young man said confidently. The girl beside him gently bowed and said, “Young master will definitely become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple.”</p>
<p>Chapter 924: Heavenly Slaughter Array</p>
<p>The Luo clan's royal palace covered an extremely expansive area. And in this wide area, the palaces and buildings only took up an extremely tiny portion of that area. Behind the royal palace, there was a wide expanse dotted with immortal mountains and spiritual grounds.</p>
<p>These immortal mountains was where Heaven Earth Yuan Qi gathered. It was a perfect place for cultivation.</p>
<p>“This is the back of the Luo clan's royal palace. Here, there are a hundred thousand immortal mountains. The deeper you go, the richer the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi is, but the more restricted the area is as well. In the deepest depths, even Mother lacks the authority to enter.” Luo Huo'er accompanied Yi Yun as she said along the way.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yi Yun was taken aback. “A restricted zone that even Her Majesty isn't allowed in?”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er nodded and said, “Yes, the Luo clan royal palace itself is atop a land with the clan's greatest spirit root. And it is because of this spirit root that this place was designated as a site for the royal palace.”</p>
<p>“Behind the royal palace, there are three Luo clan Supremacies in reclusion. One of them is the true person in power of the Luo clan — Third Empyrean Granduncle. He has been in reclusion for a hundred thousand years. During this period, only Father can communicate with him.”</p>
<p>The Third Empyrean Uncle!</p>
<p>Yi Yun exhaled lightly. He obviously knew about the Third Empyrean Uncle being the person who enjoyed the highest status in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>The emperor of the Luo clan could be changed. Be it Luo Huo'er or Prince Crimson Firmament, it would not deal much of an impact to the Luo clan as the Third Empyrean Uncle was the figure that represented the Luo clan's soul.</p>
<p>The Third Empyrean Uncle did not clearly indicate any support for any of the heirs to the throne. If he were to make any indication, there was no need for Prince Crimson Firmament and Luo Huo'er vie for it.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er took Yi Yun deep into the expanse behind of the royal palace before stopping in front of a canyon.</p>
<p>On the side of the canyon, there were Luo clan royal palace guards guarding the area. After Luo Huo'er flashed a token, the guards knelt down in respect, allowing Yi Yun to enter the canyon.</p>
<p>This was where the Luo clan's Heavenly Slaughter Array was located.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Slaughter Array could simulate a Shura battlefield. Constant battles would happen upon entering the Heavenly Slaughter Array. Through battle, one's combat will was honed while pushing them to their limit.</p>
<p>Although the Heavenly Slaughter Array was partially an illusionary array, the battle process was completely realistic. This was because the opponents that appeared in the Heavenly Slaughter Array were not simple illusions, they were true existences.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er said, “Decades ago, the war between the Luo clan and the Fey Phantasm Sect allowed the Heavenly Slaughter Array to become richer. Many of the fiends of the Fey Phantasm Sect, be they young or old, were captured alive after they lost their ability to fight. Their souls were refined into the Heavenly Slaughter Array, becoming corpse puppets of the Heavenly Slaughter Array!”</p>
<p>“Little Yun, when you enter the Heavenly Slaughter Array, you will be able to fight those fiends of the Fey Phantasm Sect!”</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er made this remark, her eyes revealed a rare coldness.</p>
<p>Although it was not considered to be merciful to refine a live person into the Heavenly Slaughter Array, it was a war that determined the survival of a clan, so how could they show kindness to the enemy? They had to be cruel when needed.</p>
<p>Refining the fiends of the Fey Phantasm Sect into the Heavenly Slaughter Array was a pretty wise choice. It allowed the Luo clan disciples to experience a simulated battle with strong Fey Phantasm Sect members during their cultivation. It would also prevent them from being caught unprepared on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Yi Yun never expected to be able to witness the strong Fey Phantasm Sect members so soon. This filled his heart anticipation. The Fey Phantasm Sect's cultivation methods were different to the Luo clan's.</p>
<p>By being able to see the different cultivation methods and combat styles of the world was extremely beneficial for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The array flashed as Yi Yun stepped into the it…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the bustling Luo clan royal capital, there was a street named Luo Water Street. The street was not straight and it was filled with bends like a meandering river. This gave it its name.</p>
<p>Luo Water Street was flourishing and it could be said that every inch of ground here was worth its weight in gold. A small shop that was ten square feet in size was worth more than ten thousand World Stones.</p>
<p>Beside the entrance of Luo Water Street stood a restaurant that was famous in the entire Luo clan royal capital. Its name was Luo Water Restaurant, and it did not allow entry to typical patrons. Just wealth enough was insufficient, one needed sufficient status as well.</p>
<p>The prices in Luo Water Restaurant were extremely high, and for the lounge on the seventh level, it was only given to the most important patrons. A simple dish would be worth more than a thousand World Stones. People who could sit here to dine were typically members of large family clans or even princes and princesses.</p>
<p>At this moment, on the seventh level of Luo Water Restaurant, there was a table filled with spiritual food made out of the most valuable ingredients as well as ambrosia that contained the richest Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>“For Felicitous Rain Lord to take in a disciple, it is truly an extraordinarily grand occasion. It was just him revealing a tiny bit of his intentions without affirming it, yet it has stirred the entire alliance. It seems there were many geniuses from everywhere coming to the Luo clan royal capital over the past few days. They probably do not wish to miss this grand event.”</p>
<p>The person who spoke was holding a wine glass in his hand that swirled with wine. He was dressed lavishly in a yellow robe. If Yi Yun were here, he would recognize him to be Prince Pingnan, who had recommended Yi Yun to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials!</p>
<p>Although Prince Pingnan was not Empress Xuan's son, he was one of her cadres. In order to help Luo Huo'er gather geniuses to participate in the Luo Divine Hall trials, he had gone through a great hassle. Having recruited Yi Yun, Empress Xuan had rewarded Prince Pingnan greatly.</p>
<p>Beside Prince Pingnan were a few people. According to their pecking order, their statuses surpassed Prince Pingnan. One of them was Supremacy Gulan's disciple, Jian Zhu as well as the White Fox clan genius, Wufeng.</p>
<p>In the warrior's world, strength determined the pecking order. Although he was a prince, he was inferior to Jian Zhu and Wufeng because his strength was only average.</p>
<p>“They are here just to join in the fun. If they were told that they could become disciples of a Divine Lord, they might not even believe it themselves.” Wufeng shook his head. “From my point of view, the most promising ones below a hundred years old are Princess Purple Spirit, Princess Xue'er, and if another is to be added, it would be Yi Yun. But between a hundred to three hundred years old, there are a lot more. For example, Chu Yunjian, Lin Xuanji… However, these are only people from the Luo and White Fox clans. The other large clans do not lack people either. I wonder what the chances of us winning are.”</p>
<p>Wufeng estimated that a Divine Lord would not accept someone more than three hundred years old as a disciple. The older one was, the more of their nomological cultivation was in place, so it was harder to nurture them.</p>
<p>“Princess Xue'er and Princess Purple Spirit? Interesting, but unfortunately, the chances of you winning is probably close to zero.” Suddenly, the fluttering voice of a woman with a teasing hint echoed.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu, Wufeng and the people at the table turned their heads around. They saw four people sitting on a table not far from them.</p>
<p>The person on the left was a beauty with malt-colored skin. Her voluptuous figure gave her a wild nature.</p>
<p>On the right was a bare-chested, muscular man, but his muscles were covered in scars. His weapon was extremely special. It was a pole axe.</p>
<p>And in between the two sat an ordinary-looking young man wearing azure-colored clothes.</p>
<p>In a warrior's world, due to Yuan Qi nourishing one's body, it resulted in plenty of handsome men and beautiful women. This young man was considered out of the ordinary. Although he looked ordinary, his eyes were extremely sharp. Furthermore, his pupils were red, as though they were two red clouds floating in the sky.</p>
<p>Beside the azure-clothed young man sat an old man. He wore a bamboo hat and he was covered in a cloak. He looked sinister and mysterious. There was a table of dishes placed in front of him, but the bowl and eating utensils in front of him were untouched, as though he did not even touch any of the food.</p>
<p>The female voice was the enchantress with malt-colored skin.</p>
<p>However, the enchanting woman was most likely a subordinate in this group of people. The person who was the leader was the ordinary-looking young man with red cloud-like pupils.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Wufeng asked with a frown. He was an admirer of Princess Xue'er. The frivolous comment had incurred the wrath of Wufeng. He did not tolerate others to mention Princess Xue'er in a dismissive manner.</p>
<p>“I'm Chi Zhuiyun 1, from the Oracle Fey Empire.” The man with the red pupils said with a calm voice, but it carried a sharpness of a sword that penetrated straight to the eardrums.</p>
<p>1. Literally means Crimson Chasing Clouds</p>
<p>Chapter 925: Chi Zhuiyun</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun? Oracle Fey Empire!?”</p>
<p>The people present did not have much of an impression regarding Chi Zhuiyun's name when they heard it. After all, the Oracle Fey Empire and the Luo clan were far apart geographically. Before the advent of the Fey Phantasm Sect, the two powers did not interact much. They would know the names of the Supremacies on each side and other general information, but they did not know anything about the younger talents.</p>
<p>“Who is Chi Zhuiyun? I've never heard of him!” A White Fox disciple who idolized Princess Xue'er sneered.</p>
<p>So what if he was an Oracle Fey Empire's genius? Be it the Luo clan or the White Fox clan, neither of them were inferior to the Oracle Fey Empire. How dare an ordinary genius of the Oracle Fey Empire belittle the flawless Princess Xue'er? Did he think that he was a paragon of excellence?</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was unperturbed by the young disciple's disdain for him. He only said slowly, “It's alright even if you have never heard of it. All of you will soon remember my name.”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun said these words with extreme confidence, but they were said in such a calm manner, as though he was not flaunting himself, but merely stating a fact.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu narrowed his eyes. He could tell that Chi Zhuiyun's cultivation realm was extremely terrifying, but he could not tell the how terrifying it was.</p>
<p>He exchanged glances with Wufeng. Wufeng remained silent, but he agreed with Jian Zhu's judgment.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Chi Zhuiyun's words, the White Fox disciple that had previously spoken said scornfully, “Remember your name? Hmph! Ever since Felicitous Rain Lord revealed his intention of taking in a disciple, all sorts of cats and dogs have jumped out, believing about their magnificence. Do you think that I do not know that Felicitous Rain Lord is in the Oracle Fey Empire? Aren't you also from the Oracle Fey Empire? If you were that good, is there a need for you to come to the Luo clan? You could have just stayed in the Oracle Fey Empire. Even if you didn't get selected as a Divine Lord's disciple, you should have participated in the selection. You were eliminated early on and you are coming here to the Luo clan to find some sense of existentialism!”</p>
<p>The White Fox disciple was extremely vicious with his words. Since Felicitous Rain Lord was in the Oracle Fey Empire, why didn't he stay in the Oracle Fey Empire if he were so confident? Why did he come to the Luo clan?</p>
<p>And what he said infuriated the group from the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun did not say a word, but the man sitting beside him who was covered in scars, suddenly threw out a punch!</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>Violent energies burst out of his fist. This punch stirred up a storm that swept through the seventh level of the Luo Water Restaurant!</p>
<p>The tables and cutlery in the seventh level were embroiled by the storm, but strangely, the storm left them unscathed. It was like the tables and chairs were in an alternate dimension, isolating them. However, the White Fox disciple who was targeted by the core of the storm could clearly feel an intense pressure. He was like a leaf in the middle of a terrifying storm, one that could be torn apart at any time.</p>
<p>There was no way for him to defend himself!</p>
<p>The White Fox disciple felt a deep sense of helplessness. All of his Yuan Qi had been sealed, preventing him from using any of his strength.</p>
<p>“Make way!”</p>
<p>At this moment, a shout resounded in the dazed White Fox disciple's ears. Wufeng had made a move!</p>
<p>Wufeng was appalled at the moment. The scarred man looked burly, so he was a strength-based warrior most likely, but the precise control that he had exhibited was staggering.</p>
<p>“Sou!”</p>
<p>A heavy sword slashed out, tearing the storm apart! A dense sword beam shot forward, flying at the scarred man's face!</p>
<p>But under the wanton assailment of the storm, the sword beam weakened as it progressed. It was constantly enervated to the point of being like a gentle breeze when it reached the scarred man, ruffling his hair.</p>
<p>“Bam!”</p>
<p>The sword beam and the storm vanished simultaneously, turning into nothingness. The tables, cutlery and dishes remained untouched, as though the killing intent and the explosion had never existed to begin with.</p>
<p>This was a manifestation of Wufeng and the scarred man's precise energy control. However, the scarred man was unarmed, but Wufeng had already used his sword!</p>
<p>Wufeng had a heavy expression. The scarred man was extremely strong, one that he would have difficulty handling.</p>
<p>At this moment, the scarred man chuckled and he grabbed the pole ax that was hanging on his back!</p>
<p>To use a weapon like a pole ax in a restaurant showed the absolute confidence that the scarred man had in controlling it.</p>
<p>Although he knew that the scarred man was redoubtable, Wufeng could not weaken his stance at this moment in time. It was tied to the White Fox clan's honor.</p>
<p>Wufeng stood up with his heavy sword in hand. At this moment, his shoulder was held by Jian Zhu. “Let me do it.”</p>
<p>Jian Zhu was much stronger than Wufeng!</p>
<p>He had already sensed that Wufeng was probably not the scarred man's match. Although Wufeng had seemingly controlled his energy through the slash of his sword perfectly, he was actually inferior to the scarred man. If this battle continued on, Wufeng was bound to lose.</p>
<p>Even Jian Zhu himself did not have the confidence of beating the other party.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this was only the scarred man. Chi Zhuiyun was still sitting down and drinking wine.</p>
<p>The difference was already apparent. Chi Zhuiyun was much more terrifying than he had imagined, someone that he was absolutely unable to handle.</p>
<p>Seeing Jian Zhu stand up, the elder beside Chi Zhuiyun leaned over and whispered a few words in his ear.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's sword-like eyebrows pricked up, “Oh? Supremacy Gulan's disciple?”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun glanced at Jian Zhu and said with a laugh, “So you are Jian Zhu. Before I left to come to the Luo clan, my housekeeper had given me a list of the geniuses in the White Fox clan and Luo clan. You should be honored to be listed on the list.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I do not care who is on the list, but with a list, it will save me a lot of trouble. At least I would not need to find an opponent one after another. But now, it seems like the people on the name list are only average, just like you. It is slightly disappointing for me. Luo Sha is more than sufficient to defeat you.”</p>
<p>The Luo Sha that Chi Zhuiyun mentioned was the scarred man beside him.</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, pride flashed across the scarred man's face. Clearly, he disparaged Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu's face sank. He was a calm person and he did not enjoy the thirst of prevailing over others. But today, he was suppressing the angry pangs of fire in his heart as well.</p>
<p>“No match? Then let me learn from this!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha! You are free to pick the venue. Here, or the arena!” Luo Sha said with a guffaw.</p>
<p>“Just here, take this!”</p>
<p>Jian Zhu attacked with his sword. He was the strongest person among the White Fox clan and Luo clan disciples that were sitting here. If he could not even beat Luo Sha, he would be too embarrassed to continue sitting here today.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu used all his strength with that strike. And at this moment, Luo Sha brandished the pole ax and he cleaved it forward, as though he was collapsing a mountain. Such power made it feel like the restaurant was about to collapse!</p>
<p>The pole ax shimmered with a sanguine halo. On the long pole of the pole ax, a coiling blood snake materialized, cleaving heavily onto Jian Zhu's sword.</p>
<p>In a head-on clash between a sword and an ax, it would appear as though the sword was at a disadvantage, but Jian Zhu's sword beam was extremely sharp. He tapped thrice with his sword, splitting Luo Sha's coiling blood snake on his pole ax apart with three swords beams, piercing straight towards Luo Sha's throat!</p>
<p>Seeing the sword beams about to reach him, Luo Sha suddenly stretched his hand out and made a grabbing gesture with his fist.</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>The sword beam directly shattered, and maintaining the momentum, Luo Sha punched at Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>Jian Zhu's expression changed. He had never expected his opponent's fist to be so hard, to the point of resisting the sword beam. His guess from before wasn't wrong. His opponent was an extremely accomplished master when it came to physique cultivation.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu slashed once more, augmenting the sword momentum that clashed with Luo Sha head on.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>The continuous fighting evoked a violent explosion. But under the two people's restraint, the explosive energy that had nowhere to go seemed to have eyes as it blasted out of the seventh floor's windows, turning into a massive light pillar that shot into the void!</p>
<p>Countless people on the bustling Luo Water Street saw this scene. The light pillar was like a radiant sun beam that was miles wide and shot towards the sky. People realized that there was a huge battle happening in Luo Water Restaurant!</p>
<p>Who were the ones fighting?</p>
<p>This was the Luo Water Restaurant, yet they were fighting inside?</p>
<p>People were curious, but the seventh level of the Luo Water Restaurant was not a place that they were qualified to enter.</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>Seven pieces of cutlery shattered above the table in front of Jian Zhu!</p>
<p>Three plates were cleaved in half. The cuts were straight and smooth, as though they had been measured by a ruler.</p>
<p>As for the other bowls and plates, they completely turned to dust, splashing the food onto the table.</p>
<p>The energy control of the duo was still in no way perfect.</p>
<p>Although it could be said that this was a combination of Jian Zhu and Luo Sha's attacks, the shattered plates were on Jian Zhu's table, while everything was fine on his opponent's side.</p>
<p>In the previous foray, Jian Zhu was at a complete disadvantage!</p>
<p>Chapter 926: Brewing of the Storm</p>
<p>“Jian Zhu! Are you alright!?” Prince Pingnan said as he stood beside Jian Zhu.</p>
<p>Amongst the younger generation of the Luo clan, Prince Pingnan was the oldest, and his cultivation was at the Dao Manifestation perfection realm. He was able to see the process of the entire battle clearly. Luo Sha's use of the ax pole and his energy control exceeded his imagination. It was unknown how he had cultivated such a top body tempering technique.</p>
<p>And compared to Luo Sha, Chi Zhuiyun was obviously much more unfathomable.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan could tell his cultivation level and it was half-step Dao Manifestation.</p>
<p>Half-step Dao Manifestation was the transitional process when the laws on the Heaven Ascension Dao Tree began to condense together, but the Dao fruit had yet to take form.</p>
<p>The tiny difference in cultivation level was typically nothing for elites like Jian Zhu, but when the opponent was also an elite, it was completely different.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan suspected that without him, even if all of them joined forces, they were still no match for Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>“Let's go!”</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan stood up, since their stance was lacking in formidability, it was meaningless to for them to stay behind.</p>
<p>Jian Zhu was not willing to be outdone, but he nodded his head.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Prince Pingnan turned to look at Chi Zhuiyun and said, “Today, we may be inferior, but our Luo clan and the White Fox clan are filled with young talent. Gaining victory against us is nothing.”</p>
<p>“Heh!” Chi Zhuiyun scoffed as he drank from cup of wine in his hand. “On my trip to the Luo clan, I will be visiting every young elite of the Luo clan and the White Fox clan! However, I believe that very few people are worth getting my hands dirty.”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's words were filled with confidence from beginning to end, but he truly had the power backing his boastful words.</p>
<p>Be it Luo Sha or the girl, who were both beside Chi Zhuiyun, their strength was extraordinary. Jian Zhu was not even able to match any one of them, so if he could not defeat any of the two, there was no reason for Chi Zhuiyun to do anything.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan's expression sank. “You are planning on trampling on the Luo clan and the White Fox clan so you can to attract Felicitous Rain Lord's attention in order to become his disciple?”</p>
<p>Since Chi Zhuiyun came from the Oracle Fey Empire and he was planning on challenging all of the geniuses of the Luo clan and the White Fox clan, his goals were self-evident.</p>
<p>“It won't only be the Luo clan and the White Fox clan, it will be the entire alliance. I know that when all of you learned about Felicitous Rain Lord's intention of finding a disciple, you had the extravagant wish of becoming his disciple, but I will tell you that none of you are qualified. Furthermore, I do not need to use such a method to attract Felicitous Rain Lord's attention. He has already summoned and met me.”</p>
<p>Oh? Felicitous Rain Lord's summoning?</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan heart sank. At this moment, the malt-colored skin girl beside Chi Zhuiyun said proudly, “Our young master has already put the elites of several factions in the alliance in their place during our Oracle Fey Empire trials. Later on, our young master received Felicitous Rain Lord's summoning and after seeing our young master's Dao Domain, he nodded his head to express his recognition!”</p>
<p>Among all of the young elites in the entire Oracle Fey Empire, only Chi Zhuiyun had received Felicitous Rain Lord's recognition by displaying his Great Dao Dao Domain. Any ordinary Dao Domain was obviously insufficient in obtaining Felicitous Rain Lord's recognition, so this meant that Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain was far from ordinary.</p>
<p>Prince Pingnan's expression turned ugly. This person wanted to trample on all of the geniuses of the alliance in order to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple!</p>
<p>With that, the battle was no longer limited to their group and Chi Zhuiyun, it had extended to the entire Luo clan.</p>
<p>This battle could not be lost!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When Prince Pingnan, Jian Zhu, and company appeared at the entrance of Luo Water Restaurant, there were several people who had gathered around it. All of them knew about the battle that had taken place on the seventh level of Luo Water Restaurant.</p>
<p>“It's a prince!”</p>
<p>Few people recognized Prince Pingnan, but they recognized the princely robe.</p>
<p>“They are both elites of our Luo clan and the White Fox clan. Who was so dumb to fight them!?”</p>
<p>The crowd discussed in a feverish pitch, but the misunderstanding sounded harsh on Jian Zhu's ears.</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan obviously believed that their elites were powerful, but the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was large. There was no limit in the universe.</p>
<p>They could only hope that Princess Purple Spirit could match Chi Zhuiyun…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>News of the battle that happened at Luo Water Restaurant was quickly spread by people on Luo Water Street. It was unknown who had managed to discover the identity of the opponents, but it was made know that the opponents were from the Oracle Fey Empire's younger generation.</p>
<p>If this were ordinary times, it was still a good topic of discussion, but it would not have garnered so much attention.</p>
<p>But now, with a Divine Lord taking in a disciple, a battle amongst elites in the Luo clan royal capital was too eye-catching, especially when it was a battle between the Luo clan and the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>This news proliferated at an astonishing rate.</p>
<p>As the battle process was unseen by the people on Luo Water Street, the information that spread was mostly exaggerated. It resulted in several versions, with the outcome of the battle being uncertain.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, news after news spread around the streets!</p>
<p>Indeed, there was someone from the Oracle Fey Empire who was challenging the geniuses of the Luo clan and the White Fox clan one after another.</p>
<p>First, it was Luo Mo, who was easily defeated by a genius from the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>Next, it was the Shadow Twins. Nongyue was defeated by a girl from the Oracle Fey Empire, while Nongying fought an intense battle for a hundred moves before the battle ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Although it was a draw, the opponent had challenged Nongyue before Nongying, with less than thirty minutes in between the battles. As a result, it was obvious who was superior.</p>
<p>People also began to know the names of the challengers from the Oracle Fey Empire. They were Luo Sha, Demon Girl, and Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>The most mysterious one, Chi Zhuiyun, never fought anyone yet, but people heard rumors that Chi Zhuiyun was the only person in the entire alliance who was recognized by Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>The trip that the Oracle Fey Empire took to the Luo clan was only for Chi Zhuiyun to prove his strength!</p>
<p>Xuan Junyue was the fourth person from the Luo clan and White Fox clan to be challenged. He was one of Empress Xuan's men, and he was also the strongest amongst Empress Xuan's family clan's younger generation. Before Yi Yun appeared, Xuan Junyue was the backbone of Empress Xuan's battle with Empress Luo.</p>
<p>During the Luo Divine Hall trials, Xuan Junyue had gone to the White Fox clan and obtained stellar results.</p>
<p>This time, there was finally a piece of good news. After battling Luo Sha for a long time, Xuan Junyue finally managed to defeat him with a slight edge in a tough battle.</p>
<p>However, this only piece of good news was not something that was worth being happy about. This was because Xuan Junyue was older than Luo Sha, and secondly, Chi Zhuiyun had yet to fight!</p>
<p>How powerful was this person who had been recognized by Felicitous Rain Lord?</p>
<p>No one knew for sure.</p>
<p>The White Fox clan and the Luo clan still had Luo Huo'er and Princess White Fox, as well as Yi Yun, who had entered reclusion for eighteen years straight.</p>
<p>They were the final bedrock that the White Fox clan and the Luo clan could rely on. Without a doubt, Chi Zhuiyun would have to fight, and the battles would be the center of attention!</p>
<p>Immediately, the entire Luo clan royal capital was immersed in a calm before the storm. The challenges that the Oracle Fey Empire had undertaken were brewing. People were waiting for the arrival of the final battle.</p>
<p>And on this day, news finally came out that Chi Zhuiyun was going to fight.</p>
<p>What caught people by surprise was that he did not challenge Princess White Fox or Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>But… it was a genius who had been long famous in the White Fox clan — Chu Yunjian!</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian had long stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm, having condensed space-time Dao fruits!</p>
<p>As for Chi Zhuiyun, he was only in the half-step Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>Chapter 927: Yi Yun in the Heavenly Slaughter Array</p>
<p>“Oh? Chi Zhuiyun wants to challenge Chu Yunjian!?”</p>
<p>In Crimson Firmament Palace, Bai Yueqing, Prince Crimson Firmament, and Chu Yunjian were drinking wine when they heard the news.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian was Bai Yueqing's subordinate, and in the White Fox clan, Chu Yunjian was regarded by Bai Yueqing as a first-class guest. This allowed Chu Yunjian to sit alone with a friend in a pavilion outside the emperor's palace while waiting to be summoned by Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Bai Yueqing believed that when the Oracle Fey Empire's Chi Zhuiyun came to the Luo clan, he would finally challenge Luo Huo'er and Princess Xue'er, and of course, the best outcome was Luo Huo'er being defeated by Chi Zhuiyun before Xue'er turned the tide.</p>
<p>But they never expected that Chi Zhuiyun had not chosen to challenge Luo Huo'er, but he challenged Chu Yunjian instead.</p>
<p>“That Chi Zhuiyun is way too arrogant!”, said a sullen Bai Yueqing before he glanced at Chu Yunjian and added, “Yunjian broke through to the Dao Manifestation several years ago, condensing a sword Dao fruit and space-time Dao fruits. With the space-time Dao fruits having seven leaves, they were of excellent quality. Even if Chi Zhuiyun had condensed a Dao fruit, he was not necessarily superior to you, Yunjian, what more him having yet to reach the Dao Manifestation realm.”</p>
<p>As Bai Yueqing spoke, Chu Yunjian shook his head and said, “Your Highness, this lowly one knows my own strength very well. That Chi Zhuiyun isn't simple, but he is at half-step Dao Manifestation. Once he manifests his Dao, the Dao fruit that he manifests will definitely surpass me, but… that is after he manifests his Dao. Now, he has yet to manifest his Dao fruit, and he wants to leapfrog and challenge me… ”</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian gulped down the glass of wine in hand and he no longer spoke another word.</p>
<p>“Haha! Brother Yueqing, there's no need to be angry. That Chi Zhuiyun may be arrogant, daring to declare that he alone will trample our Luo and White Fox clan. If he had limited it to the Heaven Ascension realm, that would have been fine, but to challenge Brother Yunjian in his first battle, that's good. Brother Yunjian can take the edge off his spirit, letting him know the difference between the Dao Manifestation and the Heaven Ascension realm!”</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament and Bai Yueqing were allies. Both of them supported each other in order to support their respective inheritance of the throne.</p>
<p>Now, with Chi Zhuiyun challenging Chu Yunjian, Prince Crimson Firmament would be very happy to see Chu Yunjian repress Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>The news of Chi Zhuiyun battling Chu Yunjian had caused a great sensation in the Luo clan royal capital. Chi Zhuiyun and company had already been in the Luo clan royal capital for more than ten days. The royal capital was not given a breather in those days because there was a huge battle every other day!</p>
<p>A battle between the best amongst geniuses was an exciting event, what more it had the Luo clan and White Fox clan's honor on the line.</p>
<p>The venue of Chu Yunjian and Chi Zhuiyun's battle was decided to be on the southern desolate mountain plains in the western suburbs of the royal capital.</p>
<p>The southern desolate mountain plains were several million miles wide, and due to the sparse population, it was a venue where many warriors used to spar. On this day, at the brink of dawn, groups of warriors flew out of the royal capital and rushed to the southern desolate mountain plains. Soon, the expansive desolate plains were filled with hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>“There's so many people!”</p>
<p>“It hasn't even begun. Once the battle begins, the number of people might even increase several-fold!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While Chi Zhuiyun and Chu Yunjian's battle was ongoing, Yi Yun had been in reclusive cultivation in the Heavenly Slaughter Array for more than ten days.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Slaughter Array was truly an eye-opening experience for Yi Yun. Compared to the battles against the Ancient Fey in the Fey Refining Rock array, fighting against warriors and the situations that he encountered were multifarious in nature. Especially with the warriors being Fey Phantasm Sect disciples captured by the Luo clan, they were perfectly restored through soul-refining methods, both in terms of their combat techniques and the laws they cultivated.</p>
<p>And the opponents that Yi Yun chose were from the younger generation of the Fey Phantasm Sect. There were also many low-class Fey Phantasm Sect disciples that were stuck in the Dao Manifestation for several years. Even if he chose disciples from the younger generation, they were not formidable geniuses of the Fey Phantasm Sect. True Fey Phantasm Sect geniuses would typically not be caught alive by the Luo clan.</p>
<p>As such, when Yi Yun chose his opponents, he would bias it to those who were at the mid-stages of the Dao Manifestation or even higher.</p>
<p>He was already at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, and since his opponents were not geniuses, it was meaningless to battle cultivators below the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>With a flash of light, more than a dozen figures appeared in front of Yi Yun. These people exuded demonic auras. They were all Fey Phantasm Sect disciples, be it their aura or expressions, they were no different from when they were alive.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had experienced such battles for nearly a hundred times over the past couple of days. Under such intense battles, Yi Yun depended on the Purple Crystal to absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi to replenish his stamina, allowing Yi Yun to persist. Even Heaven Fey with top bloodlines were far inferior to Yi Yun's Purple Crystal through the endurance that they gained from the power of their bloodline.</p>
<p>The figures charged at Yi Yun, and the person who was leading the charge had a gigantic python coiled around him. The python stuck its black tongue out, while its amber pupils were filled with cold killing intent. Back when this Fey Phantasm Sect disciple was refined, the gigantic python had been refined into the Heavenly Slaughter Array along with him.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>Without any change in expression, runic patterns flashed on Yi Yun's sword. With a thrust of his sword, it moved like lightning and penetrated the python's mouth, before piercing the back of its head, straight into its master's throat!</p>
<p>Puah!</p>
<p>Blood splattered as an instant kill was achieved!</p>
<p>A Fey Phantasm Sect disciple at the peak of the early stages of the Dao Manifestation realm was killed easily by Yi Yun like he was chopping vegetables. He did not have the opportunity to use the moves and laws that he had comprehended in life because Yi Yun's sword was just too fast. Furthermore, the sword was augmented by the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's Dao patterns!</p>
<p>Yi Yun could sustain for prolonged periods of time by using such a combat style, without summoning the entire 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. He could battle until the end.</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect disciple that was penetrated by the sword convulsed as he collapsed onto the ground. The hatred and indignant look on his face was probably the same expression that he had when his soul was refined, and it was perfectly displayed once again.</p>
<p>Killing the enemy with one strike, Yi Yun had an indomitable stance. Circulating the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra', sword beams flew in every direction.</p>
<p>Cha! Cha! Cha!</p>
<p>The sword beams interwove in the space in the Heavenly Slaughter Array. Wherever they passed, the demons summoned by the Fey Phantasm Sect disciples, the corpse guardians and the puppets that they refined were all slain!</p>
<p>And at this moment, an opponent at the Dao Manifestation perfection realm appeared in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At the Dao Manifestation perfection realm, he was an entire realm above Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The opponent was an elder who was as thin as bones. He looked like a starving ghost that had crawled out from hell.</p>
<p>Such warriors that were left trapped in the Dao Manifestation and their entire lives, their foundations, and nomological insights were limited. However, they could not be underestimated. Dao Manifestation realm warriors had extremely long lives and in their extended lifespans, they would research all sorts of strange battle techniques after knowing that there was no hope for them to make any further breakthroughs. Therefore, they were difficult opponents.</p>
<p>This was a pretty good opportunity for Yi Yun to test his strength.</p>
<p>“Phew&ndash;”</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect elder disrobed himself, exposing his thin body. And his body was covered in black balls.</p>
<p>The black balls were embedded in the thin elder's body. The surface had a black metallic luster. When Yi Yun focused on them, he realized that they were worms, sucking on the Fey Phantasm Sect elder's blood.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned. This elder was using his blood to feed the worms. It was a repugnant scene.</p>
<p>Chapter 928: Chuyun's Battle</p>
<p>“Buzz——”</p>
<p>Accompanying resonating sounds that gave one a chill, the black worms flew out of the Fey Phantasm Sect elder's body like a black storm and flew straight at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>There were thousands of worms, and it was unclear how they were stored in the Fey Phantasm Sect elder's thin frame.</p>
<p>“Thousand Snow Domain!”</p>
<p>With a thought, 999 flying sabers materialized around him. The saber array clashed with the black worms as swaths of black worms were sliced apart by the flying sabers.</p>
<p>In the Heavenly Slaughter Array, the flying sabers used by Yi Yun were standard issue weapons of the Luo clan, not the original Thousand Snow flying sabers. Therefore, when they were stained by the worms' blood, they lost a lot of their agility, as they showed signs of being corroded.</p>
<p>Interesting!</p>
<p>With another thought, a three-legged Golden Crow flew out from behind him. The power of pure Yang surged into his sword which he slashed out. A burning inferno befell as though the sun was descending, burning the worms to a crisp wherever the tongues of the burning flames licked.</p>
<p>The sword beam pierced through the swarm of worms, straight for the thin elder's throat!</p>
<p>At this moment, the Fey Phantasm Sect elder had a cold sneer on his face. A large black mist burst out from the front of his chest and after gaining freedom from the Fey Phantasm Sect elder, it streamed straight at Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>
<p>They were ten forbidding black bone needles!</p>
<p>Each bone needle was as long as a forearm, as though each one had a life of its own. As they drew out twisted black trajectories in the sky, they shot at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Seeing the bone needles, a thought flashed across Yi Yun's mind. Since the bone needles came from the elder's chest, were they refined from the elder's rib bones? The Fey Phantasm Sect's cultivation techniques were strange and appalling. He would definitely have suffered if he was taken by surprise by such attacks.</p>
<p>The elder's bone needles sealed Yi Yun's sword off and any path he could use to dodge them. A cruel smile suffused across the elder's face, as though he had already seen Yi Yun's terrible death.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not retreat and he accelerated instead. Yuan Qi spread out as the nomological fragments of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence augmented his sword. Instantly, a golden light blasted straight into the bone needles.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's figure went from extreme motion to extreme stillness as the bone needles were minced by the sword.</p>
<p>A thousand-foot sword beam tore through the void, penetrating the thin elder's body!</p>
<p>Yi Yun flew with his sword in hand as he angled the sword tip to the ground. As for the Fey Phantasm Sect elder, he stood motionless on the spot. A huge gaping hole had appeared in his chest. His innards looked as though they had been burned by lava, but what flowed wasn't lava, it was boiling blood.</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect elder was reduced to flying ash after he issued a vicious and indignant cry.</p>
<p>Yi Yun exhaled slightly. The sword from before looked simple, but it was a sword move that Yi Yun had come up in the eighteen years he spent in the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was something that he could not fully wield, but being able to use the laws in the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence flexibly gave Yi Yun's sword moves a power that made them completely different from before.</p>
<p>It could be considered that Yi Yun had created his own Sword Dao.</p>
<p>The deeper he went into the Purple Crystal, the more the images he saw from the Purple Crystal's memories made him marvel at the complex martial paths and the grandness of the world.</p>
<p>Previously, before seeking an audience with Emperor Luo, someone had said that the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was only a mystic technique, which made it impossible to be condensed into a Dao fruit. However, as a cultivator of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, Yi Yun knew very well that this was not just a mystic technique. Yi Yun was looking forward to what the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence would condense into when he truly stepped into the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>“Continue!” Yi Yun faced his next opponent, knowing nothing about what happened in the outside world.</p>
<p>At this moment, the southern desolation mountain plains were filled with people. Everyone was here to witness the battle of Chi Zhuiyun and Chu Yunjian.</p>
<p>One was an Oracle Fey Empire disciple that suddenly arrived to instantly wipe out the Luo and White Fox clan disciples, while the other was a space-time swordsman, who had long established his name.</p>
<p>The people who came to watch the battle were basically members of the Luo clan and the White Fox clan. They hadn't heard about Chi Zhuiyun much, but they had long heard of Chu Yunjian's fame.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had challenged the famous Chu Yunjian, and with him being a realm lower, they were here to see how Chi Zhuiyun would pay the price for his arrogance.</p>
<p>However, no one was happy when they truly witnessed the battle process.</p>
<p>The intense battle had been going on for fifteen minutes, but the scene that they imagined of Chu Yunjian trampling Chi Zhuiyun did not happen.</p>
<p>Indeed, Chi Zhuiyun looked as though he was suppressed by Chu Yunjian's keen sword moves. He defended more than he attacked, as though he was steadily losing ground, but he remained unbeaten.</p>
<p>As this went on, the audience turned anxious, like it was just shy of the final shove that would determine the outcome.</p>
<p>“Is that all you have? This is all your strength?” During the intense stormy battle, Chi Zhuiyun suddenly spoke. His words were extremely clear as sword and spear clashed. It could be heard throughout the desolate plains.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Chu Yunjian's sword-like eyebrows pricked up.</p>
<p>“If that is the case, I'm very disappointed. A White Fox clan genius at the early stages of the Dao Manifestation is nothing much after all.” As Chi Zhuiyun said this, the Yuan Qi around him changed.</p>
<p>It turned rich with bloodlust that even people dozens of miles away could sense it.</p>
<p>It was like they had entered hell. Wherever their eyes landed, it was a gray background. Crimson clouds filled the sky, burgeoning to a point of them bleeding blood. And the ground was now filled with rugged rocks, with minced meat hanging on them. The ground was scattered with bone fragments.</p>
<p>It was a Shura battleground!</p>
<p>Dao Domain? This was Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain?</p>
<p>People had heard that Chi Zhuiyun had used his Dao Domain to gain Felicitous Rain Lord's attention, allowing him to be summoned by Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Now, with his Dao Domain being activated, it had immersed a million warriors within it, and it was like they had all fallen into a trance.</p>
<p>A so-called Dao Domain was actually a tiny world formed by laws.</p>
<p>In the Universe, before every boundless world was formed, the laws were first fixed in place.</p>
<p>Chaos evolved into Yin-Yang and space-time, before forming the five elements, followed by all matter.</p>
<p>When a warrior's nomological insight reached a certain realm, they could create worlds. Of course, creating a world was impossible for a Dao Manifestation realm warrior. They could only create a domain.</p>
<p>A Dao Domain's effects were very limited, but to be able to influence a million people instantly like what Chi Zhuiyun had done was quite astounding!</p>
<p>“It's over. As long as you are within my Dao Domain, no one at the same realm as me can undertake my spear. Your cultivation realm may surpass me, and you may have insights into space-time Great Dao, but unfortunately, your space-time laws did not integrate themselves. You are not my match.” As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, he thrust his spear out!</p>
<p>All the bloodlust and killing aura in the Dao Domain gathered around his spear as it swept towards Chu Yunjian.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian's eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“Even if my space-time laws did not integrate themselves, it is still enough!”</p>
<p>Space-time Sword Dao — River of time!</p>
<p>In the sky, a surging river appeared out of nowhere. One of the 12 Fey Gods of ancient times — River of Forgetfulness. Its manifestation was that of a river of time.</p>
<p>The river of time that Chu Yunjian cast was far inferior to the standard of the River of Forgetfulness, but it had reached a nascent stage.</p>
<p>A sword went upstream against the river of time, like a swimming fish in the river that stabbed straight at Chi Zhuiyun's throat!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's expression turned cold. The spear that he wielded thrust out like a flood dragon in the river!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The desolate plains rumbled as the million warriors felt the surging bloodlust. Their vision turned a deep shade of red.</p>
<p>They tried their best to widen their eyes to focus, but all they saw in the sky was Chi Zhuiyun. Standing mid air with spear in hand, he looked cold.</p>
<p>As for Chu Yunjian, he had been pushed dozens of miles back. Although he was also flying mid air, his robes were stained with blood and his face was pale. He could not curb the trembling of his sword-wielding hand.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, all of the million warriors in the desolate plains fell silent.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian had been defeated? This was not a life-and-death battle. It was just a challenge. Being defeated by one strike was also defeat.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian had been suppressing Chi Zhuiyun from the very beginning, with victory at hand. However, the moment that Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain appeared, the outcome of the battle was reversed. The audience never expected that.</p>
<p>A Dao Manifestation warrior… and a White Fox clan genius at that that had lost to Chi Zhuiyun, who was at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>Chapter 929: Elites Assembled</p>
<p>More than a million people had witnessed the battle in the Luo clan royal capital, including eminent figures like Prince Crimson Firmament and Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Seeing Chi Zhuiyun being defeated, Bai Yueqing felt as though he had been punched in the face.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian, who he counted on, had been defeated!</p>
<p>“Brother Yunjian!”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing's figure flashed and arrived beside Chu Yunjian to hold on to him.</p>
<p>It had to be said that although Bai Yueqing was an arrogant person, he was still a person who showed concern to his subordinates. At that moment in time, it could be said that he should have been ashamed since his subordinate, Chu Yunjian, had been defeated by someone at a lower realm than him in front of a million people. However, as heir to the White Fox clan's throne, Bai Yueqing stood beside Chu Yunjian and weathered the adversity together.</p>
<p>“I'm fine.” Chu Yunjian looked at Bai Yueqing with a wry smile. “Your Highness, I have disappointed you…”</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian felt ashamed, but Bai Yueqing waved his hand and said, “Victory and defeat are both common in battle. You do not need to feel remorse. It's only that Chi Zhuiyun…”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing looked at Chi Zhuiyun as the corners of his mouth twitched. Chi Zhuiyun's strength had far exceeded his imagination. A Dao Domain that could influence a million people was astounding, to begin with.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that Chi Zhuiyun, a warrior at half-step Dao Manifestation that was able to cultivate his Dao Domain to such a standard, had gained Felicitous Rain Lord's recognition.</p>
<p>“It's a Dao Domain that is related to massacres…” Chu Yunjian said. “In his Dao Domain, my heart of the sword was affected, as though the Dao Domain had triggered my mental demons.”</p>
<p>Thinking back to his experienced inside the Dao Domain, Chu Yunjian's heart was still fluttering with fear.</p>
<p>He looked at Chi Zhuiyun, while Chi Zhuiyun also looked back at him.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian had been cultivating for a hundred years. He had always surpassed his peers, but now, he had been defeated by someone at a lower realm than him. In addition, in time to come, the gap between him and Chi Zhuiyun would only grow wider.</p>
<p>“Ten days later, I, Chi Zhuiyun, will challenge any young elite of the White Fox clan and Luo clan here on these grounds! Whoever has the confidence, come here, and I'll accept your challenge.”</p>
<p>After Chi Zhuiyun said this, he left in a beam of light. Luo Sha and Demon Girl followed closely behind.</p>
<p>The words he said before he left was heard clearly by a million people.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had challenged the entire Luo clan and White Fox clan!</p>
<p>If the young elites of the Luo clan and White Fox clan were wiped out by a single person, all the warriors from both clans would lose a great deal of prestige.</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing's eyelids twitched. Prince Crimson Firmament had also come beside Chu Yunjian. “Brother Yunjian, in your opinion, will Princess Xue'er be able to defeat Chi Zhuiyun?”</p>
<p>With Chu Yunjian defeated, the White Fox clan still had Princess Xue'er!</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian shook his head, “I can't predict it. Princess Xue'er's talent surpasses mine, but… she's still too young. Her cultivation level is only at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, slightly inferior to Chi Zhuiyun's, while I've lost despite being at the early stages of the Dao Manifestation realm. It will probably not be easy for Princess Xue'er to gain victory over Chi Zhuiyun.”</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian did not speak with certainty. After all, he could not predict the extent to which Princess White Fox had attained. “However… I have a feeling that during my battle with Chi Zhuiyun, he was not using his full strength. He has more powerful moves he did not use…”</p>
<p>When Chu Yunjian said this, Bai Yueqing and Prince Crimson Firmament felt their hearts skip a beat. The present generation of the Luo clan and White Fox clan was filled with talent. Princess White Fox and Luo Huo'er, as well as Yi Yun, were the ones with most promise to become Supremacies. Although Prince Crimson Firmament abhorred Yi Yun, he could not deny Yi Yun's talent.</p>
<p>Such young talent from the Luo clan and White Fox clan was going to be wiped out by a single person?</p>
<p>If that happened, the Luo clan and White Fox clan would undoubtedly be dwarfed by others in the alliance against the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>“Let's hope Xue'er can give us a pleasant surprise…” Bai Yueqing muttered to himself as he shook his head.</p>
<p>The million people left the desolate plains and returned to the royal capital. In less than a day, the news proliferated throughout the royal capital.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian had been defeated, while Chi Zhuiyun had challenged all the young elites of the Luo clan and White Fox clan!</p>
<p>It instantly caused quite a stir in the Luo clan royal capital!</p>
<p>People were only aware that Chi Zhuiyun came from the Oracle Fey Empire and that he was very powerful, but they never expected him to be so powerful, powerful enough for him to leapfrog a level to defeat Chu Yunjian.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his extremely conceited challenge had forced the Luo clan and the White Fox clan into a corner.</p>
<p>They could not lose. If two large sects were to lose to a single person, the Luo clan and White Fox clan would lose all face.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Oh? Chu Yunjian was defeated?” In Fenghua Palace, Dong'er hurriedly informed Luo Huo'er of the news, but Dong'er never expected for Luo Huo'er to begin clapping when she heard the news. “That Chu Yunjian is such a cocky person. I met him back when Father summoned us. I could have turned a blind eye if it was only Chu Yunjian, but his boss, that male fox, had eyes so high that they were stuck on the top of their heads as if they reigned supreme. Serves him right for being defeated!”</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er said this, Dong'er was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>The young lass blinked her flickering large eyes as she looked at Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Be it people from the Luo clan or the White Fox clan, they were extremely vexed hearing the news, afraid that the young elites of their respective clans would be wiped out by Chi Zhuiyun alone. But Princess Huo'er was on a completely different frequency.</p>
<p>“Princess, aren't you worried?” Even the dull-witted Dong'er began to worry that the Luo clan would lose to Chu Yunjian.</p>
<p>“What's there to worry? If he wants a fight, he'll get one!” Luo Huo'er said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>As she said that, her lips suffused a sneer. “That Chi Zhuiyun thinks he can create a standard by himself so that Felicitous Rain Lord would understand that he is a true genius. He also wants to let other factions in the alliance know that those weaker than him aren't even qualified to vie for the spot of Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple. It can make him famous and also benefit him. He sure has an ingenious plan.”</p>
<p>Princess knows so much…</p>
<p>Dong'er blinked as she pondered. She asked in a staccato manner, “Then…Princess, you are certain that you can defeat Chi Zhuiyun, right?”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's beautiful eyes glanced at her. “How would I know without fighting him!?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>If you don't, why are you appearing so bold and self-assured!?</p>
<p>“Don't worry. There are many others who can't sit idle such as my brother and that male fox. I'll just watch the show for now. However, why isn't Little Yun out of reclusion yet? I'm thinking of watching the good show with him.” said Luo Huo'er. Yi Yun had been in the Heavenly Slaughter Array for more than ten days.</p>
<p>If this were any ordinary reclusion, ten days was nothing. Even more than a decade was no big deal.</p>
<p>However, the Heavenly Slaughter Array was different. In there, he would have to face endless massacres.</p>
<p>To be embroiled in killing for more than ten days, especially with those insane figures from the Fey Phantasm Sect, a typical person would not have last so long.</p>
<p>And Yi Yun's reclusion continued on for another ten consecutive days without any signs of him coming out.</p>
<p>And by then, it was the day Chi Zhuiyun had scheduled his challenge to battle the geniuses of the Luo clan and White Fox clan!</p>
<p>The matter brewed throughout the period that spanned less than a month. After all, the ambassadors of the factions that made up the alliance were still in the royal capital, so they obviously knew of the matter. In addition, the matter had to do with Felicitous Rain Lord's recruitment of a disciple, so they had used various channels to spread the news out. In about ten days, Chi Zhuiyun's name had become famous in the entire alliance!</p>
<p>People from large factions like the World Margin Sect, Cloud Trail Empire, and Eternal Eventide Sea had rushed to the Luo clan in less than a month.</p>
<p>These people that came from the other factions of the alliance came for a myriad of reasons. Some were here to catch the buzz, eager to see Chi Zhuiyun sweep the Luo clan and the White Fox clan of their elites. There were also young elites from other factions that had their sights on Chi Zhuiyun. Therefore, many gathered in the Luo clan royal capital.</p>
<p>After all, there were many people who wanted to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple. These people had also learned that Chi Zhuiyun was a person who received an approving nod from Felicitous Rain Lord. If they defeated Chi Zhuiyun, wouldn't that mean they would obtain the recognition of Felicitous Rain Lord? They might even become a disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>Instantly, the Luo clan royal capital was like a raging storm with elites assembled! Emperor Luo, as well as the royal family of the White Fox clan, was stirred by this matter. Many people came because this battle determined the pride of the Luo clan and White Fox clan.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Yi Yun faded from prominence. After all, the matter had reached massive scales. There were too many people to pay attention to. Not only Yi Yun, even the attention on Luo Huo'er and Princess White Fox had diminished.</p>
<p>Chapter 930: Eternal Eventide Sea</p>
<p>As the date of Chi Zhuiyun's challenge loomed, all of the Luo clan royal capital's hotels and motels were filled to the brim with people. People could not even obtain a room, despite the amount of wealth they had. Many warriors ended up meditating on the southern desolate mountain plains, as they waited for the event to begin.</p>
<p>Some warriors even began to construct houses on the southern desolate mountain plains or they even began to erect their immortal abodes. Instantly, the uninhabited southern desolate mountain plains began to bustle. It was like a city was built overnight.</p>
<p>Now, the battle was no longer just a matter pertaining to the Luo clan and the White Fox clan. More and more people were embroiled in the matter, with many hoping to become famous from a single battle so they could gain Felicitous Rain Lord's attention.</p>
<p>“Zhuiyun, there are many people targeting you. You being in the limelight has now made you a target to become a stepping stone.” Yu Tianfeng said to Chi Zhuiyun as they sat in the Oracle Fey Empire's Ambassador Palace.</p>
<p>As an ambassador of the Oracle Fey Empire, Yu Tianfeng was very pleased to see Chi Zhuiyun cause such a stir in the Luo clan royal capital. This was a manifestation of the power that the Oracle Fey Empire had.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was sitting on a futon meditating. A nine-foot spear was silently floating in front of him.</p>
<p>“These people want to trample over me to gain fame, but that saves me the trouble. I was planning on going to the other factions and have a nice meeting with each and every one of them. Now it's even better, it can be done once and for all.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Chi Zhuiyun grabbed the spear. The cold sheen on the spear flashed in the darkness of space, like it was a fleeting star that appeared in the night sky before disappearing.</p>
<p>The spear's name was Bloodthirst, a name that originated from Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun looked up at the battle arena in the desolate plains. His eyes flashed with fighting spirit.</p>
<p>“I will definitely gain your recognition. I know that a simple bout alone might not be enough to let you think otherwise of me even if I were to defeat everyone, but that is only just the beginning. I will definitely make you take me in as a disciple.”</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, his figure flashed. Like a meteor that streaked through the sky, he flew towards the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Little Yun, stop staying in reclusion. You've been in there for so many days. It's turmoil out here, yet you are still in there. Hurry up and come out!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun had just undergone a bloody battle in the Heavenly Slaughter Array when he heard Luo Huo'er calling him from outside.</p>
<p>Yi Yun thought. Turmoil?</p>
<p>He walked out of the Heavenly Slaughter Array and he saw that Luo Huo'er was beaming, like she was extremely excited.</p>
<p>“What's the matter?”</p>
<p>“There's no time to explain. Hurry up and follow me. I'll tell you along the way!”</p>
<p>How could Luo Huo'er miss such a grand event that happened so rarely in the Luo clan?</p>
<p>When Yi Yun accompanied Luo Huo'er to the southern desolate mountain plains, he was astounded by what he saw.</p>
<p>Was this the legendary southern desolate mountain plains? There were too many people here!</p>
<p>Not only was there a large number of warriors. Houses, immortal abodes, and even hotels were erected on the plains.</p>
<p>To warriors, buying a portable abode was not expensive. With more people gathering, it was only natural that businessmen began to open restaurants. They just needed to erect a mobile abode on the desolate plains.</p>
<p>“Oh? There are quite a number of humans here… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun seldom saw humans in the Luo clan, while humans were nearly extinct in the White Fox clan. But now, Yi Yun saw several humans wearing black robes. However, they were quite different from the humans in the Tian Yuan world. They had black hair and purple eyes. Their facial features were more prominent and exquisite. They were good looking, regardless of their gender. Furthermore, they wore V-shaped golden accessories on their necks and the accessories had had unknown gems embedded in them. They had quite a mysterious beauty to them.</p>
<p>“They are people from the Eternal Eventide Sea.” Luo Huo'er said.</p>
<p>“Are they humans?” Yi Yun asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er shook her head, “They may look human, but they don't consider themselves to be human. Instead, they call themselves the Chosen of the Divinity. According to the records of the Eternal Eventide Sea, their ancestors were the chosen race of the Divinity. As they continued to multiply in numbers, they barred marriage with other humans in order to ensure that their bloodline wasn't diluted. From their point of view, ordinary humans are people who were abandoned by the Divinity, greatly inferior to their nobility.”</p>
<p>“The Chosen of the Divinity?” Yi Yun chuckled. It sounded like a religion from a different world.</p>
<p>“Don't scoff.” Luo Huo'er could tell what was on Yi Yun's mind. “They are quite capable. The Eternal Eventide Sea's strength is in no way weaker than the Luo clan. Although they are of equal strength, there are only a few million members in the Eternal Eventide Sea.”</p>
<p>“Oh? A few million?” Yi Yun was taken aback. How many people did the Luo clan have? The population numbered a trillion with 196 states, the royal capital, and the large family clans at least.</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide Sea only had a few million people, but its strength was comparable to the Luo clan's?</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that in a warrior's world, the number of people had little impact on strength. What truly mattered was the number and quality of mighty figures and geniuses. The former determined the faction's present strength, while the latter determined its future strength.</p>
<p>This meant that the number of mighty figures and geniuses that appeared out of a few million people in the Eternal Eventide Sea was comparable to the number produced by the Luo clan's population that numbered a trillion!</p>
<p>Yi Yun saw a few people from the Eternal Eventide Sea and indeed, amongst their younger generation, Heaven Ascension perfection and Dao Manifestation were the common cultivation realms. Furthermore, their auras were converged, making them seem unfathomably strong.</p>
<p>Under the same conditions, to be able to achieve this stage in the Luo clan meant a chance of entering the Luo Divine Hall trials. And this qualification was one in a billion!</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide Sea was not a power to be belittled.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, he saw a few young men from the Eternal Eventide Sea drinking tea while chatting in a makeshift tea hut.</p>
<p>“Who does that Chi Zhuiyun think he is? After merely winning a few battles in the Luo clan and beating a few tiny factions in a trial, he dares to claim that he will sweep the alliance!? What a joke. With our Eternal Eventide Sea here, we will teach him a lesson!”</p>
<p>“That's right, our Eternal Eventide's goddess is peerless. Chi Zhuiyun is nothing. The Oracle Fey Empire relies on the massive number of people that it has and they choose one or two geniuses that can barely make it from that number. That's how they prevent themselves from having too few geniuses.”</p>
<p>“As for the Luo clan, it's even worse. I heard that the Luo clan takes in any type of people. They can be Earth Fey, human, or even someone from the lower realms! How much distrust do they have of their bloodline? Despite having such a model, the ratio of geniuses that they have is just pathetic. Furthermore, the people that are selected aren't impressive either. There's no need to even talk about our Eternal Eventide goddess, just the two of us can reign supreme in the Luo clan. As for Senior Brother Ye Yi, he will be ranked top three in the Luo clan.”</p>
<p>Ye Yi, who the two youths from the Eternal Eventide clan were talking about, was sitting in the middle of the two.</p>
<p>Ye Yi looked young with black hair that cascaded down his body like a waterfall. He had the beauty of a woman and jade like fingers that were long and slender.</p>
<p>He was a beautiful young man with extremely exquisite looks. The accessory across his chest were different from the others. Unlike the V-shape ones that the others had, his accessory was a black pair of wings. It seemed like he enjoyed a different status.</p>
<p>Ye Yi did not comment on the duo's compliments, but Luo Huo'er could not stand hearing this.</p>
<p>“I was wondering where the two toads came from. Black all over, and their croaks are so harsh on the ears!”</p>
<p>“Oh!?” With Luo Huo'er's words fading away, the two men from the Eternal Eventide Sea, who had just spoken, immediately looked at Luo Huo'er!</p>
<p>Chapter 931: No need for Reason</p>
<p>Upon hearing Luo Huo'er's shout, Yi Yun rubbed his forehead. Luo Huo'er always had an explosive streak and she did everything on a whim. She was after all a princess, while the two members of the Eternal Eventide Sea probably enjoyed a status beneath Luo Mo's. Even Ye Yi, who enjoyed a slightly higher status than his two companions, was obviously inferior to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Their conversation could have been ignored actually. As a princess, there was no need for Luo Huo'er to be bothered about them. Yi Yun did not expect Luo Huo'er to directly hurl invectives at the members of the Eternal Eventide Sea, annoying them as a result.</p>
<p>They did not know Luo Huo'er's identity as well. The only thing to blame would be on Luo Huo'er because she did not like having a royal entourage. Typically, princes and princesses would have a grand procession, with plebeians shooed aside. They were not like Luo Huo'er, who would enter a crowd after changing into any random set of clothes. Why the hell would anyone know who she was?</p>
<p>“Which witless lass is this, for her to be squawking so much? Could it be that the both of you are from the Luo clan?”</p>
<p>The speaking man gave a look of disdain. As he spoke, he continued drinking his tea.</p>
<p>The other young man took a glance at Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er's clothes. With a judgment in mind, he guffawed, “Hahaha! They really are from the Luo clan. Why? Did my words hit a soft spot? From what I know, the Luo clan only has a Princess Purple Spirit that's fairly alright. And beneath her, there's some Yun guy. They only have two people. They are nothing impressive when compared to our Eternal Eventide clan.”</p>
<p>Some Yun guy?</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard this, he stroked his chin with a strange look. Was his existence that poor?</p>
<p>He turned his head and saw Luo Huo'er nearly bursting out in laughter when she heard them. She looked like she was enjoying the pleasure derived from his misfortune.</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head helplessly. The large clans were limited in their understanding of each other's talents. The Eternal Eventide clan probably heard of Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er only when they arrived in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>A smile harboring evil designs hung on Luo Huo'er's face. She produced a conjuration using her fingers and flicked them.</p>
<p>Seeing Luo Huo'er no longer speaking, the two disciples of the Eternal Eventide Sea chuckled and continued drinking their tea.</p>
<p>However, they never expected that as they drank their tea…</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide Sea disciples suddenly leaped up three feet high, as though they had drunk poison. Their bodies convulsed violently as they held their hands to their neck. Their faces flushed red as their eyes nearly popped out.</p>
<p>They opened their mouths in an attempt to spit the tea out, but the tea had long vanished. What they spat out were flames.</p>
<p>“Hu! Hu! Hu!”</p>
<p>The flames burned at an extremely high temperature. Be it the tea table or the ground, a hole burned through them wherever the flames touched!</p>
<p>“Hot! Hot!” An Eternal Eventide Sea disciple shouted in a muffled voice. “My tongue! Tongue!”</p>
<p>“Tongue?” Luo Huo'er feigned a look of surprise. “Tsk tsk tsk, oh my. Your tongue seems well-done… Barbecue pig's tongue. What you said earlier shows how witty your tongue is. Why are you so hard on yourself to go so far as to burn your own tongue?”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was one who never spared her words to infuriate others to the grave. Yi Yun watched secretly by the side in horror. This demonic lass was really not to be trifled with. The conjuration Luo Huo'er had produced had flown into the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples' tea cup in an undetectable manner. As a result, they had drunk the fire-elemental conjuration.</p>
<p>Just the two conjurations had resulted in such terrifying damage. Luo Huo'er's insights into fire-elemental laws had truly reached the crest of perfection.</p>
<p>Yi Yun estimated that the two poor souls would probably lose their tongues. A devilish girl like Luo Huo'er had not held back. The flames were not ordinary either. Yi Yun could discern very clearly through the Purple Crystal's vision that the flames were like tarsal maggots. The flames had pervasive energies, so the duo's protective Yuan Qi was completely insufficient to resist her conjurations.</p>
<p>Not only were their tongues damaged, even their oral cavities were burnt badly. Although it could be restored with heavenly treasures, it would result in them not being to eat or speak for several months. Furthermore, the cost of the heavenly treasures was not a small sum.</p>
<p>“Witch, I'll…I'll kill you!”</p>
<p>The two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples endured the pain as they shouted. Luo Huo'er gave a disdainful scoff. She nonchalantly picked up a pair of chopsticks on the table and flicked them.</p>
<p>“Whew! Whew!”</p>
<p>The two chopsticks flew straight at the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples like arrows!</p>
<p>Seeing the chopsticks flying at them, the Yuan Qi of the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples burst as they punched out while enduring their pain!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Energy blasted outwards like a volcanic eruption. Even divine wood grown for a hundred thousand years would be shattered into wood chips by the two punches, much less a pair of ordinary wooden chopsticks!</p>
<p>However, the pair of chopsticks was extraordinary in Luo Huo'er's hands. At the instant she threw out the pair of chopsticks, she had embedded laws into them. Now, the pair of chopsticks were flickering with fire-elemental runes on the surface as they exuded a mysterious air to them.</p>
<p>The highly-compressed fire-elemental energies caused the pair of chopsticks to ignite. Like two meteors, they streaked towards the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples!</p>
<p>“Peng! Peng!”</p>
<p>With the sounds of two explosive blasts, the punch blast from the duo was penetrated! Immediately following that, fire surged at their faces without any resistance.</p>
<p>The inferno blast apart, sending the duo flying back. Their hair was burnt, and radiated in all directions. Their faces were completely black from the ashes.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>Many people had witnessed the battle at the makeshift tea hut. They had seen the Eternal Eventide Sea disciples make the provocation before the red-dressed girl attacked them. In a few short seconds, she had beaten them so badly that even their parents would not be able to identify them.</p>
<p>Who was this red-dressed girl?</p>
<p>At this moment, the young man, whose neck hung an accessory that resembled a black pair of wings, stood up. He shattered his tea cup by tapping on it. The tea did not spill but was wrapped in Yuan Qi, as the concoction spun in mid air.</p>
<p>The young man tapped gently once again as the tea split into two clear streams and entered the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples' mouths.</p>
<p>The fire was extinguished by the tea, but their tongues were already burnt to a crisp.</p>
<p>They groaned in pain on the ground while Luo Huo'er looked at the young man. She had heard the two disciples addressing him as Senior Brother Ye Yi.</p>
<p>Although Ye Yi was relatively strong, he was clearly not the strongest person in the Eternal Eventide clan. Luo Huo'er gave Ye Yi a lazy glance and said, “Using a bit of water to extinguish my fire? Are you trying to flaunt your attainment in water-elemental laws?” Luo Huo'er said in derision.</p>
<p>Ye Yi said coldly, “For your fire-elemental laws to attain such a standard, you must be illustrious in the Luo clan, but… the two of them had only offended you with words, aren't you going too far by dealing such harm to them?”</p>
<p>“You can consider me rather benevolent. I helped them burn their tongues because their wagging tongues were too long. In many places and many occasions, uttering the wrong words can result in death!” Luo Huo'er said nonchalantly, with a faint dominance in her tone. Even Ye Yi was overshadowed by her dominance.</p>
<p>“In a warrior's world, it is nothing rare for a misspoken sentence to result in death. Many people are killed even without saying a word. There is no need for reason, and the reason is simply because… you are not stronger than the person killing you.”</p>
<p>While saying this, Luo Huo'er stood up as she played with the pair of chopsticks in her hand…</p>
<p>Chapter 932: Five Factions</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's words were infused with Yuan Qi, so although she spoke softly, it was extremely penetrating.</p>
<p>Ye Yi's swordlike eyebrows pricked up. “Interesting. You are right. There is no need for a reason for inferior warriors to be killed. Their only fault is their lack of strength. Then, I want to see whether you are stronger than me!”</p>
<p>As Ye Yi spoke, his eyes glimmered with fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Ye Yi was a martial fanatic who was militant in nature. He could not contain himself when facing an opponent like Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Instantly, the surrounding crowd turned excited.</p>
<p>They never expected how climatic the battleground of Chi Zhuiyun's challenge could become. Before he even appeared, there were already clashes between top geniuses.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Luo Huo'er only gave a lazy glance at Ye Yi and said, “You aren't qualified. If anyone wants to challenge me, get that whatever goddess from your Eternal Eventide Sea!”</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>Ye Yi's pupils constricted.</p>
<p>At this moment, a golden carriage suddenly rumbled through the sky. There were four dragon horses pulling the carriage with golden light shimmering from it! On the carriage, there was an orange emblem of a mountain.</p>
<p>Everyone looked up and someone said, “It's the World Margin Sect's carriage. Sitting in it is probably the number one disciple of the World Margin Sect, Tianya Haoyue.”</p>
<p>After the World Margin Sect, there was a resplendent green light that illuminated the firmament. A spirit vessel made of jade came floating over.</p>
<p>This was a spirit vessel of the White Fox clan. It was very likely that Princess White Fox was inside the jade spirit vessel.</p>
<p>Immediately following that, there was a black-bodied ancient chariot pulled by nine spirit birds that resembled black phoenixes.</p>
<p>“It's our goddess, Xi Ye, of our Eternal Eventide clan.” A member of the Eternal Eventide clan said in the crowd.</p>
<p>The two young Eternal Eventide clan disciples that had their tongues burnt by Luo Huo'er also mumbled the words 'goddess Xi Ye'. They looked excited and at the same time looked at Luo Huo'er, as though she would be taught a lesson in time to come.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er ignored the small fries of the Eternal Eventide clan. She stroked her delicate chin and looked at the black chariot of goddess Xi Ye. She muttered to herself, “Three men and three women. That will be interesting.”</p>
<p>With Chi Zhuiyun's challenge posed, a total of five factions were gathered here — the Luo clan, the White Fox clan, the World Margin Sect, the Eternal Eventide Sea, and the originator, the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>There happened to be three men and three women — Yi Yun, Chi Zhuiyun, Tianya Haoyue, Luo Huo'er, Princess White Fox, goddess Xi Ye.</p>
<p>Now, the five factions were gathered, but the people who truly wielded power like Emperor Luo, Empress Luo, Empress Xuan, and company did not appear.</p>
<p>After all, it was Chi Zhuiyun, a junior who had posed the challenge. In order to maintain their stature, these important figures did not appear in person.</p>
<p>Although they did not appear in person, it did not mean that they were paying no attention to the matter. In fact, the outcome of the battle was enough to make Emperor Luo nervous!</p>
<p>After all, not only did this matter pertain to the Luo clan's dignity, it also had to do with Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment!</p>
<p>At this moment in time, there was an array set up in the Luo clan royal palace. It projected everything that was happening in the southern desolate mountain plains. Emperor Luo was sitting on his throne while watching it with a heavy expression.</p>
<p>Beside Emperor Luo were various ministers and members of the royal family, who were also starting intently at the projection.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, there was no guarantee that the victor would become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, but the loser definitely lost all hopes of becoming his disciple!</p>
<p>Why would Felicitous Rain Lord accept a loser as his disciple?</p>
<p>At this moment in time, a red figure flashed in the crowd. With spear in hand, Chi Zhuiyun appeared above the desolate plains.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's eyes were bloodshot, and the spear he held behind him was nine feet nine. It shimmered with a cold glint of light.</p>
<p>Although he looked ordinary, Chi Zhuiyun had attracted everyone's gaze as he walked towards an empty space.</p>
<p>“He is Chi Zhuiyun, a person recognized by Felicitous Rain Lord.”</p>
<p>“As long as he is defeated, the halo that belongs to him would be augmented on us. We would turn famous from a single battle!”</p>
<p>The geniuses gathered on the desolate plains murmured in a discussion.</p>
<p>Although there was great allure in defeating Chi Zhuiyun, everyone knew that it was very difficult to defeat him.</p>
<p>In fact, most people did not expect themselves to defeat Chi Zhuiyun. As long as they demonstrated their strength at this event and stood in the limelight, they would gain the attention of the alliance even if they failed to gain the attention of Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>After Chi Zhuiyun appeared, he stood in mid air without a word.</p>
<p>At this moment, a middle-aged man appeared beside him.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was wearing a black robe and he looked highly-spirited. He was the Oracle Fey Empire ambassador deployed to the Luo clan — Yu Tianfeng.</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously remembered him. Back when they were summoned by Emperor Luo, Yu Tianfeng was sitting at a seat of honor just second to Emperor Luo.</p>
<p>“Everyone!” Yu Tianfeng spoke. “Zhuiyun's issuance of a challenge was only for him to meet the young elites of the alliance, but we never expected for it to cause such a stir. With so many of you gathered here, we have really troubled everyone.” Yu Tianfeng said with a chuckle, as though he sounded apologetic. However, even a blind man could tell that he was complacent with the sensational result.</p>
<p>“What does he mean meeting the young elites of the alliance. It's obvious he wants to trample on us to go higher.” Someone grumbled in private. Yu Tianfeng sure was thick-skinned.</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng ignored what was on the people's minds. He continued, “With so many people here today at the southern desolate mountain plains, there are true dragons and phoenixes amongst you, but there are also shams. It is impossible to allow any random person to challenge Zhuiyun. Neither does he have the time and effort to do so. The person challenged will not only be limited to Zhuiyun. Other than my Oracle Fey Empire, all the factions are free to spar with each other, but there are two points!”</p>
<p>“Every person is only given one chance at failure. Upon failure, they are not to fight again! And secondly… every faction is limited to having one person challenge Zhuiyun, not one more.”</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng's voice boomed throughout the southern desolate mountain plains, and when everyone heard this, they frowned.</p>
<p>Who did Yu Tianfeng think he was!?</p>
<p>What did he mean random person or shams? Although he had not explicitly referred to anyone, it was rather harsh on the ears on those who knew that they lacked the strength.</p>
<p>He was only an ambassador of the Oracle Fey Empire. If not for Felicitous Rain Lord owing a debt to Oracle Fey Empire's Imperial Patriarch, Yu Tianfeng would have been nothing!</p>
<p>With respects to challenging Chi Zhuiyun, for the southern desolate mountain plains to have these many elites gathered here, they were clearly here because of Chi Zhuiyun's challenge, but they were not here to challenge Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Now, with what Yu Tianfeng said, it was as though everyone was lining up to challenge Chi Zhuiyun. Who did Chi Zhuiyun think he was!? Ignoring the fact that Chi Zhuiyun was still not established as the number one person amongst the alliance's younger generation, even if he were the number one person, was it possible that prideful people like Tianya Haoyue and goddess Xi Ye to line up to challenge him? They would not want to degrade their stature.</p>
<p>“What we do here is none of your business!”</p>
<p>“Do you think this is a martial arts tournament? Are you the organizer? Why are you announcing the rules here!?”</p>
<p>There were chaotic shouts in the crowd. Clearly, they did not give a damn about what Yu Tianfeng had said.</p>
<p>Chapter 933: You are Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Instantly, there was a commotion. Yu Tianfeng was infuriated by this. Previously in the Luo clan royal palace, Emperor Luo had been extremely polite with him, but here, a bunch of juniors were showing him little respect.</p>
<p>Compared to the lofty Emperor Luo, these juniors were nothing!</p>
<p>Although Yu Tianfeng was angry, he could not do anything about it. Emperor Luo did not dare offend the Oracle Fey Empire because Felicitous Rain Lord owed a favor to the Oracle Fey Empire. It was destined to be critical in the alliance against the Fey Phantasm Sect, but these juniors could ignore any of that.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chi Zhuiyun walked forward. In fact, Yu Tianfeng, who had been conferred a nobility title in the Oracle Fey Empire but had relatively low talent, did not have as much weight when speaking compared to Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun said, “Regardless if it's me challenging you, or all of you challenging me, it's the same thing. I don't care at all! Today, I have set the stage for combat, only to fight the strongest person from each faction so we don't waste time. I don't care who you wish to battle, but I'll only fight four people today — Tianya Haoyue! Princess White Fox! Princess Purple Spirit! Goddess Xi Ye!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun directly named four people, and they happened to be from each of the four major factions. They were nearly the strongest.</p>
<p>“You alone want to battle us four?” Tianya Haoyue scoffed. “Chi Zhuiyun, I know that you are very strong, but if you want to fight one against four, aren't you being too overbearing!?”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was a proud person. He did not think of himself as being worse than Chi Zhuiyun. To deal with Chi Zhuiyun in a tag-team with the other three geniuses was something that Tianya Haoyue was unwilling to do. After all, even if he beat Chi Zhuiyun, it was nothing worth being proud about, much less talk about gaining the recognition of Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun gave Tianya Haoyue a glance and said, “It is up to you to do battle or not. I am open to fighting anyone of the four of you!”</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun, do not think that you are the center of the alliance's younger generation, with everyone revolving around you. I'm the one who wants everyone to challenge me!” Tianya Haoyue said coldly, “My take on this is we should choose a few more people, making up eight or even sixteen people. We can each do battle. Winning allows the next battle to happen, and the loser has to forfeit their place!”</p>
<p>The rule that Tianya Haoyue proposed had received a great number of people's approbation.</p>
<p>In such a battle, no one was the center of attention. It was a completely fair tournament, and it would not accentuate Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun sighed slightly and said, “If you want to, make it eight then. Having too many people is just a waste of time.”</p>
<p>If there were only five people, it was difficult to decide on the order of battle. By finding three 'substitutes', it would make it easier to assign the fights with eight people.</p>
<p>However, Chi Zhuiyun kept arrogantly insisting that it was a waste of time, inciting the wrath of others.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Haoyue, let us join the foray! I want to see how impressive Chi Zhuiyun is for him to be this overbearing!” In the World Margin Sect, a disciple spoke.</p>
<p>His name was Tian Yaping, he was definitely one of the leading figures in the World Margin Sect.</p>
<p>Although being a substitute did not sound pleasant to the ears, they were able to do battle after all. Many people wanted to do so. But in that case, there was a new problem. There were five factions present, but only three substitute spots. If each faction chose a person, there would be two additional people.</p>
<p>At this moment, Chi Zhuiyun spoke again, “Choose one person from each faction. Among the five, fight it out to decide on the three places!”</p>
<p>After saying that, Chi Zhuiyun did not speak another word. The crowd also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er smiled as she looked at Yi Yun. “Little Yun, it sure sucks for you to end up being a substitute!”</p>
<p>Being ridiculed by Luo Huo'er, Yi Yun helplessly stroked his chin. He could only accept being a substitute. He could only blame himself for not participating in the Luo Divine Hall trials to the very end. It resulted in him not even appearing on the Luo Divine Hall's final ranking.</p>
<p>In order for the other factions to understand the Luo clan and the White Fox clan's geniuses, they would first look at the rankings, so it was common for them to be unaware of Yi Yun's name.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was representing the Luo clan, and him taking the second spot was no surprise. Even Prince Crimson Firmament would not disagree to it.</p>
<p>With that, the name list was decided.</p>
<p>The second person each of the five factions chosen respectively were — Luo clan's Yi Yun, World Margin Sect's Tianya Ping, Oracle Fey Empire's Demon Girl, White Fox clan's Nongying and Eternal Eventide Sea's Ye Yi!</p>
<p>The five people were competing for three spots.</p>
<p>“Oh? So you are Yi Yun, and you must be… Princess Purple Spirit!?”</p>
<p>At the tea stall, Ye Yi and the two Eternal Eventide Sea disciples that had their tongues burnt finally learned about Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er's identity. They never expected that they had entered a conflict with Luo Huo'er, the person ranked first in the Luo clan!</p>
<p>It was no wonder that her attainment in fire-elemental laws had reached such an impressive level. A simple fire-elemental conjuration had been mysteriously drunk by them, resulting in their tongues being burnt.</p>
<p>“Interesting!”</p>
<p>Ye Yi looked at Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er. Luo Huo'er was in the first echelon. Before becoming one of the three people qualified to do battle, he had not right to challenge Luo Huo'er. As for Yi Yun… he was completely confident fighting against him!</p>
<p>Ye Yi was famous in the Eternal Eventide Sea. In fact, Ye Yi was eager to spar even with a person like Luo Huo'er!</p>
<p>So what if she was the number one genius in the Luo clan? The place of his birth only numbered several million people, yet the Eternal Eventide Sea was able to rank alongside various large factions. The level of the geniuses that his clansmen were at was nothing that the other factions could compare with.</p>
<p>Even if he failed to defeat Luo Huo'er in the end, Ye Yi believed that he would not be too inferior when compared to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>“Since you are Yi Yun, that's perfect. Leave the first battle to us! I wish that you will not disappoint me too greatly!” As Ye Yi spoke, he leaped and flew towards the battle arena stage.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Ye Yi, teach that punk an unforgettable lesson!”</p>
<p>“Screw him badly! Beat him up until his parents can't even recognize him!” Behind Ye Yi, the two Eternal Eventide disciples that got tormented by Luo Huo'er said with red faces.</p>
<p>However, as a result of their burnt tongues, what they said sounded muffled, and somewhat amusing.</p>
<p>They hated Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er to death. They could not offend Luo Huo'er, but Ye Yi could avenge them.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ye Yi was already on the arena stage. Yi Yun followed him in a very slow manner.</p>
<p>In this battle of geniuses, Yi Yun believed himself to be an expert as well, but he had been delegated as a substitute. Furthermore, typical experts would usually appear as a finalist, appearing only at the last few matches, but now, he was the first one to do battle. He was at quite a loss.</p>
<p>The moment that Yi Yun landed on the arena stage, the stage's surroundings erupted into a flood of cheers.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun! Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>This was the Luo clan's home ground after all. Most people in the southern desolate mountain plains came from the Luo clan.</p>
<p>In the Luo clan, Yi Yun had a high popularity, just second to Luo Huo'er's. The recognition that the Luo clan disciples had for Yi Yun had not much to do with how Yi Yun did not complete the Luo Divine Hall trials.</p>
<p>“The cheers that you receive are rather loud! It appears that you are quite popular in the Luo clan.” Ye Yi nonchalantly said, as though he disparaged the Luo clan's cheers. This was the confidence that he had in the Eternal Eventide clan.</p>
<p>Chapter 934: I've been keeping a really low profile recently</p>
<p>“That sister of mine is actually over there!?”</p>
<p>In the southern desolate mountain plains, there were temporary seats of honor. People like Prince Crimson Firmament, Bai Yueqing, goddess Xi Ye, and company were sitting on the seats of honor. Luo Huo'er naturally had the right to sit there, but she had decided to mix in with the crowd.</p>
<p>“Brother Chuyun, it's said you have a good eye on abilities. What do you think that the outcome of Yi Yun's battle against Ye Yi will be?” Prince Crimson Firmament asked.</p>
<p>Beside Prince Crimson Firmament sat Chu Yunjian. Although he had been defeated by Chi Zhuiyun, no one belittled him.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian said, “Your Highness, the talk about my eye is simply rumors as a result of others complimenting it. I have been wrong many times, but this time, there's little to be speculated. The outcome will be that Yi Yun will win.”</p>
<p>Although Chu Yunjian did not know what strength Ye Yi had, Yi Yun's strength was obvious. The second strongest person in the Eternal Eventide Sea wanted to beat a freak like Yi Yun? That was extremely unlikely!</p>
<p>“Oh? Little to be speculated?” A woman's voice could be heard. Beside Prince Crimson Firmament sat a exquisite woman with black hair and purple pupils. Her forehead and neck was covered in metallic accessories. Sitting there, she appeared like she was the source of darkness, making her appear distant and mysterious.</p>
<p>She was the goddess of the Eternal Eventide clan — Xi Ye.</p>
<p>The second strongest person of the Luo clan and the second strongest person of the Eternal Eventide clan were at similar levels, yet it was said that there was little to be speculated? What arrogance!</p>
<p>Goddess Xi Ye said coldly, “Your Luo and White Fox clans fell into turmoil because of a single Chi Zhuiyun. What sort of face do you have to say such things? If you could have defeated Chi Zhuiyun, what need would there be for us to be here?”</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide clan was able to rival the Luo clan in power with several million people, and Xi Ye was the goddess of the Eternal Eventide clan, so she was obviously pissed when Chu Yunjian said things that belittled the Eternal Eventide Sea.</p>
<p>“You must be Chu Yunjian. As a Dao Manifestation realm warrior, you were defeated by Chi Zhuiyun, a half-step Dao Manifestation realm warrior. How emboldened are you to make comments here.” Goddess Xi Ye said bluntly.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian fell silent. Being defeated by Chi Zhuiyun, a person at a lower realm than him, was indeed a stain on his life, one that he could not refute.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment on the battle arena, Yi Yun and Ye Yi were a thousand feet from each other. There were cheers from the Luo clan warriors all around the stage.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, get rid of that Eternal Eventide Sea punk!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is sure to win!”</p>
<p>The audience was made up warriors, so their shouts were deafening. Ye Yi frowned when he heard them. Without the fight even beginning, he had been disparaged by the crowd, which pissed him off. “I never expected that a bunch of Fey would cheer for a human like you. However, cheering is useless. The outcome of the battle depends on strength.”</p>
<p>“A human? Aren't you human?”</p>
<p>With his sword in hand, Yi Yun coldly looked at Ye Yi. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, humans were scarce to begin with. They stood alone and powerless, so they needed to be united as one, forging ahead together. However, despite being human, just because they had a different color to their eyes, the Eternal Eventide Sea had taken the initiative to draw a line with other humans, like being labeled human was an insult to them.</p>
<p>“Do not compare us with the lot of you. We are the Chosen race of the Divinity, while you are the abandoned race. Lowly humans have a less than a one in ten billion chance of producing a genius, millions of times inferior to us. You are one of the cream of the crop, lucky to have won your current position. However, there are even more humans that are lowly beings. With life spans ranging less than a hundred years, they are no different to ants.”</p>
<p>As Ye Yi spoke, he pulled two black sabers out. The two sabers resembled a pair of wings.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he began to slowly put his sword away. “Inferior? Lowly? Ants?” Yi Yun shook his head. “You and humans come from the same roots, but that is how you view humans.”</p>
<p>When Ye Yi heard Yi Yun's ridicule, he did not respond. Instead, he coldly said, “By putting your sword away, are you planning on throwing in the towel?”</p>
<p>“Throwing in the towel? No, I'm only planning on switching my weapon. I think that using a sword to deal with you is being too kind.”</p>
<p>As Yi Yun spoke, he took a rectangular block of metal out of his interspatial ring. It was a rectangular seal, named the Heaven Upheaval Seal. Back in the Tai Ah Divine City, Yi Yun had participated in the rookie ranking tournament and he had used the Heaven Upheaval Seal as a weapon. Back then, Yi Yun was unable to adeptly control his strength. He was afraid of killing his opponent with his saber, but with the passage of time, Yi Yun's proficiency with energy control became more and more adept, so there was no need for the Heaven Upheaval Seal to be used.</p>
<p>“That is?”</p>
<p>Ye Yi frowned. He could sense that the rectangular piece of metal taken out by Yi Yun was a seal that had been previously refined. However, the material that the seal was made out of was extremely terrible. Furthermore, the runes that were engraved on its surface were extremely poor in quality!</p>
<p>“This is called a brick. It should be enough to deal with you. I think I've been keeping a really low profile recently, resulting in me being considered as a substitute. It wasn't easy for me to get on the stage, and now, random cats and dogs are wailing in front of me.” Yi Yun said lazily.</p>
<p>He was already bent on becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, gaining the attention of Felicitous Rain Lord. Therefore, it was understandable that he could no longer keep a low profile.</p>
<p>“What did you say!?” A cold beam flashed in Ye Yi's eyes.</p>
<p>“You are courting death!” Ye Yi was incensed.</p>
<p>How dare a human belittle him in that way? The human did not even know how the word death was written!</p>
<p>“Weng!”</p>
<p>Ye Yi's sabers roared as they sliced through the wind. The sabers emitted thousands of saber beams that inundated the surroundings!</p>
<p>Saber domain!</p>
<p>Saber domain was also another name for the Dao Domain of sabers. Saber Dao was also one of the Dao. It was inferior to Yin-Yang and space-time, but it was not weaker than the five elements. And it was ranked alongside sword Dao!</p>
<p>Ye Yi had also gained insights into a Dao Domain of his own!</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the hearts of the Luo clan audience tightened. Indeed, to become the second strongest person of the Eternal Eventide Sea, he had something outstanding about him. It was very rare for a person who had gained insights into a Dao Domain before he reached the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>“I never expected a Dao Domain. It's best if Yi Yun doesn't underestimate his opponent. As long as he uses his true strength, he will still win.” The Luo clan audience were very confident when it came to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not seem to have any plans on switching weapons.</p>
<p>Phew—</p>
<p>Yi Yun was enveloped by Ye Yi's saber domain.</p>
<p>With Heaven Upheaval Seal in his hand, Yi Yun remained motionless, allowing the saber domain to envelop him.</p>
<p>“Cha! Cha! Cha!”</p>
<p>Saber beams began darting around Yi Yun, slashing at his protective Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>“Is this your Dao Domain?” Yi Yun said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>He did not think much about it. Dao Domains had different levels. Ye Yi's Dao Domain was weaker than Princess White Fox's Dao Domain from eleven years ago, much less comparable to Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>And eleven years ago, Yi Yun had been enveloped by the Nine-tailed White Fox's Nine-tailed Dao Domain in the Fey Refining Rock array, and he was able to forcibly crack it, let alone now.</p>
<p>“It's sufficient to kill you!”</p>
<p>Ye Yi used his sabers to attack in unison with the saber beams. All of the saber beams in the saber domain began to merge as one, slashing right at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, before the saber beam landed on him, a golden rune lit up in the middle of the Heaven Upheaval Seal that was in Yi Yun's hand. It was not one of the runes that was originally engraved in the Heaven Upheaval Seal, it was one of the runes that belonged to the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence!</p>
<p>Eleven years ago, Yi Yun was already able to spread the runes of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence onto a hundred flying sabers. So now, it was even easier to inject one into the Heaven Upheaval Seal.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>The rune lit up with a divine light as the Heaven Upheaval Seal came smashing down towards Ye Yi!</p>
<p>This strike was not aimed at Ye Yi, it was aimed at his saber.</p>
<p>A brick against a saber!</p>
<p>On one side, it was a saber strike that had condensed an entire Dao Domain. It contained all of Ye Yi's insights in the saber Dao, and on the other side, it was a metal brick of dubious quality. But the collision was like a meteorite hitting the ground!</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>A brick tore through the void! People could clearly see a huge rift open in the void. Energy surged wantonly in the rift!</p>
<p>The void of the 12 Empyrean Heavens was extremely firm. There was no way for Heaven Ascension realm warriors to tear the void, and Yi Yun was no exception.</p>
<p>As such, what broke was not the void, but… Ye Yi's saber domain!</p>
<p>A saber domain that had just been conjured was forcefully shattered by a single smash of Yi Yun's brick!</p>
<p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p>
<p>Large swaths of the Dao Domain had shattered successively, with countless saber beams shattering as well. However, the Heaven Upheaval Seal did not lose its momentum, it continued to remain indomitable!</p>
<p>“Dang!”</p>
<p>Ye Yi's final saber beam was sent flying by Yi Yun's smash. The heavy Heaven Upheaval Seal, with immense Yuan Qi wrapped around it, appeared above Ye Yi's forehead.</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>Blood splattered everywhere as the nicely dressed Ye Yi, who had cut facial features, was left trembling by Yi Yun's brick. His vision turned black as his mind went blank, like everything in the world around him had been forcibly stripped apart by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“What… is going on… ?”</p>
<p>Ye Yi's legs turned weak. He tried his best to stabilize his body, but he eventually collapsed slowly…</p>
<p>Chapter 935: Luo Huo'er's Turn</p>
<p>That one strike from Yi Yun's brick had condensed the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's nomological rune. With his Yuan Qi infused in it, even a handful of mud would be augmented into something as hard as divine metal! Although the Heaven Upheaval Seal was a weapon that was refined in the lower realm, its inferior quality material did not affect Yi Yun's attack in any way.</p>
<p>With the brick smashing down and hitting him right on the forehead, Ye Yi's protective Yuan Qi had shattered. His body could not even withstand the attack.</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide clan were humans after all. Like humans, their physical bodies were their weakness. If it wasn't for Yi Yun holding some of the power back at the final moment, Ye Yi would be more heavily injured.</p>
<p>“It… ended just like that!?”</p>
<p>Not only were the Eternal Eventide Sea's disciples dumbfounded, even the Luo clan disciples, who were supporting Yi Yun, were in the same state of shock.</p>
<p>The scene before in front of them was something that was totally beyond their imagination. They were both the second strongest person from factions of equal strength, but the gap in strength was too great!</p>
<p>A single strike clinched victory?</p>
<p>An insta-defeat?</p>
<p>The entire southern desolate mountain plains was covered with millions of warriors. Most of them were Luo clan residents. After a few moments of silence, they suddenly erupted into cheers that were like a roaring landslide or tsunami.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>Thundering cheers roared across the wilderness in a deafening manner!</p>
<p>Over the past few days, citizens of the Luo clan had been eating humble pie. In the 12 Empyrean Heavens, strength was everything. With strength, one would obtain honor, status and dignity, regardless if it was an individual or a large faction.</p>
<p>And a few days ago, Chi Zhuiyun had declared to sweep through the Luo clan, and he had even leapfrogged Chu Yunjian in battle, defeating him. Luo Huo'er was the only person in the entire Luo clan that could possibly match Chi Zhuiyun, but that was only a possibility.</p>
<p>Even members of the Luo clan or admirers of Luo Huo'er did not dare to determine who would win in a fight between Luo Huo'er and Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>And the situation had developed in such a way under this backdrop with the Eternal Eventide Sea, World Margin Sect coming here. They came to the Luo clan to bathe in the limelight with their minds set on Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment. The members of the Eternal Eventide Sea were extremely arrogant, so in the past few days, there were several conflicts between the Luo clan's citizens and the Eternal Eventide Sea disciples in the southern desolate mountain plains. Many of the Eternal Eventide Sea's disciples had declared that the Luo clan would not be able to deal with Chi Zhuiyun, who would be finished by them.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Luo clan naturally felt aggrieved.</p>
<p>But today, Yi Yun's victory against Ye Yi in a battle of ease and verve had finally vindicated the Luo clan!</p>
<p>The cheers for Yi Yun continued on, and they even seemed like they were increasing</p>
<p>“Brothers, shout as loud as you can! Let's see those bastards of the Eternal Eventide clan continue to be arrogant, we'll smack their faces till they turn swollen!”</p>
<p>Amongst the crowd, there was an extraordinarily powerful warrior shouting. This person's cultivation realm had surpassed the Dao Manifestation realm, and he was considered a warrior from the older generation. But faced with such a delightful event, he was as excited as the young ones.</p>
<p>“What madness… ” Yi Yun said from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>At this moment, he had already left the battle arena.</p>
<p>In front of him, Ye Yi was being carried off the stage by members of the Eternal Eventide clan. His forehead was covered in blood, and the way he looked at Yi Yun was already very weak.</p>
<p>This battle had given a huge setback to Ye Yi. It would have been fine if he had been defeated, but he had been defeated by an ordinary human, and his opponent's weapon was a brick!</p>
<p>Having been defeated, and being smacked down by a brick, Ye Yi already began to question life.</p>
<p>“Of course there's madness!” Luo Huo'er responded, “In a warrior's world, we may have the power to cause great destruction, have long lifespans, and are able to lead extravagant lives, but the pressure is intense. Be it life-and-death trials or breakthroughs that require great risks, or the sense of urgency of being killed by someone else at any moment in time, it forces us to continuously forge ahead.”</p>
<p>“The accumulation of all these pressure naturally need an opportunity for it to be released. For example, with Chi Zhuiyun setting the battle area now, everyone comes here to watch the battle for that delightful entertainment. Although they are unable to engage in the battle themselves, victory is no different from them fighting themselves as it sends boiling blood pulsing through their veins. Especially with the Eternal Eventide clan being suppressed, there is a sudden feeling of exaltation, naturally a strong sense jubilance!”</p>
<p>As Luo Huo'er spoke, she gave Yi Yun a thumbs up. Her jade like fingers looked exquisite and beautiful.</p>
<p>“That's right… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. Ignoring the warrior's world, even in the world of mortals, there were all sorts of sports that attracted people, such as baseball, soccer, etc. An unprecedented soccer tournament would attract large numbers of spectators and fans. These people would push the atmosphere of the competition to its limits. And this was in a situation with many people not even knowing how to play soccer. In contrast, in a martial world, with everyone knowing martial arts, it made it even more different.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, your fight sure is liberating. I long found that Ye Yi unpleasing to the eyes. Let him be arrogant, but finish him with a brick!”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was still reveling in her excitement.</p>
<p>And at this moment, in the seats of honor, Prince Crimson Firmament, Bai Yueqing, Tianya Haoyue, goddess Xi Ye and others were also looking at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Goddess Xi Ye's face was dark and gloomy. She had spoken with such great certainty, but with the outcome of the match, describing it as a face smacking was insufficient.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that goddess Xi Ye was feeling embarrassed, Prince Crimson Firmament did not have any thoughts of kicking her while she was down. He was actually feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, the Luo clan had smacked the Eternal Eventide clan in the face, making him feel delighted, but on the other hand, Yi Yun was in Luo Huo'er's camp. From a certain point of view, he was his enemy.</p>
<p>The stronger his enemy was, the more threatening he was to his throne, so how could he be happy?</p>
<p>“Your Highness, it appears that I've underestimated Yi Yun. His talent far exceeds mine. Eleven years ago, it appears that it was not as simple as Yi Yun relying on a mystic technique to defeat the fifth Ancient Fey at the Luo Divine Hall trials… ” Beside Prince Crimson Firmament, Chu Yunjian sighed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, Luo Huo'er, and Princess White Fox were people who made one feel inferior for existing in the same era. Despite being extraordinarily talented, he was repressed by them, without being able to lift his head up.</p>
<p>By defeating Ye Yi, Yi Yun was undoubtedly one of the strongest of the eight.</p>
<p>Following that, the World Margin Sect, the White Fox clan, and the Oracle Fey Empire had to choose two people out of three.</p>
<p>To the Luo clan citizens, such a battle was of lesser importance when compared to Yi Yun's. In the eyes of the people, in the three substitutes, the other three were only there to make the numbers. Regardless of who fought, nothing mattered.</p>
<p>What they were eager to watch was the matchups amongst the strongest.</p>
<p>However, no one expected that before the three people got on to the stage to fight, Luo Huo'er was first to step onto the stage.</p>
<p>“It was really lively in the previous fight, so let me have a hand at it too!” Luo Huo'er was dressed in a red fighting costume as she casually said.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Luo Huo'er was going on-stage?</p>
<p>The battle had only just begun, and there was no assignment of opponents, but Luo Huo'er had already gone on stage.</p>
<p>“Goddess Xi Ye, is it?” Luo Huo'er looked far into the distance at the seats of honor, “Do you want to come over and have a fight!?”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er did not care if there had not been an assignment of opponents. Amongst the eight people, she just needed to call out the person's name to fight anyone she wanted!</p>
<p>Chapter 936: Purple Spirit vs Xi Ye</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er wanted to battle Xi Ye?</p>
<p>Everyone held their breaths. They never expected that the battle would be this intense right from the very beginning.</p>
<p>They believed that the best of the best face would face each other in battle only at the end. They never expected the Luo clan to directly go against the Eternal Eventide Sea!</p>
<p>First, Yi Yun had defeated Ye Yi, and now, Luo Huo'er was battling the goddess, Xi Ye!</p>
<p>The pangs of fury suppressed by the members of the Luo clan, which had been ignited by the arrogant words declared by the Eternal Eventide Sea, finally felt as though it was vented clean.</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit!”</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit!”</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit!”</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan were shouting loudly. After all, Luo Huo'er's popularity in the Luo clan exceeded Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>In the stands where the seats of honor were, goddess Xi Ye snorted coldly and flew away from her seat!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Luo Huo'er and Xi Ye, two daughters that were the pride of the heavens stood in mid-air, facing each other thousands of feet apart in the battle arena!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was dressed in red, she resembled a burning flame. As for Xi Ye, her black hair and dress made her seem like the source of darkness.</p>
<p>“Treating as though you, the Luo clan has surpassed my Eternal Eventide clan just by defeating Ye Yi?”</p>
<p>Xi Ye's voice sounded like a cold rain that splashed across the faces of everyone.</p>
<p>“It doesn't matter if the Luo clan surpasses the Eternal Eventide clan or not. It's just that I'll beat up whoever I find unpleasing to the eyes, and as it happens, you belong to one of the types I detest.”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was very casual in her speech, and this undoubtedly infuriated Xi Ye.</p>
<p>At this moment, a sword appeared in Luo Huo'er's hand in a very abrupt manner. Few members of the audience that numbered millions managed to discern how it appeared in Luo Huo'er's hand, it was as though she had been holding on to the sword from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The sword was slightly longer than five feet and it was very narrow. The blade was pale red in color, and when it was unsheathed, the sword was bent due to its thinness. From the main blade to its tip, it formed a curve, making it resemble a red ribbon.</p>
<p>A soft sword?</p>
<p>Xi Ye's eyebrows pricked up slightly. She had seen her fair share of soft swords, but this was the first time she had seen a sword so soft that it curved naturally. How was such a sword used?</p>
<p>Although Xi Ye was arrogant, she did not belittle Luo Huo'er. A large snake completely black in color appeared behind Xi Ye. As it slithered towards Xi Ye's shoulders, it slowly coiled its body. The black snake's scales were like metal, exuding a cold sheen, and on its head, there was a single horn. This was a snake in the process towards its evolution into a dragon. Legends had it that ancient snakes could produce single horns and four claws after surviving numerous heavenly tribulations, eventually evolving into a dragon.</p>
<p>“Contract Beast?”</p>
<p>People were slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“It's not a Contract Beast, but an Aspect Totem. The members of the Eternal Eventide clan are humans. Their cultivation system allows them to refine an Aspect Totem,” said a mighty figure in the crowd.</p>
<p>“An Aspect Totem that looks so lifelike? It's like a real wyrm!”</p>
<p>Typically, Aspect Totems looked like phantom images, but Xi Ye's Aspect Totem looked no different from an actual living creature.</p>
<p>At that moment, the black snake merged into Xi Ye's body, as a black beam of energy emitted from one of her palms. It spread out and formed a long black whip.</p>
<p>Black snake! Black whip!</p>
<p>It could not stop people from making the connection that the whip in Xi Ye's hand was a refinement of the black snake.</p>
<p>At this moment, Xi Ye moved. She lashed out with her whip, and a series of cracking sounds of a whip accompanied thousands of whip shadows that began to envelop Luo Huo'er!</p>
<p>“I've reigned supreme in the Eternal Eventide Sea. Whoever fails to keep up with me in terms of speed has no right to fight me!”</p>
<p>With whip and body as one, Xi Ye transformed into a black stream of light. People could only see black beams of light dancing throughout the sky, but with no sight of Xi Ye herself!</p>
<p>“How can this be dodged?”</p>
<p>“There are no blind spots at all!” The members of the Luo clan exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>Under the envelopment of the series of whip shadows, the ground was diced into countless fragments, exploding in the process!</p>
<p>Despite the terrifying bombardment of the scourge, Luo Huo'er's figure suddenly blasted out like a plume of fire, flashing away.</p>
<p>The endless whip shadows looked like there was not a single blind spot, but in fact, Xi Ye's lashes were done one after another. There was definitely an order, and as black smoke flared under Luo Huo'er's feet, she accurately pinpointed what was needed of her. Using a nearly impossible speed and mastery of her bodily actions, she dodged the whip shadows while darting through them while advancing!</p>
<p>“There are too many phantom images from Her Highness!”</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan watched Luo Huo'er shuttle through the whip shadows with bated breaths. Countless whip shadows penetrated Luo Huo'er's body, but strangely, the whips went straight through without the slightest bit of resistance, leaving Luo Huo'er unharmed!</p>
<p>“It's too fast. It has exceeded the limits of our visual acuity. Her Highness isn't forcefully blocking the lashing of the whips, she's only dodging!”</p>
<p>Blocking the bombardment of such rapid attacks was much easier than dodging. Although there was an order in which the whip shadows appeared, the gap in between successive lashes was a thousandth of an instant. It was easier said than done to dodge every one of them!</p>
<p>Not only so, people already realized that Luo Huo'er was chasing up to Xi Ye while dodging the whip shadows!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had swept through a hundred feet across the void, closing in on Xi Ye!</p>
<p>She was about to catch up!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er flicked her hand as the red ribbon-like sword slashed out!</p>
<p>Due to the oddness of the soft sword, at the instant of its cleaving, the sword tip lagged behind due to its softness, but with the force of the blade reaching its limits, the sword tip whipped out at an even faster speed, shooting straight at Xi Ye.</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>Like a fire python sticking its tongue out, the strike thrust straight at Xi Ye's chest with roaring fire-elemental Yuan Qi at an odd angle.</p>
<p>“Shield of Darkness!”</p>
<p>Xi Ye waved her hand as the power of darkness condensed in front of her. The black vortex formed was Xi Ye's Shield of Darkness.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's strike stabbed straight into the center of the Shield of Darkness.</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>The Shield of Darkness shattered immediately! Luo Huo'er's attack was just too powerful!</p>
<p>Immediately following that, overwhelming fire-elemental energies flared.</p>
<p>Dao Domain of fire!</p>
<p>With Luo Huo'er's nomological insight, it was only natural for her to have gained insights into her own Dao Domain, and it was of excellent grade.</p>
<p>The moment the Dao Domain appeared, tongues of fire deluged the surroundings, as though a volcano had erupted beneath Luo Huo'er's sword. The desolate plains were engulfed by the flames, as stones turned to lava!</p>
<p>“Back! Move back immediately!” People exclaimed.</p>
<p>The suppressive pressure of the flame coming from Luo Huo'er's strike was just too powerful! Standing beyond the battle arena, it was as though they were immersed in a prison of fire. They felt like their vitality was being consumed by the fire.</p>
<p>As people retreated, the flames churning in the battle arena culminated into a climax, as it blasted in one crazy explosion!</p>
<p>Firestorms swept the area, engulfing everything!</p>
<p>“Si!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a black snake shot towards the sky amid the turbulent flames, as it gave out a painful hiss.</p>
<p>“It's Xi Ye's Aspect Totem!” Someone shouted, but they could hardly keep their eyes open in the fierce firestorm.</p>
<p>This battle was too intense! The battle between two extremely talented women was a clash like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. It far exceeded the battle involving Yi Yun and Ye Yi.</p>
<p>Even though they were watching the battle from afar, it left them out of breath.</p>
<p>“What is the outcome?”</p>
<p>People stared at the battle arena with widened eyes, afraid of missing any scene. However, the firestorm completely blocked the sights of everyone.</p>
<p>Chapter 937: Eternal Eventide Star</p>
<p>Half a minute had passed before the flames gradually dissipated. Everyone focused their eyes, but the scene in the arena stifled their breaths.</p>
<p>There was a gigantic purple eye floating above the arena. In the eye's pupil, there was what seemed to be a vast and endless spiraling galaxy.</p>
<p>The large and dazzling stars drifted through the galaxy in such a manner that they seemed to have a grip on anyone who glanced at them. They pulled at them with no means of escape.</p>
<p>This was definitely no ordinary illusion, but it was also impossible for an eye to contain a true galaxy. Instead, it was a distant sector of the universe that had been projected into the pupil.</p>
<p>This technique was very astounding.</p>
<p>“The collapse of stars… the descent of the eternal night. You should be proud that you were able to force me to use the Eternal Eventide Star Technique.”</p>
<p>The black-dressed Xi Ye slowly landed in front of the gigantic eye. Her clothes were fluttering gently, while her hair was being blown around in the wind, making her look exceedingly elegant.</p>
<p>“Eternal Eventide Star Technique? What sort of technique is that?”</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan were puzzled regarding this matter. Ancient factions like the Luo clan and the Eternal Eventide Sea, that had existed for more than a hundred million years, would have explored countless mystic realms. It would not be surprising to find remnant copies of mystic techniques that were on the Divine Lord level in them.</p>
<p>However, despite having these ancient mystic techniques present in the faction, they were usually extremely demanding and difficult to comprehend. Coupled with the lack of available instruction, the number of people that could master such techniques were exceedingly scarce!</p>
<p>For the Eternal Eventide Star Technique to have such an astounding effect when being conjured by someone with a cultivation level at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, to the point of being able to project a galaxy that was located in the far reaches of the Universe, it was most likely an ancient heritage obtained by the Eternal Eventide Sea from a particular mystic realm.</p>
<p>Such a heritage was most likely incomplete, so it definitely needed extraordinary perception just to gain some basic mastery in it.</p>
<p>With the Eternal Eventide Star Technique being used, the entire arena was shrouded in darkness. It was like an eternal night had fallen as darkness penetrated every inch of the area.</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er was enveloped by the Eternal Eventide, she felt like the world external to her became increasingly unreal, and the darkness became more and more extensive and viscous, like it was engulfing everything and isolating her from everything.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er suddenly sensed that the southern desolate mountain plains were moving far away from her, and the surrounding warriors had also opened up a distance from her, like she was being isolated.</p>
<p>A seal!?</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er immediately realized what had happened.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the audience was seeing a completely different scenario. What they saw was that the viscous darkness was gradually shrinking again and again under the envelopment of the gigantic eye.</p>
<p>It went from shrouding the entire arena to a vortex of darkness that was several feet wide.</p>
<p>Next, the dark vortex had shrunk to a few inches in size… a black ball the size of a peach. When this happened, Xi Ye grabbed it with her hand.</p>
<p>“That is!?”</p>
<p>The millions of spectators had witnessed this spectacle. An expansive zone of perpetual eventide had been shrunk to the size of a peach. No! It was already smaller than the size of a peach, and Luo Huo'er, who had been enveloped by it, had already vanished along with it!</p>
<p>Could Luo Huo'er be trapped in that tiny black ball!?</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the black ball. Having great eyesight as warriors, they could discern all of the details of the black ball despite the large distance.</p>
<p>It resembled a mini-universe. On the boundary of the darkness, there was a projection of uncountable stars. Despite it being small in size, it gave people a sense of magnificence.</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit!”</p>
<p>“What did you do to Princess Purple Spirit!?”</p>
<p>The millions of spectators could not remain calm. Princess Purple Spirit, the most talented person in the Luo clan, had been sealed in a ball of darkness. With a ball the size of a peach or smaller, who knew what had happened to Princess Purple Spirit!</p>
<p>“Hmph! Luo Huo'er has been sealed in my Eternal Eventide Star. Without me willing it, she will forever be lost in a chaotic space, never to escape! Over time, her power will be gradually eroded by the darkness, turning her into a cripple. Or with a simple thought of mine, her body will be devoured by the darkness!” Xi Ye said brightly as the surrounding members of the Luo clan had turned anxious.</p>
<p>“Let Princess Purple Spirit out!” People shouted. It was fine even if the battle was lost, but Princess Purple Spirit was not to be harmed.</p>
<p>“Let her out? Heh heh heh heh!” Xi Ye laughed out in a clear and charming manner. “I will let her out, but not yet. She has to pay the price for her arrogance. This is the outcome of challenging me and challenging my Eternal Eventide clan! In two hours, I will release her from the Eternal Eventide Star. Considering how talented she is, she should be able to endure it for two hours.” Xi Ye said with a sneer.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she looked at Yi Yun. “The next person will be you. Do you think that your strength is heads and shoulders above the Eternal Eventide Sea after defeating Ye Yi? I will let you know how hopeless the gap between the two of us is. You will experience a hopelessness that resembles sinking into the eternal and infinite eventide!”</p>
<p>Xi Ye's words were extremely arrogant. Yi Yun frowned slightly. She really was detestable, making him feel like beating her up.</p>
<p>Just as he was pondering about how the Eternal Eventide Star Technique could be cracked, Yi Yun suddenly uttered a light cry.</p>
<p>He looked at the black ball in Xi Ye's hand. The darkness energy that was stable had suddenly become chaotic.</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>Xi Ye felt a jolt as she looked at the completely sealed Eternal Eventide Star. As its creator, she could clearly sense that the world of darkness that she had built up was collapsing from the inside!</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>The Eternal Eventide Star was equivalent to a small world that was created by Xi Ye. In this small world, she was the overlord, but now, the world was collapsing!</p>
<p>Cha! Cha! Cha!</p>
<p>Fiery-red beams burst out of the ball of darkness, riddling the boundary of the ball with hundreds, if not thousands, of holes. From afar, the Eternal Eventide Star looked like a radiant sun.</p>
<p>“How could this be possible!?”</p>
<p>Xi Ye's expression changed drastically. As one of the few people in the Eternal Eventide Sea who could master the Eternal Eventide Star Technique, Xi Ye understood how powerful this mystic technique was, but now, it looked like it was being dismantled!</p>
<p>Was it Luo Huo'er? How could she crack it!?</p>
<p>Xi Ye had no time to ponder about it as the amount of red light that burst out of the Eternal Eventide Star increased and grew in intensity. It was like the Eternal Eventide Star had been ignited. Without any choice, Xi Ye leaped back because the peach-sized Eternal Eventide Star was emitting thousands of beams of dazzling light at this moment. The entire arena was blinding!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A violent explosion could be heard as a phantom image of a goddess of war dressed in armor charged out of the exploding Eternal Eventide Star. She was as tall as the mountains, and she had a broadsword in her hand. The gold armor that covered her shone brilliantly!</p>
<p>Goddess of the River Luo! It was the Luo clan's totem — the Ancient Fey, Goddess of the River Luo!</p>
<p>Millions of Luo clan clansmen exclaimed. The Goddess of the River Luo which could only be seen during rituals had appeared in front of their very eyes!</p>
<p>Chapter 938: Skyfire Lunar Occultation</p>
<p>Goddess of the River Luo was the totem ancestor of the Luo clan. She had a feminine image when compared to a female human but where her legs should be was a snake's tail.</p>
<p>With broadsword in hand, Goddess Luo's body charged into the sky, but her tail remained in the Eternal Eventide Star. And at that moment, her broadsword came slashing straight at Xi Ye!</p>
<p>The strike had an indomitable momentum, and within the sword beam, Luo Huo'er had transformed into a stream of light that merged with the sword beam!</p>
<p>At that moment, Xi Ye could discern two swords in Luo Huo'er's hands.</p>
<p>One of them was a soft sword that resembled a red ribbon which Luo Huo'er had used earlier.</p>
<p>As for the other sword that made its first appearance, it was a broadsword about as wide as a palm. It was dark red in color, and there were complicated runes engraved on the blade.</p>
<p>A soft sword and a heavy sword were weapons that did not seem compatible when used together, but they were perfectly used in unison by Luo Huo'er. Two sword beams slashed out at the same time!</p>
<p>“Skyfire Lunar Occultation!</p>
<p>At the moment the two swords landed, it was as though the heaven and earth had turned into a sea of fire.</p>
<p>Xi Ye clenched her teeth as the gigantic eye in the sky poured down black Chaos. She cracked her whip that snapped straight at Luo Huo'er's attack.</p>
<p>The dark galaxy spiraled while it collided with the surging Skyfire.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An intense explosion resulted in an inferno, turning into a radiant sun in the sky. The slash from the two swords, combined with the might of the Goddess Luo, caused the darkness surrounding Xi Ye to dissipate from the fire!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er's sword moved forward unopposed, stabbing in between Xi Ye's eyebrows!</p>
<p>Peng!</p>
<p>Xi Ye trembled as the metallic accessory on her forehead shattered!</p>
<p>Endless fire-elemental energy nearly tore through Xi Ye's soul, sending her retreating. Her face was pale, and on her fair-skinned forehead, a scar had been left behind by Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>The scar was the size of a plum, resembling a black flame. It was a burn mark from Luo Huo'er's sword tip.</p>
<p>Such a scar could easily be treated using precious elixirs, but it was a greatly humiliating to have a scar appear on Xi Ye's face.</p>
<p>Xi Ye held one hand to her forehead as remnant fire-elemental energy surged within her.</p>
<p>The flames that were cultivated by Luo Huo'er were undying in nature. It seemed to consume Xi Ye's energy to replenish itself, allowing it to continue for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>Xi Ye's meridians were injured, preventing her from dissolving the wanton energies.</p>
<p>In mid-air, the gigantic eye had already dissipated, while the Goddess of the River Luo was gradually fading away as well.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stood in mid-air with the soft sword in one hand, and a broadsword in another as her clothes fluttered.</p>
<p>The millions of spectators fell silent momentarily upon seeing the outcome.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er had been sealed within the Eternal Eventide Star, a technique suspected to be an ancient mystic technique. It was an odd attack and nomologically profound. After all, it was able to project a distant galaxy.</p>
<p>However, such a sealing technique had been slashed apart by a single move from Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>After slashing apart the Eternal Eventide Star, Luo Huo'er had used 'Skyfire Lunar Occultation' to defeat Xi Ye in one strike!</p>
<p>The battle did not give people the opportunity to even breathe from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Was this really a battle between Heaven Ascension realm warriors?</p>
<p>Seeing the arena that was nearly reduced to lava from the flames, the spectators were distraught. Be it the profound laws or the terrifying energy fluctuations from the attacks, they had surpassed the limits of Heaven Ascension realm warriors. It even surpassed most Dao Manifestation realm warriors.</p>
<p>“Her Highness has won!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan's warriors were extremely excited. With Princess Purple Spirit exhibiting her prowess, revealing the Goddess of the Luo River, they felt a collective sense of pride!</p>
<p>As for the people from the Eternal Eventide Sea, they had ugly expressions. Their Eternal Eventide Sea was here to fight Chi Zhuiyun and they did not think much of Chi Zhuiyun's wipeout of the Luo clan.</p>
<p>But just moments ago, Yi Yun had first instantly defeated Ye Yi with a brick, followed by Princess Purple Spirit defeating Goddess Xi Ye in a grand manner.</p>
<p>As for what Xi Ye previously said, it was still fresh on their minds, but in a blink of an eye…their Eternal Eventide Sea had suffered an abject defeat. Not only was Xi Ye disgraced, they felt disgraced as ordinary clansmen as well.</p>
<p>As Xi Ye listened to the jubilant cheers from the Luo clan's warriors, her face turned pale.</p>
<p>She stared angrily at Luo Huo'er before her figure flashed. She returned to her seat of honor after transforming into a plume of black smoke.</p>
<p>“I want to see how many times she can remain undefeated.” Xi Ye said coldly.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun looked at Xi Ye, he felt rather speechless. She had lost so badly to the point of being unable to redeem herself, yet she insisted on watching the battles to wait for the moment of Luo Huo'er's defeat… Even if Luo Huo'er were to be defeated, the person who defeated her would not be Xi Ye.</p>
<p>And at this moment, another wave of cheers was heard from the millions of warriors.</p>
<p>Oracle Fey Empire's Demon Girl had accepted the challenge from Tian Yaping of the World Margin Sect and she had clinched victory!</p>
<p>Tian Yaping looked disheartened. He was planning on flexing his skills at the event but was eliminated right from the beginning. Just Demon Girl alone had rendered him helpless in defeat, much less Chi Zhuiyun. He did not even find his footing when he set foot in the arena before he was defeated.</p>
<p>In the seats of honor, Yu Tianfeng said with a laugh, “Demon Girl is not lacking in strength. If anyone were to belittle her, they will suffer heavy losses and remember their terrible mistake.”</p>
<p>It was hard to tell what was on Tianya Haoyue's mind as the corners of his mouth twitched, “Isn't it perfect that she doesn't lack strength? This would indicate that Chi Zhuiyun's strength is something worth looking forward to.”</p>
<p>While speaking, he made his move. Like a swimming dragon, he descended upon the desolate plain.</p>
<p>He shook a feathered fan and looked extremely refined. He resembled a scholar that dabbled in poetry more than a warrior.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Haoyue! Senior Brother Haoyue!”</p>
<p>The World Margin Sect disciples shouted loudly. Their euphoria was uniform, sending cheers that resounded in waves throughout the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>As the top disciple of the World Margin Sect, Tianya Haoyue represented power amongst the sect's disciples. The World Margin Sect advocated the importance of strength. Whoever could overpower the rest to become the strongest took the top spot.</p>
<p>Tianya Ping's defeat had caused a dark cloud to hang over the World Margin Sect disciples but it was swept clean by Tianya Haoyue's appearance. They were filled with limitless anticipation that Tianya Haoyue would redeem the World Margin Sect.</p>
<p>“Who shall participate in the battle?” Tianya Haoyue asked.</p>
<p>Near the arena, Nongying took a deep breath. She knew she had nearly no chance at winning the battle, but since she had been chosen, she could not retreat from the fight. Even though her opponent was very powerful, she was bent on treating the battle seriously, so as to not sully the White Fox clan's reputation.</p>
<p>Now, Ye Yi, Tianya Ping and Demon Girl had each fought a battle. The remaining were top geniuses from the various factions. Without any other opponent, she could only battle Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>Even though she knew that her hopes were slim.</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>A soft figure landed across Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>Chapter 939: Catoptric Deflection</p>
<p>Nongying wore a white short-sleeved robe with golden bells attached to her snow-white wrists and ankles. She was an exquisite beauty, with large eyes and an unsmiling face, she immediately attracted the attention of everyone when she appeared.</p>
<p>“White Fox clan, Nongying.” Nongying said calmly.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue gave a faint smile and said, “I'd have been somewhat interested in meeting Princess White Fox in battle, but for you… ”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue shook his head, clearly feeling great disdain for Nongying.</p>
<p>He flapped his feathered fan and said, “Make your move, I'll give you a three-move handicap.”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue shook his fan, with no intention to reveal his weapon.</p>
<p>Nongying's face turned slightly warm as she tiptoed on her toes slightly, taking a step forward with a curious kind of footwork.</p>
<p>“Ding!”</p>
<p>A clear ringing sound of bells instantly resounded in everyone's ears. It was pleasing to the ears, but it caused people to fall into a trance when they heard it. At the same time, Nongying's footwork was not ordinary. It looked like an elegant dance, but taking another look would put one end up in stupefaction.</p>
<p>Nongying darted towards Tianya Haoyue. Despite her speed not appearing to be fast, she left behind a series of shadows in the eyes of millions of warriors. The clear ringing of the bells succeeded one after another.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue chuckled, but he did not enter a defensive pose, allowing Nongying to come at him.</p>
<p>“I said that I'll give you a three-move handicap. During these three moves, I'll not move a single step.” Tianya Haoyue's words echoed throughout the southern desolate mountain plains, causing Nongying to frown.</p>
<p>As for the White Fox disciples, they were upset because of his statement.</p>
<p>Nongying was one of the two Shadow Twins. Furthermore, she was even stronger than Nongyue. Even if she was no match for Tianya Haoyue, it was an act of arrogance to not even make a single move!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had defeated Ye Yi in a devastating manner, but that was with Yi Yun using a real attack on Ye Yi.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had used a brick, the brick was flickering with nomological runes that looked profound in nature. It was clearly not an ordinary move.</p>
<p>As for Tianya Haoyue, he was crazier than Yi Yun!</p>
<p>“If that's the case, try taking this.” Nongying said coldly.</p>
<p>Ding Ding Ding!</p>
<p>The bells rang in close succession as Nongying's figure transformed into countless shadows in the midst of the ringing. Warriors who had low cultivation levels were already feeling dizzy. Just listening to the ringing seemed to induce blood vomiting.</p>
<p>The motions that the shadows did were varied, but they attacked Tianya Haoyue simultaneously!</p>
<p>All possible angles for dodging had been sealed off.</p>
<p>Some people could not even stand firmly in the face of the ringing, so how was one to withstand the overwhelming attack?</p>
<p>Many warriors were secretly horrified. Although the White Fox clan's Shadow Twins were rather famous, they paled in comparison at this event. But when Nongying made her move, the warriors came to a realization that these geniuses that seemingly paled in comparison were the cream of the crop that stood out from billions of warriors!</p>
<p>Nongying had went all out on her first move!</p>
<p>However, Tianya Haoyue remained composed. He stood in his original spot with a smile, apparently having no intention of dodging.</p>
<p>Seeing the attacks about to land, Tianya Haoyue mentally conjured something immediately as a transparent wall appeared around him. This 'wall' was resonating with ripples, slightly reflecting the sunlight like the surface of water.</p>
<p>Nongying's countless shadows were reflected on this watery wall.</p>
<p>“Ding!”</p>
<p>As the ringing suddenly reached a single crescendo, all of the shadows vanished.</p>
<p>Nongying was sent flying backwards, stumbling when she landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Her face was pale as blood flowed out of her ears.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>Nongyue, who had been clenching her fist and hoping that Nongying would teach Tianya Haoyue a brutal lesson, was astounded.</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples were puzzled as well.</p>
<p>Nongying was the one attacking a motionless Tianya Haoyue, but why was Nongying the one injured?</p>
<p>“Nongying's ears are bleeding. She had received attacks from the ringing of bells. It's Nongying's own attack!”</p>
<p>“Why did that happen?” A White Fox disciple asked in a fascinated manner.</p>
<p>“Catoptric Deflection! That is the top martial technique of our World Margin Sect. Only Senior Brother Haoyue was able to master it among the younger generation of disciples! Catoptric Deflection can sense all nomological changes in the opponent's martial arts, replicating it perfectly. This is what it means to pay somebody back with her own coin.” A World Margin Sect disciple smugly said.</p>
<p>For the World Margin Sect to possess such a top martial technique, as World Margin Sect disciples, they too gained pride from it, so it was natural for them to take the opportunity to promote it.</p>
<p>“Quickly make your next move. You still have two more to go.” Tianya Haoyue said.</p>
<p>Nongying raised her hand and she used her slender fingers to wipe the blood from her ears before suddenly charging forward.</p>
<p>This time, her actions were much slower than before, but the ringing was more intensive and ringing at a greater frequency. Visible warping of space could be seen around her.</p>
<p>And within the warped space, countless threads appeared alongside the ringing of the bells.</p>
<p>Nongying was centered amid the threads, filling almost the entire space.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the threads gathered as one!</p>
<p>The threads tore through the void and swept towards Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>The spectating warriors felt a tingling pain in their eyes, for every thin thread contained extremely lethal and horrifying power.</p>
<p>“This is a nomological move Sis learned while in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.” Nongyue said. She knew what was on Nongying's mind. Even if she were to be defeated, she wanted to make Tianya Haoyue do the act of blocking!</p>
<p>“Not bad, but it's useless against me.” Tianya Haoyue sneered as light from Catoptric Deflection bloomed.</p>
<p>Bam! Nongying flew backwards like a kite with a broken thread, before collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>Her white arms and calves were covered in streaks of blood as she spat out a mouthful of blood. She looked like she was in a miserable state.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue shook his head and waved his fan, saying, “You are too weak.”</p>
<p>“Sis!” Nongyue's face turned pale as she angrily looked at Tianya Haoyue, “You were too harsh on her!”</p>
<p>Other than Nongyue, many of the warriors could tell that Nongying's attacking strength was inferior to Tianya Haoyue. He did not simply reflect the move, he had enhanced the replication of Nongying's move before returning it to her.</p>
<p>In the series of battles, everyone else only did what was necessary, but Tianya Haoyue showed no mercy, seriously injuring Nongying.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue shook his head as he ignored Nongyue completely. Instead, he looked at the pale Nongying, “You still have one more move, which is also the last move. Do not disappoint me any further.”</p>
<p>He still wanted to carry on fighting?</p>
<p>Nongying was already severely injured. Under such circumstances, the outcome was already decided. With him saying this, was he intentionally trying to humiliate her?</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples were enraged. In the seats of honor, Princess White Fox's eyes turned cold.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to say a word, Nongying had already stood up.</p>
<p>“You can throw in the towel if you wish.” Tianya Haoyue said.</p>
<p>Nongying looked calm as she said, “This is the final move. Take it.”</p>
<p>In the arena, she represented the White Fox clan, so how could she throw in the towel?</p>
<p>Princess White Fox looked at Nongying, and from Nongying's eyes, she could see determination.</p>
<p>She did not say another word for this was a battle belonging to Nongying.</p>
<p>In a series of bell chimes, Nongying's head was lowered slightly, but when she raised her head and opened her eyes, her eyes had turned scarlet, as though she was a real fox!</p>
<p>At the same time, her aura suffused an air of extreme danger.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A terrifying power erupted from Nongying's petite body as her figure instantly disappeared from where she was standing. A deep crater suddenly appeared where she stood as cracks like spiderwebs emanated across the ground.</p>
<p>A rare change appeared in Tianya Haoyue's expression, as a coldness flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>At the same moment, the feathered fan in his hand emitted a dazzling brilliance. Catoptric Deflection activate once again, conjuring a gigantic mirror surface that stood in front of him.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>A loud explosion boomed like a mountain that was crumbling!</p>
<p>And from within the explosion burst of light, a figure flew out.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox rushed from the seats of honor and when she landed gently on the ground, she held a blood-covered Nongying, whose eyes were closed tightly, in one hand. As for her other hand, she flicked her long sleeves, dissipating the remaining forces.</p>
<p>Chapter 940: Chi Zhuiyun's Round</p>
<p>A killing intent flashed in Princess White Fox's eyes when she saw Nongying's state. “You knew that Nongying was not your match, but you remained so heavy-handed.”</p>
<p>“I'm really sorry.” Tianya Haoyue laughed heartily. “I did not expect this outcome as well. The power of Catoptric Deflection depends completely on the attacker, reflecting any move after it is enhanced in power. Who knew that she was unable to withstand a fight? Yet, she insisted on using such a move without understanding her own strength. It's only normal for her to be severely injured.”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's words infuriated the White Fox disciples.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was pushing it too far!</p>
<p>“I'll mark your words of it being only normal!” Princess White Fox stood up with Nongying in her arms. Her expression was cold as she said, “I'll make you pay the price.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I'll be waiting!” Tianya Haoyue did not seem to mind Princess White Fox's threat. “I've long heard that Princess White Fox has a powerful bloodline. It's something I want to see!”</p>
<p>As a haughty person by nature, Tianya Haoyue completely belittled Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox handed Nongying to Nongyue before feeding Nongying a relic. But at this moment, a red cloud descended upon the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>“I can agree to your wish to battle Tianya Haoyue, but you might no longer have a chance. We are the only two left that has not fought.”</p>
<p>The person who spoke was Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>He shook his spear in one hand as he emanated an unstoppable aura!</p>
<p>From the beginning of the matchups, Yi Yun, Luo Huo'er and company had each fought once, leaving only Chi Zhuiyun and Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>With Chi Zhuiyun saying this, millions of warriors turned their heads to look at him.</p>
<p>The situation was filled with twists. Princess White Fox had just challenged Tianya Haoyue, but Chi Zhuiyun wanted to battle her first!</p>
<p>If Princess White Fox were to lose, there was no need for her to battle Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was publicly acknowledged to be extremely mighty!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox took a deep breath as her face turned sullen. Her figure vanished and with an accompanying electric flash, her figure appeared across Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>“I'll fight you,” said Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>As a representative of the entire White Fox clan, she had to accept the challenge from anyone.</p>
<p>Above the southern desolate mountain plains, millions of warriors were feeling their blood boil with excitement.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun versus Princess White Fox!</p>
<p>Previously, Luo Huo'er's stunning performance was an eye-opener for everyone, and with Princess White Fox on par with Luo Huo'er, how magnificent would she be?</p>
<p>“Princess Xue'er! Princess Xue'er!”</p>
<p>The White Fox disciples cheers resounded.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tianya Haoyue had returned to his seat.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue flapped his fan, ignoring the cheers of adoration the White Fox disciples gave their princess.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox wanted to defeat Chi Zhuiyun? That was unlikely as Chi Zhuiyun was someone who had gained the approval of a Divine Lord!</p>
<p>At this moment, Chi Zhuiyun made his move!</p>
<p>He vibrated the tip of his spear, causing flames to twirl around the spear immediately.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A blinding flare burst above the southern desolate mountain plains, as Chi Zhuiyun's figure, appeared in front of Princess White Fox in a blink of an eye. The burning spear thrust straight towards the middle of Princess White Fox's eyebrows!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's white hair fluttered as energy surged in front of her!</p>
<p>However, she remained composed. Lightning bolts flashed all over her body as her slender finger tapped the spear tip gently.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's snow-white finger collided with the flaming spear that was indomitable. The spear seemed like it could pierce through everything and demolish mountains.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>A thundering blast caused the ground to quake!</p>
<p>Flames and lightning bolts blast out simultaneously as red and bluish-white Yuan Qi radiated in all directions from the explosive center.</p>
<p>Countless cracks appeared on the ground. After one strike, half of the area where Princess White Fox and Chi Zhuiyun stood had charred, while every plant in the other half withered.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's white finger was left with a bloody wound!</p>
<p>“Again!” Chi Zhuiyun carved the ground with his spear as his Shura Dao Domain appeared once again. In the Dao Domain, his killing intent raged!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox crossed her hands, and in the middle of her palms, a strange eye suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The eye seemed to come from ancient times. When the spectating warriors saw this eye, they could not help but shudder in fear!</p>
<p>Eye of the Skyfox!</p>
<p>At the same time, Princess White Fox closed her eyes slightly, and when she opened her eyes, her eyes resembled the Eye of the Skyfox.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox mouthed the words, “Nine-tailed Domain.”</p>
<p>Under the Eye of the Skyfox's watchful eye, Chi Zhuiyun, as well as his Shura Dao Domain, was enveloped by the Nine-tailed Domain.</p>
<p>“Her Highness has already grasped the Nine-tailed Domain!” In the seats of honor, Chu Yunjian was astonished. “Her Highness had a Lightning Dao Domain, to begin with, and now, with the Nine-tailed Domain, wouldn't it be a dual Dao Domain!?”</p>
<p>Bai Yueqing nodded and revealed a look of satisfaction. The Nine-tailed Domain was a Dao Domain exclusive to the Nine-tailed White Fox. It was a Dao Domain of an Ancient Fey's, much more powerful than a Lightning Dao Domain!</p>
<p>“What terrifying talent. Princess Xue'er has far exceeded me at the same realm.” Chu Yunjian said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian was also a top genius and he was not wrong. This was indeed a match between two extremely talented elites. The two did not probe the other or hold back their skills. They were using their true skills from the onset.</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun has been sealed in the Nine-tailed Domain. Xue'er plans on winning in one move, so she did not hold back at all.” Bai Yueqing's eyes turned serious. It was possible to defeat Chi Zhuiyun by combining the Nine-tailed Domain with the Eye of the Skyfox!</p>
<p>In the Nine-tailed Domain, Princess White Fox's figure had quickly shrunk and disappeared. Only a gigantic Eye of the Skyfox was left in the Nine-tailed Domain that stared intently at Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>At this moment, Luo Huo'er looked elsewhere. “Eh?”</p>
<p>Demon Girl, who belonged to the Oracle Fey Empire like Chi Zhuiyun, was stepping up as well!</p>
<p>She had previously defeated Tianya Ping, and after a short break, she had her sights on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“Come on.” Demon Girl wiggled her finger.</p>
<p>She had a wild kind of beauty, so her wiggling finger did not appear frivolous at all.</p>
<p>The southern desolate mountain plains were extremely wide, and with the spectating warriors leaving ample space for the battle participants, two battles could be simultaneously carried out.</p>
<p>“First things first, I will not be giving you a chance if you want to use that metallic seal to whack me.” Demon Girl said.</p>
<p>Yi Yun chuckled. If a clan's genius were to be defeated by a brick in public, it would indeed leave a psychological scar.</p>
<p>Similarly, Yi Yun was not planning on using the Heaven Upheaval Seal to deal with Demon Girl. After all, a weapon like a brick was only used by Yi Yun when the person pissed him off.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wiped his interspatial ring as a sword immediately appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun switch weapons, Demon Girl did not look relaxed either. On the contrary, her eyes squinted like a beast as she stared intently at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was very strong!</p>
<p>Demon Girl slowly lifted her arms and with a whoosh, long claws stretched out from her hands. At the same time, her entire form changed, looking more like a Fey beast than human.</p>
<p>“Watch it!”</p>
<p>Just as Demon Girl's voice faded, her figure had disappeared from where she was standing!</p>
<p>Immediately following that, Yi Yun sensed an intense energy source coming from in front of him, but there was only an emptiness in front of him. There was no one!</p>
<p>Chapter 941: Have some fun with you</p>
<p>It was not that there was nobody there, but Demon Girl had turned invisible!</p>
<p>Yi Yun sensed the distortion of the space around him under the influence of laws.</p>
<p>“It's spatial dimension laws.” Luo Huo'er could tell very clearly from her seat of honor.</p>
<p>“It's not easy to change the 12 Empyrean Heavens' spatial dimension laws at the Heaven Ascension realm.” Yi Yun thought.</p>
<p>This most likely had something to do with Demon Girl's bloodline. Different Ancient Fey grasped different laws, so it was likely that Demon Girl's bloodline was related to an Ancient Fey that grasped spatial dimension laws.</p>
<p>Spatial dimension laws were extremely odd. Demon Girl seemed to enter the void, making it difficult to locate her whereabouts. People who did not know spatial dimension laws would not even be able to put up a defense.</p>
<p>But at this moment in time, Yi Yun had brandished his sword.</p>
<p>Yi Yun slashed out at an empty space in front of him.</p>
<p>Dao patterns condensed on the sword's blade and as the beams sliced through space, distortions immediately appeared in the space.</p>
<p>What was Yi Yun doing? Was he trying to crack Demon Girl's spatial dimension laws by taking the initiative to attack?</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Yi Yun had slashed dozens of times successively!</p>
<p>Distortions could be seen everywhere in space as Yi Yun ignored when or from where Demon Girl would attack. He just slashed out again and again!</p>
<p>Wherever there was an energy fluctuation, Yi Yun would slash in that direction.</p>
<p>He had spent a great deal of time in the Heavenly Slaughter Array, fighting countless opponents in it. Hence, he was very keen when it came to energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>At this moment, a sound similar to a chicken egg cracking was heard as Demon Girl suddenly appeared nearby.</p>
<p>Her expression was ugly when she appeared. She was also retreating without any qualms, like she was trying to open up a gap between her and Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was already pursuing her with his sword pointed at her.</p>
<p>There were Dao patterns appearing beneath his feet, and although Yi Yun's speed did not appear to be fast, every step allowed him to traverse a great distance. In a blink of an eye, Yi Yun had appeared behind Demon Girl.</p>
<p>Dang!</p>
<p>Demon Girl immediately turned around and swiped with her sharp claws. Ten spatial rifts immediately appeared in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun did not dodge the spatial rifts.</p>
<p>He slashed down with a sword beam that resembled lightning!</p>
<p>Above the sword beam, Dao patterns trembled, vanquishing the ten spatial rifts, reducing them to countless black dots, and Yi Yun passed through these black dots.</p>
<p>His sword was pointed straight at Demon Girl's throat!</p>
<p>Demon Girl retreated again and again!</p>
<p>But the sword beam caught up to her at an even faster speed.</p>
<p>Weng!</p>
<p>Demon Girl came to a stop, her face ashen.</p>
<p>Just in front of her throat, the slightly quivering sword came to a stop. Yi Yun just needed to move his hand slightly forward, and her throat would be penetrated.</p>
<p>“I've lost.” Demon Girl said in a whisper.</p>
<p>She had defeated Tianya Ping in a devastating manner. Similarly, Yi Yun had defeated her with his indomitable sword that undermined her efforts.</p>
<p>Only then did the warrior audience manage to react. Yi Yun had been using the same move from the beginning, never taking a step back.</p>
<p>They were both geniuses, but there was a huge gap between them!</p>
<p>If anyone of them had fought Yi Yun, they would not have been able to even withstand a single strike.</p>
<p>On the Eternal Eventide Sea's side, Ye Yi watched Yi Yun standing on the arena with his sword in hand. It was unknown what was on his mind.</p>
<p>Even their Goddess Xi Ye had been eliminated, but Yi Yun had solidly come up on top, as one of the top talents. Even if he were to be defeated later, he would definitely garner the appreciation of the alliance.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had used a brick to humiliate him, and it was foreseeable that Yi Yun's future would be more promising than his. Now, Yi Yun was receiving the kudos of the Luo clan after trampling on him and Demon Girl. Just as Luo Huo'er mentioned, a warrior's world depended on strength. Ye Yi had a strong feeling that the gap between him and Yi Yun would only grow wider in time.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, not bad at all!” Luo Huo'er gave Yi Yun a smile from afar.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had also came to the seats of honor.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun and Princess White Fox's battle was still ongoing!</p>
<p>Princess White Fox stood mid air, as her skirt fluttered in the wind while her silvery-white hair moved around freely in the wind. Maintaining a Lightning Domain and Nine-tailed Domain, as well as the Eye of the Skyfox simultaneously was very taxing on Princess White Fox.</p>
<p>At this moment, a Nine-tailed White Fox phantom image appeared behind Princess White Fox. Simultaneously, lightning flashed as a blinding bolt of lightning condensed into a sword in her hand.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox held the sword and she thrust at Chi Zhuiyun from afar.</p>
<p>At the same time, a lightning bolt that manifested as a sword appeared above Chi Zhuiyun as it slashed down at him!</p>
<p>“Heaven's Prison Electro-penance!”</p>
<p>When this strike appeared, it was like divine lightning struck from heaven from out of nowhere. The millions of spectating warriors could feel a tingling sensation on their skin despite standing far away.</p>
<p>If it were them at the same cultivation realm, there was nothing that they could do but face death against this terrifying strike, considering how Chi Zhuiyun was sealed in a Nine-tailed Domain and being stared at intently by the Eye of the Skyfox!</p>
<p>And in the Nine-tailed Domain, Chi Zhuiyun, who was facing this strike head on, had the surrounding space around him sealed, with no room for him to dodge!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun clenched his spear tightly as he was not planning on dodging as well!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun roared as the Shura Domain beneath his feet suddenly contracted.</p>
<p>A dark crimson color gathered on his spear, like it was forged out of a blood pool in hell. Just a look at it gave people a jolt through their very souls!</p>
<p>“This strike is called Shura!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's aura surged violently as terrifying killing intent emanated from his body. He thrust his spear out at the strike above him!</p>
<p>The sword and spear clashed in a blink of an eye!</p>
<p>However, the terrifying collision resulted in a moment of silence.</p>
<p>After the silence, the energy from the two strikes burst outwards in a circular shockwave! The ground quaked and wherever the energy passed, everything was flattened.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox's face turned white as blood seeped from the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>The contrast that the scarlet blood created over her fair skin was a captivating pathos.</p>
<p>The warriors held their breaths as they looked in Chi Zhuiyun's direction.</p>
<p>Who was the winner and who was the loser?</p>
<p>In the raging dust storm, a red figure holding a spear slowly walked out.</p>
<p>His figure was as straight as his spear.</p>
<p>Weng!</p>
<p>With a tremble of his spear, Chi Zhuiyun said with a cold expression, “You have lost!”</p>
<p>Princess White Fox eventually lost to Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>The battle process was extremely intense, causing others to feel shortness of breath.</p>
<p>There was a long moment of silence on the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>In the seats of honor, Bai Yueqing clenched his fan tightly as he stared intently at Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Beside him, Chu Yunjian also exhaled gently. “Chi Zhuiyun is too strong! I have never seen such talent in my life before.”</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian's words were not exaggerated. He too was a top genius, but Chi Zhuiyun gave him a feeling that he was the strongest person of the same generation.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was indeed extraordinary for him to gain the recognition of Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>“Xue'er's cultivation realm is still a bit too low.” Bai Yueqing said with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“Heh heh, Chi Zhuiyun is at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm, while Princess White Fox is at the Heaven Ascension perfection real, with a rich Nine-tailed White Fox bloodline. There is a gap, but even if Princess White Fox were to enter the half-step Dao Manifestation realm, do you think that she will be able to defeat Chi Zhuiyun? I think it's very unlikely!”</p>
<p>“What a pity that Princess White Fox would lose her first round. She previously mentioned that she wanted to teach me a lesson, but it looks like she no longer has the chance to.”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue emotionless voice came from the side. It wasn't said softly and many people present could read between the lines.</p>
<p>Princess White Fox, who had just returned from the arena, also heard it clearly.</p>
<p>She faltered slightly. She could ignore Tianya Haoyue's verbal humiliation, but he had deliberately injured Nongying and he still remained so arrogant.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she had been defeated in a single battle, no longer having the chance to battle Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>“Haha! Goddess Xi Ye and Princess White Fox have both been defeated. It seems that the both of them do not live up to their reputations. Now, there's only Chi Zhuiyun and the two from the Luo clan. I'm rather interested in how Luo Huo'er will fare.”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's tone was extremely arrogant, so arrogant that the White Fox disciples wanted to brutally beat him up. As for the defeated Eternal Eventide clan, they were feeling vexed as well.</p>
<p>“To dare say he is rather interested. Who does he think he is!?”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples were infuriated as well. This person was too good at posturing.</p>
<p>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. “Curb your interest. I'll have some fun with you in the next round.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's eyes turned serious as he looked towards Yi Yun. He saw Yi Yun heading towards the arena on the desolate plains once again after defeating Demon Girl!</p>
<p>Chapter 942: Limit of a Move</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue frowned. As the top disciple of the World Margin Sect, he obviously wanted to challenge the strongest person of the Luo clan, Princess Purple Spirit — Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he had only defeated two substitutes. Be it Ye Yi or Demon Girl, they were only recruited to fill the numbers.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was strong, but Tianya Haoyue felt that Yi Yun was not qualified to fight him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun had been overbearing. He did not talk about challenging him, but he used the words 'have some fun with you'. Who did he think he was?</p>
<p>“You just finished a round and have expended quite a bit of energy, yet you want to challenge me immediately after that? You truly overestimate yourself!”</p>
<p>“It's fine, it's sufficient to deal with you.” Yi Yun said nonchalantly. His words made Luo Huo'er snigger.</p>
<p>She understood Yi Yun and she knew that Yi Yun could not stand Tianya Haoyue's vaunting of himself. Since Tianya Haoyue was so good at it, Yi Yun did not back off and he humiliated him on the matter, instigating his anger.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had deliberately said those words, but it was Luo Huo'er's cup of tea.</p>
<p>Other than Luo Huo'er, when Princess White Fox heard this, she gave Yi Yun a surprised look. Looking at Tianya Haoyue's grim face, the corners of her mouth could not help but curl upwards.</p>
<p>When Tianya Haoyue heard Yi Yun's words and Luo Huo'er's snigger, his eyes turned stern.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was courting death!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was extremely arrogant. Previously, he did not think that Nongying was qualified to battle him. Hence, he had severely injured her.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Yun had humiliated him, so there was no way that he would hold back in battle!</p>
<p>“Since you overestimate your strength, I'll fulfill your desire.”</p>
<p>As Tianya Haoyue's voice faded, he flew upwards, and arrived on the arena in the desolate plains.</p>
<p>Yi Yun versus Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples were exhilarated. Tianya Haoyue was too arrogant, so they were looking forward to Yi Yun smacking Tianya Haoyue heavily in the face.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun! Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>Even the White Fox disciple were shouting as well.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, beat him up badly!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, come on!”</p>
<p>The World Margin Sect disciples were also shouting, but their voices were incomparable to the disciples from the Luo clan and White Fox clan.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's face turned grim as he revealed a sneer. “Victory is not something determined by one's mouth.”</p>
<p>His words were deriding the Luo clan and White Fox disciples, as well as Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun said scoffingly, “Since you know such a principle, why do you still have so much to say?”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's eyes narrowed as he threw his feathered fan forward. Behind him, an endless sea cliff appeared. The sky seemed to darken, as the dark blue sea crashed into the rocks. Mist billowed above the ocean as a bright moon hung in the sky. Its projection was reflected above the surface of the sea in a sparkling manner.</p>
<p>Catoptric Deflection!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue used Catoptric Deflection once again. Back then, he had used this move to crush Nongying.</p>
<p>And now, the Catoptric Deflection that he was using was much more powerful and extraordinary than the one he used against Nongying. There were even phenomena conjured, creating an independent space, enveloping Yi Yun and Tianya Haoyue within it.</p>
<p>“Use whatever moves you have,” said Tianya Haoyue. “But remember to leave some energy for defense, or you might not be able to withstand the reflection of your own move.”</p>
<p>“It's that move again!”</p>
<p>“That move is really troublesome. It reflects all attacks and all laws!”</p>
<p>The audience had already seen the strange martial technique. In their opinions, Catoptric Deflection was an extremely difficult move to deal with.</p>
<p>“If it reflects moves and laws… can't he just not attack and go for a battle of attrition!?” Amongst the Luo clan disciples, someone suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“Don't attack? Then wouldn't that put Yi Yun in a passive state as he endures attacks?”</p>
<p>In a battle between two parties, one of them was in an unassailable position while the other party could only take a beating. If that was the case, there was no need to continue this battle!</p>
<p>At this moment, Tianya Haoyue had put his fan away and he had taken out a curved moonblade from his interspatial ring. The Catoptric Deflection's space was shrinking as Tianya Haoyue encroached towards Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“Your every attack will be useless against me. You are definitely losing!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Tianya Haoyue slashed down with his blade!</p>
<p>His strike split into thousands of blade beams, like the moon had descended. Instantly, Yi Yun was in a dangerous situation!</p>
<p>“Peng Peng Peng!”</p>
<p>As the blade beams surged at him, Yi Yun suddenly charged to the right and retreated. However, space in Catoptric Deflection was limited. Instantly, Yi Yun retreated to the boundary of Catoptric Deflection. Since the space had already been isolated, there were faint ripples suffusing through the spatial barrier. Attempting to crack it was easier said than done.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not panic at all. Instead, he smiled and said, “Reflect every attack and law? You really don't feel the embarrassment from boasting. Can you reflect a Divine Lord or Supremacy's attack?”</p>
<p>Catoptric Deflection sounded invincible, but it was obvious that Catoptric Deflection could not reflect every attack. It definitely had its limitations.</p>
<p>“Divine Lord? Hahaha!” Tianya Haoyue guffawed. “That question of yours is incurring ridicule on yourself. Are you a Divine Lord? You aren't even a disciple of a Divine Lord! If you want to attempt at attacking my Catoptric Deflection, go ahead!”</p>
<p>Extreme Slaughter — Remote Heavens Severing!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue brandished the moonblade in his hand as wanton blade beams surged forward. At that moment, it was truly like moon essence had transformed into blade beams, as they rained down like mercury, with no gaps in between!</p>
<p>Inside the confined space of Catoptric Deflection, it was impossible to withstand the blade beams if one did not strike!</p>
<p>When the spectators saw Yi Yun, who had been forced into a corner, they held their breaths!</p>
<p>“Then, try to receive this.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyes flashed and with a thought, hundreds of flying sabers burst out from around him as they shot towards Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>Wherever the sabers passed, there was the resonance of energy and a deafening sound!</p>
<p>“What the hell is Yi Yun doing!?”</p>
<p>In the seats of honor, Prince Crimson Firmament and Bai Yueqing frowned. Didn't Yi Yun see the battle from before?</p>
<p>By not figuring out how to crack Catoptric Deflection's seal, Yi Yun would definitely be seriously injured by the reflection of such a powerful attack!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue sneered. “What foolhardiness and stupidity.”</p>
<p>He brandished his moonblade as the mirror that seemed to fade in and out of existence appeared in front of him to receive the hundreds of flying sabers.</p>
<p>“Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's flying sabers stabbed at the mirror in an indomitable fashion!</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er stared unblinkingly at the mirror. She was already prepared to immediately help Yi Yun that if Tianya Haoyue's reflection was too powerful.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was a sinister person and he was ruthless even to Nongying. He would definitely deal a fatal strike at Yi Yun who had offended him.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>An sound that resembled a explosive clap of thunder resounded as raging forces ripped the surrounding space, producing several rifts in a thousand foot radius.</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples felt their hearts tighten.</p>
<p>Space was torn apart, preventing them from seeing the situation above the arena.</p>
<p>However, they were stunned when they discerned the situation after everything calmed down!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had finished his clash with Tianya Haoyue. Yi Yun stood mid-air with his sword in hand, while flying sabers surrounded him in a dance. As for Tianya Haoyue, his Catoptric Deflection was still in front of him, but his chest had been sliced apart by the saber blades. What looked like a gorgeous outfit was instantly no different to a beggar's.</p>
<p>However, there was a piece of clothing that emitted a metallic luster beneath his tattered clothes. It was because of this enchanted piece of clothing that Tianya Haoyue wasn't reduced to a bloody state.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's expression had already changed drastically!</p>
<p>What happened? How could it happen?</p>
<p>The spectating warriors were completely unsure of what had happened.</p>
<p>But in the seats of honor, Luo Huo'er and company were able to see it clearly.</p>
<p>Catoptric Deflection was penetrated by Yi Yun's flying sabers and it failed to put up any resistance!</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned his head, he looked at Tianya Haoyue, and said with a faint smile, “That Catoptric Deflection of yours doesn't seem to work?”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's expression turned uglier when Yi Yun said this. What did that punk do?</p>
<p>Chapter 943: Purple Dragon's Roar</p>
<p>Catoptric Deflection used by Tianya Haoyue was a top-grade martial technique that the World Margin Sect retrieved from the Sinkhole mystic realm. Regardless of the cultivation technique that attacked Tianya Haoyue, it would be replicated and reflected.</p>
<p>With this martial technique, Tianya Haoyue was considered invincible against his peers.</p>
<p>However, Catoptric Deflection had failed to replicate Yi Yun's sword technique!</p>
<p>What could be the reason?</p>
<p>If it wasn't for his enchanted armor, Tianya Haoyue would have already been defeated! This was not a life and death battle after all. If he was injured, losing by one move was also considered to be a defeat.</p>
<p>“What the heck did you just do?” Tianya Haoyue coldly questioned Yi Yun. He refused to believe that Catoptric Deflection was ineffective against Yi Yun. This was something that he had never encountered before!</p>
<p>“Is there a need to explain what I did?” Yi Yun sneered. Catoptric Deflection definitely had its limits. It could reflect moves and laws, but if the attack was too powerful or the laws involved were too profound, it would not be able to reflect them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's attack from before had been augmented with a Dao pattern from the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. This mysterious Dao pattern was something that even mighty figures of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven failed to understand, much less Tianya Haoyue. So what if it was Catoptric Deflection? How was Catoptric Deflection going to reflect it?</p>
<p>Of course, Yi Yun would not explain such matters, but instead, he said with derision, “Isn't the Catoptric Deflection very awesome, so awesome that it makes you invincible? Why is there a need to wear armor?”</p>
<p>The spectating warriors found it humorous when they heard this. Yi Yun remained unsparing with his words and he specifically targeted Tianya Haoyue's soft spots.</p>
<p>No one could have seen the armor worn by Tianya Haoyue previously, but now, it was exposed to millions of pairs of eyes.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's mockery, Tianya Haoyue felt that everyone's eyes were focused on him.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was accustomed to being in the limelight, but it was not with gazes of distrust and cynicism!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue clenched his teeth and said, “So what if there's an armor? In a life-and-death battle between warriors, would you complain that the opponent was wearing armor after being killed? What a joke! Weapons, puppets, pills and relics are a part of a warrior's combat strength!”</p>
<p>As Tianya Haoyue said this, he ripped off his tattered shirt, revealing a layer of soft purplish-golden armor. A duel between warriors was not like a trial. Any weapon or armor was free to be use.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, curb those words of yours because the person that will lose will be you!” Tianya Haoyue took a step forward as he spoke before slashing with his moonblade.</p>
<p>“Dance of the Full Moon!”</p>
<p>Immediately, a cold netherbeam tore through the void, forming a silverish-white beam that shot towards Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Countless blade beams descended from the sky like the pouring of moonlight or the surge of a galaxy.</p>
<p>The spectating warriors found it stifling when they saw such an attack. It looked like there was no room for escape, with every angle of retreat being sealed off.</p>
<p>Every blade beam looked captivating, but they contained extremely terrifying killing intent.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the top disciple of the World Margin Sect, Tianya Haoyue was still very powerful without relying on Catoptric Deflection!</p>
<p>From Yi Yun's point of view, it was like he saw a gigantic moon crushing down on him. As the moon rapidly approached him, the dim moonlight became thousands of blade beams , like they would tear him into pieces.</p>
<p>“Golden Crow totem!”</p>
<p>“Xiao!”</p>
<p>A gigantic three-legged Golden Crow shot out from behind Yi Yun as a pure Yang inferno consumed the moon. Instantly, there was a burst of light above the southern desolate mountain plains!</p>
<p>The blinding light made it difficult to look straight at it. And the intense sounds of collision was resembled the pattering of rain in a storm.</p>
<p>Fiery beams of light filled the sky like countless scars. What was a clear and beautiful sky now looked as though the firmaments were rupturing.</p>
<p>This scene was astounding!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure charged out of the fiery storm in a dazzling brilliance. Yi Yun thrust his sword straight at Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had withstood Dance of the Moon and his strike was aimed straight at Tianya Haoyue's lower spine!</p>
<p>Cha!</p>
<p>The sword penetrated Catoptric Deflection's defence and proceeded forward in an indomitable fashion!</p>
<p>Despite seeing the sword approaching him and Catoptric Deflection failing once again, Tianya Haoyue was not alarmed. With a sneer, he focused and circulated his Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>A gigantic shield of light appeared in front of Tianya Haoyue, blocking Yi Yun's strike!</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>The sword beam shattered into what seemed like snowflakes. The millions of people that filled the desolate plains held their breaths at this moment.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue retreated several steps back, but he remained unscathed.</p>
<p>The reflection of Catoptric Deflection had failed, but the shield was able to withstand every attack from Yi Yun.</p>
<p>This shield came from the armor.</p>
<p>It was the armor again!</p>
<p>“Your attack… is nothing much after all!” Tianya Haoyue waved his hand and he wiped away the remaining pure Yang flames in front of him. “I'm not afraid to tell you that this is a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor of my World Margin Sect, the Purple Dragon's Roar Armor. It is indestructible at the Dao Manifestation realm. Let's see what you can do to me!”</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, it was not uncommon for large factions to prepare top-grade protective items to protect their elite disciples. Protective items were different from assault weapons. Weapons only needed to be sharp and hard, used for killing.</p>
<p>However, protective items, even if they were full-bodied armor, would fail to withstand the intrusion of Yuan Qi and laws. They would be ineffective for protection. In order to withstand fatal energy attacks, they needed the warrior to inject Yuan Qi into them as well.</p>
<p>As such, armors had an effective cultivation level for use. It allowed a warrior of the corresponding level to push the armor's defensive capabilities to its highest point.</p>
<p>Regardless of the cultivation level classification, armors that were considered to be supreme-grade were few and far between. It was not commonly seen even amongst large factions. The value of a supreme-grade Heaven Ascension realm armor could even be hundreds of times higher than a top-grade armor at the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>But now, Tianya Haoyue was wearing a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's cultivation level was at the Heaven Ascension, but in terms of strength, he was not weaker than Dao Manifestation realm warriors. Therefore, he was also able to produce the full defensive capabilities of the Purple Dragon's Roar Armor.</p>
<p>It was not considered bragging to claim that a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor was indestructible at the Dao Manifestation realm!</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, even if Yi Yun's offensive strength was extremely perverse, allowing him to barely break through the supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor's defense, how much of his offensive strength would there be left after that? It was probably 20-30%!</p>
<p>How was one to win if one's attack was reduced by 70-80% while battling the top genius of the World Margin Sect?</p>
<p>“To think that he is using a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor. That Tianya Haoyue is shameless!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples hailed invectives at him.</p>
<p>“How can clinching victory using an armor be considered talent!?”</p>
<p>“If you have the guts, take off your armor!”</p>
<p>Many Luo clan disciples booed at Tianya Haoyue, but Tianya Haoyue scoffed. “Getting one to take off one's armor in a duel between two warriors? How retarded can the words the lot of you be? One's background is also a part of one's strength. Yi Yun, if there is anything to blame, blame yourself from coming from a lower realm, making you as poor as dirt! Hahaha!”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue guffawed.</p>
<p>“Supreme-grade armor? Indestructible at the Dao Manifestation realm?” Yi Yun picked his ears and he put the sword in his hand away. As he wiped his interspatial ring, he said, “Then, I want to see if this sword of mine will be able to slash through that supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor of yours.”</p>
<p>Just as his voice faded, a rusty ancient sword appeared in Yi Yun's hand. It was in a miserable state and what rendered people speechless was that the sword was broken. It was only half of a sword.</p>
<p>Chapter 944: Too disparaging</p>
<p>A half-broken sword? And it was even rusty?</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded when they saw the sword. Warriors typically used superior-grade weapons, which were made of all sorts of divine metals and were refined by masters. Even if such a weapon were to break and lose a great deal of its spirituality, it would never rust, even if it were buried underground for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The material that was used in the rusted sword was probably not something that was impressive, but could it still be called a sword?</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue had heightened his wariness when he heard Yi Yun say those words, but he had never expected Yi Yun to take out a broken sword.</p>
<p>“You plan on using that piece of trash to break through my armor?” Tianya Haoyue asked in amusement.</p>
<p>“You'll know once you give it a try.” Just as Yi Yun's voice faded, the broken sword in his hand was slashed at Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's pupils constricted as he retreated in a hurry. Although he had mocked Yi Yun, Yi Yun's strength was redoubtable. He definitely could not take Yi Yun lightly.</p>
<p>Swish!</p>
<p>The moonblade in Tianya Haoyue's hand released a cold beam of light.</p>
<p>“Lunar Occultation!”</p>
<p>As the top disciple of the World Margin Sect, Tianya Haoyue was extremely wealthy! The armor that he wore was a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor, and the moonblade in his hand was a top-grade weapon.</p>
<p>The moment Lunar Occultation was produced, the moonblade suddenly turned ethereal, as though a crescent had descended into the mortal realm.</p>
<p>The moonblade slowly slashed down as Tianya Haoyue's actions were much slower than Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>With the cleaving of the moonblade, a night sky appeared behind TianYa Haoyue with a bright moon hanging in the sky!</p>
<p>During the process of the moonblade's cleaving, the moon was gradually devoured by darkness, leaving behind only a glimmer of light.</p>
<p>At the same time, the light in the space around Yi Yun had been engulfed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had finally felt a sense of danger, because not only did Lunar Occultation devour light, it also devoured life.</p>
<p>Once Yi Yun was completely engulfed by the darkness, he would be annihilated in it as well.</p>
<p>“That is a spatial attack.” In the seats of honor, Princess White Fox said softly as she frowned slightly. “That move is very powerful! Using that moonblade to conjure the strike makes the effects even more astonishing.”</p>
<p>Princess White Fox detested Tianya Haoyue greatly, but she had to admit that Tianya Haoyue had all sorts of techniques. It was unknown how Yi Yun would respond to that attack.</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned a blind eye to the rapidly compressing space. His eyes only had Tianya Haoyue in them.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was only a tiny rift left in front of Yi Yun, with Tianya Haoyue appearing a great distance away from him!</p>
<p>Yi Yun proceeded forward with the rusty sword in his hand as nomological fragments condensed themselves out of the void, attaching themselves to the broken sword.</p>
<p>The sword truth, pressing forward with an indomitable will!</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>The sword thrust forward with no return. Shatter!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the darkness, a radiant sun rose up and within the sun was Yi Yun's figure that was slashing at Tianya Haoyue with a sword in his hand!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's pupils constricted. Lunar Occultation had been shattered!</p>
<p>He raised his moonblade to block, hoping that the treasured saber would be able to block Yi Yun's attack!</p>
<p>Ka!</p>
<p>The moonblade met the pure Yang broken sword as terrifying energy blasted outwards, causing the moonblade to shatter and explode.</p>
<p>Oh!?</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was alarmed as he never expected Yi Yun's attack to be so powerful. However, Tianya Haoyue still had a supreme-grade armor, the Dragon's Roar Purple Armor that could not be broken at the Dao Manifestation realm. It was his greatest crutch!</p>
<p>“Nine Neonate!”</p>
<p>In the flames that surrounded Yi Yun, the Golden Crow screeched, and it was accompanied by the Neonate's cry as the nine hydra heads charged out of the inferno.</p>
<p>At the same time, even more, nomological fragments condensed on the broken sword.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was one with the sword as he slashed down at the gigantic shield in front of Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>The sword's edge was like a blistering sun!</p>
<p>Terrifying power surged towards the gigantic shield of light.</p>
<p>The scene of his shield of light being engulfed by the flames was mirrored in Tianya Haoyue's eyes.</p>
<p>An explosion was clearly heard at that very moment by the millions of warriors on the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>The shield of light had shattered!</p>
<p>With sharp sounds like that of glass shattering, the entire shield of light was reduced to countless fragments.</p>
<p>The sword beam had broken through the shield as it surged down like a flood!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's expression changed drastically. With the shield of light shattering, he could only use his armor to defend, but it was not a full-bodied defense.</p>
<p>And at this moment.</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>With another crisp cracking sound, Tianya Haoyue's body jerked backwards as he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He watched helplessly as his supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor was ripped from top to bottom!</p>
<p>Peng!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue's body was thrown back heavily as he slammed into a large boulder, producing a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Tianya Haoyue charged out of the rubble. His chest was stained with blood, blood that dripped down the cracks of the armor. He looked in disbelief at the crack in his armor.</p>
<p>His Dragon's Roar Purple Armor had been slashed through by Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Not only had his shield shattered, even his armor itself had been cracked by a single strike from Yi Yun!</p>
<p>It was a supreme-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor!</p>
<p>It was said to be indestructible at the Dao Manifestation, but now, it had been ripped apart by a Heaven Ascension realm warrior!</p>
<p>“You… you… ”</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue felt the pinch because the armor was extremely valuable! Although in the grand scheme of things, its grade wasn't the highest, it was specifically meant for Dao Manifestation realm warriors so as they could fully utilize its power. This was an extremely rare effect, but now, it had been cracked!</p>
<p>An armor that had cracked would have its grade drop from supreme-grade to superior-grade, even if the best master were to repair it.</p>
<p>A superior-grade Dao Manifestation realm armor would no longer be valuable.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that. You were hyping the powers of the armor, so I was afraid that my offensive strength was lacking, so I used a bit more strength. I never expected it to crack just like that.” As Yi Yun held the pure Yang broken sword, he shrugged and said innocently.</p>
<p>And when this was said, Tianya Haoyue nearly had his intestines twisted from his fury.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, well done!” On her seat of honor, Luo Huo'er shouted loudly!</p>
<p>She had a strong dislike for Tianya Haoyue for a while now, so what Yi Yun had done was so vindicative!</p>
<p>However, where did Yi Yun get that sword from?</p>
<p>At this moment, many people shifted their gazes towards Yi Yun's sword. Yi Yun had torn through Tianya Haoyue's armor, so other than Yi Yun having amazing strength, that sword was definitely no ordinary item!</p>
<p>The slash of the sword had shattered Tianya Haoyue's top-grade moonblade and it had torn through Tianya Haoyue's Dragon's Roar Purple Armor. The sword was definitely not simple!</p>
<p>People found it unbelievable that the rusty, worn-out broken sword was some peerless divine sword.</p>
<p>Yi Yun held the broken sword and he walked towards Tianya Haoyue. “Your strength doesn't seem to be that great after all. All you depend on is that Catoptric Deflection and that armor. Without those two things, do you have anything else? Or, are you going to throw in the towel now?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's words were combative. Typically, when two warriors sparred, they would speak humbly to each other after victory was determined. Seldom did warriors show such disregard for pleasantries.</p>
<p>However, Tianya Haoyue had mocked Nongying back when he defeated her!. Now, Yi Yun was returning Tianya Haoyue's words nearly intact back at him.</p>
<p>This was probably the most depressing thing. Tianya Haoyue's face was livid as he yearned to skin Yi Yun alive!</p>
<p>“You said I rely on my armor, but didn't you rely on that broken sword!? What sort of skill is that!?” Tianya Haoyue retorted. He could tell that Yi Yun's sword far exceeded his armor in value.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yi Yun nodded. “You're right. I shouldn't use this broken sword anymore. Your armor has been cracked, and it would reflect my win as being ungracious.”</p>
<p>With that said, Yi Yun flipped his hand, causing the pure Yang broken sword to disappear. What replaced it was a cuboid Heaven Upheaval Seal!</p>
<p>The simple Heaven Upheaval Seal did not have any luster to it. Yi Yun weighed it in his hand a few times as he felt the heaviness of the Heaven Upheaval Seal and he said with a laugh, “This shall be it then!”</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Tianya Haoyue immediately felt a dark cloud descend upon him, nearly planting his face to the ground.</p>
<p>In order to refute Yi Yun, he had spoken without thinking. He never expected that his words had ended up digging a hole for himself to jump into!</p>
<p>He was now seriously injured and his armor had cracked. Catoptric Deflection was also useless against Yi Yun, so how could he deal with Yi Yun!?</p>
<p>Although it was disgraceful to be defeated by an ancient sword, he would become the laughing stock of the alliance if he were to be smashed by the brick!</p>
<p>“Wait… Wait, wait!” I admit… ” Tianya Haoyue shouted as he wanted to throw in the towel. However, how could Yi Yun give him the chance? Instantly, he rushed in front of Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>With Heaven Upheaval Seal in his hand, the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence Dao patterns were embedded in them. The Heaven Upheaval Seal was glowing with dazzling golden light!</p>
<p>Catoptric Deflection was completely useless against the laws of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence. It was immediately penetrated, allowing the brick to smash right down on Tianya Haoyue's head!</p>
<p>As for Tianya Haoyue, not only was his armor cracked and him being heavily injured, even his moonblade had been shattered.</p>
<p>Fuck your motherfucking grandfather!</p>
<p>This was the final thought of Tianya Haoyue. The next moment, all he saw was darkness as he felt his head jerk violently, immediately making him dizzy. After that, he had no idea what happened.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue had been smacked down by Yi Yun's brick.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the audience fell silent.</p>
<p>They could forget about Yi Yun smacking Ye Yi, but now, even Tianya Haoyue…</p>
<p>He was the top disciple of the World Margin Sect, possessing treasures from head to toe. The Elders of the World Margin Sect had high hopes for him and there was a declaration that he would become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple. With all sorts of halos augmented around him, making him seem so awesome, yet, in front of everyone, he was smacked down by Yi Yun's brick.</p>
<p>How could he even continue living after this?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was way too good at disparaging others. The final brick strike was definitely done on purpose. It was best to not mess with this punk…</p>
<p>Many Luo clan geniuses had such a feeling after seeing Yi Yun's battle.</p>
<p>Some of them had already made up their minds to avoid him if they were to see him. If not, their outcome would be just like Tianya Haoyue.</p>
<p>Chapter 945: The direction in which the sword points</p>
<p>After Yi Yun defeated Tianya Haoyue, there was a moment of silence before deafening cheers came from the surrounding Luo clan warriors.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>To the Luo clan warriors, the battle that just happened in the southern desolate mountain plains was truly rousing. The dark clouds that came from Chi Zhuiyun's declaration of sweeping the Luo clan was wiped clean!</p>
<p>Yi Yun and Luo Huo'er had defeated Tianya Haoyue and goddess Xi Ye respectively. They could be called the Luo clan's Gemini Gods of War!</p>
<p>Furthermore, people realized that not only was Yi Yun powerful, even the sword in his hand was extraordinary. With that sword, Yi Yun had managed to slash through the Dragon's Roar Purple Armor that should not have been broken in the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>“I wonder what history Yi Yun's sword has… ” Someone asked curiously.</p>
<p>However, people shook their heads in response to this person's question. An elder with quite an impressive cultivation level said, “Since the weapon that Yi Yun has has been corroded so badly, it must be a weapon left behind from primordial eras! However, there are just too many divine weapons from primordial eras. The 12 Empyrean Heavens is so large, so to suddenly reveal one of them, who can guess its history. Many weapons exist in books of legend, having existed for hundreds of millions of years, or even billions of years. They might be buried in a ruin, yet to be discovered. The day that it sees the light of day again, those who had seen such a divine weapon might have already been dead for dozens of generations. It's impossible to recognize them based on the description in records, unless one knows where the ruin was and infer based on the ruin's history.”</p>
<p>“That's right! If there is a precise location of the ruin, especially if the ruin's master leaves behind notes or cultivation manuals, only then is there a chance to barely infer from those materials. However, over billions of years, the description in the books might not all be true.” Another elder said.</p>
<p>Although they had inferred that the weapon in Yi Yun's hand was of primordial origin, it was apparent that Yi Yun's strength was lacking for entering a primordial ruin in an escapade.</p>
<p>Then, the most likely possibility was that a mighty figure had taken the sword out of the primordial ruin, and eventually died from age or an accident, leaving behind a new ruin. Such an event might happen several times, and for some reason, this sword had eventually landed in Yi Yun's hands.</p>
<p>In that case, trying to probe its origins was truly nearly impossible. Of course, its power was beyond doubt.</p>
<p>“This should have been an opportunity that Yi Yun encountered. Only a genius with providence augmented on him can go further. If our Luo clan wants to become strong, we have to try our best to nurture and protect such a genius.”</p>
<p>The Luo clan had existed in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven for a very long time, but compared to a Divine Lord level faction, the Luo clan was still greatly lacking. And now, with the Fey Phantasm Sect looming in the horizon, it threatened the survival of the Luo clan. At such a juncture, the Luo clan had to use whatever hidden capabilities it has. If not, it was not impossible that the Fey Phantasm Sect would wipe them out.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, Tianya Haoyue, who had been knocked unconscious by the brick, had been hastily removed from the arena by people from the World Margin Sect. However, Yi Yun remained standing on the arena, while cheers continued!</p>
<p>As one of the Luo clan's Gemini Gods of War, Yi Yun's popularity surged, with him nearly catching up to Luo Huo'er.</p>
<p>Now, the Luo clan had already defeated the Eternal Eventide Sea and World Margin Sect, leaving only the Oracle Fey Empire, which also had the strongest person, Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had obtained the approval of Felicitous Rain Lord and he had previously defeated Princess White Fox. Furthermore, people could tell that Chi Zhuiyun had yet to go all out.</p>
<p>He was able to defeat Princess White Fox without doing his best. In addition to how he had defeated a White Fox clan genius that had been famous for a very long time, Chu Yunjian who was at the Dao Manifestation realm, Chi Zhuiyun's strength was unfathomable.</p>
<p>Now, the two genius of the Luo clan, Luo Huo'er and Yi Yun, were going to fight Chi Zhuiyun, but the members of the Luo clan were still uncertain.</p>
<p>What was the limit of Chi Zhuiyun's strength, considering how his cultivation level had reached half-step Dao Manifestation?</p>
<p>Many people had such questions in mind, but the outcome would be revealed almost immediately. The only people who remained undefeated was Luo Huo'er, Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun. Regardless of it was Luo Huo'er or Yi Yun, the fight any one of them had with Chi Zhuiyun was enough to send ardor and zeal coursing through their blood!</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit will fight first. Maybe Princess Purple Spirit will be able to defeat Chi Zhuiyun!”</p>
<p>“Don't be too optimistic. Although I adore Princess Purple Spirit, truthfully, the feeling that Chi Zhuiyun gives me is that he's very strong. That person is unfathomable, or else why do you think that Felicitous Rain Lord would approve of him? It is Felicitous Rain Lord, an important person that leaves even our Luo clan's Third Imperial Uncle in the dust!”</p>
<p>In fact, during Luo Huo'er's battle with Xi Ye and the battle between Yi Yun and Tianya Haoyue, many people had observed Chi Zhuiyun's reaction. From the beginning to the end, he did not reveal any looks of surprise. It was like everything was well within his grasp!</p>
<p>Especially in the seats of honor, Chu Yunjian and Prince Crimson Firmament had been monitoring Chi Zhuiyun from the very beginning. The way that Chi Zhuiyun remained so calm and composed, having that expression like he was confident about facing any sudden turmoil, was extremely irritating. But at the same time, it also cast a dark cloud over them.</p>
<p>A possibility for Chi Zhuiyun to remain so calm could very be that Luo Huo'er and Yi Yun's strength had never exceeded his expectations. He had the ability to deal with them!</p>
<p>“According to the rules, Princess Purple Spirit will fight Chi Zhuiyun first! Princess Purple Spirit is extremely gifted, but her cultivation level and age are her disadvantage. Even if Princess Purple Spirit is no match for Chi Zhuiyun, she will be able to drastically expend Chi Zhuiyun's stamina. In the following match, it would be Yi Yun, and he should be on par with Princess Purple Spirit in terms of strength. With the two of them fighting one after another, I don't believe that Chi Zhuiyun would remain undefeated!”</p>
<p>A few Luo clan courtiers discussed in private. Although Emperor Luo and Empress Luo were not present, it was only because they needed to consider their stature. For such an important showdown, everyone in the Luo clan attached a great importance with it, so the Luo clan courtiers naturally would not be absent. They were only standing amongst the ordinary spectators, without revealing their identities.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun wanted to sweep through the geniuses of the Luo clan with his blatant challenge, so he certainly had to accept challenges by the Luo clan geniuses one after another. Since the rules were as such, there was nothing about it being unfair!</p>
<p>“It should be Chi Zhuiyun and Princess Purple Spirit's turn now.”</p>
<p>The Luo clan courtiers discussed in private, but they realized that Yi Yun remained in the arena.</p>
<p>“What is Yi Yun doing?”</p>
<p>Many people failed to understand.</p>
<p>“Hmph! That punk probably has never experienced the cheers coming from millions of people and he is probably intoxicated by it!” In the seats of honor, Oracle Fey Empire's ambassador, Yu Tianfeng said disdainfully.</p>
<p>As long as Yi Yun remained in the arena, the fervent audience of the Luo clan would not stop with their cheers. Each burst was louder than the previous one, like it was a tsunami or landslide!</p>
<p>With millions of people watching the duels, the battles allowed one to make a name of oneself. Millions of warriors were cheering, reverberating the lands, tearing through the cosmos!</p>
<p>Such glory was the dream of countless people!</p>
<p>At this moment, it was Yi Yun's new peak in life, but it was not necessarily a good thing for young people. The moment that one was intoxicated in it, it was easy to lose oneself and make it difficult to extricate oneself from the situation. It might even put a halt to any progress!</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng apparently had such a thought as he said with a sneer, “That punk has only defeated an arrogant man from the World Margin Sect, and he thinks he's the strongest in the world? He has probably forgotten who he is. He has immersed himself in the cheers for nearly a minute. How long does he want to stand there?”</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng's words were not said with a voice transmission, so Chu Yunjian, Prince Crimson Firmament, Bai Yueqing and company, who were sitting in the seats of honor, heard him clearly.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament's face sank. Although he disliked Yi Yun, he was very irritated by the way that Yu Tianfeng spoke.</p>
<p>“Huo'er, it's time for you to go on up. Tell Yi Yun to return. Standing there for too long isn't good.” Prince Crimson Firmament did not want Yi Yun to continue standing there either. It would illustrate that the Luo clan geniuses were overly arrogant. Now, there was exuberance, but if Yi Yun was to be defeated by Chi Zhuiyun later, it would disgrace the Luo clan completely. When the time came, the irritating Yu Tianfeng would jump out and say something like “All of you shouted too fervently, in the end, he's not even able to withstand a hit”.</p>
<p>“Get Yi Yun to return? The reason why Yi Yun hasn't returned is because his conversing with me in a transmission!”</p>
<p>When Luo Huo'er said this, Yu Tianfeng guffawed and said, “Right! It's best to discuss how to expend Zhuiyun's stamina. If the two of you work well together, there might be that glimmer of hope. Everyone should always have hope, shouldn't they?” Yu Tianfeng said with a teasing tone as Luo Huo'er's eyebrows pricked up.</p>
<p>She gave Yu Tianfeng a teasing look as her lips moved slightly, as she transmitted her voice to Yi Yun: “Little Yun, proceed as you proposed.”</p>
<p>“Alright!” On the arena, Yi Yun gave a heavy nod.</p>
<p>At this moment, the arena in the vast wilderness had an audience of millions who were in fervor!</p>
<p>Yi Yun stood proudly amid the millions of cheers, and at that moment, Yi Yun was extremely ready!</p>
<p>Suddenly, he lifted his sword and pointed it straight at Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun! I'll be the only one battling you today! Come on down!” Yi Yun's roar echoed in the vast wilderness, abruptly drowning out the cheers from the millions of people!</p>
<p>“Come on down!”</p>
<p>“Come on down!”</p>
<p>“Come on down!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The loud voice reverberated again and again as millions of people held their breath. The cheers had also come to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was planning on challenging Chi Zhuiyun alone today!?</p>
<p>Millions of pairs of eyes instantly gathered on Chi Zhuiyun who was sitting on a seat of honor!</p>
<p>Chapter 946: A Sword Through Nirvana!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun immediately became the focus of attention.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun's voice, it constantly echoed throughout the desolate plains.</p>
<p>Only after Yi Yun's voice faded away did Chi Zhuiyun slowly speak. His voice wasn't loud, but it was easily able to suppress the din from millions of people, reaching the ears of everyone.</p>
<p>“You want to challenge me alone?”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's words were like he was of supreme stature, with a condescending arrogance.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!” Chi Zhuiyun burst out laughing. “To continue to challenge me after experiencing an intense battle, you are really biting off more than you can chew!”</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, he stood up from his seat of honor. Putting his hand out, his spear landed in his palm.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at Luo Huo'er, who was sitting on a seat of honor as well. “You know that you will lose to me, so you aren't going to fight?”</p>
<p>“Tch!” Luo Huo'er scoffed. “Who do you think you are? Does every genius of the alliance revolve around you? You think that we want to engage in a tag-team battle? Today, Yi Yun alone will battle you so that you won't come up with excuses after losing!”</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er was merciless in her mockery, but the crowd was secretly horrified when they heard her. Luo Huo'er was too bold with her words!</p>
<p>In fact, even though many members of the Luo clan were cheering for Yi Yun, they were actually a little flustered. With Luo Huo'er saying such things, how was she going to get out of the situation if they lost in the end?</p>
<p>“Princess Purple Spirit, your words seem certain that Zhuiyun will lose? Is it because of Yi Yun?” The person who spoke was Yu Tianfeng. It was like he had heard the funniest joke in the world.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er could not be bothered with the retard as she looked at Yi Yun and sent a voice transmission. “Little Yun, I'm counting on you. I've already helped you take the step forward.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was speechless. “You have so much confidence in me, but you don't even know the limits to my strength, right?”</p>
<p>“I really do not know. In a while, if you were to lose, we will be bearing the brunt of it together, so I hope that you can give me a pleasant surprise.” Luo Huo'er said nonchalantly. She always had such a rash personality. So what if they lost?</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard Luo Huo'er's words, a smile flashed in his eyes. “Alright!”</p>
<p>“Since you want to challenge me, I'll grant you your wish!” As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, he took a step out into the void, and he walked towards Yi Yun, who was standing in the middle of the arena!</p>
<p>Every step he took caused fluctuations in the void, like it was the rhythm of the Dao.</p>
<p>It was tens of thousands of feet away from the seats of honor to where Yi Yun was in the middle of the arena. However, in a few steps, Chi Zhuiyun had already landed in the arena, just a hundred feet away from Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“If you and Purple Spirit had joined forces to fight me one after another, I might have to be slightly serious. But now… if I'm just dealing with you alone, the War Demon Form is sufficient!”</p>
<p>War Demon Form?</p>
<p>No one understood what War Demon Form Chi Zhuiyun was referring to, but without a doubt, it was definitely not Chi Zhuiyun's full strength.</p>
<p>Yi Yun laughed and said, “Really? Usually, people who say such things raise death flags and die even faster.”</p>
<p>The conversation between the two was sharp and biting, stirring the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>This was exactly what it meant to be young and crazy!</p>
<p>“Cut the nonsense!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun raised his spear as his Shura Domain spread out!</p>
<p>In an instant, a crimson patch emanated from beneath Chi Zhuiyun's feet, instantly engulfing the entire arena!</p>
<p>This sanguine energy enveloped Chi Zhuiyun and his spear. There were countless phantom images of wraiths and demons struggling and wiggling above the spear as they emitted intermittent howling and wailing.</p>
<p>For such a scene to appear suddenly in the eyes of millions of warriors, it was like Chi Zhuiyun had charged out of a hellish prison!</p>
<p>Even as spectators, they felt a sense of horror when they saw such a scene.</p>
<p>“It's Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Dao Domain!”</p>
<p>In the eyes of everyone, it was as if the entire southern desolate mountain plains had disappeared. There was only Chi Zhuiyun in this world, like he was the center of the universe, the source of all massacres! Just looking at him made people feel like they were lost in nightmares, unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Just a Dao Domain alone had enveloped millions of people, impeding their mental processes. Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Dao Domain was simply amazing!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun has been engulfed by the Dao Domain!”</p>
<p>“Say, it seems that Yi Yun has yet to demonstrate his own Dao Domain!”</p>
<p>People thought about it carefully, and indeed, Yi Yun still did not have a Dao Domain. A Dao Domain was the attainment of a certain nomological cultivation level. It was able to affect the surrounding space, forming a small world.</p>
<p>Dao Domain was a realm of Dao, but Dao Domains might not be suitable to be used in battle because a Dao Domain itself did not have any offensive capabilities.</p>
<p>Even the members of the Luo clan had to admit that Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Dao Domain was terrifying. It was like it permeated all of existence, slaughtering gods and killing buddhas, like the entire world had fallen into darkness!</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he had been engulfed by the darkness. In their perception, they could not even locate Yi Yun anymore.</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan felt their hearts tighten. If Yi Yun was completely suppressed by Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain, there was no need to carry on the fight.</p>
<p>And at this moment —</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>A dazzling light flashed as pure Yang flames burst out from the darkness and shot straight towards Chi Zhuiyun like it was the light of dawn that pierced through the twilight.</p>
<p>This was a sword beam that pierced the heart.</p>
<p>Pure Yang Sword Intent!</p>
<p>Back then, the Pure Yang Sword Palace owner had used this strike to cleave a Great World apart, and now, in Yi Yun's hand, this strike pierced through the Shura Dao Domain, moving forward in the darkness in an indomitable fashion!</p>
<p>Weng!</p>
<p>When Chi Zhuiyun thrust his spear forward like a dragon, the swirling wraiths lingering around the crimson spear headed straight for Yi Yun!</p>
<p>An intense clash between spear and sword beams!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With an explosion, the wraiths were consumed by the pure Yang flames, vanishing into nothingness!</p>
<p>“Not bad! But in my domain, the power of bloodlust that I have is endless. I want to see how much you can burn!”</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, he stirred the clouds and the wind with his spear. The wraiths that were incinerated by the pure Yang flames crawled out once again. They struggled to come together and they increased in size, like they were emanating a devilish fire.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>It was alarming. How could they reappear again after being burnt to ash by the pure Yang flames?</p>
<p>This was probably what they meant by the resurgence of dying embers.</p>
<p>What Chi Zhuiyun said that the power of bloodlust was endless in the Shura Domain was nothing but the truth!</p>
<p>If the power of bloodlust could constantly be reborn, how were these demons going to be vanquished?</p>
<p>The crowd began to worry for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>At this moment, the demons had combined with each other to form a war demon that had bare fangs protruding out of a hideous face in front of Chi Zhuiyun. The war demon went from a genuflection before slowly standing up. Its body was hundreds of feet tall, and in front of Yi Yun, it resembled a small mountain.</p>
<p>“Roar!”</p>
<p>The war demon suddenly gave an angry bellow.</p>
<p>The angry roar caused the minds of the warriors present to quiver, as their lifeblood churned in turmoil.</p>
<p>What is that!?</p>
<p>“War Demon Form!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun hooked his spear up and immediately, a sea of blood was stirred!</p>
<p>At the same time, the terrifying war demon raised the spear in its hand, its actions identical to Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Like a gigantic pillar, the spear was thrust ruthlessly at Yi Yun. Thick bloodlust caused the surrounding air to turn viscous and sticky.</p>
<p>“It's time for your defeat!”</p>
<p>The spear struck out as the world faded in color!</p>
<p>“Just nice!”</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun struck out with his sword as well.</p>
<p>The rusty broken sword, a lonely figure, charged at the war demon, like a moth heading into the fire.</p>
<p>However, just as Yi Yun was about to clash with the war demon's spear, a dazzling brilliance burst out from behind him!</p>
<p>The Golden Crow screeched as the Nine Neonate howled!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An explosive clash immediately caused a shockwave to burst out into the surroundings.</p>
<p>In the sky above Yi Yun, shockwaves burst out incessantly, penetrating the clouds, and leaving a gigantic hole above the arena in the desolate plains.</p>
<p>It was just the beginning of that single strike.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Both sides exchanged attacks again and again. Terrifying power and astounding speed were possessed by the two figures as thunder-like claps echoed from their exchanges!</p>
<p>It was so fast that the warriors spectating the battle found it overwhelming.</p>
<p>They held their breaths as their hearts leaped to their throats.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun doesn't have a Dao Domain, but every one of his nomological sword strikes is able to cleave the Shura Dao Domain in front of him apart,” said Bai Yueqing.</p>
<p>Chu Yunjian was also surprised seeing this battle. In the previous battles, Yi Yun did not even use his true strength. The speed at which his sword was slashed and the power in his strikes were too amazing. It had assumed formlessness.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun's cultivation realm was lower than Chi Zhuiyun's. If they continued to expend their energies in such a manner, the road ahead for Yi Yun would be bleak. The crux of the matter was that Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Dao Domain's bloodlust power was endless.</p>
<p>If this continued on, Yi Yun would be lacking in stamina.</p>
<p>At this moment, a desolate aura suddenly surged out of the Shura Domain!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was calm, as an ancient and lifeless concept was augmented on his sword.</p>
<p>This strike thrust straight at Chi Zhuiyun and accompanying it was a stance of the soteriological annihilation of everything!</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>The broken sword clashed with the gigantic war demon's spear, and time seemed to freeze at that moment!</p>
<p>A crisp crack sounded, like a mirror breaking. The war demon and its spear appeared like a statue that had experienced eons in an instant.</p>
<p>First, it turned gray before shattering, and finally, it was reduced to smithereens!</p>
<p>Withering concept — A Sword Through Nirvana!</p>
<p>In front of time, even a demon would wither and decay. A demon could be reborn after being slain, but once they turned to ash because of time, they would experience complete nirvana.</p>
<p>With the war demon soteriologically annihilated, Yi Yun's sword maintained a slashing pose, but there were no longer any barriers. His sword was aiming straight at Chi Zhuiyun!</p>
<p>Chapter 947: Celestial Demon Form</p>
<p>“Cha!”</p>
<p>A sword that was burning with pure Yang flames came straight at Chi Zhuiyun's face!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was alarmed as he swiped his spear that could wipe out armies!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sword and spear beams clashed, resulting in a furious explosion. A visible shockwave quaked the Shura Dao Domain, as the Dao Domain began to turn chaotic.</p>
<p>“Your War Demon Form is just that and nothing more!” Yi Yun's voice echoed throughout the southern desolate mountain plains!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's pupils constricted, but he did not retort.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's strike had indeed caught him by surprise, it had annihilated his war demon!</p>
<p>In Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Domain, the war demon was undying, it could be said to be invincible!</p>
<p>All opponents would have suffered defeat from a battle of attrition unless they could break through his Shura Domain. However, Chi Zhuiyun had no peer who had such strength.</p>
<p>But now, the war demon that was slain by Yi Yun had its vitality withered, so it could never be reborn!</p>
<p>The Shura Domain did not breakdown, but the War Demon Form had collapsed. This was the first time that Chi Zhuiyun encountered such a situation.</p>
<p>“What kind of attack is that?” Chi Zhuiyun asked in a solemn voice.</p>
<p>“Withering concept.” Yi Yun did not conceal it. There were millions of people present, with old freaks that had lived for hundreds of thousands of years. There was bound to be someone who could recognize it.</p>
<p>The withering concept was able to directly extinguish vitality, preventing it from recovering.</p>
<p>There were numerous elixirs in this world that could regrow broken limbs, or reconnect meridians, but there was no elixir in the world that could increase the lifespan of a person unless that person's life force potential had yet to end.</p>
<p>This was the power of the ages. Withering was unstoppable. The world would not last forever, and it was difficult for warriors to gain immortality — at least that was what it seemed at this moment in time.</p>
<p>“So it's the Withering concept. That concept is extremely strange and very rare.” A warrior said in awe.</p>
<p>On his seat of honor, Yu Tianfeng's eyebrows pricked up slightly. He never expected that Yi Yun would possess a few tricks up his sleeves. Yi Yun had used the Withering concept to tear Chi Zhuiyun's War Demon Form down.</p>
<p>Previously, Chi Zhuiyun had declared that the War Demon Form was sufficient in his battle with Yi Yun. But now, the fact of the matter was that it was far from sufficient using the War Demon Form!</p>
<p>“It looks like I have underestimated you. I take back my words. Then, I want to see if you can handle my next move!” Chi Zhuiyun raised his spear high.</p>
<p>Yi Yun grunted coldly and said, “There's no reason for me to break through your moves, you can try to see if you can withstand my sword and sabers!”</p>
<p>A sword beam flashed around as a thin sword edge tore through a huge blackened rift in the ground like a large and terrifying claw!</p>
<p>At the same time, 999 Thousand Snow flying sabers flew out from Yi Yun's interspatial ring. The Thousand Snow Domain was set up in place!</p>
<p>Intense saber aura and sword beams were things that the Shura Dao Domain could not longer contain. Warriors who were slightly weaker and stood in the direction of Chi Zhuiyun could not help but take a few steps back.</p>
<p>Their protective Yuan Qi had been invoked by the sword beams and saber aura!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's offensive was too terrifying. Even without a Dao Domain, just that attack alone was enough to cause Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain to experience tremors. However… it still did not collapse!</p>
<p>“A good sword! A good saber! But that's only because you have good weapons!” Chi Zhuiyun bellowed as he slammed his spear into the ground.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The ground blasted upwards!</p>
<p>Rubble flew up as soil filled the sky!</p>
<p>Following the landing of Chi Zhuiyun's spear, the Shura Domain beneath his feet abruptly contracted, converging back into his spear.</p>
<p>A ferocious demonic phantom surfaced on his spear. This demonic phantom seemed to blend with the spear as one.</p>
<p>The spear was trembling as it issued bloodthirsty cries.</p>
<p>Many warriors felt their eyes start to hurt. It was a peerless weapon of murder!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's spear tip swept the ground, and immediately, the ground burst into flames and it was dyed crimson.</p>
<p>“Ten Thousand Demons!”</p>
<p>The spear produced rapid shadows, as the spear tip clashed with the sword beam!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's sword encountered Yi Yun' sword and sabers!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A burning hell appeared as Chi Zhuiyun and Yi Yun's figures were immediately deluged by the color of blood.</p>
<p>The entire arena was immediately consumed by a sea of blood.</p>
<p>And in this sanguine color, countless wraiths appeared and pounced on Yi Yun. They let out cackles that sent shivers down the back!</p>
<p>This spear attack was a form of purgatory!</p>
<p>Many warriors felt their heartbeats racing. They were not immersed in purgatory, but their minds were affected.</p>
<p>It was too powerful. The Shura Domain's power could even be augmented on the spear beam. It was like there was no way to see Chi Zhuiyun's full power!</p>
<p>“This time, Yi Yun should be defeated,” said Demon Girl.</p>
<p>He was one who was qualified to make Chi Zhuiyun produce such an attack. Furthermore, Chi Zhuiyun was the number one genius of the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's strength had astounded her. But at this stage in the battle, could Yi Yun still withstand it?</p>
<p>The Luo clan disciples held their breaths as they watched intently. What had happened to Yi Yun?</p>
<p>At this moment, a sword beam tore through the sea of blood. The blood hell seemed like ice that encountered fire. It constantly melted as the wraiths let out shrill screams before turning to dust.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's figure dashed out of the sea along with his sword beam.</p>
<p>His sword was humming while the space around the sword was distorted. The sword was augmented with the Dao patterns of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>The Dao patterns meandered in a undefinable but abstruse manner.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's eyebrows pricked up. He had previously seen Yi Yun's mysterious sword that was augmented by the Dao patterns. The Dao patterns were extremely abstruse. A slash with such an augmented sword varied in strength. A weak strike was no different to an ordinary strike, but when it was strong enough, it could defeat Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>Previously, Chi Zhuiyun believed that that was the limit to the Dao-patterned strike. But now, from the looks of it, it was far from the truth. Therefore, in the battle with Yi Yun, the Dao-patterned sword was enough to rip through his Ten Thousand Demons!</p>
<p>What attack was it, and why was it so powerful?</p>
<p>This was the first time that Chi Zhuiyun encountered an opponent that belonged to the younger generation whose limits he could not fathom. Furthermore, it was only a single attack!</p>
<p>At this moment, Chi Zhuiyun was alarmed, but Yi Yun was surprised as well!</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existences's Dao-patterned sword power was as powerful as he wished it to be. It only became stronger against a stronger opponent!</p>
<p>However, Chi Zhuiyun was too powerful. Chi Zhuiyun's Ten Thousand Demons attack had consumed a great deal of Yi Yun's Yuan Qi!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had obviously not used the entire 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, but Yi Yun did not want to use his trump card too easily. Furthermore, he wanted to force his strength to its limits. Besides, he knew that Chi Zhuiyun had an ace up his sleeve!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had previously said that the War Demon Form was sufficient to deal with him.</p>
<p>Although it was later proven that the War Demon Form was insufficient, it also meant that Chi Zhuiyun had a stronger form!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's style of battle was like a predator approaching its prey. He would close in and finally issue a critical strike!</p>
<p>In such a battle, it was not a simple battle to determine whose attack was stronger. This was because Yi Yun did not have the confidence in the fact that he could beat Chi Zhuiyun in a single move!</p>
<p>Once his strongest move failed to end the battle, he would be the one that was defeated!</p>
<p>“You are quite an impressive opponent!” said Chi Zhuiyun. “Ever since the Yuan Opening realm, I have never been defeated by any peer. Today, I will not be defeated either! Your Dao-patterned sword must have a limit. As for me, I will use my strongest move. It is one that I have not fully grasped — Celestial Demon Form!”</p>
<p>“Here's a warning. At the moment that the Celestial Demon Form is used, it will be difficult for me to control due to its power. I might accidentally kill you. There's still time for you to throw in the towel! Your cultivation level is lower than me by half a level after all. Such an opponent like you is rare and I look forward to your growth.”</p>
<p>Chapter 948: Who is the Shura</p>
<p>When Chi Zhuiyun mentioned how he was looking forward to Yi Yun's growth, it was like he was a senior talking to a junior. This pissed off a great deal of the Luo clan clansmen present.</p>
<p>But even though they were pissed, no one made any sarcastic comments because Chi Zhuiyun was really formidable.</p>
<p>War Demon Form! Celestial Demon Form!</p>
<p>From the beginning of the battle, Chi Zhuiyun had mentioned that the War Demon Form was only his first battle form.</p>
<p>Other than the bloodlust war demon that attacked Yi Yun previously, even the 'Ten Thousand Demons' spear attack that Chi Zhuiyun used at the end, none of them deviated from the War Demon Form!</p>
<p>A War Demon Form was already so powerful, so to what extent would the Celestial Demon Form signify? According to Chi Zhuiyun, this was his ultimate power, one that he could not control.</p>
<p>A confrontation of this degree was obviously life-threatening!</p>
<p>It was not impossible for one's life to be threatened in an intense battle between top geniuses as they used their full strengths.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Luo clan was breaking out into a cold sweat for Yi Yun!</p>
<p>They did not know if Yi Yun was able to withstand Chi Zhuiyun's final attack.</p>
<p>In fact, if Yi Yun had reached his limits, he could choose to back down. No one would say a thing. After all, Yi Yun was younger and his cultivation level was lower. As for Chi Zhuiyun, he had already begun his Dao Manifestation. Such a qualitative gap required Yi Yun to possess much greater talent to make up for it!</p>
<p>However, Chi Zhuiyun was already a paragon prodigy, so to have one's talent to surpass his?</p>
<p>It was extremely difficult!</p>
<p>At this moment, in the Luo clan royal palace, a group of ministers, as well as the lofty Emperor Luo, were viewing the battle though a disk array!</p>
<p>Emperor Luo was dressed in royal robes, sitting high and mighty. However, he was not feeling relaxed.</p>
<p>He was concerned about the outcome of the battle, as well as Yi Yun's safety!</p>
<p>“Young master Yi can be proud of being able to battle Chi Zhuiyun to such a degree!”</p>
<p>The Luo clan courtiers and even the ministers, were now addressing Yi Yun courteously, adding the deferential title of 'young master'.</p>
<p>“That's right! Since Chi Zhuiyun can't even control his Celestial Demon Form himself, clashing with him would be a grave risk. In fact… ending it here would be for the best. There is still time. With the talent that Young Master Yi has presented, he is in no way inferior to Chi Zhuiyun.” Another elderly minister said.</p>
<p>As he spoke, his palms were sweaty.</p>
<p>He was feeling very nervous!</p>
<p>Not only was he nervous, many of the other important figures of the Luo clan were extremely nervous.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy for the Luo clan to recruit such a peerless genius. He was the Luo clan's treasure. Even if Yi Yun did not become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, he was bound to shine in the future, adding strength to the Luo clan!</p>
<p>This was particularly important to the Luo clan that was in the midst of a crisis.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun wanted to take on Chi Zhuiyun's strongest move. If there were any accidents, even if he did not die, he might be severely injured, possibly affecting his future achievements!</p>
<p>However, ending the battle was only the hope of the elderly Luo clan minister. After a few moments of silence, Yi Yun's energy was churning. His aura was constantly rising like he was a mountain with an endless peak!</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not need to answer. His aura was already an answer.</p>
<p>“Good! You should be honored. This is the first time that I am forced to use the Celestial War Demon against a peer ever since I stepped into the Yuan Opening realm. Even Senior Felicitous Rain Lord gave me his approval because of my Celestial War Demon! I'll let you see the anger of the Celestial Demon!”</p>
<p>A foul aura surged from Chi Zhuiyun's body as he held his spear!</p>
<p>The foul aura surged into the sky, dyeing the firmaments dark red.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's body was completely immersed in the foul aura as his skin turned azure. His body became more burly and taller. His eyes turned cold and heartless as well.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was like Chi Zhuiyun had become a demon himself!</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>With a demonic roar, a Shura demon that was a hundred feet tall appeared behind Chi Zhuiyun. This Shura demon had absorbed all of the energy in the Shura Dao Domain, and at this moment, it was like the sovereign of the heavens and earth!</p>
<p>“What a terrifying stance. Chi Zhuiyun has perfectly combined his Dao Domain, his spear attacks, and bloodline into one. Is that the final Celestial Demon Form!?” On a seat of honor, Chu Yunjian could tell very clearly. Although he was no match for it, he was still able to assess it well.</p>
<p>“It's difficult to resist it!” Bai Yueqing said as well.</p>
<p>The terrifying killing intent prevented people from looking straight at it. The millions of people present felt their hearts being stirred by the demonic aura, like they were about to explode.</p>
<p>“Everyone has a demon in their mind!” Chi Zhuiyun's voice sounded like it came out of hell.</p>
<p>It was like the whispers of demons, arousing the emotions and passions of people!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, the inducement of mental demons in everyone's mind and the stirring of the demonic auras of the heaven and earth, this move will be the result of your glorious defeat!”</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun spoke, he merged with the Shura Demon behind him. The spear in his hand appeared like it would cut through the world!</p>
<p>“Celestial Demon Form — Hellblood Stupa!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun struck with his spear!</p>
<p>A thrust as fast as lightning stirred the rolling power of foul sanguine energies. Chi Zhuiyun's figure instantly traversed the blockade of space and arrived in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Hellblood Stupa! The first blow eradicates all mortal life, the second wipes out ghosts and spirits, and the third slays the Gods and Buddhas themselves!</p>
<p>This was a spear that was indomitable. Nothing could withstand it.</p>
<p>All of Chi Zhuiyun's aura was gathered on the spear.</p>
<p>Even if gods and buddhas were in front of him, they would be penetrated into dust!</p>
<p>And at this moment, Yi Yun's surging aura completely burst out!</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>From around Yi Yun, 999 flying sabers shot out together. The flying sabers were not aimed at Chi Zhuiyun, they hummed in the air, exposing the Dao patterns hidden on the flying sabers.</p>
<p>At the same time, Dao patterns on the pure Yang broken sword burst with light as well!</p>
<p>Countless dark golden Dao patterns danced in the air, illuminating the sky!</p>
<p>“What a coincidence. Your move is a Shura Demon, but so is mine!”</p>
<p>As Yi Yun spoke, all the nomological Dao patterns in the air merged into one!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Dao pattern resonated as a gigantic Shura phantom appeared in the infinite divine light. This Shura Celestial Demon was slowly pushing a gigantic wheel.</p>
<p>In this wheel, there were countless demons and wraiths engraved on it. They were in all shapes and sizes. Some were wailing, some were hissing, and some were killing. A terrifying demonic aura burst into the sky, glazing the eyes of everyone who saw it. They found it difficult to extricate themselves, like they would sink into it if they were not careful.</p>
<p>“This move… ”</p>
<p>“What is that!?”</p>
<p>In the southern desolate mountain plains, the millions of people spectating this battle were alarmed! Yi Yun's 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was something only a few people like Bai Yueqing had seen.</p>
<p>However, back when this move was seen in the Fey Refining Rock array, Yi Yun's 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was only a tiny wheel. Although it was very powerful, it did not have a shocking appearance. It was unlike its present incarnation of it being pushed by a hundred-foot-tall Shura Demon.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's attack was similar in form to Chi Zhuiyun's, but it felt completely different!</p>
<p>What sort of Dao was that?</p>
<p>People had seen the Dao of Wind, Rain, Lightning, swords and sabers, killing intents and all sorts of different Dao. However, Yi Yun's Dao did not belong to any one of them.</p>
<p>It was like it only happened during the annihilation of the world when all things experienced Nirvana!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's spear had thrust straight down at the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's core!</p>
<p>A Celestial Demon against another Celestial Demon!</p>
<p>Who was the Shura?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>An explosive clash echoed throughout the plains after the two split off.</p>
<p>In between Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun, the ground shattered into dust as a gigantic crater appeared. The sky above them was dyed red!</p>
<p>The clouds in a radius of a thousand miles had been pushed away. This apocalyptic scene left many warriors silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Who won?</p>
<p>No one expected that Yi Yun's final attack was so similar to Chi Zhuiyun's!</p>
<p>The blood aura remained congealed together for a long time before it dissipated. Only then did people see Chi Zhuiyun standing with his back facing Yi Yun. His body was stiff and his face was pale. Although he did not look like he had received any physical wounds, people could tell that he was in a terrible state!</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was not in a much better situation. It was even worse. His body was covered in blood, and there was a shocking hole of blood on his left shoulder!</p>
<p>It was just an inch or two away from his heart!</p>
<p>Although this strike had failed to rip through Yi Yun's body, if it wasn't for the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence blocking it, the spear would have pierced through Yi Yun's heart. If that was the case, the consequences were unthinkable!</p>
<p>Even if Yi Yun did not die, he would be debilitated. By losing a great deal of life blood, he would require several years and countless treasures to recover.</p>
<p>What Chi Zhuiyun said about his strike being possibly fatal was not a lie.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun in such a state, the foreheads of the elderly ministers of the Luo clan oozed with sweat.</p>
<p>Emperor Luo was slightly relieved as well.</p>
<p>Close! It was too close!</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yi Yun was fine. The injury in his shoulder was nothing fatal.</p>
<p>“Did Chi Zhuiyun win? Or is it a tie?”</p>
<p>Around the arena, members of the Luo clan asked. Based on Chi Zhuiyun's condition, it was hard to tell.</p>
<p>If the two still had the strength to fight, they could continue battling!</p>
<p>Now, no one from the Luo clan wished for the battle to continue. They were afraid that harm would befall Yi Yun!</p>
<p>At this moment…</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>With a light ring, the clothes on Chi Zhuiyun's upper body burst open, revealing his cut muscles. At this moment, people could see that a black wheel was imprinted on Chi Zhuiyun's chest!</p>
<p>There were demon kings, wraiths, heretic gods imprinted on the wheel. It was the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence that Yi Yun had used!</p>
<p>This wheel had been imprinted on Chi Zhuiyun's flesh?</p>
<p>“What… is this move of yours?” Chi Zhuiyun said with great difficulty as his voice trembled.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence engraved on his chest seemed to start moving. The demons and wraiths on the wheel seemed to come alive. They hissed and cackled. The power of the Shura Celestial Demon was annihilating Chi Zhuiyun's life force!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun gripped his spear tightly.</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>The spear's tip was stabbed into the mostly annihilated ground, but it still failed to support Chi Zhuiyun's body!</p>
<p>Everyone was astonished when they saw this scene!</p>
<p>“That move is so terrifying!? What the hell is it!?”</p>
<p>“It's destruction! I sensed destruction from the wheel. It's the power of destruction!” An elder with a profound cultivation level said in astonishment.</p>
<p>It was the Dao of Destruction!?</p>
<p>Everything in this world, be it a boundless world, dragons, phoenixes or ants, they could be born, but they could be destroyed as well!</p>
<p>Nothing in the universe was seemingly eternal.</p>
<p>Destruction was a law that nothing could escape from!</p>
<p>The move might have ended when the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was imprinted on Chi Zhuiyun's body, but it was still destroying Chi Zhuiyun's life force!</p>
<p>Destruction was endless!</p>
<p>Even though Chi Zhuiyun's life force was immensely powerful, he found it more and more difficult to withstand the power of destruction. Finally, as he gripped the pole of his spear, he slowly fell to the ground…</p>
<p>Chapter 949: Dao of Destruction</p>
<p>When Chi Zhuiyun collapsed to the ground with his spear in hand, there was silence around the plains despite there being millions of people present!</p>
<p>The spear was still standing, in a proud but bleak manner on the desolate plains, like it was guarding its owner.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was holding the pure Yang broken sword in his hand. His body was covered in blood. Even though all of his energy had been depleted and he was severely injured, he was still suffusing with killing intent!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had collapsed!</p>
<p>The stunning battle was breathtaking!</p>
<p>This was an epic battle that had shocked the Luo clan, the White Fox clan and the entire alliance!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's final move, the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence that defeated Chi Zhuiyun, made everyone tremble when they recalled it.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's Celestial Demon Form was powerful. Even a warrior at the Dao Manifestation perfection realm would probably be killed by the attack.</p>
<p>However, Chi Zhuiyun had been defeated in his battle with Yi Yun!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was younger than Chi Zhuiyun, and his cultivation level was lower as well.</p>
<p>It was too terrifying!</p>
<p>“How could… this happen?”</p>
<p>In her seat of honor, Demon Girl looked at Chi Zhuiyun as her charming body quivered.</p>
<p>She had always secretly admired Chi Zhuiyun, but due to the difference in their respective statuses, she had never revealed it.</p>
<p>In her heart, Chi Zhuiyun was invincible.</p>
<p>But today, the legend had been broken!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's challenge of the Luo clan had ended in him being defeated by Yi Yun, who had leapfrogged him!</p>
<p>This was something unacceptable to Demon Girl.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had not only been defeated, he had been defeated by a Luo clan genius who was younger than him!</p>
<p>As for Yu Tianfeng, he was feeling distraught.</p>
<p>As the ambassador to the Oracle Fey Empire, he was doing as he pleased in the Luo clan because of Felicitous Rain Lord. Even Emperor Luo treated him with respect.</p>
<p>In addition, Chi Zhuiyun, who had gained the approval of Felicitous Rain Lord, was also one of the reasons why Yu Tianfeng was so bold. After all, it was very likely that Chi Zhuiyun would become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple.</p>
<p>But now… Chi Zhuiyun had been defeated!</p>
<p>He suddenly felt like his backbone had been ripped out, and his entire being was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>With a slight probe, he realized that Chi Zhuiyun's lifeforce was constantly being depleted. The strange move that Yi Yun used was still consuming Chi Zhuiyun's lifeforce at this very moment.</p>
<p>This tightened his heart. It was inevitable that having the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence continue to consume the unconscious Chi Zhuiyun's lifeforce, the results would be irreparable losses.</p>
<p>“Zhuiyun!” Yu Tianfeng had a rude awakening as his body flashed, arriving beside Chi Zhuiyun. He placed a palm on Chi Zhuiyun's back.</p>
<p>As an ambassador of the Oracle Fey Empire, Yu Tianfeng did not have outstanding talent. He had become an ambassador because of his family background and his nobility. Only when he infused energy into Chi Zhuiyun's body did he realize the terror of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's Dao patterns.</p>
<p>A force that had already left its owner, Yi Yun, should have been like rootless duckweed. It should have been easy to remove it, but when Yu Tianfeng infused his energy into Chi Zuiyun's body, the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence had ended up consuming and destroying his energy. It left him momentarily flustered.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yu Tianfeng wasn't young, so although his talent was mediocre, he still had a high cultivation level.</p>
<p>After a long while, Yu Tianfeng had finally managed to vanquish the destructive force in Chi Zhuiyun's body, causing the Dao patterns of the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence to slowly disappear.</p>
<p>“This… ” The surrounding warriors had all noticed this scene.</p>
<p>As a warrior of the older generation, Yu Tianfeng had to go through such laborious efforts to remove the remaining energies of a junior's attack?</p>
<p>Regardless of how weak Yu Tianfeng was, he had age on his side. This implied how powerful Yi Yun's 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's Dao of Destruction was!</p>
<p>What was destruction?</p>
<p>The Dao of Destruction were divided into the Minor Dao of Destruction and the Major Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>The Minor Dao of Destruction was the destruction of all living creatures, including the destruction of mankind, or even that of minor worlds!</p>
<p>The Minor Dao of Destruction was already extremely obscure and difficult. Without a great opportunity, it was impossible to gain insights into it.</p>
<p>It was ranked as one of the Great Dao in the cosmos alongside Yin-Yang and space-time, above the five elements!</p>
<p>As for the Major Dao of Destruction, it was close to the power of god.</p>
<p>The Universe was created out of Chaos, but after countless years, it would ultimately end in destruction!</p>
<p>The Major Dao of Destruction was how elevated worlds like the 12 Empyrean Heavens would be destroyed, or even the entire universe!</p>
<p>How long would that take? It was impossible to predict.</p>
<p>It should be said that ever since the birth of martial arts, no one had been able to experience the destruction of an elevated world on the level of the 12 Empyrean Heavens. There was no way to even begin probing the Major Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>The Major Dao of Destruction was ranked alongside the laws of Chaos that created the universe, being almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>There was a peerless mighty figure in the 12 Empyrean Heavens that attempted to gain insights into this Dao, but the destruction of the universe was too distant, so he eventually failed to make any progress.</p>
<p>People believed that the Dao of Destruction contained in Yi Yun's 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was just a Minor Dao of Destruction, but it had to be one of the top grades in the Minor Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Tianfeng had already carried Chi Zhuiyun and had flown back to the seats of honor.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was severely injured!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun said that he could not control the power of his final move, which might end up in it being fatal, but so was Yi Yun's!</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was something that Yi Yun could not control very well as well. After being struck by it, Chi Zhuiyun would definitely lose a great deal of his lifeblood!</p>
<p>At the moment that Yu Tianfeng landed, he saw Luo Huo'er give him a sardonic look.</p>
<p>This made Yu Tianfeng's face sink. He had heard of the princess's character. Previously, he had said nasty words in front of her, and now, he had been ruthlessly smacked in the face, so how could he stay here any longer?</p>
<p>“Let us go!” Yu Tianfeng said through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>He flew up with Chi Zhuiyun, while Demon Girl and Luo Sha followed closely behind.</p>
<p>At this moment, there were quite a number of people from the Oracle Fey Empire that were in the midst of the millions of people present. At this moment, they felt ashamed to stay any longer, as they quietly retreated from the crowd.</p>
<p>At moment that the people from the Oracle Fey Empire left, the disciples of the World Margin Sect and Eternal Eventide Sea felt bitter. They looked at Yi Yun with apprehension.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue had already awoken. He looked at Yi Yun with a complex look. He had previously deemed his beating down by Yi Yun with a brick as the greatest humiliation in his life, but now, he did not find it too unacceptable. After all, Yi Yun was on a completely different level to him.</p>
<p>As for the arrogant goddess Xi Ye, she sighed lightly in her heart and she did not say a word. Recalling her aloofness, she felt ashamed. It was truly the case of there being heavens beyond heavens and people beyond people. She closed her eyes lightly as her ears echoed with the tsunami-like cheers from the members of the Luo clan in the southern desolate mountain plains.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The cheers echoed at an intensity more than ten times higher than when Yi Yun had previously defeated Tianya Haoyue. It was as though the entire desolate plains was trembling with the cheers.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, nicely done!” Luo Huo'er's cheerful voice transmission entered Yi Yun's ears.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Yi Yun would become a legend from this day onwards.</p>
<p>In the history of the Luo clan, Yi Yun would undoubtedly leave behind a heavy stroke in its history books!</p>
<p>As long as he did not fall, Yi Yun's future accomplishments were unthinkable!</p>
<p>Chapter 950: Shui Ningshuang</p>
<p>Yi Yun had defeated Chi Zhuiyun! This news spread like wildfire, and in a few hours, the news of the matter was proliferated throughout the royal capital by the millions of warriors that had seen the battle!</p>
<p>And that was only the beginning. People knew that after Yi Yun defeated Chi Zhuiyun, there was a slim chance that he could become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple!</p>
<p>Once Yi Yun became Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, it was truly skyrocketing in a single step. In the future, even Emperor Luo would be respectful to him when they met!</p>
<p>In the coming days, the news of Yi Yun defeating Chi Zhuiyun quickly spread throughout the Luo clan through various channels.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's name reverberated throughout the 196 states.</p>
<p>Many young warriors idolized Yi Yun. His battle with Chi Zhuiyun was recorded on disk arrays, watched by the warriors as a rare collection. It even caused a new craze.</p>
<p>And in the royal capital, when Yi Yun returned to his residence, his entire viscount residence was surrounded by spirit beasts and spirit ships. Visitors from various factions came with many ambassadors bringing gifts. They came in endless droves.</p>
<p>Now, even the top ten factions in the Luo clan, such as the Xushui Ran clan and the Donglin family clan, had their ambassadors visit Yi Yun. All of them had to maintain an attitude of humility. They were not vexed, even if they had to line up without being able to meet Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The gifts filled up several guest halls, but shortly after Yi Yun returned to his viscount residence, he had to leave immediately. The waiting ambassadors did not even get to meet Yi Yun in person, eventually leaving in regret.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yun had arrived at Empress Xuan's Fenghua Palace.</p>
<p>“What? The Third Imperial Uncle has summoned me?”</p>
<p>The Luo clan's Third Imperial Uncle was the pillar of the Luo clan. He was constantly in retreat in the vast spirit mountains behind the royal palace. In his constant reclusion, his exact whereabouts were unknown.</p>
<p>Typically, Emperor Luo was the only person in the Luo clan that could meet the Third Imperial Uncle to inform him of various matters.</p>
<p>And Emperor Luo would only inform the Third Imperial Uncle of important matters that involved the entire Luo clan.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Yi Yun defeating Chi Zhuiyun was reported by Emperor Luo. This meant that Emperor Luo treated this as an important matter that involved the entire Luo clan.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, I have only managed to meet Imperial Granduncle once. Crimson Firmament did so once as well. Most of the other princes and princesses have not even got a chance to meet him yet! But this time, Imperial Granduncle wishes to host a national banquet himself. Not only does he want to summon you, he wants to convene many important figures in the Luo clan to hold a celebration for you. That is an honor that even Crimson Firmament will be jealous of.”</p>
<p>Even Luo Huo'er and Crimson Firmament had only met the Third Imperial Uncle once. It was imaginable how seldom the Third Imperial Uncle showed himself.</p>
<p>Now, him personally hosting a national banquet was completely unprecedented.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, let me tell you. If Imperial Granduncle wants to reward you, be relentless, take all that you can!” Luo Huo'er winked at Yi Yun as she spoke.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Today was the day that the Luo clan royal capital ushered in one of the biggest events in the recent ten thousand years!</p>
<p>Just high in the sky, there were numerous flying creatures of massive sizes, as well as spirit cruisers shuttling through the nebula bands.</p>
<p>And their destination was the same — the Luo clan royal palace!</p>
<p>This was the second time that Yi Yun came to the Luo clan's main royal palace. It was located on a high mountain that was connected by a long imperial staircase.</p>
<p>The last time he came here, it was the gathering of the various major factions of the alliance. Ambassadors from various clans had come, with numerous people being present.</p>
<p>Back then, Yi Yun was just one of the many disciples and he was not considered to be remarkable.</p>
<p>But this time, Yi Yun was no doubt the center of attention!</p>
<p>At the moment he entered the main royal palace, all eyes were immediately turned on him!</p>
<p>Yi Yun remained composed. He was dressed in a pale green robe with a sword by his waist, while his hair was tied up with a piece of thread. He had an air that seemed to make him rise up above all others.</p>
<p>In the main palace, there were gigantic golden columns on both sides that had a circumference that was the combined arm spans of several people. On the ground, there were seats that could accommodate thousands of people.</p>
<p>And Yi Yun's spot was impressively in the first row!</p>
<p>Opposite him was a spot where Prince Crimson Firmament sat facing him.</p>
<p>To the warriors of the Luo clan, being able to sit at where Yi Yun sat was the greatest desire in life.</p>
<p>Having rapidly advancing up the social ladder, with him having power and wealth, there were countless beauties who admired him. Everything was at his fingertips!</p>
<p>And how old was Yi Yun?</p>
<p>He was famous at a young age, with countless people who were envious of him.</p>
<p>“So you are Yi Yun.” A sonorous voice suddenly sounded from the regal seat.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked over and on the regal seat sat a white-haired man, but he looked extremely young, like he was a teenager. His aura was unfathomable from where he sat.</p>
<p>The man was also wearing an emperor's robe, but it was slightly different from the emperor's robe that Emperor Luo wore.</p>
<p>As for Emperor Luo, he was sitting on the right hand side.</p>
<p>Was this person the Third Imperial Uncle?</p>
<p>Yi Yun took a step forward and said with a salutation, “This junior is him.”</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle's eyes were filled with endless vicissitudes as he stared at Yi Yun for a moment.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt like he was looking into the mirror as the pair of eyes gazed at him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun remained calm since the Purple Crystal could not be detected by him. Furthermore, the Third Imperial Uncle was only reading his cultivation realm, constitution and meridians. The more sensitive spots, like the heart and soul sea were avoided by him.</p>
<p>Having attained such a realm, the Third Imperial Uncle was also a genius with providence bestowed upon him. He too had his own opportunities, so he guessed that Yi Yun must have obtained certain opportunities, but he naturally would not covet the opportunities of a junior.</p>
<p>If the elders frequently snatched the opportunities of juniors, such a faction was not far from its end. Furthermore, the Third Imperial Uncle knew that he had used up his potential. Most of his lifespan had been depleted, and it was impossible for him to make a breakthrough. The same opportunity in his hand would definitely not be as effective as if it were in the hands of a junior.</p>
<p>“A minor Seamless pure Yang body and Heaven-Devouring Wyrm bloodline. I've also heard that your perception is extremely amazing… ” The Third Imperial Uncle spoke. “Perception is also a form of talent. With superb perception, you can go far down the path of martial arts as well.”</p>
<p>“Little Yun, my Third Imperial Uncle seldom praises people. It looks like he's very pleased with you.” Luo Huo'er transmitted her voice to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“Is that so? However, your Third Imperial Uncle isn't as I imagined.” Yi Yun replied.</p>
<p>“Why? Did you think that he would be some old fogey?” Luo Huo'er giggled. In fact, she was somewhat astonished back when she first met the Third Imperial Uncle.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun looked at the Third Imperial Uncle again, he noticed that he was looking at a shadow in the palace.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun looked over, the shadow suddenly began to distort. Following that, a woman stepped out of the shadow.</p>
<p>The woman looked like a drawing in the beginning, but as she walked out of the shadows, her facial features seemed to suddenly turn clear.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful woman, dressed in a bright red skirt. Her skin was brilliantly fair, and her eyes were like deep and dark pools, exuding a strange air in them.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the aura that I just sensed is the arrival of the esteemed ambassador.” The Third Imperial Uncle stood up and said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the Third Imperial Uncle's words, everyone present was astonished. They also realized that even with the woman standing in front of them, they could not sense her presence.</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle was the only person in the entire palace who sensed the the woman's appearance.</p>
<p>“There's no need to address me in this way. I am Shui Ningshuang.” The red-dressed woman took a step forward and instantly appeared in front of the regal throne. “I'm here on behalf of my master to greet the Third Imperial Uncle.”</p>
<p>Chapter 951: Lacking Dao Domain</p>
<p>On behalf of her master to greet the Third Imperial Uncle?</p>
<p>The palace was filled with important figures from the Luo clan and the alliance. They were stunned when they suddenly heard Shui Ningshuang's words.</p>
<p>Regardless of Shui Ningshuang's bearing or the nomological fluctuations around her, they were all stunning. Such a woman's looks and strength were impeccable. She even had a bearing that placed her a cut above the rest, so how could she be willing to be a slave to others?</p>
<p>How magnificent would one be to have a woman slave like her?</p>
<p>Could it be… ?</p>
<p>People began to guess, and this guess left them stifled.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Third Imperial Uncle cupped his hands and said, “Fairy Ningshuang, you must be joking. I can't afford Felicitous Rain Lord's greetings. I should be the one greeting Felicitous Rain Lord.”</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle's words affirmed what everyone had in their minds. People drew a gasp. The woman's master was indeed Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>“Fairy Ningshuang… I recall who she is. Fifty thousand years ago, Fairy Ningshuang had once traversed the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, making a name for herself. However, it was ephemeral, she soon disappeared because she had returned to Felicitous Rain Lord's side and seldom appeared. Rumors say that Fairy Ningshuang was saved by Felicitous Rain Lord when she was still a young girl. Back then, Felicitous Rain Lord had yet to become a Divine Lord. He was impressed by her intelligence and extraordinary constitution, keeping her by his side. Therefore, Fairy Ningshuang has always been a follower of Felicitous Rain Lord, tending to his daily needs. Fairy Ningshuang is extremely clever, so by serving Felicitous Rain Lord, her strength has already reached an unfathomable stage.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang was Felicitous Rain Lord's maidservant, so she naturally called Felicitous Rain Lord master. It was not that an impressive woman like her was willing to be a slave, it was because she had gone from an ordinary maidservant to her present stage.</p>
<p>So that was the reason why the Third Imperial Uncle had presided over the national banquet. His invitation of all heroes from various nations was because of Shui Ningshuang's arrival!</p>
<p>With Shui Ningshuang's identity, she naturally could become the star of the national banquet. Of course, Yi Yun was also the junior that the Third Imperial Uncle wanted to introduce to Shui Ningshuang.</p>
<p>“I wonder what Fairy Ningshuang is here in the Luo clan for?” The Third Imperial Uncle asked.</p>
<p>This question was critical.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun defeated Chi Zhuiyun, Fairy Ningshuang's appearance could not help but cause others to have certain thoughts.</p>
<p>This was apparent for the Luo clan clansmen. At this moment, they turned particularly excited as they held their breaths and looked at Fairy Ningshuang intently, waiting for her response. Could Fairy Ningshuang's appearance here imply that Felicitous Rain Lord had intentions of taking in Yi Yun as a disciple?</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang said with a smile, “My trip here was not my master's intention. My master has been staying in the Oracle Fey Empire for the past few days while pondering over the laws. Since I had nothing better to do, Chi Zhuiyun's challenge of all the younger generation of the alliance had sparked my interest, leading me here. After seeing the outcome of Chi Zhuiyun's battle, I was quite pleasantly surprised.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang smiled at Yi Yun as she said this.</p>
<p>Yi Yun got up and gave a Shui Ningshuang a bow.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yi Yun had become the focus of the banquet.</p>
<p>Prince Crimson Firmament and Bai Yueqing were both sitting opposite Yi Yun. As they looked at Yi Yun, they felt their hearts turn somewhat sour.</p>
<p>To Crimson Firmament, if Yi Yun could become the disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord, it was a great thing for the Luo clan, but for him, it did not necessarily mean that it was good. This made him feel wry and bitter.</p>
<p>“Fairy Ningshuang, what do you think about Yi Yun?” Third Imperial Uncle asked in an extremely solemn voice.</p>
<p>All these years, the Third Imperial Uncle had been cultivating in the back mountains of the royal palace. Other than the invasion of the Fey Phantasm Sect, very few things could stir him.</p>
<p>“I… do not represent the views of master.” Fairy Ningshuang shook her head.</p>
<p>“Fairy, it's fine if it's just your personal opinion.” Third Imperial Uncle said. Fairy Ningshuang had accompanied Felicitous Rain Lord for so many years, so she was probably one who knew Felicitous Rain Lord's judgment criteria.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is not bad!” Shui Ningshuang gave such an evaluation. Before the Luo clan could rejoice, there was a sudden turn in Shui Ningshuang's words. “However, he has a very big problem… ”</p>
<p>“What problem is it?”</p>
<p>The members of the Luo clan felt their hearts tighten!</p>
<p>“If I'm not wrong, Yi Yun has yet to grasp his own Dao Domain!”</p>
<p>Dao Domain, Great Dao, Heavenly Dao, Origins. This were the four realms of Dao.</p>
<p>A typical warrior would possess a Dao Domain when they were at the Dao Manifestation realm.</p>
<p>However, for geniuses, it was common for them to have their own Dao Domain at the Heaven Ascension realm. For example, Chi Zhuiyun had a Shura Domain that turned the skies crimson. It enveloped millions of people and shocked everyone!</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had approved of Chi Zhuiyun because of his Dao Domain.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, Felicitous Rain Lord had placed great emphasis on the Dao Domain.</p>
<p>This represented a genius's perception and nomological attainments. It determined one's future development to a large extent.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun apparently did not have a Dao Domain.</p>
<p>Third Imperial Uncle frowned slightly and he fell silent.</p>
<p>Quite a number of people in the crowd present were surprised. “Yi Yun does not have a Dao Domain? That can't be!?”</p>
<p>“Gaining insights into a Dao Domain should not be difficult for a top genius. Princess Xue'er had comprehended a Dao Domain more than ten years ago.”</p>
<p>Back then, at the Luo Divine Hall trials, Princess White Fox's epiphany allowed her to possess her own Dao Domain. Back then, Yi Yun had already lagged behind her, but he should not have lagged behind her for more than ten years!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun's strength was obvious. He could defeat Chi Zhuiyun, so how could he not have his own Dao Domain?</p>
<p>“In response to Fairy's words, this junior indeed has not comprehended a Dao Domain.”</p>
<p>With Yi Yun saying this, all the guests were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He really didn't have one!</p>
<p>Previously, in the challenge that Chi Zhuiyun made, the people who fought all had Dao Domains. Some of the Dao Domains might not have offensive power, but they were still Dao Domains.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not use a Dao Domain from the beginning to the end, making people believe that Yi Yun's Dao Domain was unsuitable for battle. But now, it was because he did not even have one!</p>
<p>Why was this so? Could Yi Yun have encountered a bottleneck in his nomological insights that he could not break through?</p>
<p>It was obviously better the early one formed their Dao Domain. There was room for future development. By delaying it for so long, Yi Yun's progress was already impaired. If he really had a bottleneck, it would be terrible. Bottlenecks were things that no one could tell when they could be broken through!</p>
<p>This made everyone look at Yi Yun with worried looks.</p>
<p>Especially the members of the Luo clan. They were worried that Yi Yun's weakness in Dao would make him slowly fail to catch up to top geniuses.</p>
<p>After all, the Dao Manifestation realm was extremely important. From Heaven Ascension into Dao Manifestation, Dao fruits had to be condensed. The number and quality of the Dao fruits directly affected his future success!</p>
<p>In the martial world, geniuses who reigned supreme in the Heaven Ascension realm would be slowly be left behind because of their poor Dao fruit qualities. It was not uncommon for them to end up with their potentials being expended.</p>
<p>Even if Yi Yun were to condense his Dao Domain tomorrow, he was already at a greater disadvantage compared to Chi Zhuiyun and others!</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang nodded. “You are at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, but you have yet to condense your Dao Domain. It is indeed slow. You are about to step into the Dao Manifestation realm, so nomological insight is extremely important. Without a Dao Domain, the Dao fruits that you condense would definitely be lacking in quality. If this goes on, you might begin to lag behind in the Dao Manifestation realm. It would be very difficult to make up for it!”</p>
<p>Chapter 952: Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang's words tightened the hearts of all the Luo clan clansmen present. Could it be that… Yi Yun would not be able to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple?</p>
<p>If that was the case, Yi Yun's growth would likely be affected. To the Luo clan, it would be a great loss.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not speak as he waited for Shui Ningshuang to continue.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang sat down and she looked serene. She asked calmly, “Yi Yun, I mentioned quite a bit a while ago, but I did not ask if you intend to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. To a warrior with an extremely long lifespan, there was a wide range of realms to cross. A warrior could take many mighty figures as masters, and it was not considered to be a betrayal of the previous master.</p>
<p>Indeed, Yi Yun had obtained the Azure Yang Lord's heritage in the past, but that was only a tiny portion of what the Azure Yang Lord had learned in his entire life. The most important cultivation technique inheritance was not left behind by Azure Yang Lord.</p>
<p>What Yi Yun learned was the creation by the Azure Yang Lord's confidant, the ancient Great Empress's 'Great Empress Heart Sutra'. To the present Yi Yun, the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' was already inadequate. He needed a stronger cultivation technique so it could match the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>Obtaining the inheritance and obtaining the face-to-face advice from a Divine Lord was completely different. Regardless of how high one's perception was, just cultivating from a inheritance manual still needed one's repeated experimentation and confirmation. Compared to having a master to guide them, they would end up taking more detours and waste more time. There was no need to mention the resources and status that one would gain after becoming a disciple of a Divine Lord. It would be the best protection for Yi Yun, as Yi Yun would not need to feel apprehensive when he faced the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>“My master values one's grade in the Dao greatly. To become my master's disciple, it is necessary to condense a Dao Domain at the Heaven Ascension realm. If you do not have a Dao Domain, it is impossible.”</p>
<p>“Condense a Dao Domain… ” Yi Yun faltered slightly. “A pass is given as long as a Dao Domain is condensed?”</p>
<p>“If it's just an ordinary Dao Domain, it would be meaningless! The reason why Chi Zhuiyun was able to be approved by master was because his Dao Domain was extraordinary. Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain had managed to defeat an in-name disciple of my master, thus he was recognized by him.”</p>
<p>“In-name disciple?” Yi Yun asked in surprise. Felicitous Rain Lord also had in-name disciples?</p>
<p>“That's right. Master has several in-name disciples. Although my master has never established a faction, he has several followers. Many things could not be done by him alone, so there is a need to delegate the job to others.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang's explanation enlightened Yi Yun. The in-name disciples were probably similar to servants. Although they were called servants, they were most likely very talented. It was easier said than done to become a Divine Lord's servant.</p>
<p>“What my master wants to take in is a personal disciple. It is something that an in-name disciple cannot compare to in every aspect. Therefore, the requirements are naturally high. Although you have defeated Chi Zhuiyun, you must have something that can move my master to gain his approval. Master values perception, bloodline and nomological Dao Domain.”</p>
<p>“Either your perception is amazing, allowing you to infer from incomplete Supremacy-grade cultivation techniques, or your Dao Domain reaches the same standard as Chi Zhuiyun's, or finally, you possess a pure Ancient Fey bloodline that reaches the standard like that lady over there! If you can meet any two of the three criteria, it would not be a problem to become Master's disciple. If you manage only one, it would be likely that you would gain my master's approval, but it is not a sure thing.”</p>
<p>As Shui Ningshuang spoke, she looked at Luo Huo'er. The lady that she referred to was Luo Huo'er. She could sense an extremely rare purity in her bloodline, but Luo Huo'er was a rare genius in the Luo clan. In comparison, Yi Yun's bloodline was far from hers!</p>
<p>As for perception, attempting to infer from an incomplete Supremacy-grade cultivation technique, even if it was a tiny amount, would be extremely demanding!</p>
<p>Finally, the Dao Domain was very difficult as well! Chi Zhuiyun's attainment in his Dao Domain was heaven-defying to begin with. Now, Yi Yun did not even have a Dao Domain, so how could he compete with Chi Zhuiyun?</p>
<p>And worst of all, he needed to accomplish two of the three criteria to ensure a pass. Accomplishing only one could still result in failure!</p>
<p>Such criteria made many of the Luo clan clansmen feel a coldness in their hearts. Yi Yun's bloodline was lacking, and he did not have a Dao Domain. As for perception, it didn't sound like something assuring. The chances of becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple were extremely minute.</p>
<p>Finally… was all that effort for naught?</p>
<p>The people found it difficult to accept such an outcome. Felicitous Rain Lord's requirements were too high!</p>
<p>Even a Divine Lord was so harsh on his selection of disciples!</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang apparently read the minds of the people as she slowly said, “Master naturally has his reasons for coming up with such a criteria. My master intends to hand his mantle over to the personal disciple he takes in this time. My master possesses the remnant page of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'. I believe that it is no longer a secret… ”</p>
<p>When Shui Ningshuang said this, everyone looked at each other and they drew a cold gasp of air.</p>
<p>The remnant page of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'!</p>
<p>When the primordial Universe was first born from out of the Chaos, the twelve Empyrean Heavens slowly evolved. There were mighty primordial figures, who gained insight on the natural laws, slowly establishing martial arts heritages.</p>
<p>The ultimate martial art heritages were regarded by warriors in the twelve Empyrean Heavens as Divine Canons, which were supreme techniques that approached the Heavenly Dao.</p>
<p>Maybe, it was somewhat destined that every Empyrean Heaven produced a Divine Canon that approached the Heavenly Dao at its birth. These twelve Divine Canons were seemingly the natural condensation of the world's Great Dao, just like the Divine Lord Royal Seals, which were naturally formed by every Empyrean Heaven. They had the power of creation!</p>
<p>As for the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', it was the Divine Canon that belonged to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>The twelve Divine Canons were cultivation techniques, something that Yi Yun was lacking the most at present. Obviously, Yi Yun wanted to learn it!</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that the Azure Yang Lord had previously seen remnant pages of the 'Yang God Manual' and the 'Nine Nether Sacred Manual'. But unfortunately, none of the remnant pages had landed in Yi Yun's hands, and he had never seen them before. If not, with the 'Yang God Manual' in his hand, his cultivation speed would have skyrocketed, so how would he always be lacking in energy, causing him to be apprehensive about using the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence?</p>
<p>“It's the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'. To think that Felicitous Rain Lord plans on teaching the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', it's unknown how many geniuses will go mad for it… ”</p>
<p>Even the Third Imperial Uncle sighed. Who didn't want to learn the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'? A cultivation technique of that level was too distant for a faction like the Luo clan. If the Luo clan ever possessed the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', it would probably be annihilated as a result of it!</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle looked at Yi Yun and sighed. He felt sorry for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>It was normal for Felicitous Rain Lord to have such high criteria if he planned on taking in a disciple that would be imparted with the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'!</p>
<p>However, such a big opportunity was terrible for Yi Yun. In Yi Yun's present situation, it was very unlikely that he would become a disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang looked at Yi Yun, seemingly feeling sorry for him. If a Divine Lord were to take in a disciple under normal circumstances, Yi Yun would be barely qualified, but now, he was still somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>“My master will stay in the Oracle Fey Empire for about a year. My master's taking in of a disciple will be decided during this period of time. If you think it's possible, come to the Oracle Fey Empire.”</p>
<p>Chapter 953: Yi Yun's Dao Domain</p>
<p>After Shui Ningshuang said this, a shadow began to envelop her, starting from her feet. Following that, her figure blended into the shadow as the shadow rapidly converged, disappearing completely in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The ground was left empty, like nothing had been there previously.</p>
<p>Seeing Shui Ningshuang disappear, the palace hall fell into silence. Many people looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Some frowned, while others felt a sense of regret. There were also people from other factions who were gloating at the turn of events.</p>
<p>“Fairy Ningshuang is simply being difficult.” Someone from the Luo clan said unhappily.</p>
<p>“Do you think Fairy Ningshuang is someone that you can disparage?” A dignified voice resounded. The person who spoke was the Third Imperial Uncle. “This time, Felicitous Rain Lord is planning on taking in a personal disciple and it involves the inheritance of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', so it's natural for his standards to be very high! Don't forget that a Divine Lord's lifespan is extremely long. Felicitous Rain Lord hasn't become a Divine Lord for very long. He still has millions, if not tens of millions of years to choose a disciple. There's no hurry at all! Even if he can't find one, it wouldn't matter to him. He can just wait till he meets someone when fate permits it. Quality comes before quantity in this case, so Felicitous Rain Lord will definitely not lower his standards.”</p>
<p>Although the Third Imperial Uncle felt sorry for Yi Yun, he knew that Fairy Ningshuang was definitely not making it difficult for Yi Yun. Instead, by doing so, it revealed how much importance Felicitous Rain Lord placed on his personal disciple. He was truly looking for someone to pass on the mantle to.</p>
<p>With the Third Imperial Uncle saying this, everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>Indeed, a Divine Lord's standards were different from theirs!</p>
<p>A Divine Lord could live for very long, allowing them to traverse countless worlds and see countless geniuses. To them, Yi Yun was already amazing enough, but if he was placed in the vast Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven and over millions of years?</p>
<p>Even someone as amazing as Yi Yun might perhaps be nothing!</p>
<p>Without a Dao Domain, impressive perception or an outstanding bloodline, it was indeed difficult to meet the Felicitous Rain Lord's requirements.</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle said again, “Our Luo clan has existed for a hundred million years. We do not need to sell ourselves short. Yi Yun, do you understand?”</p>
<p>As the Third Imperial Uncle said this, he looked at Yi Yun, apparently afraid that Yi Yun would suffer a setback.</p>
<p>Yi Yun said with a smile, “This junior understands.”</p>
<p>After hearing the information provided by Shui Ningshuang, as the concerned party, Yi Yun did not have any wild mood swings. He was extremely calm, and this pleased the Third Imperial Uncle greatly.</p>
<p>By not being easily pleased or depressed, while still having a strong will and a steadfast heart for martial arts, a warrior like him could go even further.</p>
<p>“Little Yun, why are you so calm? Aren't you a little bit disappointed?” Luo Huo'er asked Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head and said, “There's nothing much to be disappointed about. My martial path ultimately depends on myself.”</p>
<p>“What you said isn't wrong, but… why haven't you gained insights into your own Dao Domain all this time? I feel that shouldn't be the case with your nomological insights.”</p>
<p>With Luo Huo'er asking such a question, many people looked at Yi Yun. That's right, it's too strange that Yi Yun had yet to condense a Dao Domain.</p>
<p>From the Yuan Opening realm, warriors began to grasp laws and by the Dao Manifestation realm, the laws would condense into Dao fruits, it was a qualitative leap.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's laws were outstanding to begin with, so how could he lag behind his peers?</p>
<p>“There are some problems that I haven't managed to figure out… ” Yi Yun's response tightened the hearts of the members of the Luo clan. There was indeed a bottleneck?</p>
<p>“This junior wishes to request to enter the Primordial Space once again. Perhaps, my Dao Domain will be completed.” Yi Yun said seriously.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had yet to condense a Dao Domain. The main reason was because Yi Yun's initial goal was set extremely high. He wanted to condense a Destruction Dao Domain!</p>
<p>The Dao of Destruction was divided into the Minor Dao of Destruction and the Major Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know which Dao of Destruction that the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was from, but his intuition told him that it was definitely not as simple as the Minor Dao of Destruction!</p>
<p>If it was the Major Dao of Destruction, it was simply unthinkable.</p>
<p>Condensing such a Dao Domain was understandably difficult.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's attempt was a crazy challenge of course.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun had condensed a Pure Yang Dao Domain during his eighteen years in the Primordial Space, he would have condensed a Pure Yang Dao Domain long time ago.</p>
<p>Pure Yang was also a Great Dao law. A Pure Yang Dao Domain would be more powerful than Princess White Fox's Lightning Dao Domain, but Yi Yun did not do so. He placed all his efforts in the Destruction Dao Domain!</p>
<p>Typical warriors only focused on one law, naturally being able to condense a single Dao Domain.</p>
<p>As for top geniuses, they were able to condense several Dao Domains, but they were divided into major and minor Dao Domains.</p>
<p>The first Dao Domain that would be condensed would be augmented by the Heavenly Dao, resulting in it being the most powerful!</p>
<p>However, due to the difficulty of it, even the first Dao Domain condensed by a top genius would typically not be a Great Dao Dao Domain. It would be one of the easier five-elemental Dao, or the creational Dao.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun had chosen the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence's Destruction Dao. The difficulty of doing so was imaginable!</p>
<p>However, the Purple Crystal was something that Yi Yun could rely on. Hence, he wanted to attempt such a crazy idea.</p>
<p>Originally, Yi Yun believed that he would be able to condense his Destruction Dao Domain in another three or five years.</p>
<p>However, after the battle with Chi Zhuiyun, Yi Yun had several new insights. He believed that if he returned to the Primordial Space again, he would have a chance of success!</p>
<p>“To the Primordial Space?” Emperor Luo's eyebrows pricked up. The Primordial Space was in the Luo Divine Hall, and the Luo Divine Hall trials had already ended. Yet, Yi Yun wanted to return to the Primordial Space again.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, you might not know, but to take you to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven now, it requires ten times the amount of World Stones.” An elderly courtier of the Luo clan said.</p>
<p>It was not a small figure.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yi Yun was stunned.</p>
<p>“The Luo Divine Hall trials take place once every sixty years and they last for eighteen years each time for a reason. Because after eighteen years, the barriers to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven would become stronger. Tearing through them would require a greater price.” The Luo clan courtier explained patiently.</p>
<p>He already felt that Yi Yun no longer had the chance to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple. Even if he returned to the Primordial Space, so what? The World Stones could not be spent for nothing. They were all resources.</p>
<p>Before Yi Yun said another word, the Third Imperial Uncle said, “Take him there! It's just entering the Primordial Space once. That bit of World Stones is something that our Luo clan can afford. Even if he can't become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, it wouldn't matter. As long as it allows him to become stronger, the expenditure of those World Stones would be worth it.”</p>
<p>The Third Imperial Uncle's order was something that no one would refute. Many people from the younger generation of the Luo clan, including Prince Crimson Firmament, were jealous when they heard this. Yi Yun was receiving top treatment. Even Crimson Firmament himself did not receive such treatment in the past!</p>
<p>“Thank you, Senior.” Yi Yun said solemnly as he took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He took note of the favor that was bestowed to him.</p>
<p>The insights from the battle with Chi Zhuiyun needed to be digested back in the Primordial Space. As for the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, he needed to use the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone to verify it again. Yi Yun believed that he would definitely have new insights this time.</p>
<p>Chapter 954: Before one's heart reduced to mediocrity, Great Dao lies within one's heart!</p>
<p>In the nebulous Primordial Empyrean Heaven, the Luo clan's special spirit cruiser underwent a series of spatial traversals. With space suddenly fluctuating, it appeared above the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>When the doors opened, Yi Yun walked out of the spirit cruiser. The last time he had done this, he had imitated the Shadow Twins's footwork, allowing him to find his footing in the space with chaotic laws. But this time, he simply stepped forward, and every step he made would produce a ripple.</p>
<p>A bearded old man with a stoic face had already been waiting for him.</p>
<p>“Elder Duanmu.” Yi Yun said with a bow.</p>
<p>“I have already been informed.” Elder Duanmu sized Yi Yun up for a moment before saying, “You have improved once again since the trials. Not bad.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu knew that Yi Yun's talent was outstanding, but he never expected that Yi Yun would be able to attain such achievements. Yi Yun was really a person who constantly created pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>It was indeed difficult to become Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple, and even the present Yi Yun had minute hopes of being one.</p>
<p>“The Primordial Space has already been prepared for you. You have a year's time. Let's go.” Elder Duanmu led the way by flying towards the Luo Divine Hall.</p>
<p>When no one came to participate in the trials, the Luo Divine Hall would be like an ancient monument lying dormant in a forgotten world, it exuded an ancient and bleak aura.</p>
<p>The Elders of the Luo Divine Hall were in reclusion for tens of thousands of years. In order to pursue even great heights in martial arts, they had to endure a lot.</p>
<p>Yi Yun reflected over it as he arrived at the Primordial Space with Elder Duanmu.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and start your reclusion.”</p>
<p>“Does he want to condense his Dao Domain in a year's time?” It was unknown when Elder Shi appeared beside Elder Duanmu, as he asked while looking at the gigantic doors that sealed Yi Yun within the Primordial Space.</p>
<p>“That's right. Senior Brother, what do you think of it?”</p>
<p>“That child is very ambitious. If he wants to condense an ordinary Dao Domain, it obviously wouldn't be difficult, but how can the Dao Domain that he wants to condense be anything ordinary? A year's time is too short. Furthermore, he now has a year's time breathing down on his neck, so the tension makes it even harder.”</p>
<p>“I have seen too many geniuses throughout my life. They set high ambitions for themselves, but they end up failing to achieve them. They only want to gain insights into the Great Dao, and show disdain to the lesser Dao, but… during their meditations, they end up being led astray! To a warrior that gains insight into the worldly Dao, it is very common to deviate in the meditation process. Some people might even realize that their insights were wrong after many years, and that price paid for that would be terrible!”</p>
<p>Gaining insights into the laws and going astray wasn't that terrifying. The most terrifying thing was not knowing that one had gone astray! That would be dangerous!</p>
<p>For a young genius like Yi Yun, there was no time for delays!</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, do you mean that Yi Yun might go astray?”</p>
<p>“There is a possibility… I'm just afraid of it happening.” Elder Shi shook his head. “With his talent, it is very out of the ordinary for him to not have gained insights into his Dao Domain after so much time. Even a pure Yang Dao Domain should have been condensed by now.”</p>
<p>Geniuses were prideful people. A top genius like Yi Yun would only have higher ambitions, but at times, that was not necessarily the best thing. What Dao Domain did he want to condense? A Pure Yang Dao Domain? A Dao Domain of the Sword?</p>
<p>Mastering one Dao Domain would also result in enormous combat strength. For example, Chi Zhuiyun's Shura Dao Domain was the condensation of his killing intent and will.</p>
<p>“It's pointless for us to fret here. Let's wait and see what happens in a year's time.” Elder Duanmu said.</p>
<p>A year's time was like a snap of the fingers to them.</p>
<p>In the Primordial Space, Yi Yun arrived in front of the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone once again.</p>
<p>This time, there was an even more obvious resonance between him and the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone. It had a feeling like their lifeblood was connected.</p>
<p>Yi Yun faced the Purple Crystal Fey God Stone and he reached out his hand to touch it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Like he had instantly opened a door, Yi Yun's eyes glazed over as he arrived in a mental world.</p>
<p>This time, the man or the red lotus woman were not seen in the mental world.</p>
<p>There were only countless nomological fragments constantly shuttling through it.</p>
<p>In the space, there were only nomological fragments, and the rest was all Chaos.</p>
<p>Yi Yun reached his hand out and gestured with it, causing a small nomological fragment to fly towards him. Following that, more nomological fragments flew towards Yi Yun like a flurry of snow.</p>
<p>The first Dao pattern was completed, and immediately, the space had its first law.</p>
<p>As he continued to construct them, the nomological fragments were constantly being condensed into Dao patterns.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was immersed in his actions, while his mental energy was constantly being drained.</p>
<p>Soon, the entire 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was condensed by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The long-haired man in the Purple Crystal had formed a world with his spear, before shattering the world. Following that, he had merged the entire world's laws into the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>This was the Dao of Destruction, and it was even more powerful than Minor Destruction.</p>
<p>In the trial before, Yi Yun had attempted to copy the long-haired man's methods and he had used the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence to help condense his own Dao Domain, but he had failed.</p>
<p>In the process of condensing his Dao Domain, Yi Yun felt something unharmonious. This snag was something that he never managed to resolve.</p>
<p>And in the battle with Chi Zhuiyun, Yi Yun had gained new insights as to where the feeling came from.</p>
<p>Looking at the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, Yi Yun quietly stared at it. Suddenly, his eyes flashed with a beam of light.</p>
<p>He pulled out his broken sword and slashed at the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence!</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence had shattered, and it was reduced to countless nomological fragments!</p>
<p>This was not the Dao that he was pursuing!</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was the long-haired man's life-long martial technique, and there was no doubt with its profoundness!</p>
<p>However, that was the long-haired man's Dao. Although Yi Yun had learned the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, he had learned it through mimicking it. It was not his own understanding.</p>
<p>By copying the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence exactly, he had learned a martial technique. But regardless of how profound it was, it was only that and nothing more.</p>
<p>Once he was restricted by this, how could he form his own Dao?</p>
<p>Yi Yun brandished the broken sword and he shattered the flying Dao patterns. He tore them apart and reconstituted them from destruction!</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence had been completely shattered into tiny nomological fragments!</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>In Yi Yun's mind, it was like there was a membrane that obstructed him, but it was shattered by the pure Yang broken sword.</p>
<p>There was still a year's time for him to go over the eighteen years of insights!</p>
<p>A light flashed in Yi Yun's eyes as he faced the countless random nomological fragments that appeared once again. Yi Yun thrust his sword out.</p>
<p>The sword had destroyed, and what he wanted to condense was Destruction.</p>
<p>This was Yi Yun's Sword of the Will, which represented Yi Yun's martial heart and his obsession!</p>
<p>He wanted to pursue the pinnacle of martial arts and go even further!</p>
<p>Before one's heart reduced to mediocrity, Great Dao lies within one's heart!</p>
<p>Coming from the Cloud Wilderness and traversing through space, he had arrived in the wider 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>From an ordinary mortal to a Heaven Ascension realm warrior, I can go even further.</p>
<p>Lin Xintong, I will find you.</p>
<p>Azure Yang Lord, I will avenge you.</p>
<p>Sword beam after sword beam, they appeared like snowflakes, lighting up the entire space!</p>
<p>Nomological fragments began to condense amidst the sword beams, condensing in a completely different way from the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not even think about how he was going to condense them. He slashed out freely as his heart willed, a heart of the sword.</p>
<p>In the sword beams, Yi Yun emptied his body and soul, as he felt free.</p>
<p>He felt like he was in a vast world, enjoying the process while engaging in swordplay!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The swishing of the sword produced sounds that resembled war gongs or thunder.</p>
<p>He had brandished his sword countless times, not knowing how much time had passed.</p>
<p>He was repeatedly drained of all his energy, but every time that happened, the Purple Crystal would palpitate along with his heart, absorbing the energy in the world, nourishing Yi Yun's limbs and body along with his blood vessels.</p>
<p>The sounds intensified as they increased in both amplitude and frequency!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body was drenched with sweat as he was on the verge of his limit.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>All of the sounds suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's sword came to a stop as he looked straight. At the tip of his sword, there was an esoteric circular pattern that was gradually revolving.</p>
<p>Sou!</p>
<p>With the sword tip stabbing at it, the circular pattern exploded. Beneath Yi Yun's feet, countless Dao patterns appeared as golden light circulated around him!</p>
<p>Within the golden flames, Yi Yun felt like he was undergoing rebirth from the flames. A long screech came from behind him as the Golden Crow totem appeared, spreading its enormous golden wings apart!</p>
<p>In the flames, Yi Yun's eyes seemed to have an additional hint of gold in them.</p>
<p>The entire mental world apparently could not withstand his aura as it began to tremble.</p>
<p>With a cracking sound, space was shattered as Yi Yun was sucked into the turbulence of time and space as he flowed along with it…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Time passed as cultivation knew nothing of time. In the Primordial Space, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi had once again appeared in front of the hall's door.</p>
<p>A year's time was extremely short in the quiet and dead world. It was like a snap of the fingers.</p>
<p>Chapter 955: The Competition for Disciplehood</p>
<p>In the vast cosmos, a spirit cruiser was mid flight.</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser had reached a nebulous zone before it was devoured by the sudden appearance of a black entrance.</p>
<p>The ancient self-standing space inside the black entrance was where the core of the Oracle Fey Empire in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven was. Legends said that at the formation of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, an Ancient Fey had died, leaving behind the world that was in its body. After a long period of time, the world had transformed into a space.</p>
<p>In the ancient space, there was a large floating island, with several small islands surrounding it. These islands were where people of high status lived in the Oracle Fey Empire. There were restrictive rings around the area, preventing people from approaching them.</p>
<p>And on the large floating island, there was the vast and bustling Fey empire. In the middle of the Fey empire stood more than ten large towers, with surging martial intent exuding from them.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun lived in one of the towers. Ever since he had lost to Yi Yun in the Luo clan, he had entered reclusion inside the tower.</p>
<p>People would come to visit him, either to comfort him or to gloat, but Chi Zhuiyun did not meet them.</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng came to the tower's entrance and he transmitted his voice to the tightly-closed door, “Do you still plan on attaining a higher level of martial arts, or do you plan on always losing to Yi Yun?”</p>
<p>Just as Yu Tianfeng said this, the door opened.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun stood at the door and while looking at Yu Tianfeng, he said, “Yi Yun is no longer my goal. My goal is my own martial path.”</p>
<p>He had thought through it. There were heavens beyond heavens, and people beyond people. Even if he did not lose to Yi Yun, he would have lost to someone else.</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng was surprised before he shook his head. “I came to tell you that all hope isn't lost for you to become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple.”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's expression changed.</p>
<p>He no longer treated Yi Yun as his opponent, but he obviously still wanted to become a Divine Lord's disciple. That was his greatest regret.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain Lord is about to leave the Oracle Fey Empire. He has failed to recruit a personal disciple, but he has agreed to the Oracle Imperial Patriarch to expand his recruitment by taking in a few in-name disciples,” said Yu Tianfeng.</p>
<p>In-name disciples?</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's eyebrows pricked up. A Divine Lord might only have a few personal disciples, but in-name disciples could number in the hundreds or thousands. Divine Lords that lived especially long might even have in-name disciples who die of age, resulting in them having tens of thousands of in-name disciples in total.</p>
<p>A person like Felicitous Rain Lord had only become a Divine Lord for tens of thousands of years, but the number of in-name disciples that he had was already in the dozens.</p>
<p>“Don't underestimate in-name disciples. A Divine Lord's in-name disciple is comparable to the top geniuses of a large faction. Furthermore, by working for a Divine Lord, their status would not be low. Most importantly, there is a chance of becoming a personal disciple by becoming an in-name disciple!” Yu Tianfeng said as he could tell what was on Chi Zhuiyun's mind.</p>
<p>A Divine Lord's personal disciple could sometimes be chosen from his in-name disciples.</p>
<p>“In the disciple recruitment this time, in-name disciples of Felicitous Rain Lord will be coming, so they can compete for a spot as a personal disciple,” said Yu Tianfeng.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's choosing of personal disciples was done through a selection throughout the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Therefore, his in-name disciples were naturally eligible to compete for it.</p>
<p>“A chance to become a personal disciple!”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“It's not possible for the Imperial Patriarch to block the spread of the news, and now, there should be geniuses from various large factions coming here. However, with your strength, in addition to you having gained Felicitous Rain Lord's approval, it should not be a problem for you to become an in-name disciple.”</p>
<p>Yu Tianfeng still had a grudge with Yi Yun. Chi Zhuiyun had gained Felicitous Rain Lord's approval, and if not for Yi Yun's putting his foot out, causing Chi Zhuiyun to miss the chance of becoming a personal disciple, Chi Zhuiyun would not have to compete to become an in-name disciple.</p>
<p>Now, with the one year finishing, the surprisingly difficult requirement was not something that Yi Yun could accomplish, even if he had three heads and six arms. It was not so simple to become a personal disciple of a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The news of Felicitous Rain Lord's recruiting in-name disciples quickly proliferated throughout the alliance!</p>
<p>In the coming days, there were spirit cruisers that constantly arrived at the ancient self-standing space.</p>
<p>The capital of the Oracle Fey Empire was immediately where many geniuses gathered.</p>
<p>There were geniuses from large factions who were gathered in the restaurants and tea shops every day. Yi Yun's name would be mentioned from time to time.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, Yi Yun from the Luo clan might come as well.” A warrior said.</p>
<p>“To compete for a spot as an in-name disciple? That's very possible!” Another warrior said. They had heard that Fairy Ningshuang had listed the requirements on Felicitous Rain Lord's behalf. The requirements were prohibitively difficult. Even a genius like Yi Yun could not meet the requirements.</p>
<p>“He has no chance of becoming a personal disciple, but the chance of becoming an in-name disciple obviously cannot be missed. If he comes, wouldn't our chances of becoming in-name disciples become slimmer?” Another warrior shook his head with a wry smile.</p>
<p>After coming, they realized that the spots as in-name disciples of a Divine Lord were also extremely sought after. Top geniuses had come, and even Chi Zhuiyun was participating in it.</p>
<p>However, they did not leave either. Since they had already come, they might as well take the opportunity to watch the recruitment. It was possible for them to gain insights from the performance of top geniuses.</p>
<p>“The requirements that Fairy Ningshuang mentioned to become a personal disciple are impossible to complete.”</p>
<p>“That's right. Even Yi Yun could, it's really too demanding.”</p>
<p>While these warriors were conversing, they suddenly heard a cold snort. “A few frogs in a well. How can Martial Aunt Ningshuang be maligned by people like you?”</p>
<p>This voice made the geniuses who were drinking wine frown. They were geniuses from various countries as well. So how could they be ridiculed? They immediately took an angry glance.</p>
<p>The snort came from one of two black-robed warriors who wore jade bands on their heads. One of them had long hair, with two white horns on his head. He was sneering as he looked at the warriors.</p>
<p>The warriors looked at them with frowns on their faces. It was unknown what faction those two people came from. The clothing that they wore was something the warriors failed to recognize. They could only see the profound patterns on the jade bands.</p>
<p>“Only shallow people will think that others can't accomplish what they can't do.” The warrior with the horns on his head said with a tone of arrogance.</p>
<p>“Such impressive blowing of one's own trumpet, aren't you afraid that the wind will get too strong and cut your tongue? Try accomplishing it for me to see!” Anger flashed on warrior's face as he retorted.</p>
<p>“My Senior Brothers, Song Wuchen and Tian Xun, would be able to accomplish it.” The warrior said lightly.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen? Tian Xun?</p>
<p>The warriors present looked at each other. They had never heard any of those names before.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother Zhang, why do you bother to talk to them?” said the warrior beside the horned warrior. “At the recruitment meeting, they will naturally know that Senior Brother Song Wuchen would definitely be able to be promoted to a personal disciple! These people actually believe that Martial Aunt's requirements were given to Yi Yun, but Yi Yun is just the number one genius of a tiny country, so how can he be worthy to be given the requirement by her? Martial Aunt Ningshuang's requirements were originally given to Senior Brothers Song Wuchen and Tian Xun.”</p>
<p>The two warriors continued to speak, completely ignoring the dirty looks from the other people in the restaurant.</p>
<p>“Let's go. It's just a bunch of people dreaming to ascend to the heavens in a single step. In my point of view, Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun can only barely become in-name disciple. They can forget about becoming a personal disciple!”</p>
<p>The youth who spoke left behind a relic and left.</p>
<p>“Promoted to a personal disciple? They called Fairy Ningshuang Martial Aunt? Could… they be Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples!?” A warrior suddenly said in shock.</p>
<p>After Felicitous Rain Lord came to the Oracle Fey Empire, he lived on one of the independent floating islands. There were heavy restrictions placed around it. But now, the recruitment meet was chosen to be held at the Oracle Fey Empire's capital to prevent the gathered geniuses from disturbing Felicitous Rain Lord. The disciples that lived on the independent islands with Felicitous Rain Lord naturally came to the royal capital as well.</p>
<p>With that said, the two people were most likely Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples. The Song Wuchen they mentioned was likely one of Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples as well.</p>
<p>These warriors quickly looked in the direction that the two had left in, but the two had taken two steps into the crowd before vanishing, with no traces of them being left behind.</p>
<p>Chapter 956: Gui Huazi</p>
<p>Sou!</p>
<p>Streams of light quickly vanished outside the cruiser's window, revealing a nebulous mist.</p>
<p>“This is the final spatial transference. The Oracle Fey Empire is in that nebulous region.” Elder Duanmu said as he looked out of the window.</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. He knew that the Oracle Fey Empire was located in an ancient self-standing space. And that space was in this region.</p>
<p>They had rushed from the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, spending a great deal of time travelling.</p>
<p>Before they left the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, they were informed about the event being held at the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>Luo Huo'er did not wish to compete for a spot as an in-name disciple of a Divine Lord, but there were a few warriors from the Luo clan that headed to the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>“We managed to get here in time… ” Elder Shi said. He was a reticent person and he did not speak much on the journey from the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.</p>
<p>Now, as he looked at the nebulous region outside, he reflected and said, “The last time I came to the Oracle Fey Empire was a few hundred thousand years ago. I wonder if there will be a chance for me to step foot on this land the next time… ”</p>
<p>A chance?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was somewhat confused. Elder Duanmu said, “After he returns to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven this time, Elder Shi will be in reclusion to break through to become a Supremacy. Accompanying you out here is a way to tie things up. He is trying to adjust his mind.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun understood everything from hearing this. Elder Shi was entering reclusion till his death.</p>
<p>Elder Shi had been in reclusion in the Primordial Empyrean Heaven for hundreds of thousands of years in preparation for his breakthrough. Unfortunately, Elder Shi had failed to succeed.</p>
<p>“Senior Shi… is planning on entering reclusion to his death?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was somewhat puzzled. He was about to break through to the Dao Manifestation realm soon, and after the Dao Manifestation realm, it was the Dao Palace realm. Above the Dao Palace realm was the realm of Supremacies.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were both in the Dao Palace realm.</p>
<p>It sounded like they were only two realms away from Yi Yun, but the Dao Palace realm itself was highly disparate. Warriors at the same Dao Palace realm could not be compared with each other at all.</p>
<p>Warriors at the Dao Palace realm were not demarcated with a beginning, middle or late stage. Instead, they would establish a Dao palace in their bodies, with floors as their goals. The highest floor that a Dao palace could reach was nine floors.</p>
<p>If one had a nine-floor Dao palace, it was almost certain that they would become a Supremacy.</p>
<p>Warriors with eight-floor Dao palaces had lifespans that reached eight million years. According to such a lifespan, Elder Shi was not considered to be too old. Yi Yun felt that Elder Shi did not need to be in such a hurry to enter reclusion to his death.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Duanmu said, “Everyone's limit is different. Some people might only be able to construct a single-floor Dao palace, but there are others who can construct a nine-floor Dao palace. I have yet to reach my peak, but Elder Shi has already reached it. He has stopped at an eight-floor Dao palace and he has not improved for hundreds of thousands of years. If it goes on, his strength will not only fail to improve, it would slowly go into a downtrend as a result of his age. And to break through to the realm of Supremacies, everything has to reach the peak and proceed with the available momentum. It is extremely difficult to break through to the realm of Supremacies with an eight-floor Dao palace. It is a struggle with one's life. Upon failure, one would be reduced to dust. Therefore, there are some Dao Palace-realm warriors who know that by doing so means abandoning the path to go further, they would not dare to make the breakthrough.” Elder Duanmu explained.</p>
<p>On one side was a lifespan with eight to nine million years, while the other side was death upon failure.</p>
<p>If a man in the morning hears the right way, he may die in the evening without regret. It was too difficult to become a Supremacy. Yi Yun reflected upon this.</p>
<p>At the same time, Yi Yun looked at Elder Shi and he felt like sighing. This elder, who looked high and mighty to the younger generation of Luo clan disciples, was facing the hard choice of life and death.</p>
<p>On the path in pursuit of the peak of martial arts, he was equally tiny.</p>
<p>And this time, Supremacy Gulan was accompanying them as well. Although he had become a Supremacy, there was a large rift that separated him from a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>The entire Luo clan had not produced a Divine Lord in hundreds of millions of years. It was obvious how hard it was to become a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun thought about this, a sense of grave danger suddenly enveloped him. It was like a dark shadow had been cast on his mind. Sweat inexplicably oozed out of Yi Yun's back.</p>
<p>What happened!?</p>
<p>Yi Yun spread his perception out and he noticed that silently in the nebulous mist around his surroundings, a black hand had stretched out, grabbing at the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>This large hand shuttled through the stars and it was even able to mask the luster of the starlight on the spirit cruiser.</p>
<p>Such terrifying power could instantly crush the spirit cruiser into pieces with a grab!</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who was inside the spirit cruiser, had already seen the large hand. The large hand gave him an overwhelming feeling that he could not resist.</p>
<p>Who!?</p>
<p>A black hand had sealed the space around them, isolating them from the world around them. The isolated space seemed to be shattering. This grab would not only shatter the spirit cruiser, it would even cause the space to explode as well!</p>
<p>Not only Yi Yun himself, even Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, who were beside Yi Yun, had a drastic change in expression. Even they could not withstand this strike!</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yun felt a strong sense of fatal danger!</p>
<p>At this point, the bow of the spirit cruiser was covered in a brilliance of light. Simultaneously, a figure flew out of the bow. He was dressed in azure-colored clothes and he held a broadsword. He slashed down at the large hand!</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The hand quaked as it disintegrated partially in the void. But very soon, it returned to its normal state. Its fingers moved lightly, drawing out a symbol of a phantasm, sealing the space firmly!</p>
<p>“Gui Huazi!”</p>
<p>The azure-clothed figure stood with the sword in his hand as his body exuded a terrifying aura. His brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>From the nebula came a sinister-sounding voice. “Gulan, it's been a while.”</p>
<p>The sword-wielding figure was naturally Supremacy Gulan. To traverse the Primordial Empyrean Heaven, a Supremacy was needed to power the spirit cruiser. And since Yi Yun was coming to the Oracle Fey Empire, Supremacy Gulan had accompanied Yi Yun. After all, there was a fear of accidents for such a long journey.</p>
<p>And now, an accident had really happened. Gui Huazi was a Supremacy from the Fey Phantasm Sect!</p>
<p>Supremacy Gulan said with a cold voice, “Gui Huazi, as a Supremacy, you actually want to assassinate a junior? Are you only worth that much?”</p>
<p>Gui Huazi did not respond to Supremacy Gulan's ridicule. The nebulous gasses stirred as the large black hand vanished. A gray and thin figure slowly emerged. He had six arms that hung softly from his body. His body was bent and he looked extremely weird.</p>
<p>His pupils were green as his eyes penetrated the spirit cruiser and his gaze landed directly on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately felt like he had fallen into an ice cavern. The gaze was like a dark hole that would devour him.</p>
<p>“Not bad. Much better than those disciples from the Cloud Trail Empire. Eh, his mind is pretty strong as well? Very good. His soul shall be devoured by me. It would definitely be a delicious tonic!”</p>
<p>When Yi Yun heard Gui Huazi's voice, it was echoing in his mind like a demon's whisper.</p>
<p>He was someone from the Fey Phantasm Sect, here to assassinate him!</p>
<p>Previously, they had killed all the Cloud Trail Empire geniuses who were undertaking the trials. Now, he was being targeted!</p>
<p>A Supremacy of a faction would consider their reputation, and they would not attack juniors. However, Supremacies of the Fey Phantasm Sect would not consider this at all!</p>
<p>Gui Huazi may not be able to kill Supremacy Gulan, but if he wanted to kill Yi Yun, it would be much simpler. After all, it was much easier to kill than to protect!</p>
<p>Chapter 957: Cutting the weeds and digging up the roots</p>
<p>“Gulan, you haven't improved in all these years. I failed to behead you in our last battle, but today, I'll kill you as well!” Gui Huazi said coldly.</p>
<p>“Preposterous!” Supremacy Gulan thrust his sword out as the two Supremacies engaged in an intense battle.</p>
<p>This was a battle that completely exceeded Yi Yun's realm. The battle of the two Supremacies created an independent space. The Dao Domain of Supremacies already formed nomological worlds. A battle created a world!</p>
<p>Gui Huazi attacked with all his strength, but Supremacy Gulan had to protect the spirit cruiser!</p>
<p>Supremacy Gulan and Supremacy Gui Huazi were close in strength. In order to protect Yi Yun, Supremacy Gulan was heavily restricted. As things went on, Supremacy Gulan was quickly repressed and he was in a disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>“This is the territory of the alliance and the entrance to the Oracle Fey Empire. Gui Huazi can't engage in battle for too long. He will leave very soon.” Elder Duanmu said as beads of sweat oozed off his forehead.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was in their hands, and not a single blunder was allowed.</p>
<p>They watched as the two Supremacies battled, but they did not leave Yi Yun's side.</p>
<p>They were no help in a battle between Supremacies. By staying beside Yi Yun, they could withstand any periphery aftershocks from the battle so they could protect Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But at this moment, there was a sudden spatial fluctuation, giving the world that they were in a strong sense of oppression.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt a strong sense of danger once again. As for Elder Shi, his heart tightened and his expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>“Careful!”</p>
<p>Elder Shi smacked out with his palm, like he did not use any strength.</p>
<p>But in front of Yi Yun, there was a micro-world that suddenly appeared. There were living creatures in it, with lush forests and tiny river streams. It was bustling with life.</p>
<p>This was Elder Shi's Dao Domain. Although he had yet to condensed nomological worlds, he had already attained the second realm of a Dao Domain — Great Dao.</p>
<p>However, when the shock wave struck the microcosm, Yi Yun watched as the biological beings in the world began to wither and die quickly.</p>
<p>Elder Shi's body convulsed as his face went pale and his blood drained from his face.</p>
<p>“Who is it!?”</p>
<p>Elder Shi was appalled. Gui Huazi was still fighting Supremacy Gulan, so it was not Gui Huazi's attack. It was from someone else.</p>
<p>For a person to be able to easily destroy his Dao Domain, severely injuring him, it was most likely another Supremacy!</p>
<p>“Two Supremacies in an assassination attempt!?” Elder Shi's heart sank. He never expected that Yi Yun would be targeted by the Fey Phantasm Sect in such a manner. Did they need to go that far?</p>
<p>He was just a junior. Even with the title of the number one genius of the Luo clan, there was no need to go so far!</p>
<p>They previously believed that it would be enough to protect Yi Yun with Supremacy Gulan, along with Elder Shi and Elder Duanmu. There were few Supremacies in the Luo clan to begin with. Other than those in reclusion, sending a Supremacy to protect Yi Yun was already the limit. After all, the Luo clan royal capital also required Supremacies to guard it. The Luo clan never expected that the Fey Phantasm Sect would send such a large killing squad. A Supremacy was not even enough to protect Yi Yun!</p>
<p>“Eight-floor Dao Palace? You aren't young, and you have expended your potential. Your obstruction is nothing in front of me.”</p>
<p>With a indifferent voice echoing, a pure-white figure appeared in the void.</p>
<p>The white figure neither looked male nor female. The figure's facial features were blurred, resembling a ghost.</p>
<p>“Daoist You Ming! Shit, Junior Brother, combine forces with me!” Elder Shi turned extremely nervous. There was Gui Huazi and another, Daoist You Ming!</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were both Dao Palace realm warriors, but their combined forces was still not enough for them to be an obstruction for Daoist You Ming!</p>
<p>“Since both of you yearn death, I shall fulfill your wishes. Feihua, I'll leave that junior to you.” The white figure said.</p>
<p>At that moment, a young man dressed in a crimson-colored robe walked out from the white figure. He had delicate features and he exuded a soft and effeminate aura.</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.” The effeminate man said.</p>
<p>His tone had a hint of disdain. He had accompanied his father to watch a battle between Supremacies and he hoped to gain insights from it. Now, he had to kill Yi Yun, a task that was to be done as a matter of convenience. His cultivation level was at the six-floor Dao Palace realm. Killing a Heaven Ascension realm warrior was as easy as slaughtering chickens.</p>
<p>Having a six-floor Dao Palace meant that he was on the same level as Elder Duanmu. If he fought Yi Yun, it was simply incomparable!</p>
<p>Two Supremacies and a six-floor Dao Palace warrior!</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt his body be constricted. Yi Yun did not have very deep feelings for the enemy known as the Fey Phantasm Sect, but today, he had encountered them for the first time. They were perverse opponents.</p>
<p>He had yet to form a vendetta with the Fey Phantasm Sect, but they were planning to nip all possible threats in the bud!</p>
<p>A super sect, whose strength went far beyond the Luo clan, did things meticulously by cutting the weeds and digging up the roots as well. They showed no mercy, so it was no wonder that despite the Fey Phantasm Sect being up to all kinds of evil, they still managed to remain steadfast in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven for so many years!</p>
<p>At this moment, the white figure had attacked. He stretched his hand out and waved it. A profound seal appeared in his hand as it flew at Elder Shi.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A terrifying shock wave immediately blasted at the two Elders who bellowed loudly. They burnt their blood essences as they combined forces to face the attack!</p>
<p>They were out of options. Even if they burnt their blood essence, they were still no match for a Supremacy.</p>
<p>At this moment, You Feihua looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>He touched the void in front of him and immediately, a guqin appeared and floated in front of him.</p>
<p>The guqin exuded a strange aura. As You Feihua's fingers flicked the guqin gently, it made sounds, sending sound waves out, immediately making Yi Yun's blood surge wantonly.</p>
<p>Music was the style of a gentleman, but this warrior gave one a very sinister feeling. The strum of the guqin sent sound waves that were mingled with the sound of wailing ghosts.</p>
<p>“Vanquishing you in one strike!” You Feihua's voice was cold and indifferent.</p>
<p>His fingers strummed against the strings of the guqin and immediately, a sharp sound of the guqin resounded as a dark shadow appeared in the sound wave. The ferocious and pained face opened its mouth as it grabbed at Yi Yun with its sharp claws.</p>
<p>It was like the wraith shadow was about to grab at Yi Yun's soul!</p>
<p>What seemed like a casual strike was actually one of You Feihua's proficient moves, God Vanquishing Sound. Even Elder Duanmu would have to carefully withstand it!</p>
<p>You Feihua had a six-floor Dao Palace cultivation level. Against a junior at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, it would be an easy task to do anything to him. But in order to quickly settle the problem, he immediately used God Vanquishing Sound. He did so to waste little time, so that he could finish the deed before the arrival of the people from the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>The wraith shadow's attack immediately made Yi Yun feel that his life was being threatened. It was like his throat was being held and he was quickly being suffocated!</p>
<p>He would die!</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt that the wraith shadow was something difficult to withstand!</p>
<p>Be it Supremacy Gulan or the two Elders, they were completely embroiled in their battles with the Fey Phantasm Sect Supremacies. They could not rescue him.</p>
<p>This was the greatest crisis that Yi Yun had ever faced ever since he came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven!</p>
<p>There was no way for him to block against such a move!</p>
<p>With his life on the line, Yi Yun did not resist the strike head on. He immediately summoned the Draco First True Gold avatar as it charged at the ghastly shadow!</p>
<p>“Cha! Cha! Cha!”</p>
<p>999 Thousand Snow flying sabers flew out. But at that second, the flying sabers were defiled by the wraith shadow, losing a great deal of their agility. The wraith shadow rushed straight into the Draco First True Gold avatar!</p>
<p>“Branched soul, return!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun decisively pulled his Draco First True Gold avatar's branched soul back. At that moment, the Draco First True Gold avatar was trembling violently. It could not resist the attack at all!</p>
<p>“Oh? An avatar?”</p>
<p>You Feihua was slightly surprised, but he did not mind it. The God Vanquishing Sound from his Heavenly Wraith Guqin could vanquish any target with life in it. By using his avatar to attract the attention of the sonic wraith, Yi Yun had managed to escape the crisis, but there was no way to avoid it again.</p>
<p>Just as You Feihua was about to use the God Vanquishing Sound again, there was a divine beam that flashed in the distance. Someone was coming!</p>
<p>People from the Oracle Fey Empire?</p>
<p>It was war time now. The Oracle Fey Empire's level of alertness was extremely high, and with the Fey Phantasm Sect appearing at their country's doorstep, they naturally discovered it very quickly.</p>
<p>“They came so fast.” Daoist You Ming frowned. Although he knew that carrying out an assassination at the doorstep to the country would result in gaining the attention of the Oracle Fey Empire, they could only do so. This was because they could only be certain that the entrance to the Oracle Fey Empire was where Yi Yun would have to pass on his trip to the Oracle Fey Empire.</p>
<p>“Feihua, come back!”</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming no longer needed Feihua to attack. He did not wish to stay long in the Oracle Fey Empire. After all, Felicitous Rain Lord was residing in the Oracle Fey Empire!</p>
<p>Of course, Felicitous Rain Lord was located very far away. He would not notice the battle here immediately, but it was unknown what tricks a Divine Lord had up his sleeve. If they stayed in the area any longer, they would definitely die here if Felicitous Rain Lord were to appear here!</p>
<p>In order to end the battle quickly to ensure no mistakes, Daoist You Ming decided on attacking himself!</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi had already been severely injured by Daoist You Ming! Especially Elder Shi, his face was pale and he was bleeding from all seven orifices. He was barely alive, so they could no longer stop Daoist You Ming!</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming beckoned his hand in the void, and in a distance, a tiny star vibrated gently because of Daoist You Ming's summoning. The energy essence from the star was induced by Daoist You Ming through such a move, and had large amounts of energy extracted from it!</p>
<p>A nonchalant wave of the hand extracted the power of stars!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body was ice-cold. At this moment, Daoist You Ming's attack was aimed at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>A strike that contained the power of stars!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser that Yi Yun was in began to shatter! Although the spirit cruiser was a national treasure of the Luo clan, it was still a spirit cruiser after all. It was only used to travel through space, a tool for motion. So how could it withstand the blow from a Supremacy?</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>The spirit cruiser exploded breaking into fragments in the storm!</p>
<p>And spatial chaos immediately surged out, merging with the power of the stars, resulting in a fierce explosion!</p>
<p>Such a terrifying strike would instantly kill even an eight-floor Dao Palace realm warrior! There was no need to even talk about a Heaven Ascension realm warrior. He would definitely be reduced to smithereens!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi's eyes turned red. All these years, Yi Yun had been in reclusion in the Primordial Space. They already treated Yi Yun as half a disciple and they were desperately fighting to protect him. Even if Yi Yun could not become a Divine Lord's disciple in the future, he would definitely become a mighty figure of the Luo clan, or he might even become a spiritual leader of the Luo clan disciples, but now… everything was gone!</p>
<p>“Let's go!”</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming flicked his sleeves and took You Feihua away. As for Gui Huazi, he used a move to send Supremacy Gulan retreating. The two Supremacies tore through the void and entered it, vanishing from the area!</p>
<p>This was the power of Supremacies. They could come in and leave the entrance to an empire as they wished!</p>
<p>Only at this moment did the people from the Oracle Fey Empire arrive. In front of them, there was only a shattered void, as well as the debris of a spirit cruiser in the spatial turbulence.</p>
<p>Chapter 958: Surprises at every bend</p>
<p>As he looked at the shattered spirit cruiser, Supremacy Gulan's expression was extremely ugly. The Third Imperial Uncle had assigned him a task to protect Yi Yun from any harm. Furthermore, it was already unprecedented for a Supremacy to protect a Heaven Ascension realm junior, but even so, something untoward had happened.</p>
<p>The main reason was the mightiness of the Fey Phantasm Sect. The Luo clan's Supremacies could be count with one's fingers, while the Fey Phantasm Sect's Supremacies that the Luo clan knew about numbered approximately fifteen. There were others that the Luo clan did not even know about at all.</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect could easily send two Supremacies to assassinate Yi Yun, while the Luo clan's Supremacies had to stay behind to protect the royal capital.</p>
<p>Supremacy Gulan felt ashamed to return to the Luo clan. Just as he felt disheartened, he suddenly sensed something. He was surprised to discover that in the chaotic spatial storms, there was a bright glimmer of light floating about. It seemed like it was about to be sucked into the spatial turbulence.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>Supremacy Gulan had his hopes lifted as he suddenly took a step forward to grasp the glimmer of light.</p>
<p>The point of light flew over, and it was a… small pagoda tower!</p>
<p>The small tower was about two inches tall, and it shimmered with a dark golden sheen. It was obvious that it was an extraordinary item.</p>
<p>It was a Supremacy's attack, but the tower was not destroyed?</p>
<p>Could it be…</p>
<p>Supremacy Gulan held his breath, and at that moment, a weak beam of light flew out of the tower. As it spun in the air, it finally took on the form of Yi Yun. His face was pale and his body was drenched in sweat. As for the tower, it flew into Yi Yun's body at that moment and vanished.</p>
<p>What a close call. He had been tethering on the brink of life and death!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's energy was all depleted and he had suffered a huge lose in lifeblood. But at that critical juncture, he used the God Advent Tower to withstand Daoist You Ming's final strike!</p>
<p>A Supremacy's attack was extremely horrifying! Even if Yi Yun had broken through another major cultivation realm, he would not be able to withstand it, much less his present self.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he had the God Advent Tower.</p>
<p>Ever since he came to the 12 Empyrean Heavens, Yi Yun had never used the God Advent Tower. After all, the God Advent Tower was a legacy item of the Azure Yang Lord.</p>
<p>A legacy item of a Divine Lord was obviously extraordinary in power. Unfortunately, the God Advent Tower was not powered by a Divine Lord. With Yi Yun's present strength, the power that the God Advent Tower could use was greatly limited with his control. Thankfully, the God Advent Tower had a protective array with it. Back in the lower realm, these arrays were unable to show their effectiveness due to the lack of energy.</p>
<p>And upon coming to the 12 Empyrean Heavens, with the availability of a large number of World Stones as an energy source, Yi Yun had long recharged the God Advent Tower's arrays to their maximum.</p>
<p>The strike from Daoist You Ming had nearly depleted all of the stored energy in the God Advent Tower's defensive arrays!</p>
<p>In one breath, he had burnt nearly two hundred thousand World Stones!</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yi Yun was wealthy. Disregarding everything else, just the gifts that were sent to his viscount residence after he defeated Chi Zhuiyun had given him a great deal of wealth.</p>
<p>Without mentioning the relics and other treasures, he received about eight to nine hundred thousand World Stones. And amongst them, there were quite a number of superior World Stones.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not think that the gifts would play an important role, and with more World Stones, they were just a number. However, he never expected that the gifts were able to save him at that moment in time.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was best to have more wealth.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt a lingering fear. Thanks to a treasure like the God Advent Tower and his massive wealth, he had managed to survive an attack of a Supremacy.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, are you alright?” Supremacy Gulan did not ask further as he reached his hand out to feel Yi Yun's meridians and sent pulses of energy to probe Yi Yun's body to examine him thoroughly. When he realized that Yi Yun was fine other than being severely drained of his energy, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he gave Yi Yun an incredulous look. He knew that Yi Yun's survival was not because of his own strength, but because of that tiny tower.</p>
<p>That tiny tower was so impressive?</p>
<p>Just from the looks of it, Supremacy Gulan could not glean the history of the God Advent Tower that had been shrunk an unknown number of times. After all, the Azure Yang Lord was a figure that existed about forty to fifty million years ago.</p>
<p>When the Azure Yang Lord reigned in the Yang God Empyrean Heaven, Supremacy Gulan's great-grandfather had yet to be born. In addition to the Yang God Empyrean Heaven being so far from the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, Supremacy Gulan obviously could not recognize the God Advent Tower, even if he was very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>However, there was no doubt in the God Advent Tower's value.</p>
<p>“Elder Shi, Elder Duanmu, how are the both of you?” Supremacy Gulan looked at the two Luo Divine Hall Elders that had been severely injured by Daoist You Ming. After he verified that Yi Yun was fine, Supremacy Gulan went to treat the two Elders' injuries.</p>
<p>“I won't die.” Elder Shi waved his hand. However, as he spoke, blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“You… burned your blood essence. Even your meridians are damaged!” Supremacy Gulan frowned.</p>
<p>The two Elders, especially Elder Shi, were severely injured.</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming's attacks were extremely vicious. His attacks could drain his opponents of their lifeblood, and with Elder Shi burning his blood essence and having his lifeblood drained, he was immediately feeling a deficit of energy and blood.</p>
<p>“There was no other way. If I didn't burn my blood essence, I probably wouldn't even last a few seconds.” Elder Shi said with a wry smile. He indulged in self-mockery, “I'm getting old and I am on a decline. I'm getting more and more useless!”</p>
<p>“Senior Shi… ” Yi Yun's voice sounded guilt-stricken. If not for him, would Elder Shi be in such a state?</p>
<p>And Elder Duanmu had mentioned that Elder Shi had came out to regulate his mood and mind. Elder Shi was about to enter reclusion to his death, and with the hopes of him breaking through to become a Supremacy being slim already, now with the current situation of him suffering a deficit in lifeblood, the chances of him breaking through to become a Supremacy by entering a death reclusion were even slimmer!</p>
<p>“It's fine. A warrior's cultivation depends on himself, but success or failure depends on the heavens. Regardless of the outcome, it's my choice. If it is really impossible, I will choose to give up.” Elder Shi sighed. He knew that if he continued to forcefully stay in reclusion, the chances of succeeding in becoming a Supremacy were extremely low. However, he would feel indignant if he did not attempt it!</p>
<p>Yi Yun fell silent. He no longer spoke as he looked at Elder Shi.</p>
<p>There was no way to express his gratitude towards such a large matter. Yi Yun took a note of the two Elders who had risked their lives to save him.</p>
<p>In his lifetime, he would definitely repay the debt. If he really became a peerless warrior, he could even help Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi become Supremacies!</p>
<p>At this moment…</p>
<p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>
<p>The people from the Oracle Fey Empire arrived. They were previously situated very far away, and with the energy storms distorting space, they were only vaguely aware of what had happened. They were extremely astonished to see that Yi Yun had managed to survive an attack of a Supremacy?</p>
<p>Was it a life-protecting charm?</p>
<p>A number of them had seen Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun's battle. They knew that Yi Yun had once used a broken sword in that battle, and that broken sword was an impressive treasure.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun.” Elder Shi coughed as he wiped his mouth. His voice sounded old and hoarse. “You have revealed some of your treasures this time. In the Luo clan, the Third Imperial Uncle and His Majesty, Emperor Luo, would give you their backing, so no one would snatch your opportunities. But when you are away from the Luo clan, you have to be careful. However, it's thankful that it wouldn't be a problem for you to become Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple this time at the Oracle Fey Empire. Once you become a Divine Lord's in-name disciple, no one will have their sights on you.”</p>
<p>Elder Shi was very curious about the tower's history, but he did not probe any further. The tower was extraordinary. Thankfully, it was only an artifact. To Supremacies, the most valuable treasures were ones that directly augmented themselves, such as top cultivation techniques, Ancient Fey bones, or treasures that extended their lives. External items like weapons and artifacts were not enough to make Supremacies go crazy for them.</p>
<p>In fact, even if Yi Yun had acquired an impressive legacy, and for him to walk this far with his own strength was already amazing.</p>
<p>Only a genius with providence shining down on him could mature. Without enough of providence's grace, not only would there be a lack of opportunities, just one's growth process might be cut short with death.</p>
<p>Chapter 959: The Event Begins</p>
<p>The news of Yi Yun being attacked by Fey Phantasm Sect Supremacies at the entrance to the Oracle Fey Kingdom quickly proliferated throughout the alliance.</p>
<p>The two Fey Phantasm Sect Supremacies, as well as Daoist You Ming's son, You Feihua, quickly received the news not long after they left the Oracle Fey Kingdom.</p>
<p>“What!? That punk didn't die? Impossible!”</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming was the one who had personally dealt the strike. He knew the power of that one strike very well, so how did Yi Yun survive?</p>
<p>“That is the fact. Now, Yi Yun is still all fine and dandy in the Oracle Fey Kingdom. Felicitous Rain Lord's recruitment meet for an in-name disciple will soon proceed. Yi Yun would likely not be absent. If you don't believe, you can always make a visit and also revel in the magnificence of Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment drive.” Beside Daoist You Ming, Gui Huazi said in a queer manner.</p>
<p>Although he frequently worked with Daoist You Ming, they often threw snide remarks at each other. Their relationship wasn't harmonious.</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming's face sank. He would not dare to go to the meet where Felicitous Rain Lord was taking in a disciple, even if he had an additional life. Gui Huazi was just poking fun at him.</p>
<p>It was humiliating to fail to kill a junior in one strike as a Supremacy!</p>
<p>“I'll finish that Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“Heh! You speak so lightly of it. If he were to become an in-name disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord, would you dare to touch him?” Gui Huazi quipped sarcastically. Even an in-name disciple of a Divine Lord represented a Divine Lord's honor. If one were to rashly kill a Divine Lord's in-name disciple, it was very likely that the Divine Lord would get revenge for their disciple!</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming could not afford the risk.</p>
<p>“So what if he's Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple? There are other methods to kill Yi Yun, as long as Felicitous Rain Lord doesn't realize that it was done by me.” Daoist You Ming said in a cold voice as his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, in the Oracle Fey Kingdom's capital, Yi Yun's name had once again caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>After all, Yi Yun was a person who had defeated Chi Zhuiyun. He garnered a great deal of attention in the Oracle Fey Kingdom.</p>
<p>“He actually managed to survive a strike from a Supremacy?”</p>
<p>In the Brocade Spring Court of the Oracle Fey Kingdom's capital, a youth dressed in a black robe was playing the zither. A tune like flowing water was being played.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the zither music slowly turned silent. But immediately after this, he shook his head and said, “It's impossible for a Heaven Ascension realm warrior to withstand a strike from a Supremacy. Ignoring the Heaven Ascension realm, even a peerless genius at the Dao Manifestation perfection realm would definitely die! That Yi Yun must have had some life-saving means, such as an extremely valuable protective charm in order to survive.”</p>
<p>The youth dressed in the black robe was one of the top in-name disciples of Felicitous Rain Lord, Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>This ranking was not a ranking of strength, it was a ranking of talent and opinion.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's cultivation level had already broken into the Dao Manifestation realm. Amongst Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples, his cultivation level was considered low. But typically, the number of in-name disciples that could meet Felicitous Rain Lord at any time numbered two. Song Wuchen was one of them.</p>
<p>“So it's a protective charm. That wouldn't mean anything.” In front of Song Wuchen, there were two other in-name disciples of Felicitous Rain Lord. They were the two who had argued with those warriors in the restaurant previously. Their names were Feng Zheng and Feng Qi. They were not brothers, but their identical surnames was a result of them coming from the same family clan.</p>
<p>They had vague notions of people like Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun to begin with. It was only recently that they heard about their stories. For instance, just not long ago, they had heard how Yi Yun was being assassinated by Fey Phantasm Sect Supremacies and how he finally managed to escape. They were astonished, so they came to report it to Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>“I heard that Yi Yun is a warrior from the lower realm. How did he have such a valuable protective charm?” Feng Zheng said unhappily. He came from a major faction, but a poor rascal like Yi Yun had things that were much better than his.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen said, “He must have his own opportunities, but for such opportunities to have supported his growth up to this point, it is likely that they have been mostly depleted. Now, it's most likely that Yi Yun wants to become Master's in-name disciple for the resources provided by Master.”</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen said this, Feng Qi and Feng Zheng naturally did not feel happy.</p>
<p>As disciples of Felicitous Rain Lord, they obviously wished that there were fewer fellow disciples. That way, the amount of resources they were be allocated would be a greater amount of the resources available.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Wuchen, you are the examiner for the in-name disciple test, right?”</p>
<p>“That's right, I'm just one of the examiners.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother Wuchen, you must be strict. It's best if that motley crew is barred from becoming our fellow disciples.” Feng Zheng said.</p>
<p>Actually, if it was possible, he did not even wish that there would be even be an additional disciple. It was best if they were all eliminated. However, he knew that people like Chi Zhuiyun and Yi Yun were exceptional. It was very likely that they would become in-name disciples.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen lightly pondered before saying, “If his qualifications really make the cut and pass my test, I will give him a chance… ”</p>
<p>“Alright… Senior Brother Wuchen is truly fair.”</p>
<p>Feng Zheng and Feng Qi exchanged some niceties before leaving. Song Wuchen put his zither away.</p>
<p>“There are so many people trying to become Master's in-name disciple again!” Song Wuchen frowned. All of the years that he had been an in-name disciple, he had always been hoping to become Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple, but he had failed to gain Felicitous Rain Lord's approval.</p>
<p>Although he was still a distance away from becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple, by being one of the top in-name disciples, the resources that he enjoyed was also the best provided by Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>He did not wish for anyone to threaten his position.</p>
<p>A person like Tian Xun already pissed him off greatly. If there were other people, the room for his growth would be further suppressed.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen did not show it over the past few years, but he was a person with ambition. He believed that when he was constantly ranked first amongst the in-name disciples, there would be a day when he would become Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple if Felicitous Rain Lord failed to find a personal disciple that he found suitable!</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun… Yi Yun… You want to get a piece of this, then let's see if you can complete my test!” Song Wuchen muttered to himself as he flew away…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ten days later, in the Oracle Fey Kingdom's Brocade Spring Court, the event began — Felicitous Rain Lord's recruitment of in-name disciples.</p>
<p>Brocade Spring Court was originally one of the venues that hosted the grandest events in the Oracle Fey Kingdom. And for Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment, it was even hosted by the country's king.</p>
<p>Having the head of the country host this grand event and Shui Ningshuang being in attendance, the lineup was enough to stir the minds of the elites from various countries.</p>
<p>However, it was unfortunate that Felicitous Rain Lord did not appear.</p>
<p>“What a pity to not be able to see Felicitous Rain Lord.” A young genius said in dismay. To people like him, it was impossible to even hope. They were just hear to take a look.</p>
<p>“It's normal to not even see him. Felicitous Rain Lord's recruitment of an in-name disciple might not mean that he would personally give them pointers. Only a few of the top disciples might obtain the true teachings of Felicitous Rain Lord. Now, it's already sufficient to have Fairy Ningshuang manage the recruitment of in-name disciples. Furthermore, I heard that two of the examiners are Song Wuchen and Tian Xun, two of the best in-name disciples. I wonder what their tests will be.”</p>
<p>Chapter 960: No test of actual combat</p>
<p>“Song Wuchen? Tian Xun? Letting in-name disciples test us?”</p>
<p>Outside Brocade Spring Court, a few young geniuses were displeased hearing this. Felicitous Rain Lord's absence was understandable, but who the hell were Song Wuchen and Tian Xun? Weren't they also juniors from the younger generation? At best, they would be an entire realm higher than them, yet, they had the qualifications to test them?</p>
<p>“I would like to see what sort of tests would one need to take to become Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple.”</p>
<p>Many young geniuses were discontented regarding this matter. As they conversed with each other, they walked through Brocade Spring Court's gates.</p>
<p>The Brocade Spring Court covered an area of a hundred square miles, and it was like a spirit forest. There were all sorts of spirit trees, assorted flowers, and treasured materials, each numerous in number.</p>
<p>And the number of people that came for this grand event was estimated to be seventy to eighty thousand people. Most of the people were only there to join in the bustle, and quite a number of people were elders that were there to watch the performances of their juniors.</p>
<p>However, even after taking these people out, the number of people who had decided to participate in the in-name disciple assessment was still way too many, a number close to ten thousand people.</p>
<p>“Why are there so many people?”</p>
<p>Upon seeing the crowd, Yi Yun was quite taken aback. He even saw a little girl that did not look like she was twenty years of age. Certain members of the Fey race had slower growth by nature, just like Dong'er. They would still look like a ten-year-old in their teens.</p>
<p>Even such a young girl wanted to become an in-name disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord?</p>
<p>“The in-name disciple assessment does not even have an initial threshold from the beginning, so it's obvious that there would be many participants. Many people are only here to join in the bustle or using it as an experience or trial as part of their martial path. They have no chance of becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple. The number of people that are of true worth can be counted with one's fingers.”</p>
<p>The ones that could really be considered as geniuses in the alliance were not commonplace after all, so it was obvious that it should not have reached such massive numbers.</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun walked into Brocade Spring Court, a faint perceptive sense brushed past the Purple Crystal, causing the Purple Crystal to palpitate slightly.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was slightly surprised, but he did not know what had just happened.</p>
<p>“Ningshuang, is he the Yi Yun you mentioned?”</p>
<p>At this moment, on a floating island above the Oracle Fey Kingdom, there was a pavilion sitting on top of a deep blue lake.</p>
<p>An azure-clothed white-haired middle-aged man sat in front of a stone table, and he was playing Go with a woman.</p>
<p>The white-haired man had a pair of purplish-red-colored eyes. In his pupils, it reflected a universe. It was a world with stars that were born and destroyed in that universe.</p>
<p>The man was Felicitous Rain Lord, who had obtained the Divine Lord Royal Seal in the past tens of thousands of years!</p>
<p>And the woman he was facing was Shui Ningshuang, a person who he had once saved and has always followed him by his side.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not attend the Brocade Spring Court's event, but with his perception, a simple sweep of it allowed him to know everything at his fingertips.</p>
<p>“Yes, it's him. A year ago, Chi Zhuiyun went to the Luo clan and he challenged everyone, but he was trounced by Yi Yun. In terms of combat strength, that child should be the strongest person in the alliance.”</p>
<p>“Combat strength is not everything.” The white-haired man said leisurely.</p>
<p>He did not care about the title of being first in the alliance.</p>
<p>The alliance was only the coalition of six factions. And among the six factions, there was not a single faction with a Divine Lord. Every hundred years, an alliance would give birth to the strongest person amongst the younger generation, and this so-called strongest person did not really have any weight to it.</p>
<p>“However, that Yi Yun is indeed interesting. Even if he's not qualified to cultivate the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', I can still nurture him well.” Felicitous Rain Lord said as he lightly placed down a piece.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang was somewhat astonished for she never expected that Felicitous Rain Lord, who always appeared to be indifferent to things around him, had such a high opinion of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>She got up and said, “Then, I shall take my leave first.”</p>
<p>The event still needed Shui Ningshuang to preside over it personally.</p>
<p>“There's no need for that. Just stay here and watch it with me.” Felicitous Rain Lord said nonchalantly as Shui Ningshuang was taken aback, before she sat back down.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, Brocade Spring Court was already extremely crowded. People darted through the spiritual plantation, waiting for the start of the event.</p>
<p>In the middle of Brocade Spring Court, there was a towering tree. It was almost ten miles high, as its crown pierced through the clouds. And its trunk had the circumference of the combined arm span of a hundred people.</p>
<p>It was rumored that the gigantic tree was planted at the founding of the Oracle Fey Kingdom, so it had already been growing for 80 million years.</p>
<p>Around the towering tree, there were floating houses. Song Wuchen, Tian Xun, and the Oracle Fey Kingdom's king and ministers, as well as members of the upper echelons of various major factions, such as Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, were sitting in the floating houses, overlooking the tens of thousands of warriors beneath them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Song Wuchen had the pleasurable feeling that he had control over tens of thousands of warriors. After all, many of the rules for the test were decided by Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>“I believe it's about time with most of the people being here.” The king of the Oracle Fey Kingdom said.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen looked at the tens of thousands of warriors and he wrapped up his thoughts. He said with a gentle smile, “If that's the case, let's begin.”</p>
<p>As he said that, Song Wuchen stood up and he went next to a railing beside the floating hall.</p>
<p>“Silence!”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's voice wasn't loud, but it immediately spread through the entire Brocade Spring Court.</p>
<p>The warriors, who came to participate in the in-name disciple selection, immediately looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Who is that?”</p>
<p>People had never seen the young and elegant man, but they could guess his identity.</p>
<p>“Everyone, I'm Song Wuchen. I'm here on behalf of my master to preside over the selection of in-name disciples.”</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen spoke, he scanned the warriors beneath him. Other than most of the people that were here just for an experience, with no hopes of becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, there was a small group of people in front of the crowd that made him take a few additional glances.</p>
<p>Amongst them was Yi Yun, Chi Zhuiyun, and Tianya Haoyue — the cream of the crop of the alliance!</p>
<p>Other than these geniuses from various factions that everyone was familiar with, there were two unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>One of them was thin and had pale skin, giving him a sinister look. Another one was short and fat, but he looked harmless in nature.</p>
<p>Very few knew who the two were.</p>
<p>When Song Wuchen saw Yi Yun, his good mood turned for the worse.</p>
<p>Just a while ago, he had received Shui Ningshuang's long-distance voice transmission to focus his assessment on Yi Yun. Yi Yun was apparently highly valued by Shui Ningshuang, so how could Song Wuchen feel happy about that? He began to feel a threat from Yi Yun.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun became an in-name disciple, it was likely that Yi Yun would slowly threaten his position.</p>
<p>“For the assessment, the proportion for actual combat will be tiny. There will not be any one-versus-one duels!”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's first sentence caught many people by surprise. To warriors, the most intuitive method of comparing strength was one's combat strength, but Song Wuchen said that there would not be any duels.</p>
<p>Many people immediately looked at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>They knew that Yi Yun was best at actual combat!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Dao Domain was very weak, or at least a year ago, he did not have a Dao Domain. Yet, Yi Yun was able to defeat Chi Zhuiyun without a Dao Domain, relying on his terrifying combat strength.</p>
<p>Chapter 961: Demon Defying Bead</p>
<p>Without testing actual combat, what other advantages did Yi Yun have?</p>
<p>Bloodline? Perception?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's bloodline was just too weak. It was a known fact. Although Yi Yun had absorbed an Ancient Fey bone, he was still incomparable to other elites of the Fey race.</p>
<p>In terms of perception, it was apparent that Yi Yun didn't have a great advantage.</p>
<p>The rules that Song Wuchen set made several members of the Luo clan unhappy. Elder Shi and Elder Duanmu were also discontented with the rules. It was too disadvantageous for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked calm and he remained silent. Chi Zhuiyun glanced at Yi Yun. Yi Yun was an opponent worthy of his respect, so although he wanted to beat Yi Yun, he did not want to beat him in such a manner.</p>
<p>“Then, how does Young master Wuchen plan on beginning the test? The number of examinees in Brocade Spring Court seem to be far too many.” The king of the Oracle Fey Kingdom said.</p>
<p>There was no lower threshold for the assessment, so there were too many riff-raff that came to Brocade Spring Court. It would be extremely troublesome to test each and every one of them.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen gave a nonchalant smile, as though he had everything under his control.</p>
<p>“It's simple. The first round will eliminate more than 99%! If there are people who wish to fish in troubled waters, then they are just too naive.”</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen spoke, his body began to hover mid-air. With a swipe of his interspatial ring, a black and white bead flew out of it.</p>
<p>The bead began to rapidly expand in size mid-air. It resembled the eye of an Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>“This is a Demon Defying Bead, a piece of treasure bestowed unto me by my master. The Demon Defying Bead is a supreme-grade array bead, allowing it to contain an array formation. Furthermore, the array formation's powers are extensive. All of you will enter the Demon Defying Bead's array formation, with the array formation that was created by me personally. Those who can eventually walk out of the Demon Defying Bead will pass, or they will be eliminated!”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's voice echoed throughout the area. The Nine Palatial Array in the Demon Defying Bead was an array formation attainment that he was proud of as it was mostly created by himself.</p>
<p>As examiner, Song Wuchen obviously would show off his Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>“The first test is to crack the array?”</p>
<p>The people could tell what Song Wuchen meant.</p>
<p>“Crack the array?” Song Wuchen had a smile on his lips. Many warriors had their domains of expertise. Some of them would be in the Desolate Heaven technique, while others in the refinement of items, but for Song Wuchen, it was his array formation.</p>
<p>He was an array formation master, and with his cultivation level being at the late stages of the Dao Manifestation realm, how could it possibly be so easy to crack an array formation that he set?</p>
<p>“It's not cracking the array. It would be pretty impressive just to exit it. The less time it takes, the better the result.”</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen spoke, the Demon Defying Bead began to slowly descend, encompassing everyone within it.</p>
<p>“An array formation that can eliminate 99% of people. Young master Wuchen's means are indeed impressive.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said with a laugh.</p>
<p>He naturally had to compliment Song Wuchen, who was one of the top disciples of Felicitous Rain Lord as well as one of the examiners.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I said above 99%. There are about nine thousand people participating in the assessment, so eliminating 99% would still leave behind eighty to ninety people. That's way too many. I believe leaving about a dozen or so after the first round would be sufficient.” Song Wuchen said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Everyone was secretly horrified when they heard this. To reduce nearly ten thousand people to about a dozen was quite a ruthless elimination rate.</p>
<p>“To leave about ten people behind, 60% difficulty should be enough.” Song Wuchen said as he waved his hand once again, causing the array bead to envelop the examinees completely.</p>
<p>If 60% difficulty could eliminate so many people, wouldn't that mean that few could clear its 100% difficulty?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's words made quite a number of people give him a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen was very pleased with this effect. He knew that by being an examiner, it was also an opportunity for him to showcase himself in front of Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>In the test, the standard that he set was a manifestation of his strength!</p>
<p>Song Wuchen liked the feeling of being in complete control of an array that determined the fates of almost ten thousand people.</p>
<p>With a Divine Lord-level treasure, the Demon Defying Bead, in his hand, he could achieve perfect control over any one of the thousands of people.</p>
<p>Of course, that included Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's perception interfaced with the Demon Defying Bead and his focus landed on Yi Yun. A teasing smile suffused across his lips.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, since you are so highly valued by Martial Aunt Ningshuang, you obviously can't have such a simple difficulty. I'll add something in for you.”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen knew very well that Shui Ningshuang's voice transmission, which requested him to put more focus on Yi Yun before the assessment began, meant that Felicitous Rain Lord had already decided to take Yi Yun in as an in-name disciple already.</p>
<p>Since there was no way of stopping Yi Yun from becoming an in-name disciple, it was meaningless regardless of the methods he employed to asses Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Although it was an unchangeable fact, Song Wuchen wanted to haze Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's choice of adding something for Yi Yun's assessment could not escape the eyes of Fairy Ningshuang, but it did not matter as Fairy Ningshuang had informed him to 'focus' on Yi Yun. If Yi Yun's results were terrible during the assessment, Song Wuchen could explain it away as him thinking that Yi Yun was extremely gifted and that Yi Yun could go above and beyond the requirements of the assessment, but who knew that Yi Yun could not stand up to the examination.</p>
<p>In that case, even if Yi Yun became an in-name disciple, he would not be able to threaten Song Wuchen's position as the top in-name disciple.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, since you are the focus of attention, enjoy the additional augmentation of the Demon Defying Bead. As for Chi Zhuiyun, you are slightly weaker, so I'll give you 100% difficulty, so that you'll have a fun time.” Song Wuchen muttered to himself as he produced a few incantation seals without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>He looked forward to Yi Yun's ending in dismay, to the point of him not being able to exit the array bead.</p>
<p>Many members of the audience did not know that there was a difference in the difficulties in the Demon Defying Bead's array formation. Song Wuchen was eager to know what Yi Yun's Luo clan worshipers would think when they saw their idol have such terrible results.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, in the pavilion in the middle of a lake on a floating island.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang and Felicitous Rain Lord were still playing their Go game. When she placed a piece, her wrist trembled slightly. “Song Wuchen is a bit too much. Although I informed him to focus on Yi Yun, isn't this difficulty a bit too high?”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord smiled and said, “It's alright. It's good to have a bit more difficulty. Let's see if that child, Yi Yun, can give me a pleasant surprise.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Do you think that even at such a difficulty, Yi Yun will still be able to exit it?”</p>
<p>“According to Yi Yun's cultivation level, it will be very difficult for him to do so, but… If everything is done according to conventional thinking, then there is no meaning for him to be specially nurtured… ” Felicitous Rain Lord said casually before placing another piece down.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang's eyebrows pricked up slightly. This was Felicitous Rain Lord, who had extremely high standards!</p>
<p>Even at such a difficulty, which most mighty figures would find it demanding for a junior, Felicitous Rain Lord treated it as a standard for the assessment.</p>
<p>Even the three criteria set for Yi Yun previously to become a personal disciple was Felicitous Rain Lord's original intentions. It was a rigid criteria that had no room for contest!</p>
<p>Since she couldn't do anything about it, all she could do was wish Yi Yun the best of luck.</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord and Shui Ningshuang were conversing, Yi Yun had arrived at an alternate spatial-temporal dimension.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this was the interior world of the Demon Defying Bead. When it came to treasures at the Divine Lord level, their internal spaces could be expanded into worlds of themselves. Back then, the God Advent Tower had similar effects as well.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun had such a thought, the space around him began to cave in towards him. Soon, it formed a long corridor, and at the end of the corridor, there was a large bronze door!</p>
<p>Chapter 962: Nine Palatial Array</p>
<p>Yi Yun arrived in front of the large door and he looked up. On the door, there were runes of all shapes and sizes. Instantly, the runes flew off the bronze door like a flock of birds and swarmed Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The runes did not take on the shape of Ancient Fey or anything similar. They maintained their most primitive forms as they surrounded Yi Yun, like they wanted to tear Yi Yun to pieces.</p>
<p>“These are all runic patterns and they combine together into something like a maze. But as long as the flaws in it can be discovered, it can slowly be cracked open.”</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun gently tapped the runic patterns as ripples began appearing. Yi Yun was searching for a way to crack the array formation.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's taps, the flying runic patterns came to a stop, and after five minutes, the core rune was destroyed by Yi Yun, shattering the entire array formation.</p>
<p>“Rumble!”</p>
<p>The bronze door opened, giving him access, but Yi Yun frowned slightly.</p>
<p>The assessment was part of Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple recruitment. From the beginning, Yi Yun did not care about the spot of an in-name disciple. If he could only become an in-name disciple of a Divine Lord, he would rather stay in the Luo clan.</p>
<p>But now, the difficulty of the assessment was so high?</p>
<p>This was just the first obstacle in the first assessment. It did not pose any problems for him, but many others would probably be eliminated immediately.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun had such thoughts in mind, he walked into the palatial hall behind the bronze door.</p>
<p>Upon entering the palatial hall, all sorts of chaotic scenes inundated his mind.</p>
<p>An illusion array!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was very familiar with such scenes.</p>
<p>An illusion array not only resulted in simple confusion, it could also kill people, trap them to their deaths, or even completely wear down a warrior's will. The terrifying highlight of an illusion array was that even if one struggled to snap out of the illusions or realize that one was stuck in an illusion array, they would still not be able to avoid the effects, eventually failing to extricate themselves from the situation.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, this problem obviously did not exist. He immediately produced his Sword of the Will from his soul sea.</p>
<p>Kacha! The world in front of him shattered completely. Before the illusions even appeared, they were already diced into fragments.</p>
<p>Having cultivated in the Primordial Space for eighteen years, Yi Yun's mental mind had already undergone a transformation. His will had evolved, producing a Sword of the Will. It was not difficult for him to crack an illusion array at all.</p>
<p>However, this was only for Yi Yun. Through that attack, Yi Yun managed to probe the strength of the illusion array as well. He knew very well that if it were any other person, even if it were warriors at Nongyue or Ye Yi's level, they would probably spend quite a bit of time in it.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the assessment was higher than he expected.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun walked out of the palace, and after that, it was a void of nothingness. Immediately following that, the space around him began to cave in towards him. Soon, it formed a long corridor, and at the end of the corridor, there was another large bronze door!</p>
<p>It was almost an identical scene, and Yi Yun immediately understood what had happened.</p>
<p>Demon Defying Bead, Nine Palatial Array!</p>
<p>He must have finished one of the palatial halls, and if he wasn't wrong, there were nine such palatial halls, thus giving it its name.</p>
<p>To complete the array, he needed to go through all nine palatial halls.</p>
<p>Previously, Song Wuchen had mentioned that he himself created the Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen was using an array that he created to test all of the elites present!</p>
<p>If the Nine Palatial Array truly had nine palatial halls, Yi Yun felt that he would be silly to really trudge through each level.</p>
<p>They were both members of the younger generation and Song Wuchen was only an in-name disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord, one that Yi Yun wouldn't have troubles becoming. Did the other nine thousand people, including himself, have to clear level after level of the array formation of Song Wuchen's own creation, according to his wishes?</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not like being staged unless it was an elder of his.</p>
<p>Then, was it possible to crack the Nine Palatial Array in one fell swoop instead of clearing one palatial hall after another?</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun arrived in front of the second palatial hall's door.</p>
<p>The runes on the door were even stronger and more complex than the first.</p>
<p>“Oh? This difficulty… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyebrows pricked up. He reckoned that the second palatial hall's difficulty was 30% higher than the first!</p>
<p>If this trend persisted, the third palatial hall would have its difficulty rise by another 30%, and by the ninth palatial hall, the difficulty would have increased multifold.</p>
<p>Then, it would not be easy to crack the array formation of the nine palatial halls, even for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Even if he could crack it, it would consume a great deal of energy, time and stamina.</p>
<p>“Finishing the nine palatial halls will probably take a day or two. To think that the first assessment by Song Wuchen would last so long, and that's for me. If the others are experiencing the same difficulty, the number of people that can clear this level will probably be countable with one's fingers, ignoring the time and effort to do so.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the others are experiencing a difficulty different from mine, or does Song Wuchen plan on using one round of assessment to select the in-name disciple?”</p>
<p>As Yi Yun pondered over the matter, he frowned.</p>
<p>He did not wish to waste one or two days of energy and effort to crack Song Wuchen's array formation.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen was just at the Dao Manifestation realm. How profound could an array formation, that he created, be?</p>
<p>Yi Yun had seen the Pure Yang Sword Palace's array formations, the God Advent Tower's array formations, as well as the world created by the long-haired man in the Fey God Stone.</p>
<p>There were so many profound array formations, Dao patterns, and laws that Yi Yun did not have the time to ponder over, so how could it be possible for him to willingly waste time researching Song Wuchen's array formation? Furthermore, if he expended his stamina and became Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple, it would affect his performance when he challenged the right to be Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple.</p>
<p>It was best to crack the array formation once and for all!</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun was in no hurry to enter the second palatial hall. He began to follow the path towards the second door.</p>
<p>On careful thought, with about nine thousand people undertaking the assessment, even if a large number of them were trying to fish in troubled waters, or they were riff-raff that lacked any true strength, the number was still a force to be reckoned with. There were also people like Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue. How could Song Wuchen alone, with his Dao Manifestation realm cultivation level, be able to use an array formation to maintain an assessment for nine thousand people?</p>
<p>Even if Song Wuchen was an array formation master, due to the limitations of his cultivation level and nine thousand people trying to simultaneously crack his array, it would have cracked with a simple prod from everyone! For it not to crack, then it could only be the…</p>
<p>Demon Defying Bead!</p>
<p>Yi Yun finally understood the situation. The Demon Defying Bead was a treasure bestowed to Song Wuchen by Felicitous Rain Lord. Yi Yun was able to use the God Advent Tower to withstand Daoist You Ming's strike, so it was not surprising that Song Wuchen could use the Demon Defying Bead to test nine thousand people with an array formation simultaneously.</p>
<p>“I just need to sever the connection between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead.”</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Yi Yun closed his eyes and he activated his energy vision.</p>
<p>Instantly, the runic patterns around him disappeared. In Yi Yun's vision, there were only the flow trajectories of Origins energy. He began to search the chaotic energy for the energy nodes between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead…</p>
<p>Chapter 963: Destroying Energy Nodes</p>
<p>“Isn't this assessment too difficult? That was just the first level, I've only cleared one palatial hall and I'm already overwhelmed. Could there be nine palatial halls… ?”</p>
<p>Many of the participants were not stupid. By connecting the dots, the Nine Palatial Array's name easily told them that the palatial halls were connected one after another.</p>
<p>The difficulty of their assessment was naturally easier than Yi Yun's, but it was still not easy to pass.</p>
<p>This was an array formation created by Song Wuchen after all. So how could he let all these people easily clear his array?</p>
<p>“The difficulty is too high. Few will definitely pass it. It was said that this array formation was created by Song Wuchen himself. An array formation that tests nine thousand people while being powered by one person is still able to eliminate so many people. Is this the strength of an in-name disciple of a Divine Lord… ?”</p>
<p>Many people had such thoughts in mind and they felt disheartened. The gap between them was too large.</p>
<p>If a Divine Lord's in-name disciple was so powerful, they could forget about becoming a Divine Lord's in-name disciple.</p>
<p>The nine thousand participants were struggling through each palatial palace.</p>
<p>The weaker ones were even stuck in the first palatial hall, with no means of escaping.</p>
<p>The stronger ones had already reached the fourth or fifth palatial hall. Although their energies were greatly drained, they were still struggling to forge ahead.</p>
<p>All of them realized that it was not possible to finish the Nine Palatial Array in a short period of time. They even had to rest midway so they could recover their energy before continuing.</p>
<p>In that case, it was impossible to finish it in less than three or four days.</p>
<p>People like Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue were stronger, but as they were given special treatment by Song Wuchen, they had only reached the third palatial hall. They were not the fastest.</p>
<p>By then, it was nearing dusk outside the Nine Palatial Array. As the sun slowly set, it dyed the sky red, making the surroundings more beautiful and gorgeous.</p>
<p>The palace maids of the Oracle Fey Kingdom were serving exquisite fruits and wine to the Oracle Fey Kingdom's king, Song Wuchen, Tian Xun and others.</p>
<p>These fruits were supreme-grade spirit fruits grown in Brocade Spring Court. They were sweet and delicious, and they were abundant in energy, allowing them to benefit one's cultivation level.</p>
<p>As for the wine, it was brewed from spirit fruits and had a bold flavor, and it could be described as ambrosia.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen plucked a grape as he watched the Demon Defying Bead float mid-air while it enveloped Brocade Spring Court. He began to savor the fruit's flesh that melted the moment it entered his mouth.</p>
<p>Such an assessment gave him a feeling that he was twiddling talented peers around his fingers.</p>
<p>He reveled in such a feeling and he was very pleased with the effects of the Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>“Young master Wuchen, the first round of assessment has already lasted for six hours. How long more will it take?” The Oracle Fey Kingdom's king asked.</p>
<p>“At least three days. If the first person to clear the assessment does it in three days, that person will be extremely talented.”</p>
<p>By saying it in this manner, although it seemed like he was praising the talent of the person that was going to exit the array formation at that time, he was actually praising himself.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, Young master Wuchen is truly a master of arrays. This Nine Palatial Array is truly exquisite.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom's king complimented. He was hoping that as Song Wuchen presided over the assessment, he would spare the disciples of the Oracle Fey Kingdom.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen smiled slightly as he calmly accepted the compliments. He said nonchalantly, “Let's hope that I wasn't being too harsh. I was originally planning that it would be best if about ten to twenty people are able to clear this round of assessment. If I had set the difficulty to be higher, it wouldn't look too good if only seven or eight people came out.”</p>
<p>“Seven or eight people… ” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king gave a dry laugh. If there were so few people, the only people from the Oracle Fey Kingdom that could have any hope were Chi Zhuiyun and Demon Girl. Even Demon Girl might be eliminated.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, in the Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was strolling through the void and in his energy vision, he could clearly see the energy flow between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead.</p>
<p>The Demon Defying Bead was a Divine Lord level treasure after all. With Song Wuchen's cultivation level, he was definitely finding it tough to power the Demon Defying Bead even if he could!</p>
<p>Just like a five or six-year-old child using a hammer as a weapon, although they would be more powerful than a child's fists, it would be extremely demanding when lifting the hammer. If they were not careful, they might even hurt themselves.</p>
<p>Now, Song Wuchen was in such a state. Therefore, the interface between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead was not considered to be perfect. There were several flaws and rough edges!</p>
<p>Yi Yun could clearly discern these with his energy vision.</p>
<p>At the moment, Yi Yun had already traversed through the spatial corridor. He did not even take a step through the second door to the palatial hall.</p>
<p>“Oh? There is an energy node here!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's figure shuttled through the spatial turbulence and suddenly, he came to a stop in front of the void. The void seemed to be normal, but Yi Yun knew that there was a secret behind it.</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun moved his hands like lightning.</p>
<p>With an explosive crack, the void was ripped open by Yi Yun. The energy node, that wasn't very stable to begin with, immediately tore apart!</p>
<p>“The fourth point.” Yi Yun muttered to himself.</p>
<p>He had previously estimated that there were twelve points that connected the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead. When the connections were mostly severed, the Nine Palatial Array would lose most of its power.</p>
<p>This was analogous to two armies fighting at a fortress on top of a cliff. The fortress was impregnable, but if the cliff was destroyed, the fortress on the cliff would be taken down automatically.</p>
<p>“Here, the fifth point!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun took action once again.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>The fifth energy node shattered as the Nine Palatial Array's energy weakened once more.</p>
<p>Following that —</p>
<p>The sixth point! The seventh point!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was destroying an energy node every fifteen minutes, quickly severing the connection between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead.</p>
<p>And this led to the Nine Palatial Array becoming weaker.</p>
<p>Not only was the Nine Palatial Array facing Yi Yun becoming weaker, the nine thousand participants immediately faced such a situation as the energy nodes were shattered!</p>
<p>“Oh? Why does the assessment suddenly feel easier?”</p>
<p>A participant, who had struggled to complete the third palatial hall while feeling exhausted to the point of giving up, suddenly realized that the difficulty of the array formation was decreasing.</p>
<p>This made him catch his breath and revive hope in him. “Is this my imagination?”</p>
<p>He found it quite incredulous until he somehow cleared the fourth hall in a baffling manner. Even he did not know what had happened.</p>
<p>“So that's the case. It was only difficult in the beginning. As long as I survived the first few, it will become easier later on!”</p>
<p>There were many people like this disciple who suddenly realized the drop in difficulty.</p>
<p>“It's becoming easier. The difficulty of the fifth hall was already halved, but the sixth hall is actually easier than the fifth?”</p>
<p>“I feel like I'm about to clear it. Haha, I shouldn't have sold myself short in the past. I'm indeed a genius. Even if I can't compare with a crazy existence like Yi Yun, I'm at least someone in the alliance!” Another participant that was disheartened to the point of giving up regained his confidence.</p>
<p>Chapter 964: Something's not right</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun had completely destroyed the twelfth energy node in the Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>As a result, although the Nine Palatial Array was still in its original state, its strength was greatly reduced without the Demon Defying Bead's support.</p>
<p>And at this moment, Song Wuchen, who was sitting in a palatial hall in the towering tree, felt something amiss.</p>
<p>“The Demon Defying Bead…”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen looked at the Demon Defying Bead and felt troubled.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen had previously claimed that the Demon Defying Bead was a treasure bestowed unto him by the Felicitous Rain Lord. It gave others the impression that the Demon Defying Bead had been given to him, but in fact, Song Wuchen was just an in-name disciple, so how could a treasure at the Divine Lord level be really given to him? It was just lent to him.</p>
<p>The Demon Defying Bead had mental imprints in it that belonged to the Felicitous Rain Lord. In order to control the Demon Defying Bead, Song Wuchen had only recently infused his own mental imprints into the Demon Defying Bead. It was not very stable, and his control of the Demon Defying Bead was extremely weak.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun severing the energy nodes between the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead, his mental imprints had suddenly collapsed. This left him momentarily baffled. He obviously refused to believe that an assessee would deliberately destroy his mental imprint. He believed that it was a result of him being only barely able to control the Demon Defying Bead.</p>
<p>“Young master Wuchen, what's the matter?” The Oracle Fey Kingdom's king asked as he noticed something amiss with Song Wuchen's expression.</p>
<p>“Nothing much,” Song Wuchen said as he waved his hands. “Just a tiny mental imprint in the Demon Defying Bead weakened. In a while, I'll place another few more mental imprints, so as to do a better job in presiding over this assessment.”</p>
<p>How was it possible for Song Wuchen to tell others that his mental imprints had collapsed? He had done it at such a large scale, so if there were suddenly any problems, wouldn't he be embarrassing himself?</p>
<p>“I see. Young master Wuchen has been controlling a treasure at the Divine Lord level, so it's only normal for the mental imprint to weaken after a period of time.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said with a smile. He knew how to read the cues from the countenance of others.</p>
<p>Placing additional mental imprints in the Demon Defying Bead was not an easy task. Song Wuchen began producing dozens of seals, but only a tiny number of his mental imprints managed to seep in.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the difficulty of the Nine Palatial Array had turned nearly trivial in the Demon Defying Bead. With about nine thousand people attempting an array formation created by a Dao Manifestation realm warrior, there was already not enough strength for the array formation itself!</p>
<p>Instantly, all the participants in the assessment felt energized. They gathered all their energy and began forging ahead. Many people even began running.</p>
<p>One palatial hall after another was left behind them.</p>
<p>“So it's a psychological battle. The beginning is very difficult, but once it's cleared, the later stages become trivial.”</p>
<p>A participant was very pleased with his performance.</p>
<p>“I made my first public appearance after intense training, but Master said that I'm too weak and that Chi Zhuiyun is many times stronger than me. He thought that I would suffer a setback if I were to be eliminated from the beginning. Ha! I already said it was impossible for me to be eliminated from the beginning. I really should let Master have a look at this. It's already the eighth hall. I'm indeed a genius. The trial is without any obstacle!” A young man confidently muttered to himself.</p>
<p>In the vast world, there were all sorts of people. Although Chi Zhuiyun was publicly considered the number one genius of the Oracle Fey Kingdom, it did not mean that every young warrior was convinced of his strength. There were always people who believed that they were the strongest and that they would be able to trample on Chi Zhuiyun once they made their public appearance. Now, with the ease of clearing the array improving, they were convinced of their viewpoints.</p>
<p>Soon, quite a number of people reached the ninth palatial hall.</p>
<p>They initially believed that as the last hall of the Nine Palatial Halls, there would be some difficulty to it, but they were surprised to realize that the ninth hall was the easiest!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At this moment, the Oracle Fey Kingdom king was eating spirit fruits outside the Nine Palatial Array as he looked at Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>“Young master Wuchen, there's no need to rush the mental imprint. The assessment has only gone on for eight hours.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said deliberately when he noticed that Song Wuchen was struggling to condense mental imprints.</p>
<p>“It's fine.” Song Wuchen frowned. After his mental imprint collapsed, he did not know what was happening inside the Demon Defying Bead as well. However, he believed that the Nine Palatial Array was interfaced with the Demon Defying Bead, so even if certain nodes were not stable, the twelve nodes combined would reduce any possibility of error. It was likely that the assessment would continue on as expected.</p>
<p>“In a while, when a new mental imprint is established, I'll definitely increase the difficulty greatly and make those fellows suffer.”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen secretly thought to himself as he wished to vent the anger in his heart. He knew that Felicitous Rain Lord was most likely watching the in-name disciple recruitment with his perception. As the owner of the Demon Defying Bead, Felicitous Rain Lord definitely knew about the mental imprint collapsing in the Demon Defying Bead.</p>
<p>This would affect Felicitous Rain Lord's impression of him!</p>
<p>As an in-name disciple for so many years, he had always been yearning to be promoted to a personal disciple. If he failed to run the assessment properly, how could he be promoted to a personal disciple?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen took a deep breath and said, “Eight hours isn't too short either. It's better that I recreate imprints. The first assessment would last about three to five days. I cannot let the assessment period exceed my control.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, Young master Wuchen is truly a serious person. By saying that, I'm truly worried, afraid that my Oracle Fey Kingdom's disciples will have terrible results!” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king joked. And at this moment, the hovering Demon Defying Bead suddenly emitted a faint beam of light.</p>
<p>“Oh? What happened?”</p>
<p>In Brocade Spring Court, many people saw this scene.</p>
<p>“Could it be that someone has cleared the array?”</p>
<p>“How can it be possible!? Didn't you hear what Young master Wuchen say? It's extremely difficult to clear the Nine Palatial Array and it would take at least three days before the first participant will clear it!”</p>
<p>“It might be Yi Yun or Chi Zhuiyun since it might be possible for them to clear it ahead of time…” A disciple whispered.</p>
<p>And at that moment, Feng Zheng and Feng Qi were in the crowd as well. Upon hearing the person's statement, they sneered, “Chi Zhuiyun? Yi Yun? Hmph, with their strength, they are only relatively stronger in the alliance. Amongst Master's disciples, they are nothing at all! They are facing an increased difficulty in the Nine Palatial Array. It would be Senior Brother going easy on them if they can successfully clear it in five days. Clear it ahead of time? Stop dreaming!”</p>
<p>Feng Zheng and Feng Qi detested Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun, to begin with. Upon hearing someone tout the two of them, they could not help but pass off snide remarks.</p>
<p>When people heard this, they were stunned. So it turned out that Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun were facing higher difficulties?</p>
<p>Before they could say anything, the flickering light from the Demon Defying Bead suddenly grew more intense.</p>
<p>“Oh? That is…” Feng Zheng and Feng Qi were puzzled as well. They did not notice that up in the hall in the towering tree, there was an extremely ugly expression on Song Wuchen's face.</p>
<p>Swish!</p>
<p>A beam of light burst down from the Demon Defying Bead as a figure appeared!</p>
<p>The person wore a long robe and held a three-foot-long sword. His black hair was fluttering in the beam of light, making him look distinguished.</p>
<p>The first person to clear the Demon Defying Bead had appeared!</p>
<p>Feng Zheng and Feng Qi were immediately left dumbfounded. It had only been eight hours, so how could it be possible!?</p>
<p>Chapter 965: Hidden Geniuses</p>
<p>Feng Zheng and Feng Qi had seen Song Wuchen's Nine Palatial Array. It was absolutely impossible to clear it in such a short period of time!</p>
<p>However, the other members of the audience did not care about this.</p>
<p>“Someone cleared! He cleared it so fast!”</p>
<p>“What a genius!”</p>
<p>People shouted excitedly. However, as these people were shouting, there were even more people who were dumbfounded. They looked at the long-haired youth that had suddenly appeared, and the first thing on their minds was — who the heck is he?</p>
<p>There were many geniuses in the alliance, but not every one of them were known by everyone like Yi Yun or Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Nearly no one knew who the person that had appeared was.</p>
<p>“Hmph! You don't know him? I'm not afraid to tell you that he is my sworn brother! At a young age, he showed unparalleled talent. Later on, he went deep into the mountains and became the disciple of an erudite master. He remained unseen for years, and his strength is definitely top in the Oracle Fey Kingdom. It's beyond your imaginations!”</p>
<p>At this moment, a youth jumped out and said those words. He looked like he was a strutting rooster after a victory.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the fellow who came out to posture in a daze.</p>
<p>Now, who was this guy?</p>
<p>The guy was wearing a tiny hat and his clothes were beast hides. There was a family clan emblem that no one knew about on his clothes. It was obvious that he came from some tiny tribal clan from some nook and cranny.</p>
<p>How could such a person like that know a 'top' genius of the Oracle Fey Kingdom?</p>
<p>Everyone found it unbelievable.</p>
<p>However, it was not uncommon for some peerless geniuses to have friends at the grassroots level in his youth. It was common to have legends of how a peerless hero would stand up for his friends that were being bullied in his youth.</p>
<p>But at that moment, another beam of light flashed and another person who cleared the assessment appeared!</p>
<p>The person looked even more handsome. He was dressed in white robes and he held a fan in his hand. He was even slowly flapping his fan. Although he had cleared the Nine Palatial Array, he looked energetic and clear-minded. He did not look drained at all, and he gave off an impressive vibe.</p>
<p>“Another passed, and it was done so easily.”</p>
<p>“It is another unfamiliar face. However, it seems like he's also from the Oracle Fey Kingdom. I never knew that we had so many hidden geniuses in the Oracle Fey Kingdom!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. It seems like these people had remained hidden and do not like to compete for fame and wealth. But now, with Felicitous Rain Lord taking in a disciple, it's truly a rare opportunity, so all of them are beginning to make their appearances.”</p>
<p>A few scions argued and at that moment, they saw another few beams of light flash. Three consecutive people appeared in Brocade Spring Court after having cleared the array!</p>
<p>This…</p>
<p>Everyone faltered in shock.</p>
<p>There were really too many hidden geniuses.</p>
<p>However, it was apparent that these people were not from the Oracle Fey Kingdom, so it was expected. The other factions in the alliance were bound to have hidden geniuses as well.</p>
<p>But following that…</p>
<p>Sha! Sha! Sha!</p>
<p>Beams of light flashed one after another like it was raining. In the blink of an eye, there were more than twenty geniuses!</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded when they saw this scene. Who knew that there were so many geniuses in the world. They were truly frogs in the well to believe that the world only had geniuses like Yi Yun, Chi Zhuiyun, and Luo Huo'er. From the looks of it, they were short-sighted. Each era has men of talent, leading in what they did for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! It's Kid Tiger of my Black Tiger Tribal Clan! That kid has extraordinary talent. He could lift a thousand pound rock at the age of three. Today, he has indeed given me a big and pleasant surprise. There is hope for the rise of my Black Tiger Tribal Clan!” A stout old man said with a mighty roar.</p>
<p>He looked extremely excited. As for the 'Kid Tiger' he was referring to, it was a person with a silly look. The fur had yet to shed from his body, making him look like a beast-man. As for being able to lift five hundred pounds at the age of three… that training method sure was simple…</p>
<p>This guy… was also some hidden genius?</p>
<p>Many people looked each other in the eyes. They were somewhat dumbfounded. One really couldn't judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>“Congratulations as well. My White Bear Tribal Clan's Bear Two has succeeded as well. When the younger generation grows up, as fellow tribal brothers, we will march forward hand in hand!” Another stout elder said.</p>
<p>The Bear Two he mentioned was covered in yellow fur, making him have a brotherly resemblance of the person known as 'Kid Tiger'.</p>
<p>A white bear and a black tiger. What the hell? Can you tribal clans name your people in a better manner?</p>
<p>In fact, the White Bear and Black Tiger tribal clans were not completely unknown. They were considered to be two of the bigger tribal clans in the wild tribal clans of the Oracle Fey Kingdom. However, they were incomparable to the large family clans. Everyone believed that people from Fey tribal clans would never be able to catch up to people from large family clans that were situated in the capital. But now, from the looks of it, these tribal clans were not to be underestimated. The probability of them producing geniuses was low, but they had the numbers, so it was also possible for a talent to rise up from a tribal clan.</p>
<p>And following that, beams of light began bursting out one after another. Every light beam revealed a young person who had cleared the array. One after another, they appeared like mushrooms appearing after a rain. There were so many people that it was easy to lose count.</p>
<p>“One, two, three, four… a hundred and eighty-one, a hundred and eighty-two… ” Someone casually counted as he stared with widened eyes.</p>
<p>Wasn't the difficulty of the assessment said to be very high? Wasn't it previously said that the first round of assessments would eliminate 99%? Why did so many people manage to clear the array?</p>
<p>“Two hundred and thirty-six, two hundred and thirty-seven… ”</p>
<p>The headcount was still rising. As people were counting on one side, there would be people descending on the other side like rustling leaves. Those counting failed to keep up with the number of people descending.</p>
<p>Soon, the headcount broke three hundred!</p>
<p>People were astonished. But at that moment, many people felt that something was amiss.</p>
<p>It was said that it would take three days for the first person to clear the assessment, but there were more than three hundred people clearing it in eight hours?</p>
<p>However, there were people immersed in the joy of clearing the assessment, especially the trial-takers themselves. There were relatives and friends who excitedly spoke amongst themselves.</p>
<p>“Brother Bai, you passed as well!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, same to you. Congratulations Brother Yuchi. The last time I met you, I knew that you aren't ordinary.”</p>
<p>“Eh, isn't that Brother Li? It looks like he cleared it as well. Let's go and congratulate him.”</p>
<p>There were no end to such dialogs.</p>
<p>At the moment, the headcount had already exceeded eight hundred!</p>
<p>There was no decrease in the number of beams of light that descended from the Demon Defying Bead. Instead, they were increasing in number to the point of the beams of light forming a contiguous beam that was so blinding that people could not open their eyes.</p>
<p>“What's going on?”</p>
<p>In the hall in the towering tree, many members of the upper echelon were agape. Even if the assessment relaxed in its difficulty, there was no way that everyone would be able to clear the array together, right?</p>
<p>Furthermore, they even saw some wondrous existences amongst the participants who cleared the assessment. The Kid Tiger and Bear Two from before could be ignored, because they saw a ten year old girl. She had two tiny hair stumps on her head and she had shimmering eyes. She looked extremely innocent, with her only missing a cotton candy in her hand to perfect her look.</p>
<p>Although they guessed that the assessment would adjust its difficulty according to the trial-taker's age, it was completely unacceptable that such a harmless young girl could clear the first round.</p>
<p>This was definitely not what a normal assessment should look like.</p>
<p>Many people could not help but look at Song Wuchen. He was the examiner of the first round, and the entire Nine Palatial Array was created by him. They realized that Song Wuchen's face seemed to have grown moss. It could not be any greener.</p>
<p>Because at that moment, there was already more than two thousand people that had cleared the Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>Actually, he knew that there was a problem when the first person came out of the Nine Palatial Array in eight hours.</p>
<p>When his mental imprints collapsed, he was unable to probe the situation inside the Demon Defying Bead. Now, he knew that his mental imprints had not collapsed because it was too tough on him to control the Demon Defying Bead. Instead, something strange had happened to the connection between the array formation and the Demon Defying Bead. This resulted in the collapse of his mental imprints that were not stable to begin with.</p>
<p>What the hell happened?</p>
<p>At that moment, Song Wuchen was like a burning chicken. He wished that he could charge up and block the Demon Defying Bead!</p>
<p>If a few hundred people appeared, he could have brushed the matter aside and increased the difficulty of the next round.</p>
<p>But now, with the numbers quickly approaching four thousand, half of the participants had already cleared the first level. There was bound to be more later.</p>
<p>How could he brush this aside? Felicitous Rain Lord was still watching!</p>
<p>“Damn it! What's going on!”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen clenched his teeth. He had tested his Nine Palatial Array several times!</p>
<p>It was true that he could not control the Demon Defying Bead, but as long as the Nine Palatial Array and the Demon Defying Bead were interfaced, there would not be any problems even if he ignored it. How could the present situation happen?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen did not think of the possibility that the interface was destroyed by someone. He did not believe that anyone had the ability to do so.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Young master Wuchen… ” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king spoke in a probing manner, “There's already more than seven thousand people… Uh… it's over eight thousand. Do you think that we should end the first round of assessment and quickly begin the second round?”</p>
<p>The number of people that participated in the Divine Lord's disciple recruitment numbered about nine thousand people. And previously, Song Wuchen had said that more than 99% would be eliminated and that it would take the first person three days to clear it. He even said that there would be only about ten people who would clear the trial after four or five days, but now, after eight hours, there were already over eight thousand people. Was this still an elimination?</p>
<p>Even if there was, it would probably number in the dozens. How unlucky would they be to be eliminated?</p>
<p>Although the Oracle Fey Kingdom king knew that Song Wuchen was like a volcano ready to explode, he could not help but speak up. This couldn't go on any longer. The people below were already creating a din. Even the silliest person could tell that something was amiss. There was talk going around.</p>
<p>“I know!” Song Wuchen said through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>He had failed miserably during the first round of assessment, so what else could he say!?</p>
<p>“Demon Defying Bead, come!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Song Wuchen managed to barely summon the Demon Defying Bead back using a pathetic new imprint that he placed on it.</p>
<p>With the Demon Defying Bead in hand, he felt the coldness of the Demon Defying Bead. Song Wuchen's face turned extremely surly.</p>
<p>Previously, while presiding over the assessment, he had even fantasized of the tiny hope that his master would give the Demon Defying Bead to him after the assessment. He was adept at array formations, so the Demon Defying Bead would greatly benefit him.</p>
<p>But now, Song Wuchen could only feel a limitless estrangement from the bead in his hand.</p>
<p>Chapter 966: Abnormal Eyes</p>
<p>The feeling of estrangement was a result of the complete destruction of Song Wuchen's mental imprints in the Demon Defying Bead. Now with the Demon Defying Bead in hand, Song Wuchen probed it with his perception. The Demon Defying Bead was not his, so he spent a very long time to figure out what had happened. The twelve energy nodes within had completely shattered!</p>
<p>This…</p>
<p>Song Wuchen was astounded. Every energy node had remaining traces of the energy being destroyed. The feeling felt like it was destroyed by mortal means, but who could have the ability to destroy his energy nodes?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen was incensed. He would definitely make the person pay a heavy price if he knew who had done it!</p>
<p>“Could it be Tian Xun? Or is it Mi Liu?”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's initial suspects were not the disciples that had participated in the assessment, but his fellow martial brothers. Under Felicitous Rain Lord, it was not uncommon for the in-name disciples to have their own conflicts.</p>
<p>It was possible that someone knew that he would be presiding over the assessment and that he wanted to demonstrate his prowess, so the person deliberately sabotaged him?</p>
<p>But on further thought, Felicitous Rain Lord was watching. Who had the ability to pull wool over the Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes and tamper with the assessment?</p>
<p>Was it really a participant that did it?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen found it unbelievable. A group of disciples mostly at the Heaven Ascension realm, or even Dao Manifestation realm, were just riff-raff. None of them had that ability!</p>
<p>At that moment, many people were in a flurry of discussion as they talked about the assessment.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen sat in a seat of honor in the towering tree's hall, but he felt like he was sitting on pins and needles.</p>
<p>He had previously made a boast, but the outcome was disastrous. His face had figuratively swollen.</p>
<p>He cast his eyes across all the disciples that cleared the level before his gaze landed on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“Could it be him? He is only at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, how was he able to crack my array!?”</p>
<p>At the moment, Yi Yun was freely floating in mid-air as he quietly regulated his breathing. The cracking of the array did not consume too much of Yi Yun's energy, as all he needed to do was find the energy nodes and sever them.</p>
<p>After severing the energy nodes, Yi Yun leisurely cleared the remaining eight palatial halls. By the time he came out, most people had already come out. Yi Yun did not stand out when he appeared in the raining beams of light.</p>
<p>Although he was keeping a low profile, there were people who paid him special attention.</p>
<p>“Are you Yi Yun?”</p>
<p>Two stout males appeared in front of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun opened his eyes from his meditation.</p>
<p>The two of them had beast fur covering them. It was not uncommon to have half-beast appearances amongst members of the Fey race.</p>
<p>“I'm Black Tiger, and he's my brother, Bear Two!” One of the men said. Kid Tiger was his nickname in the tribe, and it naturally didn't sound as imposing as Black Tiger when said in a formal setting.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyebrows pricked up. The two had released their aura and they had surging killing intent. They were definitely not here to only greet him.</p>
<p>“Rumors say that you are the number one genius of the Luo clan, but it seems your speed at clearing wasn't that fast either!”</p>
<p>Black Tiger's first words had an aggressive tone.</p>
<p>He and Bear Two were amongst the first few to clear the Nine Palatial Array, so he was obviously feeling very confident.</p>
<p>Although people later believed that something had gone wrong with the Nine Palatial Array, there were no problems with the first few levels after all. By being the first few to come out of the array, it was also a proof of their strength. This made Bear Two and Black Tiger turn smug.</p>
<p>“I heard that you defeated Chi Zhuiyun?” Bear Two said with a low, muffled voice. “Chi Zhuiyun is called the number one genius of the Oracle Fey Kingdom, but it's only a title. Don't think that you have swept through the Oracle Fey Kingdom by simply defeating Chi Zhuiyun!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was amused when he heard Bear Two's words. He knew that many geniuses were proud and they also felt proud of their family clans or factions. They were naturally indignant about the claim that the Oracle Fey Kingdom had been swept clean by Yi Yun alone.</p>
<p>If he had not cracked the Nine Palatial Array, it might have been a problem for the duo to even come out of it. However, the world was large, so there was bound to have people that had an exaggerated opinion of their own abilities. And such kind of people could even be the majority.</p>
<p>“The assessment has only just begun. We will have a chance to compete.” Black Tiger declared his challenge of Yi Yun before he turned and walked away.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Simultaneously, in a floating island outside the royal capital, Felicitous Rain Lord was paying attention to the entire situation. He gave a rare chuckle.</p>
<p>“This young guy is rather interesting!”</p>
<p>As the owner of the Demon Defying Bead, Felicitous Rain Lord naturally saw the entire process of Yi Yun cracking the array.</p>
<p>“Divine Lord, what method did Yi Yun use to crack the array?” Fairy Ningshuang had also seen the entire process. It was true that Song Wuchen's control of the Demon Defying Bead was inadequate, but the energy nodes were still situated in rather hidden spots. However, the twelve energy nodes were still found by Yi Yun and they were all destroyed.</p>
<p>This act astonished Fairy Ningshuang greatly. Even Dao Manifestation perfection realm geniuses had no chance of cracking it, much less a Heaven Ascension realm warrior.</p>
<p>“This child might have some special talent. I can sense that he has very keen senses when it comes to the perception of energy! In Wuchen's array, due to some imperfect initializations, there were residual energy trajectories. Yi Yun followed these energy trajectories precisely and finally reached the energy nodes.”</p>
<p>With Felicitous Rain Lord's cultivation level, he could easily sense the distribution of the energy nodes and the energy trajectories. As such, he understood how Yi Yun had cracked the array.</p>
<p>“For him to have such keen perception of energy, could he be born with abnormal eyes?”</p>
<p>In a martial world, some people possessed special physical traits, such as abnormal eyes. They could see laws and the trajectories of energy.</p>
<p>People who possessed such special traits were extremely few in number, with very few historical records describing them. Even well-read people did not understand much about these people who were born with extraordinary physical traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people with extraordinary traits did not necessarily have martial talent. People who could see flow trajectories of energy might not be able to absorb energy. Their ability to learn and perceive was not necessarily high. These factors caused the extremely few number of people to eventually be lost in the crowd, and vanish in the vestiges of time.</p>
<p>And those with impressive talent and possessed extraordinary traits were truly the blessed children of the heavens. They were particularly rare.</p>
<p>“Divine Lord, if Yi Yun really was born with an abnormal trait, he is truly an extremely rare prodigy considering his martial talent.”</p>
<p>“It's still too early to say. The way he cracked the array is after all but a trick, and not done with his own strength and interpretive perception. I want to see what his limit is, and what his understanding of the Dao is.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord spoke, Shui Ningshuang could clearly tell the look of anticipation in his eyes. It was truly not easy to make Felicitous Rain Lord, who had extremely high standards, reveal such an expression.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At the moment, in the towering tree's hall.</p>
<p>“Young master Wuchen, what do we do now?”</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Kingdom king asked a probing question. He could tell that the assessment had fallen into disarray. Song Wuchen had suffered quite a setback.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the assessment after this demanded a small group of people, with a test of Dao Domain for example. It would require each person to showcase their Dao Domain one after another. But now, with nearly ten thousand people present, it was unknown how long it would take if they all lined up.</p>
<p>Chapter 967: Divine Lord Herb Garden</p>
<p>Upon hearing the Oracle Fey Kingdom king's question, Song Wuchen's heart fell into turmoil.</p>
<p>With things coming to this point, he was already unsure about what to do. The assessment that he had prepared was not suitable for about ten thousand people. Did he have to do another test of the Nine Palatial Array?</p>
<p>Disregarding the fact that he was already too embarrassed to use the Nine Palatial Array again, even if he used it, what would happen if the problem reemerged? He might as well slam his head against a surface till he dies.</p>
<p>Who was it that cracked my Nine Palatial Array? Could it really be the warriors that participated in the assessment, such as… Yi Yun!?</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people had their eyes focused on Song Wuchen. Song Wuchen did not heed the thoughts that these lowly warriors had of him, but… Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>Song Wuchen knew very well that on the floating island, Felicitous Rain Lord could see him. Felicitous Rain Lord was waiting to see what he would do, making him even more anxious as his palms broke out in sweat. Without the support of the Demon Defying Bead, he did not have any arrays that could test ten thousand people at once.</p>
<p>The only option that he had was to send everyone to the desolate plains and group them together in a battle royale. However, that was a simple and crude. Furthermore, it would not be a fair assessment. It would obviously not please the Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>At that moment, a rustling sound was heard.</p>
<p>Like misty rain that drifted past, a misty drizzle enveloped the towering tree's hall. A white-dressed female appeared above the square.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang!</p>
<p>The person most trusted by Felicitous Rain Lord after she began following him tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>“Martial Aunt Ningshuang… ”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen hurriedly stood up and saluted her. Song Wuchen felt nervous upon seeing her at that moment. It was obvious that Shui Ningshuang was displeased with the assessment that he presided over.</p>
<p>“The next assessment's topic shall be given by me!” Shui Ningshuang said.</p>
<p>Her words caused Song Wuchen's heart to sink.</p>
<p>He gaped but eventually, he did not say a word.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang was giving the next topic that was going to be assessed?</p>
<p>Many warriors who were present looked at Shui Ningshuang, and her gaze had unintentionally landed on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was inconspicuous with about ten thousand warriors present, so although the others did not know that Shui Ningshuang was focusing on Yi Yun, Yi Yun himself knew.</p>
<p>He stroked his chin. He knew that the process of him cracking the array had mostly likely been seen by Shui Ningshuang.</p>
<p>He was not afraid that the secret of the Purple Crystal would be exposed. The Purple Crystal far exceeded the martial realms of this world. No one would be able to detect it.</p>
<p>If they could not detect the Purple Crystal, then everything would come down to Yi Yun himself.</p>
<p>Since he wanted to become a personal disciple, he definitely needed to show the extraordinary worth of himself. There was no reason to continue hiding his strength.</p>
<p>“Since the first round is as such, everyone can be considered to have passed. As for the second round… ”</p>
<p>As Shui Ningshuang spoke, she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>A faint light tore through the void after it shot out from Shui Ningshuang's fingertip. It accelerated before becoming a big door.</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>The door landed on the ground and it stood in front of everyone.</p>
<p>The door was hundreds of feet wide, and more than ten stories high. It was massive.</p>
<p>People could see the misty rain inside the door. There were mountains that could be barely made out through the rain, with lush grass and an endless sea of flowers.</p>
<p>A door that led to another world!</p>
<p>“This is the Door of Misty Rain. It's a Divine Lord herb garden that I am in charge of. Past the Door of Misty Rain is an independent world. My assessment is for everyone to enter the Door of Misty Rain, and pluck a flower from the ground. Coming out of it again would be considered a pass!”</p>
<p>Divine Lord herb garden?</p>
<p>Plucking flowers?</p>
<p>The warriors present were all extremely excited when they heard this. It was a Divine Lord herb garden!</p>
<p>The thought of being able to enter a Divine Lord's herb garden was invigorating. Furthermore, the details of the assessment were rather fresh!</p>
<p>Plucking flowers inside the Door of Misty Rain sounded extremely simple, but people knew that the assessment set by Shui Ningshuang was definitely not as simple as it sounded on the surface. There was probably some tricks to the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>However, that only made it more interesting. If anyone could complete it, it would be meaningless as well.</p>
<p>“Haha, plucking flowers. May I ask Fairy Ningshuang if simply plucking a flower is a pass, are there other means of grading?” Black Tiger asked loudly.</p>
<p>Previously, the shorter the amount of time taken to clear the Nine Palatial Array, the better the results were.</p>
<p>As for plucking flowers, the Door of Misty Rain was just in front of them. The flowerbeds were not very far either. Charging in to pluck a flower before returning was something that could be completed if one had the ability. The amount that it took wouldn't differ greatly amongst people. It would not illustrate the disparity in his result from others.</p>
<p>“Grading?” Fairy Ningshuang smiled. “The flowers closest to the Door of Misty Rain are known as Seven Heart Flowers. The flower takes a thousand years to sprout, a thousand years to grow, and a thousand years to form its bud. After that, it would grow one additional petal every thousand years, for a total period of ten thousand years. If you can return with a Seven Heart Flower, it would be considered to be a perfect grade. However, even if you fail to pluck a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower, that's fine. Just bringing back a bud would be considered a pass!”</p>
<p>When Fairy Ningshuang said this, everyone looked at the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>Through the blurry mist of rain, people saw flowers on the bed of grass as expected. The number of petals varied.</p>
<p>The ones closest to the Door of Misty Rain were only flower buds, and the deeper it was, the more petals the flowers had.</p>
<p>However, it was already considered quite a number for a flower to bloom four or five petals. Six petals were extremely rare and they were usually in the deepest depths of the misty rain. They would not be seen clearly.</p>
<p>As for the seven-petal flowers, they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Are there seven-petaled flowers?”</p>
<p>Black Tiger craned his neck to take a look. He wanted to find a flower ahead of time so that he could lock onto a target when he entered the Door of Misty Rain and pluck it in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>Even if it was too difficult, preventing him from plucking it, he could bring a five or six petal flower on his way back.</p>
<p>Black Tiger's question made the elders in the towering tree's hall frown.</p>
<p>A legendary figure of the World Margin Sect said, “Although the lifespan of the Seven Heart Flower isn't considered to be long, with it being ten thousand years at most, it is extremely precious. It has gathered the worldly essence, and most Seven Heart Flower would wither before they fully bloomed. The number that can grow to an age of ten thousand years is one in ten thousand. It is a top holy herb, and it has amazing effects for Dao Manifestation realm warriors in their breakthroughs to Dao Palace, as well as Heaven Ascension realm warriors in their breakthroughs to Dao Manifestation.</p>
<p>“Kid, do you think a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower is cabbage that can be found anywhere on the streets? That you can find it without much work!?” The elder grunted, clearly annoyed about a burly man who had little knowledge like Black Tiger.</p>
<p>It was unknown how Black Tiger managed to be at the forefront during the first assessment.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the elder's words, everyone's eyes lit up. Many of the people present were at the Heaven Ascension realm. If a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower was helpful in their manifestation of the Dao, it would be an absolute treasure.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shui Ningshuang said with a smile, “The Seven Heart Flower that you pluck will belong to you, even if it is a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower! Of course, it will depend on your own circumstances if you have one or not.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang's statement made the warriors present excited.</p>
<p>The Seven Heart Flower that they plucked would be theirs!</p>
<p>The value of the herbs in the Divine Lord herb garden was beyond doubt. Furthermore, the World Margin Sect elder had just mentioned the miraculous effects of the Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>Fey like Black Tiger and Bear Two, who came from tribes, were extremely eager. As tribes that were far away from the central cities, they were most lacking in herbal treasures. The Divine Lord herb garden was truly timely.</p>
<p>Chapter 968: Badly Battered</p>
<p>No one expected that Shui Ningshuang's assessment would directly give an opportunity to everyone who was present. Just the thought of entering a Divine Lord's herb garden to pluck herbs was exciting.</p>
<p>About nine thousand warriors impatiently stood in front of the Door of Misty Rain. They were waiting for Shui Ningshuang to give the go ahead.</p>
<p>A look of excitement flashed in Black Tiger's eyes as he prepared himself. At that moment, he noticed Yi Yun, who wasn't standing very far from him. He could not help but reveal a sneer. “Number one genius of the Luo clan? I wonder if your speed will still be as slow as a tortoise.”</p>
<p>“Bro, in a while, we brothers will charge right in front. If I'm not wrong, there is one ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower at most. If we are too slow, there won't be any left!” Bear Two said.</p>
<p>“That's right! However, be careful of any unexpected dangers. The herb garden is most likely not that simple with traps along the way.”</p>
<p>Just as Black Tiger finished speaking, Shui Ningshuang nodded her head slightly and said, “You can begin.”</p>
<p>Charge!</p>
<p>Fighting spirit burned in the eyes of Black Tiger, Bear Two, and many other assessees. They charged out like arrows that left a bowstring!</p>
<p>Everyone knew very well that Fairy Ningshuang's assessment was not that simple. Many of them had activated their Fey race bloodlines, which caused them to shimmer in a divine light. Behind many people were the phantom images of their ancestors. Instantly, Brocade Spring Court looked like thousands of Fey were galloping in a spectacular stampede!</p>
<p>Black Tiger and Bear Two was rushing right in front of the crowd!</p>
<p>But just as they reached the Door of Misty Rain…</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>A loud explosion echoed aro as the duo slammed into an invisible light curtain. The duo's bodies shook violently as they rebounded off the light curtain.</p>
<p>Black Tiger and Bear Two flew backward at a speed much faster than when they were charging at the door. They slammed heavily into the ground!</p>
<p>“Peng! Peng!”</p>
<p>With two dull thuds, the duo crashed into the ground. Their faces faced the sky, but Black Tiger's face was covered in blood. He had been running at full speed and he had protruded his head right in front. It was his face that slammed into the invisible light curtain and so even his nose had been flattened.</p>
<p>As for Bear Two, his condition was worse. He had fractured seven or eight ribs and his body was convulsing as he foamed at his mouth.</p>
<p>After Black Tiger and Bear Two, there were about a hundred more people who slammed into the light curtain just like them. The impacts left them badly battered as they wailed in pain.</p>
<p>It was the ones that had charged slightly slower who managed to slow down when they took warning from the failures of others. They had escaped the outcome of slamming into the wall of light.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, the crowd had already charged forward and were sent flying back, but he did not even take a step forward ever since Fairy Ningshuang declared the start of the assessment.</p>
<p>After a long while, Bear Two and Black Tiger managed to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>They struggled to get up and they could hardly stand straight. Their heads were hurting and they felt dizzy.</p>
<p>“What the heck!?”</p>
<p>“Fuck, we got tricked. To think that there is such a trap set up in the Divine Lord herb garden. The lot of us who were the first to step on the mine suffered a great deal, while those cowards at the back managed to gain an advantage.”</p>
<p>As Black Tiger touched his bloodied face, he noticed that Yi Yun was not far from them. Yi Yun had been standing there all along, like he was an outsider witnessing all that was happening.</p>
<p>Black Tiger and Bear Tiger looked at Yi Yun, and in return, Yi Yun looked at the pair of brothers in trouble.</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not conceal his gaze. The way that he looked at Black Tiger and Bear Two was like he was looking at a a pair of retards.</p>
<p>They only had brawn over brains. They were shallow and ignorant, but they thought highly of themselves, so who else could be blamed?</p>
<p>In fact, Yi Yun had long noticed the thick energy that gathered in front of the Door of Misty Rain with his energy vision. As long as anyone attempted to rush in, the energy would immediately condense together and become as unassailable as divine metal. In addition, the energy light curtain could even reflect energy. It would return how ever much energy was used to slammed into it. This was the reason why many people ended up in such tragic states when they slammed into it.</p>
<p>“That punk!” Black Tiger and Bear Two were furious. They had suffered serious injuries after bouncing back from their charge, but Yi Yun found much amusement in watching them on the side.</p>
<p>“How is it skill to be standing on the side watching? If you have the guts, go on and charge at it. How shameless is he to mock us when he cowers behind like a tortoise!” Black Tiger cursed unhappily.</p>
<p>At that moment, a beam of light flashed. Chi Zhuiyun had walked in front of the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>He was dressed in red and he stood straight in a towering and magnificent manner. All his energy began to gathering on his spear.</p>
<p>“Oh, Chi Zhuiyun?”</p>
<p>Just as everyone was surprised, Chi Zhuiyun suddenly thrust his spear out!</p>
<p>The thrusting of the spear made it seem like hell had descended on the mortal realm. Wraiths wailed as a gigantic Shura devil appeared behind Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>War Demon Form — Shura!</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>With a loud explosion, visible ripples appeared in the void in front of Chi Zhuiyun. The light curtain was reverberating!</p>
<p>Everyone finally realized that it was a pale blue light curtain. It was like a water membrane. And now, Chi Zhuiyun's stab has caused a tear in the curtain of light!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's eyes were focused as his body flashed. He had already entered the light curtain!</p>
<p>At the next moment, he had stepped through the Door of Misty Rain!</p>
<p>“He entered the Divine Lord herb garden!”</p>
<p>Everyone stared with widened eyes. Chi Zhuiyun had managed to use his powerful attack to rip the light curtain apart, allowing him to gain entry through the Door of Misty Rain!</p>
<p>His attack was way too sick!</p>
<p>“I can enter as well!”</p>
<p>In a split second, a small-built Fey sprang out of the crowd. With a machete in hand, he immediately followed Chi Zhuiyun's footsteps.</p>
<p>“Dang!”</p>
<p>He slashed at the light curtain that Chi Zhuiyun had just attacked. He had an ingenious plan. He believed that the part of the light curtain that Chi Zhuiyun had just ripped apart was likely to remain unstable. By attacking the same spot, there was a higher chance of tearing the light curtain open.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>His blade beam was rebounded, slashing straight back at his chest.</p>
<p>'”Puah!”</p>
<p>The small-built warrior spat out a mouthful of blood as he flew backward and crashed heavily into the ground.</p>
<p>He had failed!</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. Chi Zhuiyun had succeeded with a single attack. The guy had attacked the same spot but ended up in such a situation?</p>
<p>“I know him. He is Yuchi Long from the Oracle Fey Kingdom's Yuchi family. He is definitely one of the top figures of the southeastern zone of the Oracle Fey Kingdom, but who knew that the gap between him and Chi Zhuiyun would be so large!?” Someone in the crowd exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>In the Oracle Fey Kingdom, Chi Zhuiyun had made his public appearance a decade ago. Although he was famous, there were very few people who had a chance to really fight with Chi Zhuiyun. Without an actual fight, there was no way to understand Chi Zhuiyun's formidability.</p>
<p>A year ago, Chi Zhuiyun had swept through the Luo clan but was eventually defeated by Yi Yun. This had greatly reduced the halo around Chi Zhuiyun, which also resulted in some members of the Oracle Fey Kingdom thinking that Chi Zhuiyun was just that and nothing more.</p>
<p>But today, they had witnessed and got a deep understanding of how much more inferior the famous Yuchi Long from the southeastern zone was when he was compared to Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, many people could not help but cast their gazes on Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was already so powerful, but he was still defeated by Yi Yun's hand. Then, what was Yi Yun's strength? How strong was he?</p>
<p>Chapter 969: This is my original line of work</p>
<p>After Chi Zhuiyun entered the curtain of light, the bloodied Black Tiger and Bear Two, who had just got up from the ground, gaped. They were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He… went in just like that!?</p>
<p>The scene of Chi Zhuiyun entering the Door of Misty Rain dealt a severe blow to them!</p>
<p>It was obvious that Chi Zhuiyun did not use all his strength in that strike, but he was still able to enter?</p>
<p>If they had only seen Chi Zhuiyun's entry process, they would definitely believe that the light curtain was too weak to withstand a single blow. However, they had previously attempted to charge through the Door of Misty Rain. They were left badly battered, but not a single ripple appeared in the light curtain.</p>
<p>Wasn't the gap just too huge?</p>
<p>Bear Two and Black Tiger suddenly recalled something as they looked at Yi Yun. Yi Yun's back was facing them. He was not looking at them, but even so, the duo felt that their black faces were being consumed by flames.</p>
<p>Didn't this mean that Yi Yun could easily enter the Door of Misty Rain just like Chi Zhuiyun?</p>
<p>In the first round of assessments, they were clearly the first few to exit the array. Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun were one of the last few!</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun has already entered the Door of Misty Rain. Wouldn't that mean that the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower will fall into his hands?”</p>
<p>Many people turned anxious, but there was nothing that they could do.</p>
<p>“What is Yi Yun doing? Why hasn't he made a move?”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun's strength was inferior to Yi Yun's, but he had taken the first step into the herb garden. Yi Yun, who was stronger, had ended up falling behind.</p>
<p>And at that moment, Tianya Haoyue had made his move. With his moonblade in hand, he slashed at the light curtain. As blade beams shot out in every direction, a phenomenon of a cliff and luminous moon appeared behind him</p>
<p>Lunar Occultation!</p>
<p>Cha!</p>
<p>The light curtain looked like it was being swallowed by Tianya Haoyue's strike, just like a lunar eclipse.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Tianya Haoyue had entered the Divine Lord herb garden as well!</p>
<p>Everyone drew a gasp. It was not difficult for Tianya Haoyue to enter the Divine Lord herb garden as well. Were these top geniuses from the various factions so much stronger than them?</p>
<p>And people recalled that geniuses like Tianya Haoyue had been defeated by Yi Yun a year ago!</p>
<p>All the people that Yi Yun had previously defeated were actually so abnormally strong?</p>
<p>After Tianya Haoyue passed through the Door of Misty Rain, he looked back at Yi Yun and flashed the blade in his hand.</p>
<p>After losing to Yi Yun, he had worked hard in the hopes of crushing Yi Yun so he could avenge the humiliation that he had suffered. And now, the opportunity was here!</p>
<p>A ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower could help him condensed his Dao fruit!</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Tianya Haoyue looked into the Divine Lord herb garden. In it, the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was so rich and dense that it condensed to form liquid droplets. This made it look like it was misty and rainy, thus giving the Door of Misty Rain its name. But only when he entered did he know that the so-called misty rain was actually extremely pure Heaven Earth Yuan Qi!</p>
<p>If one were to cultivate in here, the effects would be heaven-defying!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue impatiently used his movement technique and he attempted to head further into the Divine Lord herb garden. However, he realized that it was like he had fallen into a quagmire when he took a step forward. His speed was as slow as a snail's.</p>
<p>It was tough!</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was surprised to discover that although his surroundings had rich Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, he had no means of absorbing any of it!</p>
<p>He opened all 360 acupuncture points, but he was unable to absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. What was wrong with the Yuan Qi here?</p>
<p>The outcome of each step being extremely demanding and Tianya Haoyue not being able to absorb any of the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi around him meant that his stamina was rapidly decreasing!</p>
<p>It was not only limited to Tianya Haoyue. Even Chi Zhuiyun was encountering the same situation. However, he was much stronger than Tianya Haoyue, so it was slightly easier for him to advance.</p>
<p>But even so, it would be extremely difficult for him to enter the depths of the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>“This Door of Misty Rain is truly fascinating.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun saw everything clearly from outside. He was in no hurry to begin because he wanted to observe the mysterious traits of the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>He realized that as an enchanted treasure, the Door of Misty Rain controlled every strand of Heaven Earth Yuan Qi like they were well-trained soldiers. Upon entry into the Door of Misty Rain, it was equivalent to entering a Heaven Earth Yuan Qi quagmire.</p>
<p>This was the difficulty of plucking the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>The location of the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower was too deep, and the Door of Misty Rain was expansive. A great deal of energy was needed to take every step inside, so how easy could it be to find a specific flower?</p>
<p>But such a difficulty made Yi Yun itch to try.</p>
<p>He did not immediately enter the Door of Misty Rain but he looked at Shui Ningshuang instead.</p>
<p>“Senior Ningshuang, this junior has a question and is unsure if he should ask.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang smiled at Yi Yun. Typically, warriors who participated in such an assessment would rush to be right in front, afraid that the best herbs would be snatched by others. However, despite Yi Yun being very strong, he was in no hurry. This made her curious as to what Yi Yun would ask.</p>
<p>“This junior wants to know what happens if this junior happens to come across other precious herbs other than the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower after entering Felicitous Rain Lord's herb garden?”</p>
<p>When Yi Yun asked such a question, it left everyone somewhat dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Anyone could tell that even Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue were finding it extremely difficult to pluck a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower. Even a eight or nine thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower would be difficult enough!</p>
<p>Not only did Yi Yun want a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower, he was planning on plucking a few others in passing!</p>
<p>This is way too ridiculous!</p>
<p>“Oh? You have so much confidence?” Shui Ningshuang gave Yi Yun a surprise glance. She knew that Yi Yun wasn't a simple person, but she refused to believe that Yi Yun could complete such a feat.</p>
<p>A year ago, Shui Ningshuang had seen a projection array of Yi Yun's battle with Chi Zhuiyun. Yi Yun was stronger than Chi Zhuiyun, but he wasn't that much stronger.</p>
<p>“If you have the ability, you can take them away. However, the rule is that you can only take one of every strain!”</p>
<p>Inside the Door of Misty Rain, the herbs were grown in different areas. The same herbal strain was grown in the same vicinity. Since he could only take one of each strain, it meant that Yi Yun had to go very far to pluck the second herb.</p>
<p>Such a difficulty left people secretly horrified, but they never expected Yi Yun to nod and say, “Alright.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang's brows pricked up. “As the saying goes, heroes come from youths, but I need to remind you. The deeper you go into the Door of Misty Rain, the higher the difficulty will be. You must leave sufficient stamina to walk out of the Door of Misty Rain. Do not be overly greedy. If you lack the energy to return, you will only come back empty-handed!”</p>
<p>“Senior, thank you for your advice. I will do my best to choose only herbs that are within my grasps. Actually… herb-picking is my original line of work.” Yi Yun said with a smile.</p>
<p>It had been decades in the blink of an eye. The scenes of his herb-picking days back in the Tai Ah Divine City were still fresh in his mind. Those days were really a cherished memory.</p>
<p>Herb-picking was Yi Yun's original line of work? No one understood what Yi Yun meant, but at that moment, Yi Yun had finally moved towards the front of the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>Chapter 970: Nightmare-like Day</p>
<p>Yi Yun was about to cross the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>After witnessing Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue entry into the Divine Lord's herb garden, no one doubted Yi Yun's strength. The light curtain would definitely be cracked opened by Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Amongst Yi Yun's weapons, be it the broken sword or the 999 flying sabers, they all left a deep impression on others.</p>
<p>Just as people were waiting to see how Yi Yun would crack open the light curtain, Yi Yun walked towards the light curtain empty-handed. He apparently did not plan on using any weapon.</p>
<p>“He wants to crack it with his bare fists?”</p>
<p>People were left astounded. Yi Yun really was never one to take the beaten path.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen felt extremely irritated when he realized that Yi Yun was not using a weapon. His instincts told him that the first assessment was a result of Yi Yun's tampering.</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Kingdom's king also noticed Song Wuchen's change in expression. In fact, his attitude towards Yi Yun was no different from Song Wuchen's. Yi Yun was not a genius of his Oracle Fey Kingdom and Yi Yun had surpassed Chi Zhuiyun, so this obviously made the Oracle Fey Kingdom's king uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“That Yi Yun might have some strength, but he is way too arrogant. He had previously made such a bold statement that he would pick other precious herbs in addition to the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower. Does he really think the Divine Lord's herb garden is his backyard?” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen responded with a heavy expression, “He plans on using his bare hands to rip apart the light curtain, but by doing so, he would definitely expend more energy than if he uses a weapon. Every step in my master's herb garden would expend a great deal of energy upon entry. By trying to eagerly show off his entry, Yi Yun will expend even more energy. However, he doesn't know that when he starts picking herbs, every additional ounce of stamina retained would give him an additional chance of victory!”</p>
<p>Although Song Wuchen had screwed up in the first assessment, he was still an examiner. His evaluation was something many people found reasonable.</p>
<p>“A young man's contention is only to make his presence felt.”</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Kingdom king stroked his beard and echoed Song Wuchen. But before he finished his sentence, his voice got stuck. His perfect smiling expression froze completely on his face.</p>
<p>He watched as Yi Yun simply took a step into the light curtain. As his right foot entered the Door of Misty Rain, a light blue light curtain effused circular ripples. It did not stop Yi Yun's advancement at all.</p>
<p>Following that, Yi Yun's body went through as the ripples in the light curtain increased in size. It was as if Yi Yun had penetrated a water membrane in an extremely natural manner. He was not slowed down at all.</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>Everyone watched astounded. What the heck. Did he know how to walk through walls?</p>
<p>“Did I see wrong? Could Yi Yun's body not be real?”</p>
<p>“Is the light curtain he penetrated the same one we attempted?”</p>
<p>The warriors that had been barred entry nearly popped their eyes out when they saw the scene.</p>
<p>They had used all their strength but they had failed to cross the light curtain. They could only tolerate in silence when Chi Zhuiyun stabbed it open with a strike. After all, Chi Zhuiyun's offensive strength was crazily strong, but now, Yi Yun…simply walked through it!</p>
<p>Was the light curtain Yi Yun that walked through a fake one?</p>
<p>However, the person who had the ugliest expression wasn't any one of the assessees, but Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>He had just made a remark about Yi Yun before such a situation occurred. From the relaxed manner Yi Yun walked through the light curtain, he probably didn't even use any stamina, much less expend his strength!</p>
<p>Today's Divine Lord assessment was nothing but a nightmare for Song Wuchen. Be it the Nine Palatial Array from before or the Door of Misty Rain, his face had been smacked so much that it felt like it was sounding with “Pa Pa” sounds.</p>
<p>“Fuck, there must be something wrong with the light curtain!”</p>
<p>Black Tiger, who had smashed his face in, could not accept the situation. Seeing Yi Yun cross the light curtain, he roared and charged right after Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to slam into the light curtain, Black Tiger had a tiny bit of apprehension and hesitation. However, seeing Yi Yun's back, he wrenched his heart and roared once again, slamming his fist straight at the Door of Misty Rain's light curtain!</p>
<p>Tiger Split!</p>
<p>A black tiger's claw struck the light curtain and immediately following that…</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a loud explosion, Black Tiger's strike bounced back at him, slamming him heavily in the chest. Black Tiger cried out in pain and like a broken bag of blood, he flew back before slamming heavily to the ground once more.</p>
<p>After being inflicted with two rounds of severe injuries, in addition to the mental blow he suffered, Black Tiger almost couldn't climb back up after hitting the ground.</p>
<p>When the assessees present saw Black Tiger's state, they fell silent. As the Felicitous Rain Lord was in the Oracle Fey Kingdom, most of the warriors that came to participate in the assessment came from the Oracle Fey Kingdom. They did not fully understand Yi Yun, who came from the Luo clan. Now, they finally saw the gap between them and Yi Yun. It was something that made them lack the courage to even chase after him.</p>
<p>And at that moment in the crowd…</p>
<p>“Whew! Whew!”</p>
<p>Two consecutive beams of light flashed. One of them was thin and had pale skin, giving him a sinister look. Another one was short and fat but looked harmless in nature.</p>
<p>The two of them had made their move almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>The light curtain cracked as a large gap opened. The two of them entered the Divine Lord's herb garden.</p>
<p>“Oh? Those two?”</p>
<p>Many people were astounded. The duo were unknowns. In the alliance's six factions, amongst each faction's top disciples, other than Tianya Haoyue and Chi Zhuiyun, Luo Huo'er, Princess White Fox, Goddess Xi Ye, did not participate in the in-name disciple assessment. They chose to stay in their respective factions.</p>
<p>Other than those people, who else had the strength to easily crack open the light curtain with a simple strike? They were no weaker compared to Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>“Could they be Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples?”</p>
<p>Many people had such guesses but when they looked at Fairy Ningshuang, they noticed her frowning slightly. From the looks of it, the duo was not Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciples.</p>
<p>Not far from Fairy Ningshuang, Elder Shi noticed the minor change in expression on Fairy Ningshuang's face. He inquired, “Fairy, could it be that you know the two?”</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang said, “No, but I have a guess of their origins. They are not from the alliance's six factions. It might be a place that Master has some connections with…”</p>
<p>The Divine Lord's recruitment of disciples was not limited only to the alliance, so it was not unusual to have outsiders.</p>
<p>“Some connections with Felicitous Rain Lord?” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king exclaimed gently. The duo's talent was definitely extraordinary, but their origins were unknown.</p>
<p>However, Shui Ningshuang did not seem to have any intentions of speaking further. In fact, she even seemed displeased with the duo's origins, so the Oracle Fey Kingdom king found it impolite to inquire further.</p>
<p>After the fat and thin youths entered the Door of Misty Rain, they followed at an adequate pace behind Yi Yun. From the looks of it, they did not wish to vie with Yi Yun. Their appearance was unexpected because no one had noticed the duo prior to this, but due to the Door of Misty Rain's selection, they suddenly stood out.</p>
<p>These made the assessees bemoan their inadequacies. The Door of Misty Rain was separated by a thin light curtain, but it seemed to separate them into two distinct worlds.</p>
<p>“The Door of Misty Rain is an assessment that reveals the gap. Just this alone has eliminated more than nine thousand people, leaving only five people behind!”</p>
<p>Chapter 971: Luck is also a form of strength.</p>
<p>The immense difficulty needed to simply become a Divine Lord's in-name disciple caused many people to give up any hope. The gap was too large, so there was no need to persist on the venture.</p>
<p>At the moment that Yi Yun entered the Divine Lord herb garden, he felt like he was walking at the bottom of the ocean. The surrounding Yuan Qi ocean surrounded him with immense pressure — a pressure that would constantly deplete a great deal of stamina for the warriors who entered.</p>
<p>“This Divine Lord herb garden is an array in itself. The array is powered by the Door of Misty Rain, and it is several times more powerful than the Demon Defying Bead from before.” Yi Yun muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The Door of Misty Rain was a treasure that was of a much higher grade than the Demon Defying Bead. Furthermore, there was no doubt that the array formation in the Door of Misty Rain was established by Felicitous Rain Lord personally. It was a night and day difference when compared to Song Wuchen's Nine Palatial Array.</p>
<p>Through the array's augmentation, the Yuan Qi in the Door of Misty Rain had already coalesced as a whole. It was impossible for Yi Yun to use his own strength to destroy it because his cultivation level was too low.</p>
<p>Even if Yi Yun fully powered the Purple Crystal, he could absorb a bit of Yuan Qi from his immediate surroundings at best. But by doing so, it would make Felicitous Rain Lord suspicious. After all, with Yi Yun's cultivation level, it would be too amazing if he could withstand an array formation that Felicitous Rain Lord had personally set up.</p>
<p>After passing through the Door of Misty Rain, Yi Yun had decided not to resist the Yuan Qi pressure in it. All he did was act as a conduit to guide and mediate the Yuan Qi.</p>
<p>With his acute perception of energy structure, Yi Yun was like a fish swimming in the Yuan Qi ocean.</p>
<p>Although his stamina was being depleted, it was not at a staggering rate.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue, who had entered the Divine Lord herb garden before Yi Yun, were also seizing the opportunity to look for herbs.</p>
<p>“A Seven Heart Flower that has just germinated… It is only a thousand years old… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not stop as he passed many Seven Heart Flowers. The flowers were located very close to the Door of Misty Rain, but even for the people who didn't manage to enter the Door of Misty Rain, their initial targets were definitely not these flowers.</p>
<p>In the expansive herb garden, the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flowers were hidden in the deep depths of the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>As time passed, the warriors that gave up attempting entry into the Door of Misty Rain began to visually follow the few assessees who had entered. Although it was misty in the Door of Misty Rain, they were able to easily follow the assessees' footsteps and see every flower at their feet by using their perception.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yun had nearly caught up to Tianya Haoyue. Although Yi Yun's pace wasn't fast, he still proceeded at a steady pace.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue turned anxious when he noticed that Yi Yun was about to overtake him. With a heart full of indignation, he gathered his energy and sped up.</p>
<p>“It's a four-petal Seven Heart Flower.”</p>
<p>A four-petal Seven Heart Flower was considered to be quite good. It resulted in Tianya Haoyue hesitating slightly when it appeared by his foot. However, he did not bend down to pick it because his ambition was not limited to just that.</p>
<p>However, after passing the four-petal Seven Heart Flower, a number of flowers that he encountered became fewer in number.</p>
<p>The Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was richer the deeper one went into the Divine Lord herb garden, but the herbs turned more sparse.</p>
<p>Many herbs were hidden in the mist that was no ordinary water vapor. Instead, it was condensed from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. In combination with the special Yuan Qi structure, one's perception could not easily penetrate it, so the assessees could only expend their strength to disperse the mist in front of them.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue had some regrets, but he was not worried that he would never find a five-petal Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>At that moment, Tianya Haoyue, Chi Zhuiyun, and Yi Yun had gone in separate directions.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue headed towards the central area where the Seven Heart Flowers were planted. There was a higher likelihood of an aged Seven Heart Flower growing there.</p>
<p>As for the direction Yi Yun chose, it was extremely special. He had deliberately chosen a remote area, which seemed to only become increasingly remote. What Yi Yun's feet encountered were strange and jagged rocks. The number and quality of Seven Heart Flowers dropped drastically.</p>
<p>What was Yi Yun doing?</p>
<p>Many people whispered. Even Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were unsure.</p>
<p>In the remote area, the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi had turned extremely sparse. The mist was not as concentrated as the central areas. Was it possible for there to be an aged Seven Heart Flower here?</p>
<p>“What is that Yi Yun doing? Didn't he declare that he would not only pick a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower, but he would also pick a few other herbs? With his present trajectory, it will be pretty impressive if he manages to find a three-petal Seven Heart Flower,” Song Wuchen said coldly.</p>
<p>Although he was Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, he was not the owner of the Door of Misty Rain. He did not know much more about the Door of Misty Rain than others.</p>
<p>But in fact, Yi Yun could clearly tell through his energy vision that this area was not considered to be a 'remote' area. On the contrary, the reason why the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi appeared thin was because the energy was being extracted through a special method.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At that point in time, the assessment had gone on for half an hour. Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue's energy reserves were beginning to empty themselves. Although they knew that there was a higher chance of finding a top-grade Seven Heart Flower if they ventured deeper, they needed to reserve sufficient energy for them to return to the Door of Misty Rain's entrance. Their best outcome would be to find a Seven Heart Flower with the most number of petals at their current depths. It was not a test of strength, but also luck as well.</p>
<p>At that moment, the searching Chi Zhuiyun happened to move a rock. Dispersing the mist around it, Chi Zhuiyun's eyes lit up when he saw what was behind the rock.</p>
<p>“A six-petal Seven Heart Flower!”</p>
<p>In front of Chi Zhuiyun, there was a foot-high Seven Heart Flower. It looked crystalline and five of its petals had extended fully. The sixth petal was in the midst of its blooming. It could be considered a Seven Heart Flower that was in the interim between its five and six petal stages.</p>
<p>At this depth, five petal Seven Heart Flowers were already extremely few in number, but Chi Zhuiyun had managed to find a quasi-six-petal Seven Heart Flower!</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun had definitely done especially well for the Door of Misty Rain assessment.</p>
<p>“Haha, a six-petal Seven Heart Flower. Zhuiyun's luck isn't bad!” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king laughed gleefully. There was no way for him to hide the joy on his face.</p>
<p>“Luck is also a form of strength.” Song Wuchen, who was sitting beside the Oracle Fey Kingdom king, echoed with a smile.</p>
<p>By being the first to enter the Door of Misty Rain and also picking such an aged Seven Heart Flower, there was no doubt that Chi Zhuiyun's results would win Felicitous Rain Lord's appreciation.</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen said those words, he suddenly thought of something as he cast his gaze at Yi Yun. Yi Yun had entered a remote area, where the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was extremely thin. Yi Yun seemed to be blindly searching with no results to speak of.</p>
<p>“Young juniors tend to like having their presence felt, but this time, he might have outsmarted himself.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said as he stroked his beard. Yi Yun was indeed strong, but he was too greedy. Without Chi Zhuiyun's luck, how could he obtain anything?</p>
<p>Song Wuchen and the Oracle Fey Kingdom king began a discussion, but at that moment, Yi Yun arrived in front of a pile of rocks. After wandering around it for a while, he finally chose a point and looked at a rock for a moment. Suddenly with a kick, he sent the rock flying.</p>
<p>“Oh? What the hell is he doing!?”</p>
<p>Upon seeing Yi Yun's action, Song Wuchen nearly felt like cursing. In the Divine Lord herb garden, everyone picked herbs gently. Even moving a rock was done carefully to prevent harm to a possible herb. Although Yi Yun was in a remote area, such a violent and crude action incensed Song Wuchen.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to chide Yi Yun, the words that he had prepared were left stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>He stared with widened eyes as he looked on in disbelief. Underneath the rock that Yi Yun had kicked away, a foot and two-inch-tall Seven Heart Flower bounced up gently. The top of it had a beautiful corolla the size of a fist. It gently swayed from the momentum it gained.</p>
<p>The corolla had six petals fully extended and its seventh petal was in gestation.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a complete six-petal Seven Heart Flower! It was not like the quasi-six-petal that Chi Zhuiyun found.</p>
<p>This…</p>
<p>Song Wuchen stared with widened eyes. As for the Oracle Fey Kingdom king, he had stood up immediately from his seat.</p>
<p>What a joke. Yi Yun managed to find such a perfect six-petal Seven Heart Flower in such a remote area!?</p>
<p>Previously, they had claimed how Chi Zhuiyun's luck was heaven-defying, but when compared to Yi Yun being able to find a six-petal Seven Heart Flower in such a remote area, Chi Zhuiyun's luck could not be considered as anything at all.</p>
<p>“That punk got it! His luck is way too good!” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king said unhappily. It was clear that Chi Zhuiyun was inferior to Yi Yun in the second assessment.</p>
<p>However, before he finished his words, a scene that nearly popped his eyes out unfolded. He watched in disbelief as Yi Yun took a few steps back and kicked the rock that he kicked away back.</p>
<p>The amount of strength that he used was perfect. The rock rolled back to its original spot and perfectly covered the six-petal Seven Heart Flower once again. Without taking a second look, Yi Yun continued on his way, like what he found was not a six-petal Seven Heart Flower, but a weed…</p>
<p>Chapter 972: Reaping the spoils without lifting a finger</p>
<p>What… just happened?</p>
<p>As the crowd watched Yi Yun walk further, with no intention to pick the six-petal Seven Heart Flower, they were left flabbergasted.</p>
<p>To roll a rock away in such a remote area and find a six-petal Seven Heart Flower by chance was already unbelievable, but Yi Yun kicked the rock back and walked away. It rendered the crowd speechless.</p>
<p>Did it mean that… Yi Yun had no interest in the six-petal Seven Heart Flower?</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had previously declared his intentions of picking a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower, the facts were laid out when the assessment began. It was difficult to take even a single step in the Divine Lord herb garden. The spectators already found Yi Yun's discovery of a six-petal Seven Heart Flower amazing, but he still planned on looking for a seven-petal Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>The others spent all day searching, but the flowers that they were overjoyed to find were inferior to what Yi Yun had just discarded. The contrast was disheartening.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yun had continued searching for the next Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>Yi Yun also found it somewhat regretful to abandon a six-petal Seven Heart Flower. Previously, he had only sensed that there was a great deal of pure Heaven Earth Yuan Qi gathered at that spot, but he was unable to tell the quality of the Seven Heart Flower. He could only disperse the mist and take a look. But unfortunately, it was not the seven-petal Seven Heart Flower that Yi Yun wanted to find.</p>
<p>It wasn't true that Yi Yun thought lowly of the six-petal Seven Heart Flower. A herb of that quality was one that Yi Yun would love to have more of. It was best if he could pick a basketful of it and return fully loaded.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun had asked Shui Ningshuang previously and she had said that Yi Yun was only allowed to take one of each herbal strain.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wanted a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower, so he could only abandon a six-petal Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>And when Yi Yun left the area, Tianya Haoyue, who was still quite a distance away from Yi Yun, suddenly turned his gaze over and tried his best to wade towards Yi Yun's area.</p>
<p>His motive could not be any clearer. He wanted the six-petal Seven Heart Flower that Yi Yun had just discarded.</p>
<p>He wanted what Yi Yun didn't!</p>
<p>At that moment, dignity was apparently not as pragmatic as an immediate benefit. Getting a six-petal Seven Heart Flower was most important.</p>
<p>Not only would obtaining a six-petal Seven Heart Flower make his results for the assessment better, it would also aid his condensation of a Dao fruit greatly.</p>
<p>The spectators saw how Tianya Haoyue was like a fish stranded in a mud pool and moving forward bit by bit with great effort.</p>
<p>“That Tianya Haoyue is so shameless!”</p>
<p>“What a good for nothing to pick up something that someone abandoned. Is that even considered an achievement?”</p>
<p>Outside the Door of Misty Rain, there were sounds of protests. The protests came from the Oracle Fey Kingdom and the Luo clan.</p>
<p>The Luo clan clansmen obviously did not wish for the fruit of Yi Yun's labor to be stolen by others. Even if Yi Yun doesn't want it, it's the same. Why should it be given to you?</p>
<p>As for the people from the Oracle Fey Kingdom, they were frustrated that the quasi six-petal Seven Heart Flower that Chi Zhuiyun found through his own efforts would be worse than the one that Tianya Haoyue picked through his shamelessness.</p>
<p>However, despite all the protests, Shui Ningshuang, who was standing in the towering tree's hall, did not say anything. Clearly, she was tacitly allowing the outcome to be counted as results of the assessments.</p>
<p>In fact, Shui Ningshuang had been watching Yi Yun with interest. She was looking forward to Yi Yun giving her even more pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>Others may not know, but as the supervisor of the Door of Misty Rain, Shui Ningshuang obviously knew that the area that Yi Yun was walking in had an array set up specially by Felicitous Rain Lord. In this area, the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was directed down into the ground as nine spirit roots. They were like nine dragons surrounding a pearl, with the herbs in the middle being given the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi that they needed to grow.</p>
<p>And it was because of this reason that made the region appear thin in Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. It had been extracted by the spirit roots.</p>
<p>It was clearly not a coincidence that Yi Yun would come here. He had definitely discovered something.</p>
<p>It was truly interesting.</p>
<p>Since Shui Ningshuang did not stop Tianya Haoyue, it was pointless to grumble any further. They watched helplessly as Tianya Haoyue 'squirmed' in great difficulty towards the remote area. And just as he was about to successfully pick the six-petal Seven Heart Flower, a thin youth suddenly appeared from Tianya Haoyue's side at a much faster speed. It was one of the mysterious youths of the fat and thin duo.</p>
<p>The person walked straight to where the six-petal Seven Heart Flower was and flipped the rock.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Everyone was incensed. The duo had been loitering in front of the Door of Misty Rain's entrance, so no one had paid any attention to them. But now, the thin youth had suddenly appeared to pick the six-petal Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>They did not spend any effort while others were searching, so they had conserved a lot of their stamina. Now, they suddenly jumped out to to get something for the cheap. Such a despicable act was more disgusting than Tianya Haoyue's actions.</p>
<p>“There was really no effort wasted to search for it!” The thin youth muttered to himself as he plucked the Seven Heart Flower.</p>
<p>“Got it. It's really a good herb!” The thin youth said as he looked at Yi Yun. The corners of his mouth curled upwards as a mocking look suffused in his eyes. Could you be any dumber to give a six-petal Seven Heart Flower that you painstakingly found away?</p>
<p>“Thanks!” The thin youth said, causing Yi Yun to turn back and look at the thin youth.</p>
<p>“So, he is taking me for a ride.” Yi Yun stroked his chin. He had looked in the wrong spot and happened to find a six-petal Seven Heart Flower. Since he could not take it away, he could only helplessly leave it in its original spot. But now, not only had someone taken the fruits of his labor, he had been taken as a fool. This displeased Yi Yun.</p>
<p>And at that moment, the fat youth also slowly walked over.</p>
<p>He smiled and with his butt chins, he looked rather kind.</p>
<p>The fat and thin duo began to tail Yi Yun at an appropriate distance. Now, wherever Yi Yun went, they would follow.</p>
<p>It was apparent that after tasting certain benefits, they were clearly just waiting for Yi Yun to find herbs for them to reap the spoils without lifting a finger.</p>
<p>“Fuck, what shameless people!”</p>
<p>Outside the Door of Misty Rain, there were loud protests. It was not even limited to the Luo clan, even people from the other factions in the alliance could not stand seeing this.</p>
<p>“To think that such a precious flower fell into the hands of those two wretches. Feeding it to the dogs would be better!” An agitated Luo clan disciples cursed.</p>
<p>He wished that he could charge inside the Door of Misty Rain and beat the duo brutally.</p>
<p>The duo turned a deaf ear to the invectives and protests outside the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>The fat youth looked at Yi Yun with a beaming smile. Yi Yun had stopped for quite a while.</p>
<p>“Why did you stop? My brother already has a six-petal Seven Heart Flower, but I don't. Why don't you give me the next one that you find?” The fat youth said with a grin.</p>
<p>The tone that he used only tempted others into giving him two hard slaps.</p>
<p>Yi Yun pinched the tip of his nose and said with a smile, “Sure.”</p>
<p>Chapter 973: Origins of the Duo</p>
<p>The fat and thin duo, who had unknown origin, were like wolves as they followed Yi Yun, like they had caught the scent of fresh meat.</p>
<p>People began to realize that although their actions were despicable and shameless, their strength was in no way inferior. Inside the Door of Misty Rain, there was resistance everywhere, but their limbs were nimble and they moved like flowing water. It was like they were accustomed to the environment in the Door of Misty Rain, which gave them plenty of energy to spare.</p>
<p>Just this point alone made them stronger than Tianya Haoyue!</p>
<p>“Where did those two people sprout out from?”</p>
<p>Everyone was astonished. Other than the six-country alliance, there were indeed uncountable large factions in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. However, true top geniuses were not easily obtained commodities. If Tianya Haoyue were to leave the six-country alliance and go to another faction, he would definitely be treasured as a talent by the seniors there. However, he turned out to be the worse when placed in the Door of Misty Rain. The fat and thin duo didn't look particularly impressive, but their talent was actually that high?</p>
<p>Those from the World Margin Sect were the ones who had suffered the greatest setback. The strongest member of their sect's younger generation was so easily surpassed by two random people?</p>
<p>“Fairy Ningshuang, who are those two… ?”</p>
<p>In the towering tree's hall, a internal Elder of the World Margin Sect could not help but ask.</p>
<p>From Fairy Ningshuang's previous expression, it was quite certain that she knew about their origins. The World Margin Sect did not care about it previously, but just moments ago, they had snatched the flower from Tianya Haoyue and they had completely exceeded Tianya Haoyue. He could no longer sit still.</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang frowned slightly as she seemed to recall some unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>People were curious about the fat and thin duo's faction that they originated from. Was it Felicitous Rain Lord's rival? How could disciples of a rival dare to participate in Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple recruitment? Wouldn't it be courting death!?</p>
<p>After a long silence, Fairy Ningshuang said, “I previously noticed their cultivation techniques, so they most likely come from the Immortal Rain Sect. It's Master's sect.”</p>
<p>“Immortal Rain Sect? Felicitous Rain Lord's sect?” Everyone was astonished!</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had never established a sect or Fey country that belonged to him. Could it be that the Immortal Rain Sect was a sect that Felicitous Rain Lord came from before he became a Divine Lord?</p>
<p>“Immortal Rain Sect? Pardon this old man's ignorance, but I have never heard of it.” The World Margin Sect's Elder said.</p>
<p>“The Immortal Rain Sect is a seclusive sect, so it is normal if none of you have heard of it. The Immortal Rain Sect was the sect that Master grew up in. Master is the son of the Immortal Rain Sect's Sect Leader. But now, the Immortal Rain Sect no longer has any ties with Master.”</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang did not plan on speaking much about it. In fact, Felicitous Rain Lord's talent was not considered to be great in his youth. The competition in the Immortal Rain Sect was intense, so even the Immortal Rain Sect's Sect Leader's son would be ostracized if his talent was inadequate.</p>
<p>To be born from a seclusive sect and also be the son of the Sect Leader did not necessarily mean it was a good thing. Mighty martial figures had extremely long lifespans. They had several male offspring and many of the bastard male offspring had no status. Under such circumstances, the familial ties between father and son were extremely lukewarm. If a child did not have talent, their deaths did not mean much.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord never had much feelings for the Immortal Rain Sect, and due to later sequences of events, it caused Felicitous Rain Lord and the Immortal Rain Sect to increasingly become estranged with each other.</p>
<p>As a large sect, the Immortal Rain Sect did things in a cold and ruthless manner. Because of one final matter, it caused the relationship between Felicitous Rain Lord and the Immortal Rain Sect to completely break down. From that moment on, Felicitous Rain Lord had nothing to do with the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>“Oh, so there was such deep origins!” Although Shui Ningshuang did not say much, most of the important figures in the hall had various guesses in their minds.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had began traveling around the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven very early on. It was likely for him to have left the Immortal Rain Sect by then. However, the Immortal Rain Sect probably never expected for Felicitous Rain Lord to slowly mature into a Divine Lord after he severed connections with it!</p>
<p>No matter how powerful the Immortal Rain Sect was, a Divine Lord was definitely an absolute mainstay that they needed. So how could they not regret? Furthermore, Felicitous Rain Lord also had the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon' in his possession!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was already extremely difficult for the Immortal Rain Sect to mend their relations with Felicitous Rain Lord after he became a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>Without needing Shui Ningshuang to elaborate further, people had guesses of what happened later.</p>
<p>The Immortal Rain Sect probably always had the intentions of getting Felicitous Rain Lord back into the Immortal Rain Sect. Unfortunately, how could a proud maverick like Felicitous Rain Lord agree to it?</p>
<p>“No wonder. The news of Felicitous Rain Lord's recruitment of in-name disciples was only proliferated in the alliance. It was unexpected that there would be outsiders coming here. But if it's the Immortal Rain Sect that constantly pays attention to Felicitous Rain Lord, it would not be strange.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom king muttered to himself.</p>
<p>He naturally did not like the fat and thin Immortal Rain Sect disciples. However, the Immortal Rain Sect was the birthplace of Felicitous Rain Lord after all. On account of them raising him in his youth, Felicitous Rain Lord would not negatively deal with the two juniors. However, it was unlikely he would take them in as in-name disciples.</p>
<p>“The Immortal Rain Sect must have cultivated some rain laws. It's no wonder that I find that the two of them can move so freely in the Door of Misty Rain. The environment of the Door of Misty Rain probably suits their cultivation the best.” Another Elder of a large faction said.</p>
<p>“Not only that. They are about to condense their Dao fruits. Their cultivation levels are higher than Yi Yun's!”</p>
<p>They were disciples of a seclusive sect and they specialized in rain laws. Inside the Door of Misty Rain, they were like fish meeting water. Under such circumstances, they had a lot more advantages than Yi Yun!</p>
<p>And now, Yi Yun was searching for the herbs, but they were following him leisurely. They conserved their energy and waited for Yi Yun to turn weary!</p>
<p>They would stroll over briskly and search only when Yi Yun began searching certain spots.</p>
<p>Such actions were really annoying.</p>
<p>Yi Yun obviously could not hear the discussion in the towering tree's hall. Yi Yun did not know about the duo's strength and origins. Without the proper information, Yi Yun was facing quite an adverse situation.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, who were from the Luo clan, felt a little anxious.</p>
<p>“A six-petal Seven Heart Flower is already not bad. Back when he saw it, he should have picked it. Could it be that up to now, Yi Yun still plans to pick a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower?” Elder Shi muttered to himself anxiously.</p>
<p>But as the person involved, Yi Yun remained completely unaware as he continued to search for herbs.</p>
<p>The corners of Song Wuchen's mouth gradually curled up. Although he did not like the fat and thin duo that suddenly appeared, he would be delighted if they were able to cause Yi Yun to suffer a setback.</p>
<p>And at that moment, Yi Yun came to a stop. He stood on the spot for a long period of time.</p>
<p>The region that Yi Yun was standing in did not look special. Beside him, there was a ring of fragmented rock. But beneath Yi Yun's feet, there was a black rock about one meter in diameter. The black rock looked heavy and unremarkable.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's brows pricked up slightly. He was not too concerned because he believed that Yi Yun would leave after a while. However, he never expected Yi Yun to constantly circle the black rock, like he was probing something. Yi Yun had done that for thirty minutes.</p>
<p>Chapter 974: As Powerful as Lightning</p>
<p>In Yi Yun's eyes, the black rock beneath his feet and the area he was standing on were extraordinary.</p>
<p>He had previously detected that the small world inside the Door of Misty Rain was divided into several regions. Every region had a large array underpinning it. And the Seven Heart Flowers were growing in one of those regions.</p>
<p>As for the tiny plot of land beneath his feet, it was where the core of the Seven Heart Flower's array was! And deep underground, there was a terrifying source of energy.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had confirmed that the reason why this area appeared remote and had thin Heaven Earth Yuan Qi was due to the massive energy that was hidden deep underground.</p>
<p>The Heaven Earth Yuan Qi had been condensed into a spirit root, and the nine underground spirit roots were gathered at that point!</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had used an array to seal the spirit roots and the seal was naturally very robust. But in fact, there was always a tiny bit of energy that would escape. As there were massive amounts of energy within the Door of Misty Rain, even a tiny leak was no trifling matter. Under such circumstances, an enchanted artifact had been specially placed at the gathering point of the spirit roots, so as to seal the diffusing underground energy.</p>
<p>This enchanted artifact was the large, black rock. In fact, it was not a black rock, but a huge seal.</p>
<p>And beneath the large seal was a herb!</p>
<p>The herb was extraordinary. It had vast amounts of energy that caused the surrounding space to distort. It created a small, independent isolated space.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's stop here lasted for nearly an hour but he did not seem to have any intention of leaving.</p>
<p>“What's the punk trying to do? Is he deliberately trying to act mysterious?”</p>
<p>Another fifteen minutes passed, but Yi Yun remained at the same spot. The fat and thin Immortal Rain Sect disciples were already running out of patience.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, is it possible that the punk has run out of luck? The six-petal Seven Heart Flower he found from before was just a result of good luck?” Scrawny transmitted his voice to Fatty.</p>
<p>Fatty was still grinning, giving him a kind and amiable look. He shook his head and said, “It can't be a coincidence that the first thing he found in such a remote area was a six-petal Seven Heart Flower. He must have some unique method. As for now…”</p>
<p>A brilliant flash glimmered in Fatty's eyes as he looked at Yi Yun and said, “I know you are waiting for an opportunity to attack the both of us. However, I advise you to hold that thought. If not, your outcome can only be described as tragic.”</p>
<p>“In addition, I'm advising you to withdraw from Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment. This is not something you can encroach on. Be careful about losing your life after being embroiled in it.”</p>
<p>Fatty's second sentence was said with a Yuan Qi voice transmission and it was filled with subtext.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyebrows pricked up. The fatty sounded like he had quite a backing.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun ignored the fatty's background. He couldn't even be bothered because he did things as he pleased. He was not one to abide by the wishes of others.</p>
<p>“Are you saying I'm waiting for an opportunity to attack the both of you? It seems like you think too highly of yourself. Don't you want to try digging for herbs? Then keep waiting.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's voice sounded indolent. But just as he finished his sentence, the Yuan Qi in his body suddenly surged. It was like a lazy lion had suddenly stirred!</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples immediately turned vigilant. They nearly attacked Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But at that moment, all of Yi Yun's energy sank. Open!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The black rock beneath Yi Yun's feet was forcefully moved away by him!</p>
<p>With the black seal released, energy surged out. The tiny sealed space beneath the black seal had also been cracked open by Yi Yun!</p>
<p>A resplendent light that resembled a divine rainbow shone out, dazzling everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>Amid the divine light, a flower about half the height of a human bloomed. It had a large, beaming corolla with seven petals surrounding it. It looked gorgeous.</p>
<p>A ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower!</p>
<p>Everyone was astounded. It was truly a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had nonchalantly found a six-petal Seven Heart Flower previously, and now, he had managed to find a perfect seven-petal ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower!</p>
<p>It was likely that this was the only ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower that resided in the Door of Misty Rain. Yet, it had been found by Yi Yun. How did he do it?</p>
<p>The bold declaration that Yi Yun made about picking a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower had been seen as an overestimation of himself, but he had really accomplished what he had set out to do!</p>
<p>A divine flower brought with it an irrepressible allure as it attracted the eyes of everyone.</p>
<p>It included the two disciples of the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>Their eyes lit up and in them, there was only greed.</p>
<p>“Great! Great! It's really a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower. Haha, you did well!”</p>
<p>Fatty said to Yi Yun. Once he got the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower in his possession, the Dao fruit he condensed would be enhanced. He would be able to gain more resources from the Immortal Rain Sect!</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at Fatty as he revealed a cold smile.</p>
<p>Fatty walked towards Yi Yun as his body began to rumble. “I previously told you that certain things are not meant for you to encroach on. It seems that it didn't get into your mind. Do you think that becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple will allow you to skyrocket? How naive!”</p>
<p>“Didn't you realize? There is only one rule in the herb-picking in the Door of Misty Rain. It is only about bringing the herb out of the Door of Misty Rain, but there is no restriction on the methods.”</p>
<p>“Then, using force to snatch is also permissible!”</p>
<p>Even after Fatty said this, the smile on his face remained. But now, his smile gave people chills.</p>
<p>As Fatty walked towards Yi Yun, Scrawny pulled out a sword from his interspatial ring.</p>
<p>The sword was soft like a poisonous snake's tongue. It was completely blue in color, as though it was immersed in poison. And Scrawny seemed to gave people a sickly feeling, like he was a poisonous snake himself.</p>
<p>Fatty with his tremendous Yuan Qi was accompanied by Scrawny, who had a strange aura and vicious techniques!</p>
<p>The two of them came from a seclusive sect and their cultivation levels were higher than Yi Yun's. Their offensive power was obvious!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, be careful!”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi turned anxious. Even though they knew that Yi Yun's strength was extraordinary, it was impossible for him to withstand the combined attacks of the duo!</p>
<p>Any one of the two could be even stronger than Chi Zhuiyun. And back when Yi Yun defeated Chi Zhuiyun, he had only barely won!</p>
<p>At that moment, Fatty moved!</p>
<p>Although he was fat, his attack was like a tribulation coming down from the heavens. The momentum he had was boundless!</p>
<p>Rain of Annihilation!</p>
<p>At the instant Fatty attacked, dark clouds rolled and shrouded the heaven and earth with endless pouring rain. It was as though a lake had burst in the nine heavens, sending endless water to rain down in torrents!</p>
<p>In the rain water, every drop of rain was imprinted with nomological runes and each drop was tremendously powerful!</p>
<p>Elder Shi's expression changed. This was a supreme technique of the Immortal Rain Sect and its power was not something a Luo clan cultivation technique could compare with! Fatty's strength was extremely formidable. It was not apparent from before, but the moment he made his move, it caused the world to take on another color!</p>
<p>“A seclusive clan's mystic technique is indeed powerful.” Unlike Elder Shi, Song Wuchen's eyes were filled with excitement. The strike would leave Yi Yun severely injured even if he did not die!</p>
<p>And when Fatty used the Rain of Annihilation, Scrawny attacked as well. He slashed out with his sword, causing a blue sword beam to tear through the void. Like a wyrm that rolled in the rain, it charged at Yi Yun!</p>
<p>The combined strength of the duo had a massive stance that seemed indomitable!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's heart tightened when he saw such a terrifying attack. It was not to be underestimated. The fat and thin duo had extraordinary strength. The combined power of their strikes was probably enough to kill any Dao Manifestation realm genius.</p>
<p>Even Yi Yun found it extremely taxing to withstand the combined forces of the duo.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun saw how the blue sword beams and the endless Rain of Annihilation were enveloping him, all of his Yuan Qi surged out. However, the Yuan Qi was not directed at the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples but towards the ground!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Yuan Qi gave a rumbling roar deep underground. That strike of his had stirred the spirit roots in the ground!</p>
<p>Previously, Yi Yun had moved the black seal which loosened the array formation that was suppressing the spirit roots. Now, with a concentrated strike from Yi Yun, together with the Purple Crystal being a conduit, it finally stirred the sleeping nine spirit roots underground!</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The ground shook violently as the land and mountains shook. At the instant the Rain of Annihilation was about to land, the nine spirit root energy underground blasted out like a volcano's eruption!</p>
<p>Although the energy was only a tiny percentage of the overall energy the spirit roots possessed, it was as terrifying as a judgment from heaven!</p>
<p>Such an oppression burst through the Door of Misty Rain and into Brocade Spring Court. The legendary figures from various factions in the towering tree's hall had drastic changes in expression. It was impossible for a junior to have such domineering power!</p>
<p>“Back! Retreat backward!”</p>
<p>All the assessees that were gathered in front of the Door of Misty Rain exclaimed as they retreated backward. Ignoring the attack itself, just the terrifying pressure was something that prevented them from standing in front of the Door of Misty Rain!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Nine twirling dragons ascended into the heavens as they met the Rain of Annihilation and the blue sword beams!</p>
<p>On one side, it was the combined attack of two junior disciples, while on the other side, it was a worldly power that had gathered in the Door of Misty Rain for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years. How could the two sides be compared?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A deafening explosion sounded as if multiple thunderclaps roared in the sky. The blue sword beams shattered immediately, while the Rain of Annihilation was swept clean. The gloomy clouds in the sky were blown away, leaving nothing behind!</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples stared with widened eyes as they found it unbelievable!</p>
<p>What was Yi Yun's attack? How could it be so powerful!? Ignoring the fact that he was only a Heaven Ascension realm junior, even sect Elders would not be able to produce an attack that possessed that much power!</p>
<p>Their assured combined attack was like withered leaves and dead twigs in front of the nine dragons. They were obliterated!</p>
<p>The explosion from the impact happened too quickly. The two were unable to react in time as their bodies were swept away by the tail of one of the dragons!</p>
<p>'”Puah!”</p>
<p>Fatty's body was like a burst blood bag. A large mouthful of blood spewed out of his mouth like a fountain. As for Scrawny, his body was sent flying like a tiny chick. Numerous bones in his body fractured and his body was covered in injuries. His body was mangled and could not be any worse!</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>“Peng!”</p>
<p>With two loud thuds, the two crashed heavily to the ground. Blood splattered on the ground, dyeing the scattered rocks red.</p>
<p>Scrawny heaved in pain while Fatty endured the pain of his bones stabbing into his flesh. He could no longer maintain the smile on his face and instead looked dazedly at the aftershocks of the energy explosion in the sky. His face was filled with an incredulous look.</p>
<p>No, it's impossible. It was impossible for Yi Yun to produce such an attack. What the hell just happened!?</p>
<p>Chapter 975: Take mine, snatching it back again</p>
<p>Outside the Door of Misty Rain, there was silence despite there being tens of thousands of people gathered. One could even hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>The attack was way too terrifying. Even many of the alliance's Elders in the towering tree's hall were startled. They didn't even have the confidence to withstand the strike head on.</p>
<p>“That is definitely not an attack a junior at the Heaven Ascension realm can produce. If I'm not wrong, the nine divine dragons is a worldly power that resides in the Door of Misty Rain itself. It's not Yi Yun's attack!” An Elder in the towering tree's hall said.</p>
<p>Others immediately understood what had happened when he said that.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun had used the Door of Misty Rain's worldly power, it was understandable why it was so terrifying.</p>
<p>However, how did Yi Yun manage to accomplish that?</p>
<p>The Door of Misty Rain was a Divine Lord's enchanted artifact!</p>
<p>Just to see through the hidden worldly power in the Door of Misty Rain was already a herculean task, much less trigger it!</p>
<p>How could Yi Yun have such abilities at the Heaven Ascension realm?</p>
<p>Many people looked at Shui Ningshuang. They could tell that the cold and aloof woman was looking at Yi Yun with uncalm eyes.</p>
<p>No one understood what Yi Yun had done better than her. He had borrowed the momentum of the attack to strike at the Immortal Rain Sect disciples. It was apparent that Yi Yun had discovered the nine dragon spirit roots array hidden deep underground, but it was a miracle for a junior like him to be able to accomplish what he had done.</p>
<p>She felt that she could no longer understand Yi Yun. This was the first time in her long life that a junior could leave such an impression on her!</p>
<p>“If it's the energy contained in the Door of Misty Rain, the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples are considered lucky to have survived.” A sect Elder said as he looked at the ill-lucked fat and thin duo.</p>
<p>“The reason they survived it is because they were not facing the main attack. They were only struck by a sweep of a dragon's tail.” Sitting in a particular corner, Elder Shi explained.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had triggered the explosion from the Door of Misty Rain's worldly power, he was unable to guide the direction of its attack. Therefore, the nine divine dragons charged straight for the firmaments, and a large portion of the energy was wasted. Only a dragon's tail struck the duo, but they were already inflicted with serious injuries from such a simple strike.</p>
<p>“It's good that no one died. If someone had died… the Immortal Rain Sect might not be willing to take things lying down…”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu heaved a sigh of relief. He was still worried about the Immortal Rain Sect. The Luo clan did not have the courage to face up to a large reclusive sect.</p>
<p>Just as Elder Shi was about to echo hims, his eyelids jumped when he saw Yi Yun taking large strides towards Fatty. With a foot, Yi Yun crushed down on Fatty's his chest.</p>
<p>“Bam!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's foot was augmented with strength, so it was a heavy stamp!</p>
<p>Fatty was already seriously injured, so even if he could withstand the heavy impact, his ribs still fractured. His organs were stabbed by the bones fragment, causing blood bubbles to spew out of Fatty's mouth.</p>
<p>“Where's the flower the both of you picked?” Yi Yun asked while his foot rested on Fatty.</p>
<p>Fatty's rotund face twitched. Having come from the Immortal Rain Sect, the figures of the alliance's six factions were only countryside geniuses to him. How could he have ever expected that he would suffer the ruthless beatings from a countryside genius?</p>
<p>“Do…do you know who I am? I come from the Immortal Rain Sect. The faction backing me is one beyond your imagination. It still won't be too late if you immediately beg for mercy. If you attack me again, you will die a miserable death!” Fatty gnashed his teeth as he threatened Yi Yun. He felt like he was a lofty prince that was being beaten by a villager in the countryside. So how could he not be furious?</p>
<p>“Get me to beg for mercy?” Yi Yun laughed. “It's funny how you are threatening me under your present circumstances. You really do know how to spell the word death!”</p>
<p>All of Yi Yun's energy was infused into his foot as he stamped down again!</p>
<p>“Ka-cha!”</p>
<p>The crisp sound of bone fracturing was heard. The ground beneath Fatty's body collapsed as his entire body sank into the ground. His sternum fractured as he was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, the eyelids of the upper echelons in the towering tree's hall twitched.</p>
<p>Fatty's declaration of the Immortal Rain Sect was unable to threaten Yi Yun at all. Yi Yun was truly a ruthless and decisive person.</p>
<p>In fact, Yi Yun had already guessed that the fatty had an impressive background.</p>
<p>He had never heard of the Immortal Rain Sect, but he had a vague guess that it was a faction that surpassed the Luo clan.</p>
<p>It was not the first time Yi Yun offended a faction that far exceeded the scope of his strength. Back when he was in the Fire Cloud State, he had similarly beaten Ran Yu from the Ran family clan as well.</p>
<p>Without any mercy, he took off Fatty's interspatial ring, followed by Scrawny's.</p>
<p>“Cha!”</p>
<p>A Sword of the Will appeared in between Yi Yun's eyebrows before it shattered the mental imprint that the duo had placed on their interspatial rings!</p>
<p>Following that, Yi Yun used his perception to probe the interspatial rings without any obstruction.</p>
<p>To warriors, items in the interspatial ring were considered private. For example, there were cultivation techniques, mystic manuals, charms, etc. There were many things that were used as a trump card to protect their lives. There were some opportunities that they had discovered themselves but were not made public. Some of them were not meant for the eyes of others.</p>
<p>Having an interspatial ring ransacked was an absolute humiliation to warriors.</p>
<p>However, the duo was heavily injured, so they were powerless to stop him. They could only watch helplessly as Yi Yun freely searched the interspatial rings. Their eyes that looked like cracking glass indicated how much they wanted to rip Yi Yun to pieces.</p>
<p>In such a manner, Yi Yun found the six-petal Seven Heart Flower that Scrawny had previously picked. After that, he nonchalantly found a spot that had rather rich Yuan Qi before planting the flower in it.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, everyone outside the Door of Misty Rain was rendered speechless. Yi Yun did not need the six-petal Seven Heart Flower at all. He had taken the six-petal Seven Heart Flower back only to discard it again.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun! I'll remember you!” Fatty said through clenched teeth. His eyes seemed like it was penetrating Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned as killing intent flashed in his heart. He nearly attacked the fatty to finish him, but if he killed the fatty, the Immortal Rain Sect would naturally find fault with him. But if he did not kill the fatty, the fatty would return to Immortal Rain Sect and mobilize his powers to destroy him.</p>
<p>The two outcomes were not too different.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun was pondering over it, a divine beam of light shot into the Door of Misty Rain. It wrapped itself around the fat and thin youths and it sent them out.</p>
<p>The person responsible for the act was Shui Ningshuang.</p>
<p>After being severely injured by Yi Yun, the duo naturally could not leave the Door of Misty Rain using their own strength.</p>
<p>“Pa! Pa!”</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples fell heavily in Brocade Spring Court and were looked at tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>At that moment, the duo even had thoughts of committing suicide.</p>
<p>Revenge!</p>
<p>He definitely wanted revenge!</p>
<p>Fatty roared in his heart. He had never suffered such an outrage his entire life!</p>
<p>Seeing how the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples were on their last breaths, the Oracle Fey Kingdom king was somewhat troubled. After all, this event was being held on his territory, the Oracle Fey Kingdom. He could not leave the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples in the lurch.</p>
<p>Besides, it was the Immortal Rain Sect, so he knew that it was wise not to offend it. He had thoughts of establishing good relations with them, so he hurriedly ordered a courtier to treat the duo's wounds.</p>
<p>While doing all of this, the Oracle Fey Kingdom king looked carefully at Shui Ningshuang's expression. He could not grasp the relationship between Felicitous Rain Lord and the Immortal Rain Sect. He guessed that with the Immortal Rain Sect being Felicitous Rain Lord's birthplace, even their relationship was estranged, it would not be as incompatible as fire and water…</p>
<p>Chapter 976: Returning With Herbs</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples were carried to the towering tree's hall. The Immortal Rain Sect was a lofty existence after all, so the Oracle Fey Kingdom king was not seeking reward. He only wished to act without fault. They were not stingy by using all sorts of good medicine and relics.</p>
<p>The person responsible for the duo's injuries was the Oracle Fey Kingdom's Imperial Perceptor. When he checked the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples' injuries, he was secretly horrified. The duo were in great physical shape and they had very powerful bloodlines. However, they were still heavily injured after being hit by the dragon's tail.</p>
<p>Many of their bones and meridians had been cracked. Curing them needed top healing medicines and treasured relics. The cost would make the Oracle Fey Kingdom feel the pinch.</p>
<p>“That Yi Yun really has endless means. I believed that Yi Yun would definitely suffer greatly when the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples joined forces, but who knew that they would be beaten up into such a state.” An Elder said with a tut.</p>
<p>“Any one of the two aren't any weaker than Yi Yun. They were helpless when Yi Yun conjured the worldly power in the Door of Misty Rain. It caused the battle to be on a completely different level. Back then, even I was unable to expect Yi Yun to have such a countermeasure, much less the duo. It's only normal for them to have suffered.”</p>
<p>Typically, no matter how intricate a junior's techniques were, it would not have been able to fool the eyes of the legendary figures, since they were on a completely different level of insight.</p>
<p>However, about Yi Yun's strike in the Door of Misty Rain, the Elders present questioned if they could be able to withstand the attack without suffering as much if they were in the duo's shoes.</p>
<p>After the Oracle Fey Kingdom endured the heartache of spending all the good medicine on the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples till everything was healed, everyone realized that Yi Yun had yet to exit the Door of Misty Rain!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was the only person left inside the Door of Misty Rain and he was still picking herbs.</p>
<p>They had spent about two hours dealing with the Immortal Rain Sect disciples' injuries, but Yi Yun had remained in the Door of Misty Rain for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>The Yuan Qi pressure inside the Door of Misty Rain was extremely high, but Yi Yun had passed through the Seven Heart Flower plantation region, headed for another herb plantation and picked another herb before coming out.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun's figure was covered in the thick mist and people's perception unable to probe further, there was an hour when Yi Yun had completely disappeared before he appeared in the people's vision.</p>
<p>No one knew what he had picked, but they noticed that at the instant that Yi Yun walked into the mist, Shui Ningshuang's eyebrows pricked up. Her expression had changed slightly as well.</p>
<p>Clearly, it meant that the second herb that Yi Yun picked was not ordinary either.</p>
<p>He had obtained two herbs — a ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower and an unknown herb.</p>
<p>Outside the Door of Misty Rain, many young warriors were watching in envy. To return with treasured herbs in hand and to showcase his formidable strength in front of the six-country alliance and Felicitous Rain Lord, Yi Yun was no doubt the biggest victor at the recruitment event.</p>
<p>After the Door of Misty Rain's test, the number of people that passed could be counted with one's fingers!</p>
<p>The first round's pass rate was nearly 100%, but the second round's elimination rate was nearly 100%. The stark contrast was quite unacceptable to some people.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun walked out of the Door of Misty Rain, the crowd had automatically separated and carved a path out for him. Even Bear Two and Black Tiger, who previously wanted to trample on Yi Yun, had long hidden in a corner and did not dare to utter a single word. The vastness of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven as well as a true genius far exceeded their imaginations.</p>
<p>“Fairy Ningshuang, from this Door of Misty Rain assessment, only a few people have cleared it. About the assessments after this, do you think… ”</p>
<p>In the towering tree's hall, Elder Duanmu spoke. In fact, his intentions were very clear. Although the second assessment had a few people clearing it, anyone who wasn't blind could tell that Yi Yun was far stronger than the rest!</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu believed that with Yi Yun's outstanding performance, it was already certain that Yi Yun would become the ultimate winner. It was meaningless to continue the competition. After all, could Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue pose a threat to Yi Yun?</p>
<p>When Elder Duanmu said those words, even the Oracle Fey Kingdom king was left without being angry, despite feeling rather aggrieved. It was originally Felicitous Rain Lord being indebted to their Imperial Patriarch which resulted in such an event. But in the end, all the benefits were given to Yi Yun from the Luo clan.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang smiled gently. Although she knew the meaning behind Elder Duanmu's words, she did not make any comment on it.</p>
<p>And at that moment, Song Wuchen spoke out. He said with a livid expression, “Does the Senior think that there's no need to compete any further? The Door of Misty Rain's test is not a test of strength. Other than some strength which is needed to gain entrance at the beginning, all it tests is luck and the ability to search for herbs inside the Door of Misty Rain.”</p>
<p>“Yi Yun being able to find two wondrous herbs must have to do with a particularly special ability of his. For example, if he has the myriad nomological eyes that is recorded in the ancient books, he will be able to see through array formations and allow him to easily do such a thing. It's the same thing with the final strike that defeated the Immortal Rain Sect disciples.”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen turned more incensed the more he spoke. After he realized how Yi Yun had stirred the worldly power in the Door of Misty Rain and defeated the Immortal Rain Sect disciples, he was certain that the reason why the Nine Palatial Array had problems was all because of Yi Yun's tampering!</p>
<p>Since Yi Yun could even use a bit of the Door of Misty Rain's array formation, it was obvious that he could easily crack the array Song Wuchen had set up!</p>
<p>Song Wuchen originally believed that this was an opportunity for him to let Felicitous Rain Lord appreciate his performance, but it was destroyed by Yi Yun. This made Song Wuchen hate Yi Yun so much that he wanted to rip him apart.</p>
<p>Now, how could he feel comfortable with Yi Yun standing out heads and above the crowd?</p>
<p>“That's right. Yi Yun's performance in the Door of Misty Rain has nothing much to do with strength.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom, who was beside Song Wuchen, echoed. He still wanted to win a last chance for Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>With the two echoing each other in great harmony, Elder Shi sneered and quipped sarcastically, “I remembered that before the beginning of the assessment, Young Master Wuchen previously said something about the assessment would not be a test of strength? But why has it come to the point where strength is the most important?”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen's expression stiffened when Elder Shi figuratively smacked him in the face right on the spot. He previously knew that Yi Yun's actual combat strength was strong, so he had deliberately not tested actual combat strength, but now he had overturned his own words.</p>
<p>He could only say, “Strength also includes the potential for future development, such as Dao Domains. It is directly correlated to the number and quality of Dao fruits condensed during the Dao Manifestation realm. It is also a measure for a warrior's future development. What Master places the greatest emphasis on is a Dao Domain! If Yi Yun's Dao Domain is mediocre, so what if he is good at herb-picking?”</p>
<p>When Song Wuchen said this, the Oracle Fey Kingdom king turned delighted. Yi Yun had yet to grasp a Dao Domain during his battle with Chi Zhuiyun! And in contrast, Chi Zhuiyun's Dao Domain was his forte!</p>
<p>He stroked his beard and said complacently, “Speaking about Dao Domains, Zhuiyun has made another breakthrough during the past year. He can showcase it to everyone.”</p>
<p>Both sides began to engage in a war of words, but Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi naturally did not have much say when it came to Song Wuchen, who was an examiner. They could only look at Shui Ningshuang.</p>
<p>Shui Ningshuang smiled slightly and said, “There's no need for you to argue any further. Master just sent a voice transmission to me. The assessment will be temporarily halted. In three days time, he will personally come to Brocade Spring Court to preside over the final assessment. The outcome will obviously be decided by Master.”</p>
<p>Chapter 977: Ward of Rain</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was going to personally preside over the final assessment!?</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, everyone was astonished.</p>
<p>As a relatively young Divine Lord, it was hard to determine the limits to Felicitous Rain Lord's strength. To the people present, Felicitous Rain Lord was a mighty figure who could really influence the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, but he was an existence that they were unworthy to look up to.</p>
<p>Now, they had learned that Felicitous Rain Lord was personally presiding over the final assessment, to the point of them being able to see him in person.</p>
<p>The entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven had trillions of living creatures, but a million years might not necessarily be enough to produce a Divine Lord. Everyone was excited when they heard the news!</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone in Brocade Spring Court engaged in a flurry of discussion and they were extremely excited.</p>
<p>“That will be all for today. In three days time, on the same spot, Yi Yun… I look forward to your performance.”</p>
<p>As Shui Ningshuang spoke, she stood up and glanced at Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Immediately, Yi Yun was once again the focus of attention. The glory gained from being valued highly by a Divine Lord was an extremely enviable matter.</p>
<p>Yi Yun bowed towards Shui Ningshuang. With a flick of her sleeves, Shui Ningshuang disappeared like mist clearing itself. Vanishing along with her was the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After Shui Ningshuang left, tens of thousands of people left Brocade Spring Court. With their departure, the news of a Divine Lord personally assessing prospective disciples spread throughout the Oracle Fey Kingdom like a whirlwind. Immediately after that, the news was spread to the other six countries in the alliance through various means of communication.</p>
<p>Everyone guessed that the reason why Felicitous Rain Lord would personally preside over the assessment was a result of Yi Yun's extremely outstanding performance that caught his eye.</p>
<p>Such treatment pushed Yi Yun and the Luo clan's status to brand new heights. In a few days, there were all sorts of visitors that came to visit Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi's temporary residence.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Luo clan clansmen were extremely delighted.</p>
<p>However, there were also people who were jealous. Song Wuchen could deeply sense that his spot as the number one in-name disciple was facing an unprecedented challenge. Once Yi Yun became an in-name disciple, his good days would probably come to an end.</p>
<p>Other than Song Wuchen, the ones who similarly were upset was the fat and thin duo from the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>After the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples were heavily injured by Yi Yun, it was arranged for them to live in one of the Oracle Fey Kingdom's temporary imperial palaces. And on that day, the entire palace was covered in thick vapor, which meant that there was very low visibility.</p>
<p>It was a Ward of Rain!</p>
<p>The fat and thin Immortal Rain Sect disciples were shrouded by the Ward of Rain. Their bodies were covered in the condensation of countless water essence.</p>
<p>Rain could nourish the lands and resuscitate thousands of creatures. It could make the world brim with life. It possessed the power of life and it also had excellent effects when it came to healing.</p>
<p>Many people could see the Ward of Rain that shrouded the temporary palace from their own residences.</p>
<p>Song Wuchen cultivated in the laws of water, so he naturally could tell the skill involved in it. He knew that it was an extremely powerful Water Domain.</p>
<p>“The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples are recuperating in the Ward of Rain? However, the Ward of Rain is way too terrifying. Despite such a distance, I can sense my body's energy being influenced by the ward's suppression. This is definitely not something that someone of the younger generation can produce… ”</p>
<p>As Song Wuchen muttered to himself, he saw that the Ward of Rain lasted for the rest of the day before it gradually weakened.</p>
<p>During this period, the temporary palace exuded a terrifying pressure. It was suffocating and prevented anyone from approaching it.</p>
<p>The mist was completely dispersed only late into the night. In the palace, there was a white-haired elder who had his back facing the fat and thin Immortal Rain Sect disciples. He was dressed in an azure-colored robe and his white eyebrows reached his shoulders, giving him a lofty and reclusive appearance.</p>
<p>“The two of you were sent to be under Felicitous Rain so as to play the role of being liaisons. But the both of you actually got beaten into such a pathetic state by a junior from a small faction? The both of you really can't bear any major responsibilities!” The white-haired elder said coldly.</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples were kneeling on a futon. They were previously injured and were barely breathing, but now, they had mostly recovered from their injuries. They just looked slightly pale.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Ward of Rain was a product of the white-haired elder. He had personally treated the duo's injuries. Heavy injuries that should have taken months to treat were healed in half a day.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Uncle, Junior Brother's and my strength far exceeds that punk's. We were only careless, causing us to fall for the punk's trickery and ended up in such a miserable state. If it's a competition of strength or Dao Domain, we would completely trash Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>“You still have hopes of competing in Dao Domains? Have you forgotten that when you exited the Door of Misty Rain, you came out without a single herb? According to the rules, the two of you have been eliminated during the second round.”</p>
<p>“About that… ” The duo's stared at him with widened eyes as they were unsure about an appropriate response. They had been arrogant before. When they entered the Door of Misty Rain, they did not pick a single low-grade herb. And the only six-petal Seven Heart Flower that they picked had been snatched back by Yi Yun. In the end, they left empty-handed. According to the rules, they had failed the assessment.</p>
<p>“Then, what are we to do… ?”</p>
<p>“What else can you do? When it comes to recruiting of a disciple, the final outcome still depends on Felicitous Rain. The both of you had entered the Door of Misty Rain previously, so it means you have met the mark. As for the assessment on the last day, just participate in it as per normal. I will be there as well!”</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain's status is extraordinary so it's impossible for him to quibble on a trivial matter about the both of you not getting any herbs. It would sully his status.” The elder said lightly. When the two of them heard that the elder would accompany them, they immediately felt relieved.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Uncle, don't worry. Yi Yun might have defeated the two of us in the Door of Misty Rain, but it was not because of his own strength. Regardless of the content of the final assessment, the both of us will definitely wipe the floor!” The two promised with great certainty.</p>
<p>The elder nodded and turned his head with thoughts on his mind. His old but radiant eyes looked far into the distance.</p>
<p>His gaze penetrated the wall and through the deep stretches of space before it landed on a pavilion in the middle of a lake on a floating island.</p>
<p>In the pavilion, Felicitous Rain Lord was dressed in a white robe as he was pondering over a game of Go.</p>
<p>He was holding a black-and-white piece but he did not respond to the gaze that came from afar, despite detecting it. He only continued with his act of placing a piece.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain oh Felicitous Rain, you are still the same… ” The white-haired elder said. It was like he was speaking to Felicitous Rain Lord, but it also seemed like he was muttering to himself. “That trivial matter that happened three hundred thousand years ago has let you bear a grudge to this day. You never understood that compared to a sect or the path to the martial peak, that matter is nothing!”</p>
<p>“You have your pride, but this time, the thing that I brought is something that you can't refuse. You will never be able to escape the massive ship that is the Immortal Rain Sect on your ride to the peak. If you want to pursue the supreme peak of martial arts, how far can you go if you do not cooperate with anyone… ?”</p>
<p>Chapter 978: Shi Changsheng1</p>
<p>Everyone in the Oracle Fey Kingdom was looking forward to the assessment that would happen in three days time.</p>
<p>A Divine Lord would be personally present. It was a grand event that had never happened in the past ten million years in the Oracle Fey Kingdom! Of course, other than the Divine Lord, the young warriors were focusing on another person, Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's stories and feats filled every restaurant in the Oracle Fey Kingdom, such as how he guided the Door of Misty Rain's array formation to defeat the Immortal Rain Sect disciples. Now, he would be personally assessed by Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>The three days passed in a blink of an eye!</p>
<p>The streets that led to Brocade Spring Court were longed packed to the brim.</p>
<p>However, when the excited warriors reached the entrance to Brocade Spring Court, they were informed that Brocade Spring Court was not to be open to the public.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord preferred quietness and there were just too many spectating warriors.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the crowd were stupefied. They could not even get pass the door?</p>
<p>Those who came with great anticipation were left extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>Quite a number of them had rushed here from the factions of the alliance, but Brocade Spring Court was not going to be opened to the public.</p>
<p>And at that moment, a Oracle Fey Kingdom Elder stood up and said, “Everyone, the Oracle Fey Kingdom's king, and Imperial Patriarch have gained special permission from the Divine Lord to set up a projection array for everyone. When the time comes, the scenes of the assessment will be displayed through the projection array. There is no need to turn anxious.”</p>
<p>As the host, the Oracle Fey Kingdom definitely would not offend the people of so many other factions, so it naturally had its arrangements.</p>
<p>Projection array?</p>
<p>Many people were reluctant when they heard this. How could watching a projection array be better than watching in person?</p>
<p>However, on further thought, they knew that the ones who could enter Brocade Spring Court were famous figures in the alliance. If anyone could enter, Brocade Spring Court would probably be overfilled and exceed its capacity.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At that moment, it was strangely quiet in Brocade Spring Court.</p>
<p>An array had been set up in Brocade Spring Court to isolate all external sounds.</p>
<p>In the towering tree's hall, in the highest Star Picking Court in Brocade Spring Court, there were musicians playing music and dancers dancing. The dancers were from either the succubus or water snake race.</p>
<p>Fey race women were proficient at dancing. Some races even seemed to be born to dance. These races were not good at martial arts, but the women from these races were taken in by major large factions. When they danced, their sleeves seemed to fill the sky in a beautiful display of aesthetics.</p>
<p>At that moment, in Star Picking Court, there were people seated who were the most prominent figures in the Oracle Fey Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Kingdom king was only sitting on the third level on the right side. To his left sat an elder in loose yellow robes. He looked somewhat old and his eyes looked torpid. The person was the Oracle Fey Kingdom's Imperial Patriarch, the true supreme person that wielded power in the Oracle Fey Kingdom!</p>
<p>And sitting in a position that corresponded to the Oracle Fey Kingdom king was a beautiful white-dressed woman. She was like an autumn rain, cool and refreshing, but she exuded a coldness that prevented people from approaching her. She was Shui Ningshuang.</p>
<p>And in the middle of Shui Ningshuang and the Oracle Fey Kingdom king sat a middle-aged man. He was dressed in ordinary azure-colored clothes. His aura was converged and he appeared to be simple. His looks were nothing special, but on a careful look, his aura seemed to blend perfectly into the environment. He exuded a sense of returning to one's original roots of simplicity.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this person was a person whose name had spread throughout the alliance. With a single title, he was able to make the Fey Phantasm Sect fear him — Felicitous Rain Lord!</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was sitting in his seat of honor while there was dancing going on below him. The dancers and musicians were carefully selected by the Oracle Fey Kingdom, but Felicitous Rain Lord did not even take a look at them, like he was waiting for something.</p>
<p>“Divine Lord, perhaps we can now begin?” Beside Felicitous Rain Lord, the Oracle Imperial Patriarch asked.</p>
<p>“No hurry.” Felicitous Rain Lord answered lightly as his gaze fell into the distance.</p>
<p>“Oh? Someone else is coming?”</p>
<p>The Oracle Imperial Patriarch thought of something. At that moment, violent spatial fluctuations appeared in the void just inches away from him. Immediately following that, the void was torn apart by a person. The person was a white-haired and browed elder who walked out of the void.</p>
<p>The elder had a stout figure and he was dressed in white robes. On the white robe, there were inked drawings of misty rain that shrouded immortal mountains. In the middle of his eyebrows, there was a faint runic imprint that looked like a raindrop.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, long time no see.” The white-haired elder said.</p>
<p>At the moment he spoke and addressed Felicitous Rain Lord without his title, the Oracle Imperial Patriarch was alarmed. Immediately, he figured out the elder's identity. He must be someone from the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>Only the people from the Immortal Rain Sect could directly address Felicitous Rain Lord without his title. As someone from the place of Felicitous Rain Lord's birth, the elder could very possibly be Felicitous Rain Lord's senior.</p>
<p>Before the elder appeared, the Oracle Imperial Patriarch did not sense anything. The elder's strength was similarly unfathomable.</p>
<p>As for the others, such as Elder Duanmu and company, they too had guessed the elder's identity.</p>
<p>“Old Man Changsheng, how have you been?” Felicitous Rain Lord's expression was deadpan like he was greeting an acquaintance.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng… Was he Shi Changsheng?</p>
<p>The people present had never heard of Old Man Changsheng's name, but the Oracle Imperial Patriarch had traveled around the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven in his youth and he learned a lot about the secrets of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven's reclusive sects.</p>
<p>He had heard about Old Man Changsheng, who was an Elder of the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>He had made a name for himself a long time ago. The Oracle Imperial Patriarch wasn't young either, and he was many years older than Felicitous Rain Lord. However, Shi Changsheng had already become a Supremacy when the Oracle Imperial Patriarch was still a member of the younger generation!</p>
<p>So much time had passed, but the old man was still alive?</p>
<p>The Oracle Imperial Patriarch was astonished. In the warrior's world, one's long lifespan was a proof of one's strength.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's attitude did not seem to anger Old Man Changsheng.</p>
<p>He took a step forward and with a flash in front of everyone, he sat down beside Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“Today is the day for you to recruit a disciple. It's such a big deal that your father is very concerned about it as well.” Old Man Changsheng said.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not react towards the word 'father'. He remained looking indifferent as he said, “Those who should and shouldn't have come have come. Let's begin.”</p>
<p>“Who is Yi Yun?” Old Man Changshang looked at the square in front of Star Picking Court.</p>
<p>The warriors that were participating in the assessment were all standing there.</p>
<p>Old Man Changshang scanned the square before he locked onto a youth.</p>
<p>“Is it him?”</p>
<p>Old Man Changshang grunted lightly. He could sense that Felicitous Rain Lord thought highly of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Once Yi Yun became Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple, Yi Yun could slowly climb up while accompanying Felicitous Rain Lord. It would not be impossible for him to get a chance to gain the private teachings of Felicitous Rain Lord — the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'. How could such a treasured book fall into the hands of a nameless punk who came from the backwater countryside? It naturally had to be obtained by a disciple from the Immortal Rain Sect!</p>
<p>Just as Yi Yun arrived in the square, he felt like he was being stabbed by needles. He looked up and traced the sensation.</p>
<p>The imposing aura that shrouded him was not hidden at all because Yi Yun could sense it clearly.</p>
<p>He looked at the long-browed elder in Star Picking Court.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is that old man?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun frowned. He did not know who the old man was at all. He felt extremely uncomfortable with the old man's aura shrouding him.</p>
<p>1. Changshang means long-lived</p>
<p>Chapter 979: Dao Tapir</p>
<p>The white-browed elder's aura was mighty and boundless. It was like it had merged with the entire heaven and earth. Against the elder's aura, Yi Yun felt that his blood seemed to coagulate. His organs were also suppressed by the aura, as though they could not function as per normal.</p>
<p>“Oh!?” Yi Yun frowned. From the old man's eyes, he could see a look of disregard. “Junior, I presume your name is Yi Yun. I've heard about some of your feats. Many people call you a peerless genius in this tiny six-country alliance, and over time, the praises have made you arrogant to the point of you losing yourself. That is only normal!”</p>
<p>“But in fact, your talent is nothing impressive to me!”</p>
<p>“This time, Felicitous Rain's recruitment of disciples is associated to one of my Immortal Rain Sect's plans. Felicitous Rain is a disciple that left the Immortal Rain Sect after all, so his recruitment of disciples is actually an internal matter of my Immortal Rain Sect! I believe that you must have heard that Felicitous Rain possesses the fragmentary pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'. Don't tell me that you believe that you have the chance of encroaching the supreme treasure of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven with that bit of background and thin foundation of yours? Be careful not to invite fatal danger on yourself!”</p>
<p>“If you are clever, find a chance to withdraw. In that case, I will not pursue the matter of your entrapment that harmed Shifei and Shiping. You will be given plenty of benefits as well! Think about it carefully!”</p>
<p>The white-browed elder's voice transmission was like rolling thunder that exploded in Yi Yun's ears. The extremely mighty sound struck straight at his soul sea, turning Yi Yun's face slightly pale. It was possible that warriors, who did not have a strong enough soul sea, would have their soul seas shattered just from the white-browed elder's voice transmission!</p>
<p>Even Yi Yun felt his soul sea being hurt. He instantly conjured his Sword of the Will and slashed out.</p>
<p>Ka-cha!</p>
<p>In the soul sea, sound waves constantly echoed, but Yi Yun slashed through them with a strike!</p>
<p>As a result, Yi Yun recovered!</p>
<p>He looked at the white-browed elder and was enraged. Someone from the Immortal Rain Sect?</p>
<p>Over the past few days, he had heard Elder Duanmu mention the Immortal Rain Sect. He also knew of its relationship with Felicitous Rain Lord. The Immortal Rain Sect's might was indeed something that the Luo clan could not compare to.</p>
<p>As a legendary figure of the Immortal Rain Sect, the elder had tried to suppress him with his strength. It made Yi Yun strongly rebellious.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Shi Changsheng's attention was no longer on Yi Yun. He only sent a voice transmission and threat before everything came to an end.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shi Changsheng was looking at Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng's exchange and voice transmission with Yi Yun happened in an instant. Many people did not realize that the white-browed elder had done something to Yi Yun, but Felicitous Rain Lord had sensed it.</p>
<p>His face turned gloomy as a cold tone resounded in Shi Changsheng's ears, “Shi Changsheng, this is my territory. If you dare to make another move, my sword will show no mercy.”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's voice transmission was simple. And similarly, it had an imposing pressure to it. Although Old Man Changsheng was much older than Felicitous Rain Lord, he was still no match for Felicitous Rain Lord when it came to power.</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng was not angered by Felicitous Rain Lord's cold words. He said with a loud laugh, “Felicitous Rain, why are you so agitated? I was just testing the junior's mental strength! Why? Does Felicitous Rain think so highly of the punk that you would be so anxious to protect him after a probe from me?” Shi Changsheng said with a teasing tone. The more Felicitous Rain protected Yi Yun, the more animosity Shi Changsheng felt for Yi Yun.</p>
<p>If Yi Yun could only become a good-for-nothing in-name disciple, Shi Changsheng wouldn't have minded him. But he was afraid that Yi Yun was good at currying favor. In addition to Felicitous Rain Lord's appreciation, Yi Yun could slowly climb higher till he became a personal disciple. This was something that Shi Changsheng could not stand for.</p>
<p>Therefore, he threatened Yi Yun from the beginning. A junior, who did not have much of a background, would not dare to offend a large reclusive sect like the Immortal Rain Sect.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not say a word and he only looked coldly at Shi Changsheng. Shi Changsheng was not embarrassed as he said, “Felicitous Rain, I know that you still have your misgivings with the Immortal Rain Sect, but people from my Immortal Rain Sect want to participate in your disciple recruitment. You wouldn't make it difficult for them, right? Everyone can compete fairly. According to what I know, the final round of your assessment is to evaluate the Dao Domain of the disciples present?”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not answer him, but Shi Changsheng did not feel awkward from the silence. He continued with his spiel, “A Dao Domain is the mark of a warrior's perception and potential. I brought Shifei and Shiping this time because they happen to have some attainments when it comes to their Dao Domain!”</p>
<p>“Oh really… ?” Felicitous Rain Lord's tone was flat. At his level of insight, he did not care about the 'attainments' that Shi Changsheng mentioned.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, an evaluation of a Dao Domain requires a Dao Tapir to be accurate. I have a hundred-thousand-year-old Dao Tapir here… ”</p>
<p>“There's no need. I already have a Dao Tapir.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord spoke, he brought a bag the size of a palm out. It was a spirit beast bag that warriors could store spirit beasts after they refined them.</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord opened the spirit beast bag, a black gas drifted out. It eventually formed a shadow mid-air.</p>
<p>Typically, one's impression of a shadow was a projection on the ground or on the walls. In this case, the shadow was as black as ink and it appeared like a two-dimensional plane without any thickness. For such a shadow to appear in mid-air violated the common sense of people.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>People saw the shadow before seeing it move. It transformed into the shape of a beast man, but at the same time, it was still a flat plane.</p>
<p>“This is a Dao Tapir, a type of spatial Fey beast. It looks like it doesn't have any thickness, but in fact, it can devour many things. Legends say that Ancient Fey Dao Tapirs could devour small worlds.”</p>
<p>“However, what a Dao Tapir likes devouring the most is 'Dao'. It can devour large arrays and different artifacts, and from them, it can extract their Dao runes. It can even devour the Dao that warriors have gained insight into!”</p>
<p>“The longer a Dao Tapir lives, the more Dao it will have devoured. And because it has devoured sufficient Dao, it in itself is a treasure. However, Fey beasts like Dao Tapirs are very rare and are very difficult to capture. Our Oracle Fey Kingdom doesn't have a Dao Tapir.”</p>
<p>The person who spoke was the Oracle Imperial Patriarch. In terms of knowledge, the Oracle Imperial Patriarch could be considered the number one person in the alliance.</p>
<p>“Does Felicitous Rain Lord plan on using the Dao Tapir to evaluate the Dao Domain? How is it evaluated?”</p>
<p>“Devouring! Dao Tapirs like to devour 'Dao'. So Dao Domains are not an exception. Warriors who are evaluated will produce their Dao Domain and let the Dao Tapir devour the Dao Domain. If it is devoured, it's considered to be a fail.”</p>
<p>When the Oracle Imperial Patriarch said that, many youths present stared with widened eyes. Dao Domains could be devoured?</p>
<p>A Dao Domain was only a type of domain. It did not have any physical form. It was truly amazing how large and fascinating the world was for it to have a Fey beast that was able to devour Dao Domains.</p>
<p>“Then if the Dao Domain is devoured, would it be gone?” Someone suddenly asked. Without a Dao Domain, was all the Dao previously learned neutered?</p>
<p>Warriors would not only lose a great deal of power, it was also equivalent to ending their practice of martial arts. The setback that one would experience was imaginable!</p>
<p>Chapter 980: Goading</p>
<p>When a warrior in the towering tree's hall asked this question, Shi Changsheng answered him before the Oracle Imperial Patriarch, “For a real Dao Tapir, that is the case. Once the Dao is devoured, it will be gone. For warrior whose Dao is devoured, it is no different to killing him.”</p>
<p>“However, the Dao Tapir in front of you was domestically raised. It has been domesticated for tens of thousands of years, so its wildness has gradually disappeared. Furthermore, the alternate space in its body has been sealed, so there is no threat from it!”</p>
<p>When Shi Changsheng said this, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. If not, the assessment would be too dangerous.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, they could see Shi Changsheng take out another spirit beast bag. He opened it and a darkness with a pale red aura spewed out of it.</p>
<p>The aura began to transform into a dark red shadow mid-air. The shadow made threatening gestures mid-air, like it had a strong desire to attack everything that surrounded it. It even slowly spread towards the Dao Tapir that Felicitous Rain Lord had previously released, like it wanted to devour Felicitous Rain Lord's Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>“That is… ”</p>
<p>Everyone's hearts leaped. Against the dark red shadow, they could feel a chill.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord frowned slightly as he grunted lightly. The sound that he issued landed on the Dao Tapir, and like rolling thunder and lightning, the Dao Tapir was forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Hum Hum Hum…</p>
<p>The Dao Tapir's body trembled violently. It shrunk back at an extremely fast speed, like it was extremely apprehensive towards Felicitous Rain Lord. However, in a few more seconds, it began to emanate a stifling bloodlust aura!</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, what do you think of my Dao Tapir?” Shi Changsheng asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>“It's not yours. It's the Immortal Rain Sect's law-enforcing court's Dao Tapir.”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord could tell the Dao Tapir's origins at a glance.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, Dao Tapirs were extremely rare. Not every powerful sect reared Dao Tapirs. But for the Immortal Rain Sect, they had raised Dao Tapirs for generations. Felicitous Rain Lord was also influenced by the Immortal Rain Sect to have his own Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>As an ancient reclusive sect, the Immortal Rain Sect had heritage that had been passed down for hundreds of millions of years. Its foundation was terrifying and in terms of wealth, Felicitous Rain Lord alone definitely could not compare to the entire Immortal Rain Sect. Therefore, the Helltoothed Dao Tapir that Old Man Changsheng produced was even stronger!</p>
<p>At that moment, the Dao Tapir had formed a thin spectral shadow mid-air. Its jagged shadow looked like the teeth of a razor. It made it looked as sinister as a wraith that came from the depths of hell.</p>
<p>“This is the Helltoothed Dao Tapir that comes from the deep depths of the Sinkhole. Its ferocity has been completely maintained and the alternate world in its body is not sealed. It's completely different to a domesticated Dao Tapir. Dao Domains that it devours would really vanish and the person would be crippled as well!”</p>
<p>“In the Immortal Rain Sect, there are many ways to condense one's Dao Domain. One can use the Helltoothed Dao Tapir to force oneself while one's life is on the line. It's not bad as a means for a breakthrough. In addition, to the law-enforcement court, the Helltoothed Dao Tapir is an excellent device for torture.”</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng leisurely introduced the Dao Tapir. And what he described secretly horrified everyone. Wouldn't the person receiving the punishment be crippled through the use of a Helltoothed Dao Tapir that could really devour one's Dao Domain?</p>
<p>Furthermore, what was the meaning behind him taking out such a Dao Tapir? Did the old man want to replace Felicitous Rain Lord's Dao Tapir and change the standards of the assessment?</p>
<p>Beside Old Man Changsheng, the Oracle Imperial Patriarch frowned slightly. He was not at ease when it was an assessment with such grave danger involved.</p>
<p>“Under equal standards, the difficulty and danger of using a Helltoothed Dao Tapir is greatly enhanced. Shifei and Shiping are from the Immortal Rain Sect, so they have an advantage over you. I believe that in all fairness, Shifei and Shiping can experience the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devourment. As for the others, they can use the ordinary Dao Tapir. What do you think about that?” Old Man Changsheng said with a teasing tone.</p>
<p>Everyone understood what he meant. Although it was said to make the assessment fairer, wasn't it just to show off the Immortal Rain Sect's foundations and its disciples' talent?</p>
<p>On one side, it was a dangerous and feral Helltoothed Dao Tapir, and on the other side, it was an ordinary Dao Tapir. Before the competition even began, the rest would have lost with their handicap!</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, what do you think of my request? It wouldn't be considered bullying the few disciples that you fancy, right?” Shi Changsheng said to Felicitous Rain Lord with a smile.</p>
<p>Although Felicitous Rain Lord was the examiner that decided everything, the way that Shi Changsheng said it was something that no one could refuse.</p>
<p>In fact, Felicitous Rain Lord did not plan on rejecting the proposal. He did not think much about the Helltoothed Dao Tapir that Shi Changsheng had taken out. He said with an extremely calm voice, “Anything.”</p>
<p>“Since Felicitous Rain doesn't have any problems with it, let us begin!”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not care too much about the tiny rules, but to Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue, they felt humiliated. Before they even competed, they were already given a handicap!</p>
<p>Beside Chi Zhuiyun, Shiping and Shifei had proud expressions. “Why? You aren't happy about that?” Fatty looked disdainfully at Chi Zhuiyun, Tianya Haoyue, and Yi Yun. His tone was clearly derisive as he said, “If you aren't happy about it, you can also choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir! No one is stopping you. The only thing is that you might not have the guts to do so!”</p>
<p>He did not hide his words. In the silent Brocade Spring Court, it was easily heard by everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone heard him. Let Chi Zhuiyun, Tianya Haoyue, and Yi Yun choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir?</p>
<p>The Helltoothed Dao Tapir was the Immortal Rain Sect's!</p>
<p>As a torture Fey beast of the law-enforcement court, it was equivalent to being crippled if one's Dao Domain was devoured. Who would dare to attempt it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dao Tapir was something that was reared by the Immortal Rain Sect. People from the Oracle Fey Kingdom had never attempted it before, so they naturally did not have much confidence!</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun, what are you choosing?” Scrawny asked in an aggressive manner.</p>
<p>Seeing Scrawny's look of contempt and provocation, Chi Zhuiyun was enraged. He knew that it was clearly meant to goad him on.</p>
<p>From a young age, Chi Zhuiyun had outstanding talent and he was more courageous than others. When did he ever admit defeat before a fight? Even before his defeat against Yi Yun, he had engaged in a glorious battle!</p>
<p>But today, Chi Zhuiyun knew that if he chose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, it was very likely for him to suffer a great loss. What would seem like a fearless act was just foolhardiness.</p>
<p>Those from the Immortal Rain Sect would also mock him for easily falling for the trick with his simple mind. If he really paid the bitter price and be mocked for being arrogant and overweening, it would eventually be him incurring ridicule on himself.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'. Chi Zhuiyun said with a heavy tone, “My choice doesn't need you to tell me!”</p>
<p>As Chi Zhuiyun said that, he stood in front of the Felicitous Rain Lord's Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>Using his actions to make his choice was a form of displayed weakness, but the Oracle Fey Kingdom king and the Imperial Patriarch heaved a sigh of relief as their faces gave signs of relief.</p>
<p>People who could amount to something could not be foolhardy. Tolerating at times was also necessary.</p>
<p>“Haha!” Seeing Chi Zhuiyun taking such a soft stance, Fatty and Scrawny found it boring. They looked at Tianya Haoyue and Yi Yun, and with a teasing look, one of them said, “What about the two of you? Are you going to be a good-for-nothing like Chi Zhuiyun?”</p>
<p>Chapter 981: Show Some Sincerity</p>
<p>Seeing how Shi Ping and Shi Fei were making things difficult for Yi Yun and company, Shui Ningshuang slightly frowned. She had been following Felicitous Rain Lord for a very long time, so she was aware of the misgivings between Felicitous Rain Lord and the Immortal Rain Sect. Therefore, she did not have a good impression of the Immortal Rain Sect either.</p>
<p>“Divine Lord, why did you agree to Old Man Changsheng's suggestion? He clearly intends on using this opportunity to show off his Immortal Rain Sect. Now, what you have done is completely adhered to his wishes.” Shui Ningshuang sent a voice transmission to Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord chuckled and said, “What's the point of such ostentatious behavior? Even if he succeeds in showing off, so what?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary… don't you think that Yi Yun's reaction towards this matter will be rather interesting?”</p>
<p>“When a warrior roams the 12 Empyrean Heavens, it is very easy for them to encounter tough problems if they lack a sufficient background. For example, how should one deal with the situation when a super faction targets you?”</p>
<p>“Being an enemy of the faction will result in the faction seeking revenge on you. That would be overestimating one's strength. But if one constantly shows tolerance and exercises forbearance, it will result in the other party reaching out for a yard after taking an inch. Not only will one have to suffer in silence and result in an impasse in one's free thoughts, it would also make the other party think that you are weak and easily bullied. Eventually, you will end up being killed.”</p>
<p>“How should one make a choice when facing two difficult alternative paths? This is also a skill in itself.”</p>
<p>“Years ago, when I left the Immortal Rain Sect and went out on my own, I had encountered countless situations such as this. I survived them one after another, and many of them were very close shaves.”</p>
<p>“Today's choice of a Dao Tapir might seem like a trivial matter, but from Yi Yun's response, one can see a lot of things. What do you think Yi Yun will choose?”</p>
<p>“About that… ” Shui Ningshuang was slightly taken aback. She never expected that there were so many intricacies to the matter which Felicitous Rain Lord had thought of when he agreed to the matter.</p>
<p>And Yi Yun's situation was truly a dilemma. If he chose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir and fell for the provocation of the Immortal Rain Sect, he would be mocked as being silly. If he yielded, he would be looked down upon.</p>
<p>When Shui Ningshuang placed herself in Yi Yun's shoes, she realized that there really wasn't any good choices. She could only swallow the insult silently.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is not dumb. It's clearly a trap so he will most likely yield.” Shui Ningshuang said.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord only laughed as he said, “Then let's see. I'm also curious about his response.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Tianya Haoyue, are you done choosing? You are so slow like a woman. If you don't have the guts, quickly admit it!” Scrawny said in a derisive manner.</p>
<p>“Hmph!” Tianya Haoyue grunted coldly, “The Dao Tapir is reared by your Immortal Rain Sect to begin with. You are naturally familiar with it. Do you want to bait me into falling for it? Dream on!” Tianya Haoyue bluntly said some strong words to keep up appearances before standing beside Chi Zhuiyun with a livid expression.</p>
<p>Tianya Haoyue was arrogant, but he was not foolish when it came to a matter that concerned his life.</p>
<p>Next, there was only Yi Yun left!</p>
<p>Fatty had a teasing smile. Yi Yun was the main star of the show.</p>
<p>After trampling on Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue, Fatty found it rather boring. However, Yi Yun was a bastard who had ruthlessly hurt them badly during the second assessment. He was the true target that they wanted to trample on!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, weren't you previously pretty awesome? I want to see what you will be choosing this time. It can't be that you lack the guts, right?”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, what are you saying? Yi Yun's strength is extraordinary. How can he be like the cowardly turtles before him?”</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei echoed each other with words filled with sarcasm. It made Chi Zhuiyun's killing intent boil.</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei turned a blind eye towards Chi Zhuiyun. They were only waiting for Yi Yun to put up a spectacle. They believed that they would see an angry and aggrieved look of having no choice but to concede on Yi Yun's face. However, they were disappointed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stroked his chin and instead, he looked at the duo with an equally teasing look. He had a smile on his face that looked somewhat sinister. It caused the duo to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Punk, what are you smiling for!?” Fatty said with a frown. Yi Yun's smile was like he was looking at a retard.</p>
<p>“I'm laughing at two retards who think highly of themselves. Just this bit of dispute over personal feelings can make you have an orgasm? Aren't the both of you from some reclusive sect? That's all you got?” Yi Yun mocked relentlessly. The duo's face sank as the thin Shi Ping said, “Punk, you are courting death!”</p>
<p>Shi Fei grunted coldly as he said disdainfully, “You are just trying to be stubborn by refusing to admit it. You just don't have the guts. You don't have any right to say that it's a dispute over personal feelings. Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue may be cowards, but they at least dared to admit that they are cowards. You don't even have the guts to do so. What a joke!”</p>
<p>Fatty didn't want to be left speechless from Yi Yun's words so he began to refute him. He too had extremely vicious words.</p>
<p>However, he still did not see any aggrieved look on Yi Yun's face despite such a refute. Yi Yun's expression looked like he had everything under his control and it displeased Fatty greatly.</p>
<p>“You are getting so worked up just like this? Since you are so eager for me to choose, why don't you help me choose one?”</p>
<p>No one expected Yi Yun to kick the ball back at the duo. He was letting Shi Ping and Shi Fei decide for him!</p>
<p>If the duo helped Yi Yun choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, it was equivalent to them admitting that they had intentions of harming Yi Yun.</p>
<p>But so what!?</p>
<p>If Shi Fei and Shi Ping were to be really shameless and told Yi Yun to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, what would Yi Yun do?</p>
<p>In the towering tree's hall, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were both feeling nervous. If the Helltoothed Dao Tapir was chosen, Yi Yun would be facing a Dao Tapir that he had never experienced before. It was extremely dangerous and Yi Yun's Dao Domain did not appear to be extremely powerful. How would he deal with it?</p>
<p>If anything untoward were to happen to Yi Yun, how were they going to answer to the Luo clan?</p>
<p>As Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were feeling worried, they heard Shi Fei said shamelessly, “Junior Brother Yi Yun has outstanding talent. I'm very impressed with him. He will definitely be able to challenge the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. From my point of view, why don't you choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Shi Fei exchanged glances with Shi Ping. They understood each other's thoughts.</p>
<p>The fool actually got us to choose for him. Do you think that we can't stand the shame to get you to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir? What naivety!</p>
<p>“You get me to choose a Helltoothed Dao Tapir, and I have to choose it? Who the hell are you? The both of you are retards without a doubt. If I had a son that begged me like that, I might have listened to him. Are the two of you my sons? I don't think I'll have a son as retarded as the two of you.” Yi Yun mocked ruthlessly. When Shi Ping and Shi Fei heard him, their eyes burned with anger.</p>
<p>They finally realized that Yi Yun had been taking them for fools. If not for the people watching, they would have charged up and fought Yi Yun in battle!</p>
<p>“This is the first time that I've seen a cowardly turtle behave in such a justified and confident manner. If you don't dare to choose, then don't choose it. Stop acting like some machiavellian wolf!”</p>
<p>“That's right. What's the point of saying so much bullshit? Get your ass beside Chi Zhuiyun. The assessment is going to begin soon. Stop wasting time over there.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not mind Shi Ping and Shi Fei's invectives. He said, “To me, there is nothing about daring to do something or not. It only has to do if I wish to do something or not. I do not want to be set up by others to do something. The both of you wanted me to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir and I have to listen to the two of you after you goad me on with a few words? Why should I listen to you?”</p>
<p>“If you want me to choose, sure. Show some sincerity.”</p>
<p>“I previously said that if I had a son and if my son were to ask me to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, I would naturally agree. Although the both of you are rather ugly, I would still reluctantly agree with the both of you if the both of you kneel down and kowtow thrice.”</p>
<p>“Or maybe, the both of you can slap each other in the face three times. Each slap must be augmented with Yuan Qi. And the slap has to be loud enough. It has to be able to reach the towering tree's palace at the very least. Only then will I feel that you have shown sufficient sincerity. I will also agree to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir.”</p>
<p>When Yi Yun said this, everyone present was stunned. No one expected Yi Yun to make such a request.</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei had goaded him on, but Yi Yun had taken them on in a composed manner. To get Shi Ping and Shi Fei to kneel down and kowtow or slap themselves in the face. That was something… no one could have guessed.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the situation, even Shui Ningshuang, who never showed her emotions, could not help but laugh with her mouth covered.</p>
<p>“That Yi Yun is really interesting!”</p>
<p>To accept the arrangements of others was not courage but foolishness. By making a request, one had to pay the price. That was entirely fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Chapter 982: To Slap or not to Slap</p>
<p>“It's indeed very interesting. Yi Yun's words have caught me by surprise as well.” Felicitous Rain Lord said with a chuckle. How Yi Yun resolved the dilemma was obviously ingenious in his eyes. However, there existed a problem. Was he betting that Shi Fei and Shi Ping would not dare to kneel down or slap each other in the face? What if they truly went for broke? Wouldn't Yi Yun end up being irrevocably committed to his taunt?</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone was looking at Shi Fei and Shi Ping. Their expressions were extremely ugly.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's request sounded excessive, but in fact, it wasn't. Getting Yi Yun to choose the Helltoothed Dao Tapir was an act that risked his life. As for them, their kneeling or slapping was only considered a bit of humiliation to their dignity.</p>
<p>Using a bit of humiliation in exchange for the crippling of Yi Yun was a completely reasonable request. If they did not choose to do so, they could not blame Yi Yun for being gutless.</p>
<p>And if that happened, they would miss the best chance to cripple Yi Yun. After all, once Yi Yun became Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple in the future and be greatly appreciated by Felicitous Rain Lord, it would no longer be easy for them to touch Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However…to kneel down and kowtow under the eyes of so many people? Or to slap each other in the face? Furthermore, the slaps had to be loud? How could they lift their heads in the future after experiencing that?</p>
<p>How different would they be from retards?</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei did not want to agree to Yi Yun's request. They could not stand the humiliation under the watchful gazes of everyone.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Old Man Changsheng's Yuan Qi voice transmission rang in Shi Fei and Shi Ping's ears. “This is a very good opportunity. Yi Yun's response might seem ingenious, but it's actually him digging his own grave. As long as you make a tiny sacrifice, he would no longer have any room for retreat. Don't forget the mission the sect gave to you. If you really succeed, your future will be limitless. Do you want to give that up because of a tiny sacrifice?”</p>
<p>“About that…Grandmaster Uncle, but we…”</p>
<p>Shi Fei's fat face was all scrunched up. He felt extremely aggrieved. How could he do it?</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was beaming at Shi Ping and Shi Fei. “Why don't you have the courage to kneel down or slap each other? How dare you goad me on with that bit of guts of yours? I'm not even afraid of a Helltoothed Dao Tapir that leads to unknown outcomes with my life on the line, but you don't even have the guts to do such a trivial matter. From the looks of it, other than knowing how to shoot your mouth, there is nothing else you are good at.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's mockery hit the nail on the head. Shi Ping and Shi Fei's faces immediately turned red. In the towering tree's hall, there were members of the younger generation of the alliance that had begun laughing out loudly.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! Those two retards were so arrogant when they were goading people on. Their arrogance almost gave them wings to fly into the sky. Now, they are shrinking back so cowardly after being goaded on. They can't even pay that tiny bit of price, but they want someone else to face a life-and-death challenge?”</p>
<p>“That's right. If they were not Immortal Rain Sect disciples, and if they were in Yi Yun's shoes, they would probably be pissing themselves if they had to face the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. They sure sounded almighty when they were mocking others, but when it was their turn, they turned terrified!”</p>
<p>The repressed Shi Ping and Shi Fei's anger nearly exploded when they heard the mockery from the crowd and when they saw Yi Yun's retard-watching gaze.</p>
<p>Was Yi Yun sick of living? They had previously learned that Yi Yun had yet to gain insights into a Dao Domain a year ago. After a year, how strong could his Dao Domain be? Against the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, it would be nothing!</p>
<p>They originally believed that Yi Yun was actually afraid that they would go for broke, but they never expected Yi Yun to deliberately provoke them. He was playing with fire!</p>
<p>With the mission delegated to them by the sect and with Yi Yun's courting of death, they would accede to his wishes!</p>
<p>Let's risk it!</p>
<p>Shi Fei clenched his teeth and like a sudden clap of thunder which left no time for one to cover one's ears, he faced the scrawny Shi Ping standing beside him and began —</p>
<p>“Pa! Pa! Pa!”</p>
<p>His fat palm gave Shi Ping three consecutive slaps, with each louder than the other. The crisp sound of the slapping echoed in Brocade Spring Court. Shi Ping failed to react in time and was left startled by Shi Fei's three consecutive tight slaps.</p>
<p>There was silence. The both sides of Shi Ping's face had been smacked red. It had a burning sensation, and by the time Shi Ping snapped out of it, he looked at fatty Shi Fei in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you…”</p>
<p>“What?” The fat-faced Shi Fei stared at him with squinted eyes.</p>
<p>“No…nothing…”</p>
<p>Shi Ping could do nothing about it, but he could not tolerate what had happened to him. With nowhere to vent his anger, he fell silent for a moment. Suddenly, he clenched his teeth and suddenly swung his palm and smacked Shi Fei three times!</p>
<p>The three slaps were returned. As Shi Fei's fat face was filled with blood vessels, it immediately turned blue-black.</p>
<p>The six slaps were delivered!</p>
<p>Immediately, the duo's face looked like it was a dye shop. In addition with their ugly expressions, it looked as though their faces had been grubbed by a hundred pigs.</p>
<p>That scene left everyone astounded!</p>
<p>And the scene had been projected through the projection array. Outside Brocade Spring Court, there were millions of people that were unqualified to enter Brocade Spring Court, but they had managed to see such an amazing scene.</p>
<p>They obviously knew of the duo's identity. They were genius disciples from a reclusive sect, the Immortal Rain Sect. Yet, they had to slap each other in the faces because of Yi Yun!</p>
<p>It was too surprising!</p>
<p>“Holy shit, that sure is some explosive stuff!”</p>
<p>“It's really big news. The projection images can be stored. In a few days, it will probably proliferate throughout the alliance of the six countries. Everyone will be able to see Fatty and Scrawny's magnificence.”</p>
<p>After a short moment of shock, everyone began discussing excitedly!</p>
<p>The alliance was feeling repressed by the sudden appearance of the Immortal Rain Sect. But now, they felt elated and relieved seeing the duo shame themselves because of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>However, there were many people who were worried for Yi Yun. Yi Yun's Dao Domain was unlikely to be anything much, so how was he to clear the assessment?</p>
<p>Yi Yun was now looking all high and mighty, but he would be facing the Helltoothed Dao Tapir after that. If he was not careful, he would have to pay a terrible price.</p>
<p>“Your request has been fulfilled. Carry out your promise!”</p>
<p>“Let's see how you can shrink away again!”</p>
<p>Shi Fei and Shi Ping said angrily to Yi Yun. With a tut, Yi Yun said, “So nice of the both of you to hit each other so ruthlessly.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun's mockery, Shi Fei and Shi Ping's faces stiffened. “Cut the crap!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun shook his head and slowly walked in front of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. Yi Yun looked up at the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. It was like a specter that was baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. It spiraled in mid-air and had a terrifying aura. It was something even the people outside Brocade Spring Court could feel through the projection array.</p>
<p>At that moment, Old Man Changsheng said to Felicitous Rain Lord. “Felicitous Rain, Yi Yun has already agreed to this matter. You probably wouldn't intervene and help Yi Yun while disregarding your status, right?”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord frowned slightly but he did not say a word. Instead, Yi Yun was the first person to speak. He said loud and clear, “The assessment is obviously a matter for us younger warriors. Out of fairness, Senior Felicitous Rain shouldn't intervene as well. However… I want to withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring together with Shi Ping and Shi Fei. The devouring should happen in sequence and when the outcome is obvious, it has to be stopped.”</p>
<p>With Felicitous Rain Lord around, Yi Yun believed that the old man would not directly kill him. And as long as the old man did not deliberately do something, Yi Yun was unafraid of anything if Shi Ping and Shi Fei were experiencing the same conditions.</p>
<p>Chapter 983: Dao Tapir Seal</p>
<p>Upon hearing Yi Yun, everyone was secretly horrified. Yi Yun was that confident?</p>
<p>A Dao Tapir was a Fey beast reared by the Immortal Rain Sect. Many of them had never even seen one.</p>
<p>To risk one's life to face such a strange Fey beast despite having never encountered one before was something no member of the young generation present had the courage to do so.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, have you thought it through?” Felicitous Rain Lord asked Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun said with clasped hands, “Yes, Divine Lord.”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord looked carefully at Yi Yun. He was astonished at Yi Yun's extremely calm demeanor. However, Felicitous Rain Lord believed that for Yi Yun to be able to gradually reach his present state from a minor character who had no background, he definitely would not do something foolhardy that would end up killing him.</p>
<p>“In that case, alright!” Felicitous Rain Lord slowly stood up and said, “There are seals inside the Dao Tapir. As the seals are released one by one, the Dao Tapir will release a stronger devouring force.”</p>
<p>“When this force is afflicted on you, it would cause the Dao imprints and Dao runes in your bodies to collapse before sucking the Dao away.”</p>
<p>“The method to resist the devouring force is to let your Dao form a perfect system. When your Dao merges with your body as it slowly achieves perfection, your Dao Domain would become more powerful. Then, the collapse would become more unlikely, causing the Dao Tapir to fail at sucking the Dao you have comprehended away.” Felicitous Rain Lord explained patiently.</p>
<p>The explanation was mainly for Yi Yun and Chi Zhuiyun. By knowing how to resist the Dao Tapir, it would prevent them from being thrown into a panic at the beginning.</p>
<p>“The Dao Tapir I rear is named 'Xiao'. I will release Xiao's first seal so that you can slowly experience it.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord spoke, he conjured a rune that spread out like water ripples before it entered the Dao Tapir's shadow.</p>
<p>The Dao Tapir jolted suddenly as a dangerous aura emanated from it.</p>
<p>Even though the Dao Tapir was reared by Felicitous Rain Lord, it possessed an aura with ice-cold killing intent.</p>
<p>Immediately, Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue felt their hearts shudder.</p>
<p>They could sense a devouring force acting on their entire being. This feeling was one they had never experienced in their lives. It felt like all the blood in their bodies was being tugged as though it would burst out of their bodies.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun wanted to activate his Dao Domain, but after carefully perceiving his situation for a moment, he realized he could withstand it.</p>
<p>“The Dao Tapir's aura is gradually becoming stronger, but it hasn't exceeded the limits of which I can bear.”</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun discovered this point. He looked towards Felicitous Rain Lord in the towering tree's hall and immediately understood something.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was only allowing them to adjust to the assessment. He had deliberately released the first seal of Dao Tapir's many seals. He wanted them to understand what it felt like when the Dao Tapir was devouring their Dao so that they would not be left in a panic.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had a similar thought. The devouring force was gradually increasing in intensity. He could release his perception to experience it and at the same time observe Chi Zhuiyun's reaction.</p>
<p>Getting some experience from Chi Zhuiyun's resistance of the Dao Tapir would allow him to withstand the Dao Tapir with ease and verve.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Uncle, let us begin as well.” Upon realizing what was happening, Shi Fei told Old Man Changsheng in an anxious manner.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was letting Yi Yun familiarize himself with the Dao Tapir and it was obvious to Shi Ping and Shi Fei. Even though they refused to believe that Yi Yun was able to comprehend a powerful Dao Domain in the span of a short year, they absolutely refused to give Yi Yun any chance of improving his likelihood for success.</p>
<p>After all, to make Yi Yun face the extremely dangerous Helltoothed Dao Tapir, they had paid the cost of slapping each other in the face. They had done so publicly, with projection images shown to millions of people outside. They needed to absolutely ensure that Yi Yun would pay a worse price than the heavy price they paid.</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng glanced at Yi Yun and sneered. How can I give you the chance to gain experience with the Dao Tapir's devouring force? You were given a chance to withdraw, but not only did you not withdraw, you even went further to ridicule my Immortal Rain Sect. Today, you shall pay a tragic price!</p>
<p>“Helltoothed Dao Tapir, three seals, release!”</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng immediately released the three seals!</p>
<p>Instantly, it was as though all hell had broken loose. The crimson Helltoothed Dao Tapir bared its fangs and brandished its claws as it covered the entire sky!</p>
<p>Even the warriors outside Brocade Spring Court could see the Dao Tapir without needing to use the projection array.</p>
<p>A shudder ran through the spines of the warriors. They were not the targets of the Dao Tapir's act of devouring, but they still felt their bodies turn cold.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, it was unknown if he could withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>“That old bastard is too vicious. He actually directly released three seals!”</p>
<p>“Those two Immortal Rain Sect disciples are familiar with Dao Tapirs. But Yi Yun did not even know what a Dao Tapir was before this. He is being a bully.”</p>
<p>Many warriors found the circumstances unfair to Yi Yun. By doing so, the Immortal Rain Sect was completely targeting Yi Yun and making things difficult for him.</p>
<p>There were others who were gloating at Yi Yun's misfortune. Song Wuchen was overjoyed. “Yi Yun got the Immortal Rain Sect disciples to slap each other in the face and they have already done it. Now, it's only fair for him to face the threat of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. It was all his choice. He had eased his heart by shooting his mouth, but I wonder how he will now deal with the situation?”</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei immediately released their Dao Domains when they faced the terrifying devouring power of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>They had faced the Helltoothed Dao Tapir several times in the past, so they were extremely familiar with it! In their Dao Domains, they stood like stable boulders! The Helltoothed Dao Tapir was constantly attempting to devour their Dao Domains, but their Dao Domains were unassailable as their two Dao Domains merged into one.</p>
<p>They looked at Yi Yun. In front of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir with three of its seals removed, how long could Yi Yun last?</p>
<p>Yi Yun could sense a horrifying suction force coming from the Helltoothed Dao Tapir that acted on him. It made Yi Yun feel like everything in his body was bursting out of his body.</p>
<p>What the Dao Tapir targeted may be the Dao inside his body, but when the suction power landed on him, it felt as though his soul would be sucked away as well.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt that the world he was facing was filled up by the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, and he was standing in front of a gaping mouth.</p>
<p>The nomological fragments that he was not controlling would be sucked away!</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, Felicitous Rain Lord had said to form one's Dao Domain into a system so that one could withstand the devouring force. Although it sounded simple, it was the same as comprehending a Dao Domain. It needed repeated attempts and a sequential progress.</p>
<p>But Yi Yun was immediately facing the Helltoothed Dao Tapir which had three seals released. He did not have any chance of slowly familiarizing himself with the situation. The moment the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's seals were removed, he was engulfed immediately.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never shown his Dao Domain before. Some people even suspected that he had yet to comprehend a Dao Domain after a year.</p>
<p>While under the influence of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force, Yi Yun clenched his teeth. Slowly, an ice-cold aura that seemed to come from a deep abyss began emanating from his body.</p>
<p>The aura was very strange and it suffused a gray light. It did not appear obvious, but it managed to block the devouring power.</p>
<p>“What is that gray halo…? Is that Yi Yun's Dao Domain?”</p>
<p>“Dao Domain? That doesn't…seem like one?”</p>
<p>Chapter 984: Dao Domain of Rain</p>
<p>People watched the gray halo suffusing from Yi Yun with curious amazement. A Dao Domain was produced when a warrior's comprehension of a Dao reached a certain standard. When their laws were able to form a small world, a tiny space surrounding their bodies would separate itself from the greater world, forming a Dao Domain.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun's gray halo, it apparently did not seem to be forming a world of its own. It was completely different to the common impression that everyone had of Dao Domains.</p>
<p>But very strangely, the gray halo was able to withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force.</p>
<p>“What Dao is that?” Shi Fei was surprised. He could not help but sneer as he said, “It doesn't matter what Dao it is. It's only the appetizer. Be prepared to become a cripple!”</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei's auras were increasing in intensity. A domain with misty rain immediately appeared around them.</p>
<p>Dao Domain of Rain! In the Dao Domain of Rain, every drop of rainwater was the condensation of Dao. The water droplets were produced by their bodies before it returned to their bodies. It was a water cycle that repeated itself. The Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force was unending, but it was unable to crack the cycle.</p>
<p>The power of the rainwater was perpetual. People could see that Shi Ping and Shi Fei's surroundings had seemed to merge into a greater whole, forming a rainy world.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this scene, Old Man Changsheng nodded his head in appreciation. “Felicitous Rain, what do you think of Shi Fei and Shi Ping's comprehension of Immortal Rain Dao?”</p>
<p>The Dao Domain of Rain was one of the core inheritances of the reclusive Immortal Rain Sect. The rain here was not in the ordinary sense of the word… it was Heavenly Dao Immortal Rain. Every drop was like ambrosia condensed from the essence of the world.</p>
<p>The Dao Domain of Rain had the ability to constantly renew itself and its unique trait of being a complete ecosystem made it best at withstanding the devouring force.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord did not make comment. All of his attention was on Yi Yun, or to be precise, the gray halo around Yi Yun.</p>
<p>What is that gray halo… ?</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's eyebrows jumped slightly. The gray halo gave him a strange feeling.</p>
<p>And at that moment, Shi Changsheng's cold voice sounded, “Helltoothed Dao Tapir, fourth seal, release.”</p>
<p>The fourth seal!</p>
<p>It was said that the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force could devour mountains and seas when the fourth seal was released! Even the surrounding air was resonating like it would be torn apart at any time.</p>
<p>“That… that is the fourth stage?”</p>
<p>On Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue's side, they were still withstanding the devouring force of the released second seal. Yet, Yi Yun was already beginning to experience the fourth seal. The difference was just too great. Furthermore, Chi Zhuiyun and Tianya Haoyue were facing an ordinary Dao Tapir, while Yi Yun was facing a Helltoothed Dao Tapir!</p>
<p>“Let's see how long you can last!”</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei were not finding it easy when the fourth seal was released either!</p>
<p>They were using the Dao Domain of Rain to prop themselves up. As for Yi Yun, how was he going to withstand the devouring force with that baffling gray halo?</p>
<p>Chi! Chi! Chi!</p>
<p>The devouring force maniacally crunched the gray halo around Yi Yun. It was like the gray halo was being shredded.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who was experiencing this, could see Shi Ping and Shi Fei's teasing smiles, as well as the cold and belittling gaze from the Star Picking Court above him. At that moment, his expression was extremely livid.</p>
<p>Want me to die?</p>
<p>Killing intent flashed in Yi Yun's eyes. For the past year, he had been gaining insights into the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, which touched upon the Major Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>Legends said that when the universe experiences its final and biggest annihilation, it would experience the supreme laws of destruction.</p>
<p>And in this universe, there was nothing that could remain everlasting. Be it life, the celestial bodies, the boundless worlds and the be-all and end-all of everything, they would all be destroyed.</p>
<p>If Chaos was the beginning of Dao, then Final Destruction was the end of Dao — On the day of the Final Destruction, even Dao itself would be annihilated.</p>
<p>Even for Yi Yun, he had only managed to comprehend an inkling of such a mystical Great Dao of Supremacy.</p>
<p>With that bit of Major Dao of Destruction, it was extremely demanding on Yi Yun to produce a Major Destruction Dao Domain. Furthermore, it would expend a great deal of his energy and stamina.</p>
<p>At the moment that the Major Dao of Destruction was released, whatever devouring force he experienced would be like a gentle breeze to Yi Yun. It would not pose any threats.</p>
<p>But most important of all, Yi Yun's Major Destruction Dao Domain could last less than thirty seconds!</p>
<p>The assessment was a test to see how long a warrior was able to endure the devouring force and not the strength of the Dao Domain.</p>
<p>With less than thirty seconds, he would be exhausted upon using it after thirty seconds. And when that happened, Yi Yun would no longer be able to withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force when he lost the protection of the Dao Domain.</p>
<p>At that moment, the devouring force was increasing in intensity, like a storm had befallen the area around him. Yi Yun was experiencing the storm and the gray halo around him appeared ephemeral. It was like a tiny boat in a tumultuous storm.</p>
<p>Although the gray halo was not eye-catching, everyone knew how terrifying the devouring force that Yi Yun was experiencing was.</p>
<p>It was obvious when comparing his situation with the assessment with the ordinary Dao Tapir. At that moment, the ordinary Dao Tapir had just had its third seal released. The powerful devouring force was something that Tianya Haoyue could no longer withstand. As for Chi Zhuiyun, he had activated his Shura Dao Domain's Celestial Demon Form. He was going all out!</p>
<p>Although there was a stirring sea of blood in front of Chi Zhuiyun with ghastly wails coming from it, it was gradually being consumed by the devouring force.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Chi Zhuiyun was famous for his powerful Dao Domain. But even so, he was already at his limit when facing an ordinary Dao Tapir that had three of its seals released.</p>
<p>How horrifying would it be when the fourth seal of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir was released? It was completely unimaginable!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun still can withstand it!?”</p>
<p>“Amazing. What is that gray halo around him? Doesn't he cultivate in pure Yang laws? That does not look anything like a pure Yang Dao Domain.”</p>
<p>People were in a flurry of discussion. And at that moment, the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force was at its fourth stage and it had reached its limit. The terrifying Dao Tapir's mouth appeared like it was about to completely swallow Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt like his lifeblood was about to be drained. He had used Destruction laws to withstand the devouring force, but it was not a Dao Domain after all. There was a limit to its effects, so he knew that he was quickly reaching his limit.</p>
<p>“Punk, your Dao Domain is already being pressed against the surface of your body, and yet you haven't died?”</p>
<p>Not far beside Yi Yun, Shi Fei's fat body was trembling, like he was about to be swept away by a storm.</p>
<p>“You are just lingering on with your last breath. I don't believe that you can last till the moment when the fifth seal is released!”</p>
<p>As Shi Fei spoke, he exchanged glances with Shi Ping. They moved closer together as the Dao Domains of Rain around them began to slowly merge.</p>
<p>The two rainy domains had merged together.</p>
<p>As the rain underwent an exchange, the Dao Domain of Rain became more expansive. The vast screen of rain withstood the devouring force that came falling from the sky as it protected Shi Fei and Shi Ping.</p>
<p>However, such a scene caused people from the six-country alliance to curse at them.</p>
<p>“The two of them are joining forces?”</p>
<p>“They have no shame. Did they join forces to withstand the devouring force? What sort of ability is that!?”</p>
<p>Chapter 985: Assimilation of Everything</p>
<p>“Isn't joining forces to withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force a violation of the rules?” Someone raised an objection.</p>
<p>However, in the towering tree's hall, Felicitous Rain Lord did not make any comments. Instead, Song Wuchen was the one who spoke up. He said, “The two of them aren't considered to be joining forces. They are withstanding the same devouring force. The two of them would be withstanding twice the devouring force, so working together will not reduce the difficulty. However, the unique ability of Dao Domain of Rain is fusion. When the Dao Domains fuse, the resulting Dao Domain's power will be stronger!”</p>
<p>In the Immortal Rain Sect, the fusion of Dao Domains was a battle strategy in itself. Some Immortal Rain Sect disciples, who were proficient in combined attacks, might not be a match for an opponent in a one-on-one situation. But if they joined forces in a similar two-versus-two situation, they would have an advantage. And when in a three-versus-three situation, they could have an overwhelming victory.</p>
<p>When Immortal Rain Sect disciples ventured outside of the sect, such as exploring mystic realms, they would frequently take on the support role in the team. An excellent Immortal Rain Sect disciple could even use his Dao to fuse with the other non-Immortal Rain Sect warriors. By doing so, their combat strength would be more than simply the two of them combined.</p>
<p>Although Immortal Rain Sect disciples were proficient at support, it did not mean that their combat strength was weak. The most powerful cornerstone array of the Immortal Rain Sect was the Rain of Annihilation. It was a strike with more than ten thousand Immortal Rain Sect disciples combining their Dao Domains together. At the moment it was struck out, Rain of Annihilation would fall from the sky. Every drop of rain was condensed from Dao. It was extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was from the Immortal Rain Sect after all. He too taught his disciples the Dao of rain fusion. So the appearance of such a situation in the assessment naturally wasn't considered to be a violation of the rules.</p>
<p>That was the ability of the Dao Domain of Rain.</p>
<p>After their Dao Domains fused, Shi Ping and Shi Fei's strength increased multifold. The two of them had grown up together, so they had long been able to team up perfectly.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng naturally wouldn't give up on that opportunity. Seeing the two of them ready, he once again released another seal — the fifth seal!</p>
<p>At the moment that the seal was released, the devouring force flooded over at a greater intensity. The Helltoothed Dao Tapir was like a beast that had been uncaged. It directly pounced at Yi Yun, Shi Ping, and Shi Fei!</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>Many people were given a shock when they saw this scene. Previously, no matter how many seals were released, the Helltoothed Dao Tapir would be hovering mid-air, using its devouring laws from afar. But now, it had directly pounced at the assessees!?</p>
<p>Then, wouldn't Yi Yun be devoured into the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's body?</p>
<p>At that very instant, no one could think too deeply about the matter. They saw a viscous darkness enshroud the square in Brocade Spring Court. Yi Yun, Shi Fei, and Shi Ping were fully immersed in darkness as they vanished!</p>
<p>“This… ”</p>
<p>Everyone stared with widened eyes. In the towering tree's hall, sweat began oozing out of Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi's foreheads.</p>
<p>They had no way to predict what would happen next. Once Yi Yun's Dao was devoured, his martial path would be destroyed. It wasn't easy for the Luo clan to find a genius that could influence what providence would bring them. If he was destroyed under their watch, they would truly become sinners of the Luo clan. Especially now, when the Luo clan was still living under the threat of the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>Just as Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were feeling extremely worried, rain began to pour down from the sky.</p>
<p>That was the ability of the Dao Domain of Rain.</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei's figures gradually appeared from the darkness. By their combined forces, their fused Dao Domain of Rain allowed them to forcefully withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir which had its fifth seal released.</p>
<p>The Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force was extremely potent. Even the Dao Domain of Rain that they produced in a combined effort was compressed into a tiny space. Shi Ping and Shi Fei were barely persisting on in that tiny space.</p>
<p>What about Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and company widened their eyes as they attempted to search for him.</p>
<p>The spectating warriors also began to search for Yi Yun's figure in the darkness.</p>
<p>However, they could not find Yi Yun no matter what!</p>
<p>“What happened?” Elder Duanmu directly stood up from his seat and asked Shi Changsheng.</p>
<p>In Star Picking Court, Elder Duanmu's actions appeared rather impolite in front of Felicitous Rain Lord, but he could not be bothered about etiquette.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng grunted coldly. Elder Duanmu was only a warrior at the Dao Palace realm, one that he did not think anything of.</p>
<p>“Who are you? How preposterous of you to act so impolite in front of me! I am the one who is presiding over the assessment of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. It was something that Yi Yun and Felicitous Rain agreed upon too. You have no say on the matter!” Old Man Changsheng said coldly.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu's voice faltered as he was unable to make any retort. Compared to Old Man Changsheng, he was too inferior, be it status or strength.</p>
<p>He could only endure the anger in his heart as he tried his best to speak in a calm manner, “Senior Changsheng, I only want to know where Yi Yun is.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were feeling extremely worried after not being able to see Yi Yun's figure. Their perception could not enter the world of darkness formed by the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, so they could only ask Shi Changsheng.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng said with a sneer, “Isn't that obvious? Haven't you seen Yi Yun disappear? That's obviously because he has entered the Dao Tapir's body. In other words, he has been devoured by the Helltoothed Dao Tapir!”</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Old Man Changsheng's words, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi felt an angry jolt pass through their hearts. He had been devoured!?</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng, who was the mastermind behind all of this, had a teasing smile on his face. Elder Duanmu wished that he could just charge up and fight the old man with his life!</p>
<p>“What are the two of you worrying about? Don't worry, that punk isn't dead yet. He's not bad either. He is still able to withstand the fifth stage's devouring force for a short period of time.” Shi Changsheng said with a laugh. He refused to believe that Yi Yun could still persist on. And even if he could, the sixth stage was awaiting him!</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei still had their final tricks up their sleeves. They could temporarily withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's six stage for a second or two. Without that bit of ability, how could they have been willing to slap each other in the face so they could force Yi Yun to face the Helltoothed Dao Tapir?</p>
<p>Regardless of the case, Yi Yun was bound to be crippled!</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, you wouldn't go so far as to stop the assessment, right?” Old Man Changsheng looked at Felicitous Rain Lord and asked.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord gave him a glance and said, “Whatever I do or not do is not up to you.”</p>
<p>“Haha.” Old Man Changsheng stroked his beard.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord turned his gaze towards the Helltoothed Dao Tapir. The situation was somewhat abnormal. He realized that Yi Yun's limit was much higher than he had originally predicted. Felicitous Rain Lord believed that Yi Yun would be pushed to the brink when the fourth seal was released, but now, Yi Yun was still able to persist on despite the release of the fifth seal?</p>
<p>Yi Yun seemed to be a person who became stronger when facing the strong.</p>
<p>Upon knowing that Yi Yun had been devoured, Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, who could not see the situation inside the world of darkness, were sweating profusely. As for the other people from the six-country alliance, they too found it ominous.</p>
<p>Could Yi Yun be destroyed by the Helltoothed Dao Tapir… ?</p>
<p>And in the envelopment of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, Shi Ping and Shi Fei were most aware of their surroundings. They too were searching for Yi Yun's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Soon, they were certain that Yi Yun had disappeared!</p>
<p>Yi Yun has already been devoured!?</p>
<p>Other than that, there was no other possibility!</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei revealed looks of excitement.</p>
<p>“That Yi Yun is doomed!”</p>
<p>“He is considered pretty good, but compared to Senior Brother and me, he's nothing.”</p>
<p>However, they did not find the outcome surprising. Under the devouring force at the fifth stage, the two of them could not last that long, even with their forces combined, much less Yi Yun, whose Dao Domain was not stronger than theirs.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun has been devoured. The Helltoothed Dao Tapir can be sealed again.” Shi Fei said.</p>
<p>They also found it extremely taxing to withstand the devouring force.</p>
<p>Shi Ping put his hand out and waved, hoping to give Old Man Changsheng a signal.</p>
<p>And at that moment, the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force came to a standstill.</p>
<p>“It looks like Grandmaster Uncle already knows,” said Shi Ping.</p>
<p>At the moment that the devouring force came to a standstill, the pressure that they felt was immediately lessened.</p>
<p>Following that, once the Helltoothed Dao Tapir was sealed again, they could deactivate their Dao Domains.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, they saw a gray vortex appear in the middle of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir.</p>
<p>The vortex was only a size of a pin at the beginning, but very quickly, it began to spin rapidly. In a blink of an eye, it replaced the Helltoothed Dao Tapir and swirled at Shi Ping and Shi Fei in an inundating manner!</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the sixth seal has been released?”</p>
<p>“What is that Immortal Rain Sect thinking? Yi Yun has already been devoured! It's no longer an assessment if they release the sixth seal. They clearly want Yi Yun dead!”</p>
<p>“How despicable. Is Senior Felicitous Rain not going to stop this?”</p>
<p>On one hand, there was the assessment, but if they deliberately increased the difficulty when Yi Yun appeared like he could not withstand it, that was intentional murder.</p>
<p>The people from the six-country alliance began hurling invectives. But at that moment, they realized that Felicitous Rain Lord had not moved. He did not stop any of it, while Shi Changsheng, who was beside him, had an ugly expression on his face.</p>
<p>The sixth seal?</p>
<p>He did not open it at all!</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, the gray vortex in the Helltoothed Dao Tapir had rapidly expanded.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It directly turned into a gray tornado that swept around wantonly!</p>
<p>The rain in the sky was devoured by the tornado, wrenching them into mist!</p>
<p>It was unexpected when the twisted rain become a part of the gray tornado!</p>
<p>Upon seeing that scene, Shi Changsheng, who was sitting leisurely in his seat, stood up suddenly.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>His cultivation level was deep and profound. He held control of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir as well, so he knew everything that was happening inside the world of darkness. He could clearly see that the gray vortex was using an unbelievable power to destroy all laws and Heaven Earth Yuan Qi around it!</p>
<p>And the laws and Heaven Earth Yuan Qi that were being destroyed would be instantly assimilated by the gray tornado, before becoming a part of the terrifying destructive power! It caused the tornado vortex to expand rapidly like an explosion!</p>
<p>“That tornado!”</p>
<p>In his long life, this was the first time that Shi Changsheng saw such a terrifying law. It was like the world was covered in flammable oil and dry wood, while the black tornado was like a fire starter. It lit up the world, causing everything in the world to become a destructive inferno!</p>
<p>The spreading happened like it was unstoppable. It even made Shi Changsheng feel a sense of foreboding. What if the inferno continued spreading?</p>
<p>If it could assimilate everything around it, to make them one of its constituents, it would only become more and more powerful. The stronger the assimilation power, the more likely it would eventually assimilate the world, and turn the world into a ruin!</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng was not only the one who was astonished. Even Felicitous Rain Lord felt alarmed.</p>
<p>As a Divine Lord of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, he was very well-learned, but this strange law was able to surprise Felicitous Rain Lord. He thought of anything Shi Changsheng could think of as well.</p>
<p>But be it Felicitous Rain Lord or Shi Changsheng, none of them dared to think that the power of destruction could really spread through thousands of worlds, or even the 12 Empyrean Heavens, much less a single world. It would destroy everything.</p>
<p>That was the Major Destruction laws that could end the Universe which no 12 Empyrean Heavens warrior had been able to comprehend!</p>
<p>Of course, with Yi Yun's cultivation level, it was impossible to produce a destructive power that could devour all of the 12 Empyrean Heavens. It was already sufficient to destroy whatever that was around him.</p>
<p>“The rain in the sky has been devoured. Even the clouds are gone!” In the towering tree's hall, a warrior from the younger generation exclaimed.</p>
<p>At that moment, in the world of darkness, not only was the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's power being assimilated by the destructive force, even Shi Ping and Shi Fei's Dao Domain of Rain was being assimilated by the destructive power!</p>
<p>Chapter 986: Price</p>
<p>Shi Fei and Shi Ping were already struggling when the fifth seal was released. With the sudden intrusion of the destructive power, the Dao Domain of Rain that they conjured through their combined forces was like paper being consumed by flames. It shattered immediately!</p>
<p>In front of the powers of Major Destruction, be it the fusion of rain or the perpetuity of the water cycle, it all became meaningless. They were destroyed.</p>
<p>“What's going on!?”</p>
<p>Shi Fei and Shi Ping watched helplessly as the gray vortex tore through the layers of the rain before their faces changed drastically.</p>
<p>They were in the confines of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force, and once their Dao Domain was destroyed, the outcome would be obvious!</p>
<p>“What is Grandmaster Uncle doing? This doesn't feel like it's the release of the sixth seal!”</p>
<p>Shi Fei's rotund face was trembling. Under the force of destruction, he had an extremely powerless feeling. He felt like he was a tiny boat in a storm and the boat was going to capsize at any moment.</p>
<p>He was still not sure what the gray vortex was as he shot a pleaful look at Old Man Changsheng. The scene of their Dao Domain being rapidly devoured while they waited for death filled him with despair.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng finally could not sit still. How could he ignore the disciples he led, especially when they were in a dangerous situation?</p>
<p>He produced a few seals with his hands. As Heaven Earth Yuan Qi gathered, it formed water droplets. He was about to take action to save Shi Ping and Shi Fei, but at that moment —</p>
<p>“Pa!”</p>
<p>With an explosion, the water droplets in Shi Changsheng's hand had dispersed into a mist.</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng turned his head towards Felicitous Rain Lord in astonishment. The only person who could easily dissolve his laws of rain was Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, what are you doing!?” Old Man Changsheng asked with a frown.</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei were his Immortal Rain Sect's genius disciples.</p>
<p>“In this world, every action has a cost,” said Felicitous Rain Lord in a casual manner. “Back when they bet on the life of another, their lives were also placed on the betting table. If they did not come to such a realization, how are they to continue down the path of martial arts?”</p>
<p>There was a coldness in Felicitous Rain Lord's casual tone.</p>
<p>Previously, Old Man Changsheng was afraid that he would interfere and he had not done a single thing. Now, Old Man Changsheng wanted to interfere himself? Felicitous Rain Lord obviously wouldn't agree to that!</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord stared at Shi Changsheng with a cold look. It gave Shi Changsheng a chill that reached his heart.</p>
<p>He knew about Felicitous Rain Lord's immense power. Ignoring the fact that Shi Changsheng's strength was slowly deteriorating, even when he was at his peak, he was no match for Felicitous Rain Lord at all.</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng made another seal with his hands, but no new raindrops were condensed again. But, how could time wait for Shi Changsheng?</p>
<p>At that moment, Shi Changsheng hesitated.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In the shroud of the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force, the sound of an explosion echoed throughout the court!</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng looked over and he saw that the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's world of darkness had been filled completely by the gray vortex.</p>
<p>The Helltoothed Dao Tapir's world of darkness gave people an irresistible feeling due to the way it seemed to devour everything.</p>
<p>But this world was being gradually assimilated by the gray vortex.</p>
<p>Even the world of darkness was unable to withstand the gray vortex, so how could the Dao Domain of Rain, that was barely struggling, be able to withstand it?</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei were anxiously waiting for Old Man Changsheng to rescue them, but what came for them in their despair was the overwhelming gray vortex.</p>
<p>They powered their Dao Domain with all their strength as they released all of their Yuan Qi, but nothing could amount to anything when placed in front of the Dao of Major Destruction.</p>
<p>“Grandmaster Uncle, save us!”</p>
<p>At the instant that the Dao Domain of Rain shattered, Shi Ping and Shi Fei's faces twisted in horror.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>The Dao Domain that they struggled to power did not seem to cause a single stir in front of the gray vortex that seemed to be annihilating everything in its path.</p>
<p>When that loud explosion sounded, their Dao Domains had shattered like a chicken's egg!</p>
<p>The hundreds of thousands of warriors outside Brocade Spring Court witnessed the scene with their own eyes.</p>
<p>The two Immortal Rain Sect disciples' Dao Domain had collapsed at the instant that the gray vortex touched down on it, and it expelled them forcefully.</p>
<p>There was no way that they could put up any resistance. Even the Helltoothed Dao Tapir was struggling and twisting in the gray vortex.</p>
<p>The formerly formidable Helltoothed Dao Tapir began to let out painful roars as the gray vortex devoured and ripped it.</p>
<p>Its world of darkness vanished and even a small part of its body had been torn off.</p>
<p>The overwhelming gray vortex swirls raged wantonly above Brocade Spring Court before it gradually shrank. It returned to a tiny vortex before it disappeared.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone jolt awake from the extended silence.</p>
<p>A cold wind blew everywhere as several warriors were shocked to find themselves drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p>That Dao Domain was truly terrifying!</p>
<p>And at that moment, a figure appeared in place of where the gray vortex had disappeared.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun!”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi agitatedly stood up.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was standing mid-air. His face was somewhat pale, but his aura still had a hint of destruction to it.</p>
<p>Through the projection array, the warriors from the six-country alliance were watching that figure mid-air. They remained silent for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Was that destructive storm produced by Yi Yun?</p>
<p>Was that a Dao Domain?</p>
<p>No one could believe it. That destructive storm was completely different to a normal Dao Domain.</p>
<p>Just a year ago, Yi Yun did not have his own Dao Domain. Now, the gray vortex that he conjured was a hundred times more terrifying than a typical Dao Domain. Not only did it withstand the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force, it was able to collapse Shi Ping and Shi Fei's Dao Domain of Rain. What sort of horrifying law was that?</p>
<p>Yi Yun had such a huge improvement in a year's time?</p>
<p>Just recalling the gray storm's sweeping through of everything left their hearts palpitating. They only witnessed it with their eyes, but they still could not calm themselves.</p>
<p>And within Brocade Spring Court, Yi Yun was standing mid-air with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>The Yuan Qi in his body was almost completely drained.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun… ”</p>
<p>Just as Elder Duanmu was about to take action, he heard Felicitous Rain Lord say, “He is contemplating the battle that he has just undergone. There is no need to disturb him.”</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu glanced at Felicitous Rain Lord before coming to a stop.</p>
<p>With a Divine Lord watching, it was unlikely that Yi Yun would be in trouble.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shi Changsheng's figure flashed as he flew towards a corner in Brocade Spring Court.</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei were lying there like ragged dolls.</p>
<p>They were covered in injuries, but that was nothing at all.</p>
<p>What was most terrifying was at the instant that their fused Dao Domain shattered, a large number of Dao runes in their bodies were obliterated. From that moment onwards, their future martial path would suffer a destructive setback!</p>
<p>They were originally geniuses, but now, they might not even be comparable to normal people. It was a worse feeling than killing them.</p>
<p>“Grand… Grandmaster Uncle… ”</p>
<p>Shi Ping and Shi Fei had looks of extreme pain on their faces.</p>
<p>They had gone to great lengths in the hopes of crippling Yi Yun, but they had never expected that the ones to end up in such a dire state was they themselves.</p>
<p>Shi Changsheng, who arrived in front of the two disciples, flashed a grim look in his eyes.</p>
<p>He had witnessed his sect's disciples being crippled, and there was never an junior that had made Shi Changsheng feel so humiliated.</p>
<p>“We… We… ”</p>
<p>Shi Fei and Shi Ping looked at Shi Changsheng with a glimmer of hope. However, when they saw Shi Changsheng's grim expression after sensing their bodies, their expressions turned completely sombre.</p>
<p>Chapter 987: Disciple Recruitment</p>
<p>Seeing that Shi Ping and Shi Fei were crippled, everyone in Brocade Spring Court was left at a loss for words. The development had completely exceeded everyone's expectations.</p>
<p>Originally, Shi Ping and Shi Fei had paid a heavy price to make Yi Yun endure the Helltoothed Dao Tapir's devouring force. People had believed that Yi Yun was just being sharp tongued, which would eventually end up in him falling for his own scheme.</p>
<p>But no one ever believed that the outcome would reach such a state. Yi Yun's Dao Domain was not only not crippled, instead, it was Shi Ping and Shi Fei who had a large amount of their Dao drawn away and had their prior insights of Dao drastically reduced. They were at the extreme limit of the Heaven Ascension realm, and they were about to condensed their Dao fruits, but with their Dao Domains gone, how were they going to condense Dao fruits?</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone looked at Yi Yun. At that moment, Yi Yun's energy was nearly depleted. He was hovering mid-air as he recovered his stamina.</p>
<p>People began to see Yi Yun's strength as being even more unfathomable. It was hard to imagine that in just one year, Yi Yun was able to possess such a terrifying Dao Domain — if that gray vortex was a Dao Domain that is.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain… ” Old Man Changsheng said with a deep voice.</p>
<p>He was incensed and he hoped to kill Yi Yun to ease his fury, but in front of Felicitous Rain Lord, he could not do a thing.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Felicitous Rain Lord gave Old Man Changsheng a perfunctory glance.</p>
<p>“It's fine if you didn't appreciate Shi Ping and Shi Fei, but why did you cripple their Dao?”</p>
<p>By stopping Old Man Changsheng at the very last moment — despite it being for a very short period of time — Felicitous Rain Lord had created such an outcome. Although Shi Fei and Shi Ping were crippled by Yi Yun directly, there was no way for Felicitous Rain Lord to shirk any responsibility either.</p>
<p>“Martial practitioners must be able to undertake responsibilities. You said that I didn't appreciate them, but in fact, my standards aren't that high. People who know how to compromise are people who I appreciate. Those without sufficient strength but can bear disgrace and a heavy burden are people who I appreciate as well.”</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord said that, he looked at Chi Zhuiyun. In the final Dao Domain assessment, it wasn't too much to say that Chi Zhuiyun had born disgrace and a heavy burden.</p>
<p>“Of course, the ones that I appreciate the most are those with strength and know how to beat their enemies through novel means… ”</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord said that, he cast his gaze at Yi Yun and nodded slightly.</p>
<p>“What I don't appreciate are people who are unaware of their own limitations, go back on their word, and people who cannot pay the price for their actions. These kind of people are not what I would take in as disciples. Now, I'll be announcing the disciples that I want to take in!”</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord said that, everyone's hearts tightened, especially in the towering tree's hall. The king and the other important figures of the Oracle Fey Kingdom braced themselves by sitting up straight.</p>
<p>They were actually feeling somewhat disheartened. Yi Yun was simply too dazzling. He had stood head and shoulders above the rest, so they felt that Chi Zhuiyun's chances were slim.</p>
<p>“I am willing to take in Chi Zhuiyun as an in-name disciple! Chi Zhuiyun, are you willing?”</p>
<p>It was unexpected that the first person that Felicitous Rain Lord mentioned was Chi Zhuiyun.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was delighted. Back when he chose the ordinary Dao Tapir because he did not dare to face the Helltoothed Dao Tapir, it was equivalent to him giving up. He never expected that Felicitous Rain Lord would still be willing to take him in as a disciple.</p>
<p>“Yes, this disciple is willing!” Chi Zhuiyun said politely.</p>
<p>The Oracle Fey Kingdom king heaved a sigh of relief. Although Chi Zhuiyun's results were inferior to Yi Yun's, he had finally passed the assessment.</p>
<p>Seeing Chi Zhuiyun become an in-name disciple, Tianya Haoyue felt extremely jealous. Felicitous Rain Lord did not even mention him, destroying any hope that was left in him.</p>
<p>The difference was just too great. He was inferior to Chi Zhuiyun, and as for Yi Yun, the gap was probably the same distance as one end of the world to the other.</p>
<p>It was a given that Felicitous Rain Lord would take Yi Yun in as a disciple. However, what made people puzzled was that even though Felicitous Rain Lord was announcing who he was taking in as disciples, why didn't he say Chi Zhuiyun and Yi Yun's names together? Why did he ask them individually?</p>
<p>Could it be… ?</p>
<p>A few people realized a possibility and this possibility left them stifled!</p>
<p>“I am willing to take Yi Yun in as a… personal disciple! Yi Yun, are you willing?”</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord said that, there was silence everywhere, including the area outside Brocade Spring Court. The projection was shown to everyone allowing millions of people to see it. They were left in shock!</p>
<p>A Divine Lord's personal disciple!</p>
<p>A Divine Lord had an extremely long life. If they did not die as a result of unnatural means, they could live for tens of millions of years. But in such a long period of time, the number of personal disciples that they took in was a handful.</p>
<p>Typically, some personal disciples who had yet to mature fully would die before the Divine Lord's death. That resulted in the Divine Lord taking in new disciples.</p>
<p>Once someone became Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple, the amount of resources that they could enjoy would be enviable. Furthermore, Felicitous Rain Lord was no ordinary Divine Lord. He held remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon' in his possession!</p>
<p>The 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon' was one of the top twelve cultivation techniques in the 12 Empyrean Heavens.</p>
<p>How big an opportunity was it to be able to study the remnant pages of the ''Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon'?</p>
<p>“Personal disciple… personal disciple… Master actually… ”</p>
<p>At that moment, Song Wuchen was sitting not far from Felicitous Rain Lord. When he heard the two words, 'personal disciple', his brain felt like it had been struck by a sledgehammer. Immediately, his brain went blank as his ears buzzed.</p>
<p>He was previously worried that when Yi Yun became an in-name disciple, he would be valued greatly by Felicitous Rain Lord and eventually reach the position of personal disciple. But he never expected that now, Felicitous Rain Lord was immediately giving Yi Yun the title of personal disciple!</p>
<p>The thing that he was most worried about had happened. Song Wuchen felt his chest turn heavy as he became short of breath. His heart was filled with anger and disgruntlement, but Yi Yun's tremendous talent left him completely unsure as to how to beat him.</p>
<p>To gain the personal guidance of a Divine Lord, the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', as well as top-grade resources, how far could Yi Yun mature considering his rare talent?</p>
<p>It was completely unimaginable.</p>
<p>“Could Yi Yun become a Divine Lord?” A Oracle Fey Kingdom prince said in a daze.</p>
<p>He knew that the moment that Yi Yun became a personal disciple of a Divine Lord, his status would far exceed any prince or princess in the six-country alliance. As for a successor to a large family clan, they were just a joke when compared to Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, they felt that Yi Yun had no background, but now… with Felicitous Rain Lord propping him up, his background and status were several times stronger than them. These made the Oracle Fey Kingdom prince feel greatly depressed.</p>
<p>“Become the next Divine Lord? It wouldn't be that easy. Since time immemorial, the number of Divine Lords that exist in the same era is basically fixed. The chances of a Divine Lord's disciple becoming a Divine Lord as well is extremely small.” Someone else said.</p>
<p>However, they all knew that even if Yi Yun could not become a Divine Lord in the future, he was bound to be an existence only second to a Divine Lord. He would be something far beyond their reach.</p>
<p>“Thank you senior for his appreciation. This junior is willing!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave a bow meant for acknowledging a master. Indeed, Yi Yun would not be willing if it was to become Felicitous Rain Lord's in-name disciple. But a personal disciple was completely different. Up to now, Yi Yun's practice of martial arts might have given him powerful inheritances, but he lacked a true master that could give him systematic advice when it came to martial arts.</p>
<p>It could be said to be extremely timely to gain the advice of Felicitous Rain Lord before he condensed his Dao fruits.</p>
<p>Chapter 988: Azure Wood Great World</p>
<p>At that moment, Felicitous Rain Lord floated down from Star Picking Court and landed beside Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord glanced at Yi Yun, whose Yuan Qi was depleted, before saying, “Let's go.”</p>
<p>Thousands of water droplets appeared out of nowhere as they enveloped Yi Yun and Felicitous Rain Lord's figures. Following that, Yi Yun felt the world in front of him turn into a blur.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of warriors witnessed the scene of Yi Yun being taken away by Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun has left.”</p>
<p>“He shall become a dragon from now onwards.”</p>
<p>For a period of time, the warriors stared at the spot where Yi Yun had disappeared.</p>
<p>Although they had failed to stand on the stage of an era, they had witnessed Yi Yun's ascension.</p>
<p>Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi were feeling all sorts of emotions.</p>
<p>The result made them feel relieved and gratified.</p>
<p>At that moment, Fairy Ningshuang stood up as well.</p>
<p>She glanced at Song Wuchen and said lightly, “There's no need for you to return. Go to Heaven's Door Cliff and reflect for three years.”</p>
<p>Song Wuchen felt his body quiver. He looked gloomy as he lowered his head bitterly.</p>
<p>He had been punished by Fairy Ningshuang not because he had targeted Yi Yun. Felicitous Rain Lord had always tacitly consented to competition between disciples. The crux of the issue was that he had screwed up terribly during the first assessment. Regardless of the reason for the screw-up, the outcome was a result of him not being capable enough. That was the reason why he was punished.</p>
<p>As for his number one spot as an in-name disciple, it was most likely not going to be his any longer. He no longer even dared to compete with Yi Yun. The main issue was that other in-name disciples could possibly surpass him as well.</p>
<p>“Chi Zhuiyun.” Fairy Ningshuang moved in front of Chi Zhuiyun as a shadow appeared from beneath her feet before it enveloped the region where she and Chi Zhuiyun were standing.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun gave a polite gesture as he felt the ground beneath him disappear. Following that, he was devoured by the shadow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A few seconds later, Yi Yun's eyes lit up as his feet landed on solid rock.</p>
<p>In front of him was a long stretch of misty mountains whose had peaks pierced through the clouds.</p>
<p>“This is the floating island that I live on.” Felicitous Rain Lord's figure appeared behind him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had previously heard that Felicitous Rain Lord lived on an independent floating island. It was tens of millions of miles away from where the Oracle Fey Kingdom was.</p>
<p>His ability to travel such a large distance in the blink of an eye through such miraculous power and without a spirit cruiser indicated how unimaginable the level of a Divine Lord was.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord looked at Yi Yun and said, “There's no need for you to be overly restrained. I'm not particular when it comes to etiquette. Let's wait for another person.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised but at that moment, a tumultuous voice came from afar. “Felicitous Rain!”</p>
<p>At the instant the voice reached them, a figure landed in front of Yi Yun and Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng!</p>
<p>When Yi Yun saw Old Man Changsheng, he immediately recalled the threatening voice transmission that he had previously received.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was still delighted to see him.</p>
<p>Shi Fei and Shi Ping had both been severely injured. The Helltoothed Dao Tapir had also been injured, while Old Man Changsheng's face was livid and so gloomy that it could probably produce rain clouds.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord said, “You can now talk about the matter that you came to discuss with me. You wouldn't have especially come just for the participation of two disciples in my disciple recruitment.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Felicitous Rain Lord mention Shi Fei and Shi Ping, Old Man Changsheng's expression turned even uglier. He obviously did not come this far for the duo, but it still pissed him off that the minor mission had failed.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised while he was listening on the side. From the looks of it, the assessment was a minor matter. The reason why Shi Changsheng came was to represent the Immortal Rain Sect in a discussion over something important with Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“It's information regarding the Sinkhole,” said Old Man Changsheng.</p>
<p>Sinkhole?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's heart stirred when he heard that. He had long known about the Sinkhole.</p>
<p>The Azure Yang Lord had previously mistakenly entered the Tian Yuan world through the Sinkhole. The Fey Phantasm Sect was also in the Sinkhole. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, the Sinkhole was a dangerous and mysterious location.</p>
<p>An odd glint flashed in Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes.</p>
<p>“The location of the Azure Wood Great World has been found. However, there is an intense spatial turbulence around it. In the coming years, the spatial turbulence should weaken for a period of time. Felicitous Rain, you are proficient in space-time Dao, so it wouldn't be a problem for you to enter it during its weak phase,” said Old Man Changsheng.</p>
<p>“In its weak phase, even people with average proficiency in space-time can enter,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment before he looked at Old Man Changsheng and said, “This piece of news is still pretty good. However, other than the Immortal Rain Sect, there should be several large sects and Fey empires that are already aware of this, right?”</p>
<p>He glanced at Shi Changsheng and lightly said, “Even if you did not especially come to inform me about it, this piece of news would still quickly reach me.”</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain, you are the first to know ever since we received the information. Furthermore, we will obtain even more information regarding the Azure Wood Great World which we can share with you. It will be a cooperation, where we would borrow your spatial-temporal laws as well as use the Immortal Rain Sect's information and faction network to garner mutual benefits,” said Old Man Changsheng.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the Immortal Rain Sect was making a trade with Felicitous Rain Lord by informing him.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord could not deny it as he looked into the distance and said, “You can leave.”</p>
<p>Old Man Changsheng hesitated for a moment before saying, “Felicitous Rain, there are certain relations that cannot be completely severed.”</p>
<p>He knew Felicitous Rain Lord's character. Even without any promises, he would usually do a fair trade of giving and taking.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Old Man Changsheng glanced at Yi Yun. His gaze had a forbidding look.</p>
<p>That junior!</p>
<p>If it wasn't for that junior, he would not have shamed the Immortal Rain Sect in front of so many backwater warriors.</p>
<p>After returning, he wouldn't know how long he would be mocked for by the other old fogies.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he remained composed. What's the point of staring at me when you lack the ability to make a move?</p>
<p>“Senior Changsheng, there's no need to keep looking at this junior. It's best that you hurry and treat the two Immortal Rain Sect disciples. More can be redeemed the earlier it is.” Yi Yun said with a smile. Shi Changsheng's expression sank as he was infuriated by Yi Yun. With a forceful flick of his sleeve, he flew away.</p>
<p>To engage in a war of words with a junior… was below his status. However he had already suffered a setback and being derided by a junior, Shi Changsheng found it impossible to stomach an insult like that.</p>
<p>After Shi Changsheng left, Felicitous Rain Lord gave Yi Yun a smiling glance. “You really aren't afraid of Shi Changsheng at all. That attitude of yours is quite a show, and it would be easy for you to suffer when you travel throughout the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, however… it is to my liking.”</p>
<p>The decision that Felicitous Rain Lord made of taking Yi Yun in as a personal disciple stemmed not only from Yi Yun's talent but also because he appreciated Yi Yun's attitude. “Have you heard of the Azure Wood Great World?”</p>
<p>“This junior has never heard of it.” Yi Yun shook his head.</p>
<p>“It's normal. This name has disappeared for more than a hundred million years,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. “Time is like a flowing river. Everything and anything can be washed away by that river. The Azure Wood Great World was once much more powerful than the Immortal Rain Sect. It was one of the most powerful worlds in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. It once produced a figure that shook the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. Unfortunately, its brilliance didn't last that long.”</p>
<p>Once produced a figure that shook the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven?</p>
<p>What sort of existence could it be for Felicitous Rain Lord to evaluate it as 'shaking the entire Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven'? Yet, such a world eventually waned?</p>
<p>“In a few years, I'll likely have to leave and enter the Azure Wood Great World. The amount of time needed is unknown, but in these few years, I'll stay behind on this floating island and impart martial studies to you,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Only a few years time?</p>
<p>Yi Yun's expression turned serious. A few years was too short for warriors.</p>
<p>However, gaining a few years of guidance from a Divine Lord was a huge opportunity that countless warriors could not even dream of.</p>
<p>“When the time comes, I'll impart cultivation techniques that go from the Dao Manifestation realm all the way to the Dao Palace realm to you, give you the treasured canons that I have stashed away and provide you sufficient resources to support your cultivation,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord felt somewhat apologetic. Back then, he had set a standard for Yi Yun, while Yi Yun had passed his assessment. Yi Yun had undergone all sorts of dangers, to the point of risking his life, to finally become his disciple. Unfortunately, he had to enter the Azure Wood Great World in a few years time.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for that matter, he would focus on Yi Yun and guide him for a century.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun felt that as a master, Felicitous Rain Lord was already considered to be very responsible. He knew that many mighty figures would spare very little time on guiding the disciples that they took in. They would frequently enter seclusion by themselves, making it difficult for those disciples to meet their masters even once. Just as the saying goes — you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink it.</p>
<p>Chapter 989: Book of Heaven's Advent</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, accompany me to the Felicitous Rain Abode. The abode only permits entry to me and Ningshuang. But since you have become my personal disciple, you can enter it as well,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned curious. Felicitous Rain Lord had constructed an additional abode on the floating island?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a flick of a sleeve, the sight in front of Yi Yun's eyes turned blurry. He sensed space distorting and at the next moment, he had entered a space with a door behind him.</p>
<p>“This is?” Yi Yun immediately looked around when he found his footing.</p>
<p>It was a massive and lofty abode. Past the door was a vast world, with a tremendous immortal mountain. In the clouds, there was a palace that could be vaguely seen. A terrifying pressure emanated inside the abode, and the immortal mountain contributed the most to the pressure.</p>
<p>“That is where the remnant pages of the Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon are stored,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. “This is an abode that I obtained from an enemy a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Obtained from an enemy? For a person to possess such an abode, he would definitely be an extraordinary Supremacy even if he wasn't a Divine Lord. Felicitous Rain Lord had only become a Divine Lord recently, so it was very likely that the abode had been obtained before he became a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>The Azure Yang Lord and the Great Empress had left behind a similar abode in the Tian Yuan world. As for the Pure Yang Sword Palace's owner's abode, it was a fragment of a world. It was much larger and majestic than the two abodes, so it was unknown how powerful the Pure Yang Sword Palace's owner was.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the abode, Yi Yun felt his heart stir. A portable abode like that was extremely convenient. By bringing such an abode with him, he could go anywhere in the expansive world.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord read Yi Yun's thoughts as he said with a laugh, “It's good for a warrior to have ambition. With strength, an abode is nothing. When you are out traveling, you will encounter many wealthy people that will end up courting their own deaths.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was unsure how to respond when he heard that. Felicitous Rain Lord was frank and casual — they were obvious traits from the way that he did not put on airs with his disciple.</p>
<p>“I watched your assessment, so I understand your martial path, laws, and talent well. Your Dao Domain is very special as it contains the concept of Destruction! But your cultivation technique and foundation no longer can keep up with the rest,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>His test of Yi Yun was not only to see how Yi Yun passed the assessment but more importantly, it was for him to observe the strengths and weaknesses of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>A Divine Lord had a long lifespan, but the number of personal disciples that they would recruit wasn't a large number.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's cultivation technique was the Great Empress Heart Sutra, which was a top cultivation technique in the Tian Yuan world. But with Yi Yun's growth in strength, and the changes in his martial arts, the Great Empress Heart Sutra was gradually becoming unsuitable for him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun wanted a master precisely for cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord took the lead as he said, “Follow me.”</p>
<p>The lush immortal mountain had a towering palace compound, and Felicitous Rain Lord led Yi Yun through the maze of palaces before entering a large and opulent palace.</p>
<p>Upon entering it, Yi Yun was immediately attracted by what he saw.</p>
<p>There were countless books flying mid-air. These books released powerful shock waves that stopped Yi Yun from having the urge to pick any one of them for reading.</p>
<p>The flying books were all sealed.</p>
<p>“The cultivation technique books here were collected by me over the years. Some come from the heritage of sects or martial arts of family clans. There are more than ten thousand books here,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was secretly appalled. That was a lot!</p>
<p>A Divine Lord's book collection was unimaginably huge.</p>
<p>Once a Divine Lord like that established his own sect, he could immediately create a mighty faction.</p>
<p>“I have read all of these cultivation technique books,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Who knew how much time he took to read them all.</p>
<p>“There is no need for you to be anxious about the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon' for the moment as they are too profound for you. Furthermore, it has missing pages. What you need now is a complete and systemic cultivation technique.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord said this, he stretched his hand out to grab at the flying books. Immediately, a few books floated in front of him.</p>
<p>“This 'Heavenfire Burning Solar Sutra' is a heritage cultivation technique of the Golden Crow clan. You possess a pure Yang body which makes it very suitable for you to cultivate it. This cultivation technique has an indomitable style which is brutal and ferocious. The Golden Crow clansmen that cultivate this technique are known as Berserkers, characterized by their red hair and crimson eyes. They are all burly and courageous, so in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, they are often hired by people to participate in wars.” Felicitous Rain Lord introduced.</p>
<p>Berserker? Yi Yun imagined himself with red hair and bulky muscles… That cultivation technique seemed to suit Chi Zhuiyun better.</p>
<p>“This 'Sacred Blood Sutra' takes a strange path. Once you attain a profound level in it, your whereabouts will be unknown and unpredictable. In times of need, you can burn your blood essence and produce a strike that far exceeds your limits. In the future, when you are out traveling, there will be many times that your life will be on the line.”</p>
<p>It was a cultivation technique to protect one's life.</p>
<p>The cultivation technique was not bad, but Yi Yun was hesitant about it. As a warrior, he preferred to take a more orthodox path. It was the best way after all.</p>
<p>It was not his goal to practice martial arts to constantly think about escaping or surviving.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord noticed how Yi Yun had no interest in the 'Sacred Blood Sutra' before he nodded and said, “By choosing this, it will suit your situation. But by not choosing it, it suits my intentions as well.”</p>
<p>As a newly risen Divine Lord, Felicitous Rain Lord had no lack of instances when he killed people. His martial path was one about settling grievances and vengeance quickly.</p>
<p>“This manual comes from a peerless figure that once ruled over the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven… ”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord took out an ancient stone disc and said, “If you are interested, you can attempt it. As for its strength, it's hard to tell if it's strong or not.”</p>
<p>There was such a cultivation technique? Even a Divine Lord could not tell?</p>
<p>Yi Yun curiously looked at the stone disc.</p>
<p>“It's called the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. It is a cultivation technique that deals with time. I too have some attainments in the Dao of time, but my Dao of time comes from another cultivation technique, so it's already too late to change.”</p>
<p>“The Dao of space-time is unpredictable in its changes. Time existed ever since the birth of the Universe, that is why it's called 'Heaven's Advent'.”</p>
<p>“Time will not stop because of the death of people or the annihilation of matter, unless, the entire Universe is completely destroyed. That will be 'Heaven's End'.”</p>
<p>“From Heaven's advent to Heaven's end, the 'Book of Heaven's Advent' is the beginning of time for the Universe.”</p>
<p>“Many warriors have talent in martial arts but they find it difficult to progress when it comes to the Dao of space-time. That's the reason why I said that it is hard to tell if it's strong or not,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. “You can try taking a look at it first.”</p>
<p>The Dao of space-time was the unification of two systems. Be it space or time, just any one of them was a Great Dao. Many warriors wished to grasp any of one them, but the amount that they could grasp was minute. Felicitous Rain Lord wanted Yi Yun to take a look at it to show him its difficulty as well.</p>
<p>Yi Yun took the 'Book of Heaven's Advent' disc and as he directed his perception into it, he immediately felt like the world had flipped over. The celestial bodies were constantly revolving as his ears heard a rustling sound that resembled falling sand.</p>
<p>A surging river appeared. It was the River of Forgetfulness. And in it were countless figures. Scenes of their experiences from life to death quickly flashed inside the River of Forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Yi Yun even saw the birth of the Universe. After a tremendous big bang, the nebulous Chaos appeared. Chaos Stones floated inside the nebula, with some of them forming landmasses, while others gave birth to the earliest Ancient Fey.</p>
<p>They quickly combined to form large worlds, but later on, the worlds collapsed, putting an end to life. Everything returned to nothingness once again.</p>
<p>Yi Yun watched the scenes one after another. At the beginning, his feelings were constantly influenced by what he saw, but slowly, he seemed to extricate himself from them and watched the scenes as a third party.</p>
<p>In the Tian Yuan world, Yi Yun had previously gained insight in the Dao of space during his battle with the Black-armored Demon God. Now, it was the Dao of time.</p>
<p>The things in front of him turned blurry as Yi Yun returned to the interior of the palace once again. He was still maintaining the movement that he did previously, while his hand was still carrying the Book of Heaven's Advent. Everything that he had just experienced was just an illusion.</p>
<p>Chapter 990: Sword of Time</p>
<p>Yi Yun immersed himself in the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. A tiny portion of what was recorded on the stone disc was text, but most of it was filled with scenes of the samsara of all matter that manifested the Dao of Time.</p>
<p>Time gradually passed, as Felicitous Rain Lord waited by the side. He sensed that Yi Yun had gained certain insights, so he did not disturb him.</p>
<p>Six hours later, Yi Yun opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“What did you see?” asked Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Yi Yun put his hand out and tapped the void with a finger.</p>
<p>Immediately, the concept of Withering appeared on his finger tip, as a dull and arid aura emanated from it.</p>
<p>A look of surprise flashed in Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes.</p>
<p>“This is the Withering concept that this disciple grasped by a matter of chance,” said Yi Yun. “Time permeates everything. A Destruction Dao Domain represents the end of time, while the Withering concept has the elapsing of time.”</p>
<p>The Withering concept was something that Yi Yun comprehended in front of the Dao Tree in the Pure Yang Sword Palace. After that, he had absorbed the Death Soulwood, but after he came to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, his Withering concept began to appear to lack in power. Without any improvement to the concept, it could no longer keep up with his strength.</p>
<p>But now, Yi Yun had freely produced the Withering concept as his heart wished.</p>
<p>“Not bad, Yi Yun. For you to have such insights, and you having grasped the Withering concept, it looks like there's no need to choose.” Felicitous Rain Lord gave Yi Yun a satisfied look. As a Divine Lord that was proficient in the Dao of Time, Felicitous Rain Lord possessed great talent in the Dao of Time, but he had never thought of finding a disciple that was similarly highly talented in the Dao of Time.</p>
<p>Finding a personal disciple was not easy in the first place, so to find someone with the same talent would be too much to ask for.</p>
<p>“You must be prepared to undergo arduous cultivation,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. “The Dao of Time is abstruse and profound. Although it is said that every Dao can gain an inkling of the Origins of the Universe when they reach a high attainment, I believe that the Dao of Time is one of the Great Dao that is closest to the Origins.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded. His Withering concept had been something that he comprehended after experiencing the life of a Dao Leaf from the Pure Yang Sword Palace Dao Tree.</p>
<p>“Then, I shall choose this 'Book of Heaven's Advent',” said Yi Yun.</p>
<p>With the 'Book of Heaven's Advent' in hand, he felt that it resonated with him.</p>
<p>“Good, then I'll teach you a set of sword techniques. I originally believed that this set of sword techniques might not be suitable for you, but since you possess the Withering concept and are also about to cultivate in the Dao of Time, you can give the sword techniques a try,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. However, he did not produce a manual.</p>
<p>He made a few hand seals as a small and shimmering sword appeared. With a swish, the sword shot straight at Yi Yun's glabella.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's heart leaped. “That is?!”</p>
<p>The tiny sword showed no animosity, so Yi Yun allowed the tiny sword to pierce his glabella. Immediately, there was a loud bang!</p>
<p>Like a tumultuous thunder, Yi Yun felt his entire soul sea reverberate. At that instant, Yi Yun looked like he arrived at a world formed from sword Qi.</p>
<p>As though he was standing in the void of space, everything around him was surging with sword Qi.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's voice seemed to come from an ancient world. “This is the core set of sword techniques in the heritage that I have learned. Its owner was the strongest Divine Lord that previously cultivated in the Dao of Time. The sword technique's name is the 'Three-foot Passing Sword'.”</p>
<p>“Time flies like an arrow and the lives of people curve like bows!”</p>
<p>“This set of sword techniques does not have a manual, it only has scenes of the swordplay. Watch well!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a swift sword beam shot from afar. Immediately, the firmaments trembled as the void shattered. The sword beam seemed to possess the most heartlessness of time. As though time was shuttling past, it looked distant but also in close proximity at the blink of an eye. Wherever it passed, space would collapse, turning everything to dust.</p>
<p>“This strike's name is the Sword of Time!”</p>
<p>Sword of Time!</p>
<p>Yi Yun was astounded. Previously, the Pure Yang Sword Palace's owner's strike was very powerful as well, but all Yi Yun saw was the scars of the strike. Now, he could see a strike with his own eyes!</p>
<p>Experiencing the terror of that strike himself gave Yi Yun the feeling that it was completely different to a sword scar.</p>
<p>This was the difference between having a true master and picking up an inheritance.</p>
<p>The Sword of Time did not slash physical embodiments, it slashed their vitality!</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The terrifying sword beams caused the world to constantly collapse. Yi Yun's soul sea could not withstand it either as his consciousness underwent tremors. He awoke from the world of sword Qi.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun realized that there was an additional small sword in his soul sea. It was the cultivation technique inheritance that Felicitous Rain Lord left behind.</p>
<p>The Purple Crystal's ability automatically swept past the sword. There was no consciousness imbued in it, only a cultivation technique.</p>
<p>“One shouldn't bite more than he can chew. Begin cultivating the Book of Heaven's Advent first as well as the first strike of the 'Three-foot Passing Sword' — Sword of Time.”</p>
<p>“There won't be anyone disturbing you in the abode. You can cultivate in Spirit Gathering Palace.”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's abode was extremely expansive. There were many palaces, and Spirit Gathering Palace was one of them.</p>
<p>When Yi Yun reached Spirit Gathering Palace, he realized that the palace was enveloped by Yuan Qi. It was likely because of the spirit gathering array that resulted in it being misty and blurry.</p>
<p>“I wonder how far he can go in the next couple of years.” Felicitous Rain Lord watched from afar as Yi Yun entered Spirit Gathering Palace. His expression revealed a reflective look.</p>
<p>“Azure Wood Great World… ”</p>
<p>At that moment, an aloof and beautiful figure gradually appeared behind Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“Where's Chi Zhuiyun?” asked Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Chi Zhuiyun was only an in-name disciple, so there was no need for him to personally impart cultivation techniques to him. However, Felicitous Rain Lord would also inquire about him.</p>
<p>“He has already taken up residence on the island. I got Tian Xun to impart cultivation techniques to him. I'll give him advice from time to time,” said Fairy Ningshuang.</p>
<p>She traced Felicitous Rain Lord's gaze and looked at Spirit Gathering Palace. She said in surprise, “Yi Yun has already begun entering reclusive training?” She looked at Felicitous Rain Lord again and said, “Why?”</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang had followed Felicitous Rain Lord by his side for tens of thousands of years, so she was very familiar with his personality.</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Great World is about to open. Shi Changsheng represented the Immortal Rain Sect when he provided me with the news. This time, I believe that there will be many people heading for it,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>The last time that he entered the Azure Wood Great World, it was still a very concealed location. Many people did not know of the situation inside, but after the first experience, there would definitely be many people entering it when it opened a second time.</p>
<p>“When the time comes for me to go, I have no idea how long it will take for me to come back. I only have these couple of years to teach Yi Yun. I wonder how much he will learn?”</p>
<p>Having taught him the Three-foot Passage Sword… was equivalent to passing on his mantle. As for the remnant pages of the 'Ten Thousand Fey Divine Canon', it was not something that could be learned if one lacked the strength.</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Great World… join me on the expedition,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. Fairy Ningshuang had accompanied Felicitous Rain Lord to many places before. “Maybe there will be an opportunity that we will find in there for you to make a breakthrough.”</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang nodded gently. Many years ago, she had suffered a near-death experience, and although she eventually became a Supremacy through Felicitous Rain Lord's help, she failed to improve any further.</p>
<p>In the Azure Wood Great World, there might be a possibility for her to break the shackles. Even if she did not find anything, it did not matter. Being able to travel the world with Felicitous Rain Lord was what she was most content with.</p>
<p>Chapter 991: Preparation for Dao Manifestation</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never exited Spirit Gathering Palace ever since he entered it.</p>
<p>The 'Book of Heaven's Advent' floated in front of him while his his eyes were tightly shut.</p>
<p>And around Yi Yun, there were occasional images that flashed.</p>
<p>Cultivation knew nothing about time. Furthermore, when it came to cultivating the Dao of Time at the level of the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', even if many warriors were given the opportunity to read the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', it would be like they were reading an indecipherable book, leaving them baffled.</p>
<p>And most terrifying of all was that when cultivating the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', they would immerse themselves into the turbulence of time, losing themselves. Time might pass in a flash and by the time they awaken, too much time would have passed but they would've gained nothing to speak of!</p>
<p>That was the most horrifying matter regarding the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. It was also something that Felicitous Rain Lord pondered deeply over before he allowed Yi Yun to cultivate the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was in no hurry to immediately begin cultivating the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. Instead, he immersed himself in the passage of time, and from there, comprehend the meaning of time. Slowly, he felt he himself become an embodiment of time.</p>
<p>The flashing figures were of no importance to Yi Yun, they were just scenes that had previously appeared in the Spirit Gathering Palace as vestiges of time.</p>
<p>Yi Yun also saw his past, as well as people that he happened to chance upon, as well as their past.</p>
<p>Everyone had their own time, but time treated everyone equally.</p>
<p>Powerful warriors possessed extended lifespans, but the worlds that they resided in could be destroyed. They would also slowly wane over a long process. There was no such thing as true eternity.</p>
<p>Phew—</p>
<p>Yi Yun breathed out while in his meditation.</p>
<p>The air that he spewed out was at times fast and at times slow. It would flow backwards sometimes when he breathed out.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's body also began to undergo changes. His appearance returned to point of when he looked even younger, but it kept switching back to his original appearance. He went from a nascent look to a sharp look, and from a sharp look to a genteel look, and from a genteel look back to a nascent look. It kept repeating.</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly opened his eyes!</p>
<p>“So that is how it is. By training one's body to become an embodiment of time before cultivating the Three-foot Passage Sword, it would be perfection.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was thankful for Felicitous Rain Lord's arrangements. The cultivation technique and sword technique supplemented each other and by combining both together, it would be extremely powerful once mastered.</p>
<p>The 'Book of Heaven's Advent' had five stages, but the breakthrough of every stage required a great deal of time and it was extremely difficult. Furthermore, the cultivation of each stage had a corresponding minimum level of cultivation needed.</p>
<p>“The first stage requires Dao Manifestation, but despite not having broken through to the Dao Manifestation realm, my Yuan Qi intensity is already sufficient. Even if it's not enough, consuming some relics and herbs would do.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun took some relics and the spirit herb that he had obtained from the Door of Misty Rain out of his interspacial ring.</p>
<p>The spirit herb was supreme-grade to begin with. Many warriors coveted it during the assessment. Even Tianya Haoyue wanted one for his breakthrough to the Dao Manifestation realm. However, those people would never have thought that Yi Yun would use it for the cultivation of a cultivation technique.</p>
<p>Looking at the 'Book of Heaven's Advent' in front of him, Yi Yun stopped moving as memories flashed past his mind.</p>
<p>By cultivating the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' would become his past.</p>
<p>Back in the Tian Yuan world, he had dual cultivated the 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' with Lin Xintong. All those scenes had surfaced in Yi Yun's eyes a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Now that I've become a Divine Lord's disciple, cultivating the 'Book of Heaven's Advent' will be the moment that I truly move up to the upper echelons of the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven ever since I came here.”</p>
<p>“Xintong, no matter where you are, I will find you, even if the 12 Empyrean Heavens are vast and with danger lurking at every turn.”</p>
<p>“Time to begin. This reclusion is for me to finish cultivating the first stage of the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. I wonder how long it will take. Without any talent, it would be difficult to comprehend it using an entire lifetime. There might be a possible of losing myself in the turbulence of time, never to awaken!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun closed his eyes and a fluctuation appeared from the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'. A abstruse aura that seemed to come from a remote past began to swirl around Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Slowly, the entire Spirit Gathering Palace was enveloped by the aura.</p>
<p>The Spirit Gathering Palace began phasing in and out of existence. At times, it would look normal, and at other times, it would look like a ruin.</p>
<p>Time was formless but the changes that it brought were tangible.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's Yuan Qi draining away, the spirit herbs beside him flew up. They gathered together mid-air to produce drips of spirit fluid that dripped into Yi Yun's body.</p>
<p>Immediately, Yuan Qi surged as Yi Yun's skin effused a glow.</p>
<p>But Yi Yun, who was busy cultivating, did not seem to know anything about this.</p>
<p>As though he had manifested himself as sand, he quietly witnessed the passage of time.</p>
<p>The 'Great Empress Heart Sutra' Yuan Qi in Yi Yun's body was slowly replaced by the abstruse aura, as his bearing also began changing.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>Yi Yun continued to keep his eyes closed, but a sword beam flashed around him.</p>
<p>While cultivating the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', he understood the existence of time, while he simultaneously cultivated the Three-foot Passage Sword.</p>
<p>Runes even began to appear beneath Yi Yun. These runes gradually came together and formed the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>The 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence was the highest martial art that Yi Yun had learned up to date. It represented the Major Dao of Destruction, but it did not mean that it was immutable. Yi Yun could inject the Dao that he had into the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence.</p>
<p>The Dao of Time runes were like vestiges of all matter that landed on the river of time. From the Cloud Wilderness to the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, whatever Yi Yun had seen and experienced formed into pieces of those fragments.</p>
<p>After these fragments were added to the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence, it made the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence look as though it was a wheel of time that bore the load of endless history.</p>
<p>The wheel of time transformed into a sword beam as it slashed out in front of Yi Yun. It was silent and left no trace, but after the sword beam slashed, the ground in front of Yi Yun cracked. It was covered in moss that spread out for a thousand feet.</p>
<p>But due to the palace array's workings, the crack gradually repaired itself.</p>
<p>The years flew by by without one knowing how long had passed.</p>
<p>Only at an unexpected moment did Yi Yun suddenly open his eyes.</p>
<p>In his eyes, it was like there was a passage of time that was like surging water. And his aura seemed to have additional feeling of time.</p>
<p>He seemed to be immersed in the world, and was part of the world.</p>
<p>“The first stage of the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'… completed.” Yi Yun breathed out lightly.</p>
<p>He looked at the relics and spirit herbs on the ground that had been completely consumed.</p>
<p>As for his hair, it had become a lot longer.</p>
<p>“How long has it been? Two years? Three?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun did not know. While cultivating the laws of time, the passage of time had turned into oblivion. That was the profound mystery of the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'.</p>
<p>Yi Yun circulated the Yuan Qi in his body. He could clearly sense the transformations in his body. The boundless Yuan Qi in his body surged out like a river, but it felt like there was something imperfect about it.</p>
<p>“This tiny bit of imperfection might be a result of me not having manifested my Dao or have any Dao fruits.”</p>
<p>“Should I manifest my Dao?”</p>
<p>Such a thought flashed in Yi Yun's mind.</p>
<p>He felt that he had already finished all of his preparations.</p>
<p>His Yuan Qi was brimming and everything had reached its peak.</p>
<p>Having redone his cultivation, all of the martial arts that he had grasped were perfectly merged with the 'Book of Heaven's Advent'.</p>
<p>Yi Yun would improve in his realm by manifesting his Dao.</p>
<p>It could be said that be everything was perfect when it came to timing, location and person.</p>
<p>“Time to manifest my Dao!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun sat back down on the ground. In Spirit Gathering Palace, he was determined to manifest his Dao fruits in one fell swoop and break through to the Dao Manifestation realm!</p>
<p>By stepping onto the path of heaven ascension, and manifesting his own Great Dao!</p>
<p>What warriors practiced wasn't martial arts, but their fates.</p>
<p>As a mortal, he wanted to go against the heavens.</p>
<p>Past thoughts flashed in Yi Yun's mind as his aura began to rise.</p>
<p>In the abode, Felicitous Rain Lord, who was meditating, opened his eyes and looked at Spirit Gathering Palace.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's aura was increasing in intensity. The sky above the Spirit Gathering Palace was filled with wind and clouds, but as immense Heaven Earth Yuan Qi gathered, it swept all the lingering fog around the immortal mountain away.</p>
<p>The Heaven Earth Yuan Qi circulated to form a wheel of time, and in the wheel, there were sword beams flying around it with golden light flashing.</p>
<p>“He's manifesting his Dao.” Felicitous Rain Lord watched quietly. “I wonder what that child's Dao fruits will be like?”</p>
<p>Chapter 992: Great Dao Dao Fruits</p>
<p>The cultivation of a warrior went from the planting of a Dao Seed, and the growth of a Dao Tree, to the bearing of fruits from the Dao Tree. It was an accumulation of the insights that a warrior had in martial arts and of nature. It was also the record of a warrior's life.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had experienced a great deal throughout his journey.</p>
<p>But in the river of time, everything appeared too short and fleeting.</p>
<p>“In the Tai Ah Divine City, I cultivated in the 'Tai Ah Sacred Technique'. In the Pure Yang Sword Palace, I fused with the Golden Crow, and in the Great Empress mystic realm, I tempered myself in lava, eventually attaining pure Yang… My pure Yang laws have accompanied me to date. As such, it can condense a Dao fruit.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A radiant sun appeared behind Yi Yun. The phantom image of the Tang Valley burst forth as the Golden Crow spread its wings and issued a loud screech. Its massive golden wings were like burning flames that could burn through everything.</p>
<p>These formed Dao runes that were filled with the profound aura of the Universe before they gradually merged into one. They formed a tiny ball that was bustling with life as it constantly spun.</p>
<p>The golden ball had totems of the radiant sun and Golden Crow engraved on the surface, and within the ball, it contained explosive power. It was Yi Yun's pure Yang Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Dao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things.</p>
<p>The 'Two' referred to Yin and Yang. At the beginning of the Universe, Chaos was first born before it split into Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang was a Great Dao!</p>
<p>Solitary Yang could not exist, so although Yi Yun cultivated in pure Yang laws, he had fused in a bit of the Yin that Lin Xintong had cultivated. This allowed Yi Yun's pure Yang Dao fruit to be closer to perfection.</p>
<p>“In the Pure Yang Sword Palace, I gained insight into the concept of Withering. In the life-and-death battle with the Black-armored Demon God, I was trapped by the Black-armored Demon God in an alternate spatial dimension. There I gained insights into the Dao of Space. I took Felicitous Rain Lord as my master and cultivated in the 'Book of Heaven's Advent', transforming the 10000 Demon Wheel of Existence into a wheel of time. On the Dao of Space and Time, I have traveled far with opportunities and attainments.”</p>
<p>Mysterious runes flew out of Yi Yun's body as they gathered together while in revolving in flux. Inside, there were celestial bodies that seemed to spin with the runes, as though they formed a small universe by itself. An ancient and immense aura emanated out of the newly condensed Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Not long later, the laws of space-time gradually manifested into Dao.</p>
<p>The Space-time Withering Dao fruit and pure Yang Dao fruit were side by side. They seemed to attract each other, but they also maintained a tiny bit of distance while they revolved like the real constellations.</p>
<p>Yi Yun continued to condense his next Dao fruit. An aura constantly separated from his body. The aura was not only a law, it was also the experiences and memories that Yi Yun had ever since he cultivated in martial arts. They all gathered together to produce a Dao fruit.</p>
<p>In his memory, Yi Yun seemed to see the scene of him standing in front of the statue of the Pure Yang Sword Palace's owner. The endless sword scar seemed to be stabbing his eyes.</p>
<p>“Pure Yang Sword Scar and Three-foot Passage Sword. My Sword Dao is where the heart lies. It proceeds in an indomitable fashion.”</p>
<p>Two tiny sword scars appeared as they intermingled mid-air before forming the shadow of a sword. In the shadow of the sword was the figure of Yi Yun when he used the sword.</p>
<p>That was Yi Yun's Sword Dao Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Finally, it was the Major Destruction Dao fruit!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Major Destruction Dao Domain had even visibly moved Felicitous Rain Lord. Everything in the world, be it space-time, Yin-Yang, or the Universe would eventually head towards destruction. There was nothing that was eternal.</p>
<p>Space-time and Yin-Yang were both Great Dao. They were close to the Origins, but the Major Dao of Destruction was one of the Great Dao of Supremacy.</p>
<p>Or perhaps 'one of' was not accurate, because up to date, there were only two Great Dao of Supremacy —</p>
<p>Chaos during the birth of the Universe!</p>
<p>Major Destruction during the annihilation of the Universe!</p>
<p>The closer a Great Dao was to the Origins, the harder it was to cultivate it. It would also naturally be harder to condense a Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had spent a good deal of time to condense his Space-time Withering Dao fruit, but the amount of time he used to condensed the Major Destruction Dao fruit was even longer.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Yuan Qi was nearly fully depleted as he took out the ten-thousand-year-old Seven Heart Flower that he had obtained from the Door of Misty Rain.</p>
<p>It was extremely difficult for a warrior to manifest his or her Dao, and during the process, a warrior's Yuan Qi could not be replenished. To manifest one's Dao fruit needed one to nearly deplete all of the Yuan Qi that they had as one gathered all of one's insights. This process could only be done in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Above Spirit Gathering Palace, the increasing aura mixed with the aura of the Dao fruits. A sense of profoundness exuded throughout Spirit Gathering Palace as various celestial phenomena happened.</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang had also come as she stood beside Felicitous Rain Lord, watching the scene.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun's Dao fruits have a very impressive feel to them,” said Fairy Ningshuang in a moment of reflection.</p>
<p>She did not produce such phenomena back when she manifested her Dao.</p>
<p>“It's almost done. We will soon learn of the outcome.” Felicitous Rain Lord was very patient.</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang nodded as she looked forward to the outcome of Yi Yun's Dao Manifestation.</p>
<p>As for Yi Yun, he was still immersed in the world of his soul sea.</p>
<p>During the Dao Manifestation process, he gradually felt like he was merging with the heaven and earth as one.</p>
<p>The fruits of Pure Yang, Space-time Withering and Sword Dao were revolving around Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Beneath him, the Major Destruction Dao Domain appeared as the destruction aura constantly intertwined.</p>
<p>“It's almost done.” Yi Yun had such a feeling.</p>
<p>A blob of gray gas gradually took up form like a nebula, but it contained a terrifying aura. It was like anything that entered it would be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>And above Spirit Gathering Palace, a phantom towering tree appeared from time to time. The Golden Crow and Nine Neonate flew around it as they let out long roars.</p>
<p>On the towering tree's branches, a tiny, tender shoot transformed into a fruit. The fruit had a barely discernible aura, and each fruit was different. On careful look, they were different Dao fruits. And leaves were slowly sprouting out of those Dao fruits.</p>
<p>“The Dao fruits are formed,” said Fairy Ningshuang as she looked at the leaves. “Six, seven and, eight.”</p>
<p>Having eight-leafed Dao fruits was definitely an extremely breathtaking feat in factions like the Oracle Fey Kingdom and the Luo clan.</p>
<p>However, to Yi Yun, it was not considered to be many. It could only be considered as above average.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun's Dao fruit are all Great Dao Dao fruits,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>Any warrior at the Dao Manifestation realm would be considered the cream of the crop if they possessed a single Great Dao Dao fruit, yet Yi Yun had three.</p>
<p>The three Dao — Pure Yang, Space-time Withering and Major Dao of Destruction — were Great Dao that were approaching the Origins, especially the Major Dao of Destruction.</p>
<p>“Yet another leaf.” Fairy Ningshuang's eyes lit up as she was visibly moved.</p>
<p>However, the leaf only sprouted into a bud before it stopped growing.</p>
<p>“What a pity!” Fairy Ningshuang revealed a look of pity.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had a slight change in expression as well before he said calmly, “There's nothing to pitiable about it. To cultivate three Great Dao at the same time and form nine-leaf Dao fruits would be too difficult. Yi Yun is now just short of the mark, but his eight-leafed Dao fruit is definitely of superior grade.”</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang nodded as well. She only found it somewhat regretful when she witnessed the ninth leaf nearly grow out.</p>
<p>“Let's wait till Yi Yun finishes his Dao Manifestation,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. With eight-leafed Dao fruits almost done, the Dao Manifestation process was also about to end soon.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, a look of surprise flashed in Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes.</p>
<p>“That is?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun's Major Destruction Dao fruit had already taken shape, but as he was about to lead the Major Destruction Dao fruit towards the other Dao fruits, Yi Yun stopped.</p>
<p>It was the final step, but Yi Yun felt something odd.</p>
<p>The Major Destruction Dao fruit was able to devour everything. It was the end to the Chaos of the Universe, and also the end of Dao.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the Major Destruction Dao fruit approached the other Dao fruits, it faintly emitted a devouring force, like it wanted to devour the other Dao fruits.</p>
<p>If he allowed the other Dao fruits to fuse with the Major Destruction Dao fruit, what sort of outcome would there be? Would it be destruction?</p>
<p>The Major Dao of Destruction could destroy everything, so it would be normal if it included Dao fruits!</p>
<p>Yi Yun had never heard of the fusing of Dao fruits, nor had he ever heard of anyone with a Major Destruction Dao fruit.</p>
<p>How was he to choose at such crossroads?</p>
<p>He was just short of a step to manifest his Dao, but the fusion…</p>
<p>Yi Yun had an intense foreboding that if he attempted the fusion, his other Dao fruits were very likely to be destroyed by the Major Destruction Dao fruit. Eventually, they would be left in emptiness and silence just like the Universe would be after its destruction.</p>
<p>What should he do?</p>
<p>Yi Yun stopped. He could not proceed any further for if he continued the fusion, what waited for him could very well be a disaster.</p>
<p>Furthermore… the ninth leaf eventually failed to develop fully. It caused Yi Yun to turn perplexed. Could it be that no one in the entire 12 Empyrean Heavens had ever come into contact with the Major Dao of Destruction and that it could not support a single nine-leafed Dao fruit?</p>
<p>The manifestation of the Dao fruits had to be done in one fell swoop. Yi Yun no longer had much Yuan Qi left, so his time was limited. He had to come to a decision.</p>
<p>Major Destruction…</p>
<p>Were destruction and finality the end?</p>
<p>Matter in the Universe could not remain eternal. They would eventually proceed towards destruction, including the Universe. But what happened after destruction? Could it be that all that was left was eternal 'nothingness'?</p>
<p>Everything in the world underwent birth and death.</p>
<p>A drop of water could evaporate and become part of a cloud before condensing into new drops of rain. Plants would wither, but the fruits that they bore could give rise to seeds. Mortals would die of age, but babies would grow up into adults. Stars could be destroyed, but new stars would eventually be born…</p>
<p>Everything in the world underwent a cycle, so it definitely included the Universe.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Universe was the beginnings of a new Universe. It was just that the cycle was immensely long that it was beyond the imagination of mere mortals.</p>
<p>New Universe…</p>
<p>Yi Yun suddenly seemed to realize something.</p>
<p>What were the beginnings of the Universe? Dao begets One, One begets Two… Before Yin-Yang and Space-time was Chaos!</p>
<p>Rebirth after destruction was Chaos and Major Destruction respectively. They were both two Great Dao of Supremacy!</p>
<p>Why were there two Great Dao of Supremacy? They might be like Yin-Yang, Space-time, Water-Fire, just two sides of the Universe.</p>
<p>The two could supplement each other and not a single one was dispensable.</p>
<p>Yi Yun had cultivated in pure Yang laws, but he did not focus on it fully. He was nourished by Lin Xintong's pure Yin, and the Great Empress Heart Sutra itself was a cultivation technique that combined Yin and Yang.</p>
<p>Yi Yun combined the Dao of Withering with the laws of time, but back when Yi Yun fought the Black-armored Demon God, he had been trapped in an alternate spatial dimension created by the Black-armored Demon God. He had used several years to see through the Dao of Space with the Purple Crystal, allowing him to escape. Space supplemented time and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Even for his Sword Dao, Yi Yun had started with gaining insights into Saber Dao at the very beginning. His first weapon was the Thousand Army Saber, and after entering the Saber tomb, he gained insight of the Saber Dao of being indomitable. At the Pure Yang Sword Palace, he had obtained the Thousand Snow flying sabers, which were, to date, a weapon he used to kill!</p>
<p>But only the Major Dao of Destruction was a lone and, solitary existence. Up to date, there was no other corresponding law that could be fused with it.</p>
<p>This caused the Major Destruction Dao to become purely destruction. It obviously possessed immense strength when used against enemies.</p>
<p>But on careful thought, Yi Yun had yet to fully grasp the Major Destruction domain up to date.</p>
<p>When he faced Shi Fei and Shi Ping, Yi Yun had produced the Major Destruction Domain which destroyed everything. If not for Yi Yun's energy being depleted, the destruction might very well continue, resulting in terrifying damage.</p>
<p>Destruction needed to form a union with Creation.</p>
<p>Only then could there be perfection. If not, it would be the present situation that he was facing. Even the Major Destruction Dao fruit that he condensed would devour the other Dao fruits, causing him to eventually fall short of success.</p>
<p>Upon realizing this, Yi Yun made his decision.</p>
<p>He needed to find a corresponding Dao for Major Destruction. If his decision was made known to others, they would definitely think that Yi Yun had gone mad.</p>
<p>He was only a warrior at the Heaven Ascension perfection realm, but he was planning to gain insights into two Great Dao of Supremacy!</p>
<p>It was impossible to do so even for a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>However, Yi Yun was determined to attempt it. He wanted his Major Dao of Destruction to be perfect as well. Ignoring the fact that the Major Destruction Dao fruit would destroy the other Dao fruits, but just having an eight-leaf Dao fruit did not satisfy Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Yi Yun suspected that it was because his Major Dao of Destruction was not perfected that resulted in his other Dao fruits to be imperfect as well. After all, the Major Dao of Destruction was his Dao Domain and also the foundations of his other Dao.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Fairy Ningshuang saw that Yi Yun's aura was weakening as she immediately turned nervous.</p>
<p>At that moment, the eight-leaf Dao fruit that was about to form on Yi Yun's Dao Tree stopped growing. The leaves curled up and wrapped the Dao fruit with them.</p>
<p>Yi Yun actually failed his Dao Manifestation?</p>
<p>“Yi Yun is now at the… half-step Dao Manifestation realm.”</p>
<p>A number of warriors would stop at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm. Chi Zhuiyun was one such example.</p>
<p>However, from Yi Yun's previous stance, it looked like he planned on manifesting his Dao in one fell swoop, but now, he stopped midway? What was the reason?</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord pondered over it as well. He too could not understand Yi Yun's decision.</p>
<p>“Half-step Dao Manifestation is fine too. With plenty of time for preparation, he will definitely succeed the next time.” Fairy Ningshuang helped Yi Yun find an excuse.</p>
<p>However, Felicitous Rain Lord shook his head gently, “That's probably not what Yi Yun is thinking. His Dao Manifestation did not fail but he intentionally stopped it. He is probably not satisfied with eight-leafed Dao fruits… ”</p>
<p>When Felicitous Rain Lord said that, he frowned slightly. Having ambition was a good thing, but how could a nine-leaf Dao fruit be so easy to condense?</p>
<p>Those who could condense nine-leaf Dao fruits were extraordinary talents. Furthermore, most nine-leaf Dao fruits were not Great Dao Dao fruits.</p>
<p>It was extremely difficult just attempting to condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit for Great Dao like Yin-Yang, Space-time, and Destruction.</p>
<p>And it would only be even more difficult if one wanted to cultivate in several Dao.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was already very pleased with the Dao fruits that Yi Yun condensed, but Yi Yun had stopped.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yun completely give up, Felicitous Rain Lord moved and flew in front of Yi Yun. Fairy Ningshuang followed suit.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, why did you stop? Are you not pleased with eight-leaf Dao fruits? Your eight-leaf Dao fruits are already approaching nine-leafs. Furthermore, it's three Great Dao Dao fruits. In addition to Sword Dao, although it's not a Great Dao of nature, to warriors, it is a Great Dao when it comes to the Dao of skill.”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord obviously wished that Yi Yun was able to condense a nine-leaf Dao fruit, but he was afraid that Yi Yun would waste too much time by aiming too high. Time in one's youth was very precious. If it was wasted, it would affect one's potential.</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew that Felicitous Rain Lord was watching his entire Dao Manifestation process, but he did not directly answer Felicitous Rain Lord's question. Instead, he said, “This disciple will keep in mind Master's teachings. This disciple has a question for Master. Where will this disciple be able to gain insights into the Dao of Primordial Chaos?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord was stunned. Primordial Chaos? Why was Yi Yun asking about one of the Great Dao of Supremacy of the Universe for?</p>
<p>“Don't tell me that… you want to gain insights into the Primordial Chaos?”</p>
<p>Chapter 993: Three Beams of Sword Qi</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Yi Yun nodded his head in absolute seriousness.</p>
<p>“About that… ” Felicitous Rain Lord pricked up his eyebrows. Learning the Dao of Primordial Chaos was just too difficult!</p>
<p>Even Felicitous Rain Lord had never had any contact to Great Dao laws that were above Space-time and Yin-Yang.</p>
<p>To comprehend Primordial Chaos, not only did one need opportunities, they also needed perception that only one in a quadrillion of people had.</p>
<p>It was unlike the Major Destruction laws. There was no place to meditate with the Major Destruction laws because the time for the Universe's destruction had yet to happen.</p>
<p>As for Primordial Chaos laws, the Universe had been born after all. There were still chances to gain insights into it. But even so, mighty figures of the 12 Empyrean Heavens who knew Primordial Chaos laws were a rare breed.</p>
<p>Therefore, Felicitous Rain Lord was unlikely to feel optimistic about Yi Yun's request to study it.</p>
<p>However, thinking back to the things that Yi Yun had previously done, and how they had far exceeded his expectations, Felicitous Rain Lord said, “The Universe was born from Chaos. In order to meditate over the Primordial Chaos, the most direct method is to find worlds that were recently born. It is possible to connect to the primordial Universe through those worlds where there is the existence of the nebulous Primordial Chaos.</p>
<p>“The 12 Empyrean Heavens is too big, so although the probability of such worlds appearing is extremely low, there are really a few spots like that. For example, the Primordial Empyrean Heaven… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun had previously been to the Primordial Empyrean Heaven and underwent the Luo Divine Hall's trials there. However, the landmass where the Luo Divine Hall trials was held was a rather stable place. It was a place that was naturally unsuitable to ponder over Chaos laws. As for places that were conducive to the contemplation of Chaos laws, Yi Yun was unable to head there alone.</p>
<p>“Without me going with you, you will not be able to reach the Primordial Empyrean Heaven.” Felicitous Rain Lord sighed in silence as he looked like he was being put on the spot.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord had previously said that he had matters to attend to in a few year's time. And a few years had passed while he watched Yi Yun's cultivation and attempt at manifesting his Dao in the abode. It was about time that he left.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord contemplated for a moment before saying, “For you to give up manifesting your Dao midway, I believe that you have thought it through. In that case, accompany me to the Azure Wood Great World.”</p>
<p>Azure Wood Great World? Fairy Ningshuang, who was beside him, revealed a look of astonishment. “Divine Lord, are you sure?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was momentarily stunned as well.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord looked at Yi Yun and said with a serious expression, “I was planning on heading there with Ningshuang, firstly because of my own matters and secondly to find opportunities for Ningshuang to make a breakthrough. If you were at the peak of the Dao Manifestation realm, even if you didn't ask, I would have taken you along. The Azure Wood Great World has plenty of opportunities… but now, it's the result of having no choice.”</p>
<p>“Your cultivation level is too low to enter the Azure Wood Great World. In there, even Dao Palace realm warriors have to tread carefully,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>In the Azure Wood Great World, Dao Palace realm warriors had to tread like they were on thin ice. Yi Yun was only at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm, so he was two full realms away. It was no wonder that Felicitous Rain Lord did not consider the matter previously.</p>
<p>But now, he decided on the matter because of Yi Yun's desire to study the Primordial Chaos.</p>
<p>“You still aren't aware of what a place the Azure Wood Great World is. It's a world that is bordering on life and death. In the Azure Wood Great World, a new world is born, while as a result, the old Azure Wood Great World is collapsing.”</p>
<p>What Felicitous Rain Lord said stunned Yi Yun. There was such a world?</p>
<p>“It might not be a coincidence… The last time that I entered the Azure Wood Great World, I saw a mark left behind by a senior.” Felicitous Rain Lord revealed a look of reminiscence. “The reason why I'm entering the Azure Wood Great World is also for that senior. That senior's martial arts is unfathomable, one that I have never seen before. Perhaps, chasing after that senior's footsteps will allow me to seek the supreme martial path… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun could see a yearning in Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes.</p>
<p>The supreme martial path was a lifelong pursuit for a warrior like Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>However, after the Azure Wood Great World began collapsing, it was abandoned for hundreds of millions of years. How was he going to pursue that senior in such a world?</p>
<p>“Although all I saw was a mark, I kept having the nagging feeling that such a senior had yet to die. Maybe in the Azure Wood Great World, there are other inheritances left behind by that senior. It might even be possible that the senior is still alive. If that's the case, there is that tiny possibility that I'll be able to find that senior.” Felicitous Rain Lord said in a tone filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>How could a senior that represented supreme martial arts for Felicitous Rain Lord die so easily?</p>
<p>“What sort of mark was it?” Yi Yun could not help but ask.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord seemed to cast his eyes to a distant spot through space.</p>
<p>“It was a flower. It constantly phased between life and death, just like the Azure Wood Great World which is the interface of destruction and birth,” said Felicitous Rain Lord. “It's fine if you want to give up now.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked up and said, “Master, this disciple is willing to go along with you!”</p>
<p>The martial path was fraught with difficulties. Yi Yun was unwilling to turn to dust after hundreds of thousands of years. He wanted to try his chances at climbing that peak of martial arts.</p>
<p>Since time immemorial, people who could become Divine Lords were all talented people who experienced great tribulations in life and encountered countless opportunities. If not, how could they trample on billions of warriors to reach the peak?</p>
<p>And the goal that Yi Yun set for himself was not limited to being a Divine Lord.</p>
<p>“Have you thought through it carefully?”</p>
<p>“This disciple has already thought it through,” said Yi Yun seriously.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord looked at Yi Yun and nodded. “On our trip to the Azure Wood Great World, there will probably be many people from other sects and countries coming along. However, those old freaks at the level of Supremacies will target the core area of the Azure Wood Great World. It's a place that you can't enter anyway. As for your true strength, it should be somewhere around the peak of the Dao Manifestation realm, but the people who will be going will mostly be at the Dao Palace realm. There will not be many people at the Dao Manifestation realm. Furthermore, what you face will be different from them. You will have to rely on yourself for everything.”</p>
<p>“As your master, I'll give you three protective sword Qi.”</p>
<p>Upon saying that, Felicitous Rain Lord stretched out his hand to draw a profound rune mid-air and placed it on Yi Yun's glabella.</p>
<p>Immediately, an extremely sharp aura surged towards Yi Yun. In his soul sea, there were three tiny revolving swords beside the 'Three-foot Passage Sword'.</p>
<p>Yi Yun could sense the terrifying power that the small swords had just from probing them.</p>
<p>With Yi Yun's soul sea and cultivation realm, he could only accommodate three beams of sword Qi.</p>
<p>“These three beams of sword Qi are produced by me, but your cultivation realm is too low. They probably will not be able to produce half of their might. But even so, they will be useful tools to protect your life.”</p>
<p>“Do not think that you are invincible with the sword Qi. People and freaks from the various large sects and Fey kingdoms would typically have their own hidden cards. And killing in the Azure Wood Great World depends on one's ability. That has the authority over life and death, so even though you are my disciple, my name will not pose much of a threat.”</p>
<p>In an independent world, it was unknown who the culprit was if one died, so there was nothing to speak of with respect to revenge. Furthermore, it was typically a life-and-death struggle between peers. Being killed only meant that he was inferior to others, so there was no reason for Felicitous Rain Lord to seek revenge.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Master,” said Yi Yun. He naturally would not act willfully because of the sword Qi. They were hidden cards to ensure his survival.</p>
<p>“Try your best to cultivate as much as possible. Doing some last-minute preparations is still beneficial,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>After Yi Yun left, Fairy Ningshuang sighed and said, “Yi Yun's aspirations are too high. I wonder if it's a blessing or a curse for him.”</p>
<p>“I'm worried as well,” said Felicitous Rain Lord as he looked into a distance. “But if a warrior does not have any aspirations, he won't be able to go far either.”</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang could tell that Felicitous Rain Lord was not supportive of Yi Yun's decision and resolution. But in the bottom of his heart, Felicitous Rain Lord recognized Yi Yun's martial heart, or he would not have bestowed three beams of sword Qi to him.</p>
<p>She had followed Felicitous Rain Lord for tens of thousands of years. Felicitous Rain Lord's martial heart was also extremely firm or he would not have become the youngest Divine Lord in the 12 Empyrean Heavens. One of the reasons why Yi Yun had become Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple was partly due to Felicitous Rain Lord's acknowledgment of his martial heart.</p>
<p>Without such determination, one would eventually turn average even if one had astounding talent. In the process of cultivation, warriors had to face numerous enticements. Ordinary Dao Manifestation realm warriors could already become an Elder of a mid-tier sect or a guest Elder. They could enjoy a long lifespan and live a lavish lifestyle like a king.</p>
<p>But the pursuit of martial arts was a lonely and dark path. There were too many unknowns along it.</p>
<p>“It won't be long before we can enter the Azure Wood Great World,” said Felicitous Rain Lord in an eager fashion.</p>
<p>He looked at the sky of the abode which reflected the world outside. At the moment, it was dark outside, and dazzling stars formed the milky arm of a galaxy. It was breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>And inside Spirit Gathering Palace, Yi Yun was also looking at the milky arm of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Be it now, or when he was a mortal, such a sight was truly mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Every star might represent a Great World by itself, and in this galactic arm, there were countless Great Worlds, with trillions of lives.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun sat inside Spirit Gathering Palace, he pondered over the distance between him and the galactic stars. But when he stretched his hand out, it was like the stars were right in front of him.</p>
<p>Chapter 994: Enemies often cross each other's paths</p>
<p>A few months later, a dazzling and starry burst of light flashed on the floating island.</p>
<p>“The Divine Lord has left.” The Oracle Fey Kingdom's Imperial Patriarch looked at the starry burst of light from afar. He could sense the terrifying power from the flash of light.</p>
<p>However, the floating island was still sealed. About a year ago, Felicitous Rain Lord had already settled several matters. His in-name disciples would stay behind and cultivate in the Oracle Fey Kingdom.</p>
<p>And on the floating island, Chi Zhuiyun watched the starry light as it flashed.</p>
<p>“We are already people from different worlds. Although I have no idea where you are heading, I wish you good luck.” Chi Zhuiyun lowered his head and continued thrusting the spear in his hand forward.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>In front of Chi Zhuiyun, a gigantic mountain was covered in densely packed holes. About half the mountain was gone.</p>
<p>Although he could not chase up to Yi Yun, Chi Zhuiyun still wanted to pursue his own martial path.</p>
<p>Amid the stars.</p>
<p>“It will be a long journey to the Sinkhole. With the Meteor Cruiser's speed, it will still require a few days. Why don't you play a game of Go with me to kill time?” said Felicitous Rain Lord to Yi Yun who was sitting across him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, who had not exited the abode for a few years, did not seem to have any change to his appearance. However, compared to before he entered the abode, his bearing had experienced drastic changes.</p>
<p>He was wearing a white robe and his hair was tied up simply. His eyes were like the night as they intermittently flashed with profound runes, and he exuded a mysterious aura.</p>
<p>“This disciple isn't that good at Go. Master, please go easy on me.” Yi Yun said with a smile.</p>
<p>Stretching his hand out, a swirling beam of light flashed around his fingers. It condensed into a crystalline chess piece that was as warm as jade as he gently placed it on the board.</p>
<p>“Try playing Go whenever you have the time. It can help you focus and refine yourself. It is a cultivation of mind and body,” said Felicitous Rain Lord as he condensed a piece from the void.</p>
<p>Fairy Ningshuang watched from the side as she revealed a faint smile, “The two of you are quite alike.”</p>
<p>“That isn't a good thing. If he's like me, he will only attract hate,” laughed Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>He had no lack of enemies.</p>
<p>The game of Go lasted for three days.</p>
<p>At the dawn of the fourth day, the Meteor Cruiser entered a strange world.</p>
<p>The starlight was dim and there were several black vortices swirling in space. There were gray planets and rocks of various sizes floating everywhere.</p>
<p>The planets were mostly silent with no life on them.</p>
<p>And those planets exuded different kinds of energies where most of the energies made people sense danger. In between the planets, there were space-time turbulences.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord's Meteor Cruiser had space-time laws protecting it, so it was unaffected as it shuttled through the space-time turbulence. All they saw was distorted space and countless flashing lights outside the windows.</p>
<p>And after crossing countless space-time turbulences, a gigantic star appeared in a warm and illuminated starry void.</p>
<p>Around the star, there was a beautiful nebula that encircled it several times. It was breathtakingly beautiful as it illuminated the starry void.</p>
<p>“The starry scenery of the 12 Empyrean Heavens is truly breathtaking.” Yi Yun could not help but reflect on it.</p>
<p>But such a beautiful star emanated a deadly and silent but chaotic aura.</p>
<p>Yi Yun turned his head and noticed that Felicitous Rain Lord was silently looking at the star.</p>
<p>“This is?”</p>
<p>“That is the Azure Wood Great World,” said Felicitous Rain Lord softly.</p>
<p>After such a long period of time, they had finally arrived in the Azure Wood Great World.</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Great World… ” Yi Yun looked at the star and he could not sense any signs of life around the star.</p>
<p>And in the star system that was on the brink of death, there was a new star system that was about to be born. The mysteries of the Universe where life and death could be companions was truly fascinating.</p>
<p>The Azure Wood Great World was too large, so when the Meteor Cruiser arrived in front of the star, it was like a speck of dust. Through the gorgeous nebula, Yi Yun could see a blob of gray shadows.</p>
<p>“The nebula is the space-time turbulence,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>As the Meteor Cruiser approached the star, Yi Yun began to sense the horror of the space-time turbulence as well. Even the space-time laws that protected the Meteor Cruiser could not fully withstand it.</p>
<p>Once they were sucked into the space-time turbulence, it was possible to be lost in the chaotic pandemonium of space-time till their deaths.</p>
<p>In the luster, Yi Yun saw the shadows of a few spirit cruisers and people. They were people who had previously been trapped by the space-time turbulence. To date, their souls were still trapped within it.</p>
<p>“This period of time is when the surrounding space-time turbulence around the Azure Wood Great World is at its weakest. But even so, there is a need for certain methods to enter it.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord said, he tapped on the void with one hand.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A palm that was dozens of times larger than the Meteor Cruiser appeared outside the window. It was nearly transparent, and it was filled with imprints of space-time laws.</p>
<p>Hu! Hu! Hu!</p>
<p>The palm pulled the space-time turbulence apart, allowing the Meteor Cruiser to immediately blast through it.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the Meteor Cruiser tore out of the lustrous nebula. Beneath them was a gigantic black lake, with gray building compounds around it.</p>
<p>Many of the buildings were toppled, and the mountains were already falling apart, while the ground was filled with cracks as well.</p>
<p>Only ruins could be seen on the vast plains. There was no life to it or at least from Yi Yun's perception, he could not even sense a worm.</p>
<p>This was indeed a dead planet that was on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord wanted to pursue that senior, and as Yi Yun looked at the planet, he found it hard to imagine that there were people living on it. From the moment they entered, Yi Yun felt as though the star system was repelling them.</p>
<p>It was like they were alien invaders.</p>
<p>“The place that I'm going to is the core area of the Azure Wood Great World, which is the Azure Wood Divine Residence. The Azure Wood Divine Residence is transformed from a piece of azure wood that turned into one of the divine. Where I want to go to is the Divine Tree Palace at the very core,” said Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“There it is.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked into the distance.</p>
<p>A towering divine tree was stood erect on the ground while shrouding the skies. Its peak pierced through the gray clouds.</p>
<p>In the collapsing and dead world, the leaves of the divine tree had yet to wither surprisingly. It was truly evergreen. It was no wonder that this world was called the Azure Wood Great World.</p>
<p>That was the Azure Wood Divine Residence.</p>
<p>And below the divine tree were roots that were like mountain ranges. The roots similarly had several buildings on them.</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Divine Residence has extremely strict restrictions. Supremacies and below are unable to enter. Even ordinary Supremacies can't enter the Divine Tree Palace. Around the divine residence is an important area of the Azure Wood Great World. With your cultivation level, you can move around it, but you have to be especially careful.”</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Great World is currently collapsing while the new world is in its nascent stages. The laws are chaotic, so there might be unexpected dangers. And the restrictions, array formations, and seals from the past have been affected by the collapse of the Azure Wood Great World. Some of them are damaged, but some of them have become even more terrifying.”</p>
<p>“There are others. I can already sense several auras. Those people sure are fast.”</p>
<p>As Felicitous Rain Lord said this, an immense aura suddenly surged over.</p>
<p>The aura only brushed past them before vanishing.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord frowned slightly and said, “The people from the Immortal Rain Sect have arrived as well. They are waiting for me.”</p>
<p>Just as Felicitous Rain Lord said that, a gigantic skull appeared in the distant void. The skull was burning with purple flames as it slowly floated over.</p>
<p>Although it was still a great distance away, Yi Yun felt like his lifeblood was being stirred by the gigantic skull.</p>
<p>“That is… ”</p>
<p>Yi Yun was stunned as he sensed an odd and sinister aura that he was familiar with but hated greatly.</p>
<p>“Fey Phantasm Sect. This would be tough. I never expected them to come as well.” As Felicitous Rain Lord said that, he glanced at Yi Yun. The toughness that he was referring to was naturally referring to Yi Yun. The Fey Phantasm Sect could not affect him.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord knew that Yi Yun had a vendetta with the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect wanted to swallow the six-country alliance, and several years ago, Yi Yun was nearly assassinated by the Fey Phantasm Sect after having just arrived in the Oracle Fey Kingdom to participate in Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple recruitment assessment.</p>
<p>Back then, the Fey Phantasm Sect had sent two experts. Logically speaking, Yi Yun would have definitely been a dead man, but Yi Yun had miraculously survived. It left the Fey Phantasm Sect astonished, and what shocked them the most was likely that Yi Yun became Felicitous Rain Lord's personal disciple.</p>
<p>As such, Yi Yun's status was extremely delicate to the Fey Phantasm Sect.</p>
<p>On one side, they had already become enemies of Yi Yun. The brighter Yi Yun's future was, the more they did not want Yi Yun to fully mature.</p>
<p>And on the other side, as a disciple of Felicitous Rain Lord, Yi Yun was not someone that they dared to assassinate recklessly. They would have to pay a heavy price for that.</p>
<p>However, it was completely different in the Azure Wood Great World.</p>
<p>The skull drew closer. Even Yi Yun did not expect that the Fey Phantasm Sect would come as well.</p>
<p>How true was it that enemies often cross each other's paths!</p>
<p>“Yi Yun, since the Fey Phantasm Sect actually came, while I will be deep in the core of the Azure Wood Great World, what about you? What are your plans?”</p>
<p>Chapter 995: Demonic Eye Divine Lord</p>
<p>Yi Yun knew how dangerous it was for him if the Fey Phantasm Sect was also in the Azure Wood Great World. However, if he were to give up on the expedition, Yi Yun had no idea where or when he could gain insights into the Dao of Primordial Chaos. It would only result in him failing to form his Major Destruction Dao fruit.</p>
<p>Time was precious to him, so he could not delay any further. If he missed the opportunity, it would no longer exist in the future.</p>
<p>“Master, since I'm already here, I have no plans on returning.”</p>
<p>“Okay, very well!” Felicitous Rain Lord nodded. Although he knew that Yi Yun's choice was extremely dangerous, he still admired Yi Yun's guts.</p>
<p>At that moment, a ghastly shadow flew out of the gigantic skull. Flying beside the ghastly shadow were a few figures.</p>
<p>The ghastly shadow appeared lofty in the void. It did not seem like it coexisted harmoniously with the surrounding space as huge distortions appeared around the shadow. It was like it was projected from another dimension.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain.”</p>
<p>A sinister and odd aura surged over as Yi Yun felt like an extremely cold storm was ushered into his soul. His soul felt like it was being sealed frozen.</p>
<p>However, when the aura reached Felicitous Rain Lord's vicinity, a cold grunt from him dispelled the aura completely.</p>
<p>“Why are you giving me the cold shoulder? It's just a greeting. I heard about the recruitment of your disciple some time ago. I actually planned on sending a few lowly disciples to be evaluated by you to see if they could catch your eye. Is that your newly recruited disciple?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun felt a few penetrating gazes that seemed to pierce through his soul being cast on him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun found two of the gazes familiar.</p>
<p>The two Supremacies that had attempted to assassinate him were here as well.</p>
<p>Yi Yun would not forget the names and appearances of Gui Huazi and Daoist You Ming. If not for the God Advent Tower, he would have been killed by them. And Elder Duanmu and Elder Shi, who had been escorting him, were severely injured. It probably caused quite a serious dent on Elder Shi's aspirations to make the breakthrough that he was preparing for.</p>
<p>“You want to fight me?” asked Felicitous Rain Lord coldly.</p>
<p>“Haha, why so serious? See you later in the divine residence.” The ghastly shadow issued a menacing cackle before it elongated itself, turning into a crimson line in the void and vanishing oddly.</p>
<p>The ghastly shadow had left.</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately felt the pressure vanish.</p>
<p>“That person is… ” The ghastly shadow clearly knew Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“The Fey Phantasm Sect's Demonic Eye Divine Lord, as well as a dozen or so Supremacies from the Fey Phantasm Sect.” Felicitous Rain Lord's expression was ashen. “He has come as well. That Demonic Eye Divine Lord is like a wretched dog that would rush over the moment he catches a whiff of something.”</p>
<p>Yi Yun had previously heard that the reason why the Fey Phantasm Sect acted so tyrannically was because it had produced a Divine Lord. So it was that ghastly shadow…</p>
<p>“Was it the two Supremacies standing beside him who attacked you?” Felicitous Rain Lord suddenly asked.</p>
<p>He had also sensed the two Supremacies glance at Yi Yun abnormally.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Yi Yun with a nod.</p>
<p>A faint coldness flashed in Felicitous Rain Lord's eyes , “They are nothing in the Azure Wood Divine Residence, and the Demonic Eye Divine Lord's target is very likely the Azure Wood Divine Residence as well.”</p>
<p>The Fey Phantasm Sect's Divine Lord and Supremacies would enter the Azure Wood Divine Residence, so there was no worry that Yi Yun would be harmed by them. And although Felicitous Rain Lord had the intention of killing the two Supremacies, they were not dumb either. They were most likely going to stick close to Demonic Eye Divine Lord.</p>
<p>Following that, the gigantic skull rapidly departed.</p>
<p>Felicitous Rain Lord watched the gigantic skull disappear. Although his personality was to do as he wished, if not for the Demonic Eye Divine Lord watching nearby, he would have wiped all of the Fey Phantasm Sect's younger generation nearby that could assassinate Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“I cannot let Demonic Eye Divine Lord and company enter the divine residence alone. I have to go in as well. My perception can only temporarily stop them from tracking you. After that, you need to be extremely careful,” exhorted Felicitous Rain Lord.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” said Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The gigantic skull had already vanished into the distance.</p>
<p>And in one of the eyes of the gigantic skull, an effeminate and intricate-looking man dressed in scarlet robes stood there.</p>
<p>He was still looking in the direction of Felicitous Rain Lord, despite not being able to see the Felicitous Rain Lord trio anymore.</p>
<p>“That punk really didn't die!” You Feihua revealed a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about that genius from the Luo clan? What's his name? Yi Yun?” At that moment, a sweet and delicate girl's voice came from behind You Feihua.</p>
<p>The person speaking was a blue-haired female with gorgeous looks. Her eyes sparkled brightly and her every move had a natural charm to them. The corners of her eyes were smeared with a scarlet tinge that accentuated her with a mysterious and odd vividness.</p>
<p>Her looks were ones that could cause disaster to befall countries and men.</p>
<p>“He's very young,” said the woman with a laugh. She had also seen Yi Yun a moment ago. “It's hard to imagine that a youth that's not even at the Dao Manifestation realm managed to survive a full strike from you unscathed. He even managed to survive an attack from your father. It's really perplexing. How did he do it?”</p>
<p>You Feihua glanced at her and frowned. “Yao Chuo, don't you poke your nose into this.”</p>
<p>“Heh heh, I'm only being curious.” Yao Chuo grinned in an alluring manner.</p>
<p>You Feihua grunted coldly and turned to look outside.</p>
<p>He did not dare to do a thing after seeing Yi Yun with Felicitous Rain Lord present. Neither could he stay there for long or he would have been courting death.</p>
<p>However, how could Felicitous Rain Lord protect Yi Yun all the time?</p>
<p>“Other than that avatar that managed to withstand a strike of mine, Yi Yun must have some impressive treasures!” A strange glint flashed in You Feihua's eyes.</p>
<p>A treasure that could withstand a Supremacy's deathblow! At the moment that the news was made known, it was likely that the warriors who had come to the Azure Wood Great World would be moved by it.</p>
<p>So how could You Feihua leak the information regarding the treasure? He wouldn't mention it even to Yao Chuo.</p>
<p>“Yi Yun's cultivation level has reached half-step Dao Manifestation after becoming Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple. Putting aside the fact that he hasn't manifested his Dao, he's still far from me even if he has! I'm at the six-floor Dao Palace realm. Without that defensive treasure, he wouldn't even stand up to scrutiny in front of me!” A menacing look appeared in You Feihua's eyes.</p>
<p>Although Yi Yun had become a Divine Lord's disciple, he had only been cultivating for a few years under the guidance of a Divine Lord. As for You Feihua, he had been taught by Daoist You Ming from birth. In addition to the two full realms of cultivation separating them, You Feihua thought nothing of Yi Yun's tiny bit of strength.</p>
<p>It could be said that in the eyes of You Feihua, Yi Yun's treasure was already his.</p>
<p>“That darn Felicitous Rain Lord, why doesn't he quickly leave? If this goes on, who knows when I'll find Yi Yun again. During this period of time, he better not die,” thought You Feihua.</p>
<p>At the instant that the gigantic skull vanished, Felicitous Rain Lord said, “The people from the Fey Phantasm Sect have left. The Demonic Eye Divine Lord's aura is also heading towards the Azure Wood Divine Residence. They aren't pursuing you.” Felicitous Rain Lord looked at the Azure Wood Divine Residence and said, “Yi Yun, we will be leaving.”</p>
<p>“Be careful.” Fairy Ningshuang said with a nod.</p>
<p>Yi Yun bowed and when he lifted his head, Fairy Ningshuang and Felicitous Rain Lord's figures had already transformed into beams of light that headed for the Azure Wood Divine Residence.</p>
<p>“Felicitous Rain Lord waited for the people from the Fey Phantasm Sect to leave before he left. That's already a level of protection for me. Next, it will all depend on me.” When a warrior practiced martial arts, it was impossible for him to always be protected by his master. A warrior that was unable to face danger himself had no right to seek the path of martial arts.</p>
<p>Yi Yun looked at the ground. This was the first time that he was visiting the Azure Wood Great World, and just as he was preparing to find a seemingly safe spot to land, two figures suddenly flew towards him from ground level.</p>
<p>The two figures were feeling apprehensive in the beginning, but when they noticed that Yi Yun was alone, the two figures immediately accelerated towards him.</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately turned wary as he pressed a hand on his interspatial ring.</p>
<p>Chapter 996: First Attempt of the Sword's Blade</p>
<p>The two figures dressed in azure-colored robes quickly approached him. One of them was carrying a heavy-looking scabbard on his back, while the other did not carry any weapons at all. The two warriors were at the peak of the Dao Manifestation realm, and their auras were rich and dense.</p>
<p>They sized Yi Yun up before asking him with a smile, “Junior Brother, do you know which seniors were here just now?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun swept a glance at them and nonchalantly said, “I came here because of the aura that I sensed.”</p>
<p>The identity as Felicitous Rain Lord's disciple was best not to be easily revealed to others in the Azure Wood Great World. Ignoring the Fey Phantasm Sect, if others were to know, there was a very strong likelihood for them to set their sights on Yi Yun. Various reasons like jealousy or greed for his treasures were sufficient motivation for them to attack Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“So, Junior Brother did not see the seniors as well?” The duo shook their heads and said, “But then again, seeing them might not be something good. The seniors might not like to be disturbed.”</p>
<p>Noticing how Yi Yun did not speak any further, the duo exchanged glances. One of the duo, who was bearded, said amiably, “Junior Brother, are you now alone?”</p>
<p>They could already tell that Yi Yun was at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm. It was obviously impossible for such a person to come to the Azure Wood Great World alone. However, there were many young disciples that accompanied their sect masters or elders.</p>
<p>“Where is the rest of your esteemed sect?” The other man looked around, but they had only come here after confirming that there were no other auras around.</p>
<p>“I do not have a sect,” said Yi Yun.</p>
<p>“Then, you must be a disciple of a reclusive master?” The bearded man said with a nod.</p>
<p>“The seniors from our sect have already entered the Azure Wood Divine Residence, leaving only the two of us. Although this place isn't the inner regions of the Azure Wood Great World, it is still quite a dangerous place.”</p>
<p>The bearded man said warmly, “Junior Brother, instead of venturing alone, why don't you join us? We can take care of each other after all.”</p>
<p>The other man did not say anything, but he looked at Yi Yun with an eager expression.</p>
<p>Yi Yun stroke his chin and looked at the duo. He planned on rejecting them when he suddenly thought of something. He changed his mind and said, “Alright.”</p>
<p>“That's great. The two of us just came to the Azure Wood Great World as well. We don't know anything and will just be looking around.”</p>
<p>“Let's familiarize ourselves with each other. Who knows, we might become friends in the future.”</p>
<p>The two men took the initiative to descend.</p>
<p>Yi Yun followed slowly behind them.</p>
<p>“The buildings over there look rather new. There should be some array protecting them. The things inside must still be preserved,” said the bearded man as he pointed to a particular courtyard.</p>
<p>The courtyard was situated beside the roots of the towering tree. Although the massive courtyard walls were estimated to be a hundred feet tall, the courtyard appeared to be minute in front of the tree roots.</p>
<p>The Azure Divine Tree, which held up the Azure Wood Great World, was just too massive.</p>
<p>“If there's anything, we will split them equally,” said the other man.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Yi Yun nodded.</p>
<p>After entering the courtyard, Yi Yun looked around the yard in a fascinated manner.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of strange rock engravings in the yard, while the ground was filled with engravings of leaves. Entering the yard felt like one had returned to ancient times.</p>
<p>The yard had probably been abandoned for more than a hundred million years, but the feeling that it gave was like someone had stayed in there only recently. Without the preservation from arrays, it would have long been reduced to ruins.</p>
<p>“Let's enter the hall.” The two warriors said as they eagerly strode into the hall.</p>
<p>The corners of Yi Yun's lips curled up when he looked at the duo's back. It was a teasing smile as he followed behind them at an adequate pace.</p>
<p>After entering the building, he noticed that the two warriors were standing inside the hall.</p>
<p>“Senior Brothers, why aren't you in a rush to search for treasures? Are you waiting for me? The both of you are just too kind,” said Yi Yun.</p>
<p>The two warriors chuckled and said, “Of course we have to wait for Junior Brother. It's best to search such a place together.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? I thought the both of you were already very familiar with this place,” said Yi Yun without any haste.</p>
<p>They had seen numerous courtyards from the sky, but the duo had chosen this one. They were in a hurry to enter the hall at the moment they landed, so wasn't it obvious that they were trying to lure him in?</p>
<p>The bearded warrior's eyes turned cold as he said with a laugh, “It looks like you are smarter than the previous one. But for you to follow us here despite knowing the truth, it can only mean that you do not know what it means to die. Even if your master is a Supremacy, there is no way that you can be rescued.”</p>
<p>“It's not like that I didn't notice that something was wrong. I followed the both of you here because I actually wanted to test a new law that I learned after a few years of reclusive training. The both of you are at the peak of the Dao Manifestation realm, so you are qualified to receive my attacks.” Yi Yun pulled his sword out.</p>
<p>With the Azure Wood Great World opening up, Felicitous Rain Lord had already said that there would be several Dao Palace realm warriors. There would also be people at the peak of the Dao Manifestation realm, but they would be relatively rare. Now that he had encountered two of them, Yi Yun planned to use them to gauge his strength. His intuition told him that his expedition in the Azure Wood Great World would be fraught with dangers. Since his strength was far from sufficient, he needed to battle to raise his strength. Now, with an opportunity to do battle voluntarily standing in front of him, Yi Yun naturally would not reject it.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The duo was incensed. They were warriors at the peak of Dao Manifestation, but they were only qualified to receive the attacks of a half-step Dao Manifestation realm warrior?</p>
<p>Before the warriors could say anything, the bearded warrior's facial expression changed. “Be careful… ”</p>
<p>Sou!</p>
<p>A cold sword beam shot out faster than he could speak. It seemed to fly out of an ancient spatial-temporal dimension as it attacked the bearded warrior without any warning.</p>
<p>The warrior's eyes flashed seriously as he roared and smacked the sword beam with both his hands.</p>
<p>His hands were imbued with Yuan Qi, allowing them to become extremely strong. A strike from his palm could shatter a person's skeleton.</p>
<p>And in between his palms, there was a spinning ball compressed from Yuan Qi. Not only did it manage to withstand the sword beam, it was able to shatter ordinary swords.</p>
<p>“How dare you think of slashing me with that cultivation level of yours!” The warrior thundered. His hands produced a tumultuous clap as he suddenly clasped the sword beam.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A powerful shock wave blasted outwards from the warrior's palms.</p>
<p>It was blocked!</p>
<p>But at that moment, the warrior had a sudden and drastic change in expression.</p>
<p>His hands were quickly shriveling up. The veins on the back of his arm protruded as his skin began to blemish. His hand had surprisingly aged!</p>
<p>What was going on!? He had clearly managed to parry the sword beam!</p>
<p>The bearded man was appalled when he saw the scene. What strike was that?</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, let's join forces and kill him!” roared the bearded man angrily.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Yi Yun's next strike had arrived.</p>
<p>“Withering Sword of Time.” Yi Yun's voice accompanied the floating sword beams.</p>
<p>The sword beams seemed to lack offensive power, but even if they could be blocked, those who blocked them would show signs of rapid aging.</p>
<p>The two warriors frantically defended and attacked, but they began to find it helpless. The youth's sword techniques were too terrifying. Their martial arts, Dao Domain or anything else could not parry his attacks.</p>
<p>What was even more despairing was that the youth apparently could produce only one move. He slashed out with the same sword beams again and again. There was no other move, much less the conjuring of a Dao Domain.</p>
<p>But it was such a sword beam that left them wallowing in despair.</p>
<p>Very soon, they came to a realization that they could not win.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, work with me and use all of our trump cards!” yelled the bearded man.</p>
<p>Yi Yun gave the duo a nonchalant glance. This was the first time that he was using the Three-foot Passage Sword in battle, so he too wanted to see what trump cards the duo had.</p>
<p>But at that moment, the bearded man's figure suddenly shrank as it transformed into a snake like shadow and rushed out.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was surprised, while the other warrior cursed out loud, “You will die a horrible death!”</p>
<p>“Don't worry. He will accompany you in hell very soon.” Yi Yun slashed out, slicing through the warrior's protective Yuan Qi easily.</p>
<p>The sword beam was like wind caressing the surface of a lake, but when it landed on the warrior's head, the warrior's appearance immediately aged rapidly. In a few seconds, all of his vitality had been drawn away.</p>
<p>His eyes were filled with anger and horror.</p>
<p>Yi Yun flashed forward and took the man's interspatial ring before charging out of the building in pursuit of the bearded man.</p>
<p>Chapter 997: Portrait</p>
<p>The sky of the world was not azure blue, but black, like black ink blots. It was perhaps because the Azure Wood Great World was on the brink of destruction. It was like the core of the world only had an eternal darkness. It felt extremely repressive.</p>
<p>However, amid this repressive pressure, there was a picturesque garden, where a divine tree stood in the middle. Although the world was losing its vitality, the divine tree remained lush and luxuriantly green with a proud crown that pierced the sky.</p>
<p>Even though the Azure Wood Great World was already beginning to collapse, the garden still possessed rich energy and was filled with Heaven and Earth essence. It gave a refreshing and pleasant feeling to people like they had ascended to become immortals in this plot of space.</p>
<p>“The divine tree remains undying, but the world is collapsing. Yet, I'm unable to redeem anything… ”</p>
<p>A girl dressed in a light-green dress was prostrated in front of the divine tree. Silver hair flowed down her back and onto the ground, like scattered silver that covered the ground.</p>
<p>From behind, one could see that the girl had a long, fair neck that reached her white and petite ears. It made her look like an elf hiding in a forest.</p>
<p>The girl prostrated for a long while before she slowly got up. She could sense that the divine tree and the Azure Wood Great World's seismic network had fused together. It was like a dragon that stood atop this world, eternal and undying. The divine tree had been planted when the world was born, and it would live till the moment when the world faced destruction.</p>
<p>For hundreds of millions of years, the divine tree was the guardian of Azure Wood Manor by existing alongside it.</p>
<p>The Azure Wood Manor was a reclusive sect. In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, there was no lack of reclusive sects. The Immortal Rain Sect and Azure Wood Manor were examples of reclusive sects. Back in the Azure Wood Manor's golden age, its scale far exceeded the Immortal Rain Sect's.</p>
<p>However, even at its peak, the Azure Wood Manor seldom made contact with the external world. For hundreds of millions of years, the sect members of the Azure Wood Manor remained hidden in the Azure Wood Great World and only focused on their cultivation.</p>
<p>In the historical records of the Azure Wood Manor, the Azure Wood Manor had suffered a calamity that had threatened to destroy them hundreds of millions of years ago. However, due to the existence of the divine tree, they were spared from utter destruction.</p>
<p>Because of that, the divine tree was deemed to be an ancestral totem of supreme importance to the Azure Wood Manor.</p>
<p>However, even though the Azure Wood Manor treated the divine tree as a guardian, the people of the Azure Wood Manor knew that the divine tree never belonged to them.</p>
<p>The divine tree belonged to the Azure Wood Great World, and it was even possible that the divine tree was the owner of the Azure Wood Great World. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the divine tree had bestowed grace upon the Azure Wood Manor when it protected them from the calamity. Legends said that the female Lord of the Manor prostrated before the divine tree for three days and three nights before the divine tree's power was stirred, allowing Azure Wood Manor to survive the calamity.</p>
<p>The girl did not dare to imagine such a scene.</p>
<p>According to the historical records, the Azure Wood Manor's Manor Lord position was mostly helmed by females from that moment on. The Elders of the Azure Wood Manor looked forward to the day when a young lady with outstanding talent was able to stir the divine tree's power. However… that miracle never happened again.</p>
<p>Closer to present day, the Azure Wood Great World was approaching its end. The Heaven Earth Yuan Qi became more chaotic, making it unsuitable for cultivation. The Azure Wood Manor also began to wane and the number of experts that it had decreased in number. Slowly, their talents withered and eventually, there was a fracture in the Azure Wood Manor. A number of people left the Azure Wood Great World and set up an external establishment that was unfortunately destroyed due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>The people that stayed back guarded the Azure Wood Great World, but the number of people that they had shrunk. By the girl's generation, there was only a handful of people.</p>
<p>And from the moment that the Azure Wood Manor began to wane, the divine tree never did a thing again.</p>
<p>The girl had once fantasized if she could emulate her ancestor by awakening the divine tree's powers. However, none of her various and repeated attempts bore fruit.</p>
<p>For example, she had already been praying in front of the divine tree for several hours today. The divine tree was not moved as it stood aloof to the happenings of the world.</p>
<p>“Young Lord, those people are here again… ”</p>
<p>Behind the girl, an old servant with white hair walked over as she spoke with a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The servant was an old woman that looked like an ailing candle in the wind and her eyes appeared somewhat glazed. She was an old servant of the Azure Wood Manor, and she usually tended to the day-to-day needs of the green-dressed girl.</p>
<p>“Master is no longer around. It's probably insufficient for the Azure Wood Divine Residence's array to stop them.”</p>
<p>The girl frowned slightly. The Azure Wood Great World was once completely hidden, but with the Azure Wood Great World's gradual collapse, the spatial nodes had weakened. It was finally discovered by others and from then on, people would probe the world like it was an ancient ruin. And the Azure Wood Manor had indeed left behind what seemed to be endless treasures and inheritances since ancient times. If it was obtained by outsiders, it would definitely be a great opportunity for them.</p>
<p>The Azure Wood Manor was already deteriorating. Tens of thousands of years ago, the girl's master was able to hold down the situation. With the arrays left behind by their ancestors, it prevented the outsiders from obtaining much. They managed to protect a large portion of the Azure Wood Manor's inheritance.</p>
<p>But now… her master had passed away leaving behind the a young girl and her old servant, so how could they stop the outsiders? All the outsiders were extremely powerful and any one of them was not someone that the duo could beat.</p>
<p>“Sigh! How infuriating! If it were a hundred million years ago, when my Azure Wood Manor was at its peak, our Azure Wood Manor wouldn't fear those people even if their numbers increase by several times! Unfortunately… ”</p>
<p>The old servant was loyal to the Azure Wood Manor. Although she had never seen the golden age as written in the historical records, she still thought fondly of their history. She was also very familiar with Lords of the Azure Wood Manor from past generations.</p>
<p>“They don't even know that our Azure Wood Manor has survived to this day, and they probably think of the Azure Wood Great World as being a world without any owner.”</p>
<p>Searching the ruins of worlds without owners to gain opportunities was a perfectly justified act in the world of warriors. In their present situation, the girl did not dare to appear. If the old freaks were to know that the mysterious Azure Wood Manor still had a successor, who knew what terrifying acts would play out.</p>
<p>“If only the divine tree would awaken… ”</p>
<p>The girl looked up at the towering divine tree. As the wind blew, the leaves that were in the clouds gently swayed and rustled. A look of adamance flashed in the girl's eyes.</p>
<p>She knew that it was unlikely that the divine tree would hear her pleas. It could even be completely ignoring her, but she still needed to do something. She was the only successor of the Azure Wood Manor. Therefore, she could not watch idly as everything in Azure Wood Manor was taken away by others.</p>
<p>She got up and walked out of the garden and arrived at an exquisite courtyard. On a table in the courtyard was a portrait with offerings placed in front of it.</p>
<p>The portrait exuded an unbelievable aura. The portrait depicted a black-dressed woman, who had a graceful figure. However, her face was blurred.</p>
<p>The girl bowed respectfully to the portrait. It might only be a portrait, but it was probably the last thing that Azure Wood Manor could rely on.</p>
<p>It might sound unbelievable that a portrait was the last thing that a sect could rely on, but the portrait had a stunning history according to the historical records of the Azure Wood Manor.</p>
<p>It existed for a period longer than the Azure Wood Great World. And the identity of the person in the portrait was even more unbelievable. The first Lord of the Azure Wood Great World had once said that the undying divine tree of the Azure Wood Great World was planted personally by the black-dressed woman.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl found it unbelievable that a divine tree, which had existed longer than a Great World, was planted by a woman.</p>
<p>Chapter 998: Chu He</p>
<p>The Azure Wood Great World was bleak and desolate in all but its core region.</p>
<p>In the periphery of the Azure Wood Great World, there was a mountain range, and the sky above the mountains was black in color. Despite there being the sun to illuminate the sky, the sunlight was dim, like it was a dying old man.</p>
<p>The series of mountains continued on incessantly, but they were barren. Everywhere was a scene of desolation.</p>
<p>Some of the mountains were flowing with lava as billowing black smoke floated into the sky and filled it to the ends of its horizons. Other mountains were littered by swaths of withered trees and weathered bone. They were filled with death and looked more like mass graves. There were even other mountains that were enclosed in terrifying black storms. Some of the storms could rip powerful Fey beasts apart.</p>
<p>In the valleys between the mountain peaks, there were large series of black lakes. They emanated a stench with miasma filling the environment around the lakes. They were highly toxic and if an ordinary person breathed it in, not only would the person die from the toxicity, the person's corpse would also be corroded, leaving only bones behind.</p>
<p>“What can we find in this godforsaken place?”</p>
<p>Near one of the black lakes, two burly men were searching the area. They were not young geniuses from large sects, but a league that was created from itinerant cultivators.</p>
<p>In the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven, leagues were very different to sects. Sects had their own heritages with strict sect rules. Disciples from the sect would usually cultivate similar cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>As for leagues, they were much more undisciplined. A league was only a group of people coming together for the same set of interests. The cultivation techniques that they cultivated were multifarious and people could leave at any time. Some leagues were simply bandit gangs, especially organized together to engage in the armed robbery of others.</p>
<p>The Azure Wood Great World was large, so there were many entrances into the Azure Wood Great World. A few itinerant members of certain leagues would enter the Azure Wood Great World's periphery, but of course, they would only linger around its periphery and not dare venture deeper.</p>
<p>“Junior Brother, this Azure Wood Great World has lots of good stuff. It's the location of a former seclusive sect, the Azure Wood Sect. When such an ancient sect collapses, could its treasures be anything inferior? Let's not even talk about the Azure Wood Sect, just the Azure Wood Great World itself would give rise to several treasures. Now that the world is about to collapse, those ordinary plants and animals have all died. The only things left are the treasures that will expose themselves.”</p>
<p>As the two men conversed, they suddenly heard a staccato scream ahead of them —</p>
<p>“Save, save me— ”</p>
<p>The voice was charming and it was clearly one that belonged to a young girl.</p>
<p>“What's the matter?”</p>
<p>The two men exchanged looks as they immediately rushed towards the voice. Their eyes lit up the moment that they saw what was in front of them.</p>
<p>A sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl, who had a pair of bright, beautiful eyes, was trapped in a marsh. A thick, black vine was extended out of the mud as it held onto the girl.</p>
<p>It was a Fey tree!</p>
<p>“Haha, Junior Brother, what did I say? After the Azure Wood Great World's plants die, the only things that survive are nothing to be scoffed at. Look at that Fey tree. Due to the lack of Yuan Qi, it's already starving in agony. It captured the girl in its quest for food. If I'm not wrong, it's a Black Blood Vine. Using it as a herb or as a poison would be rather effective. Good luck has befallen us, the Heavenly Calamity Duo.” One of the men said as his eyes flashed with a glint.</p>
<p>“Black Blood Vine? That's indeed a great thing! Also, that babe is covered in treasures.” As the other man said, he looked greedily at the girl's items. The Heavenly Calamity Duo had made it a career to rob graves, so they had keen eyesight. They could tell that the clothes that the girl wore, and the hair accessories that she wore, were all valuable ornaments.</p>
<p>“That's right. The babe must be from some large sect. Her elders must have given her lots of great stuff, but unfortunately, her cultivation level is too low and she was unable to use them to their full power. What a waste if she can't even finish a Black Blood Vine. Hey, Beauty, don't be in a rush. When I'm done finishing that Black Blood Vine, I'll treat you with tender loving care,” said the man as he revealed a licentious smile.</p>
<p>The girl's aura was pure and unadulterated. She had a substantial foundation, so she was definitely a genius from a large sect. Such women stood high and mighty in the world, one that they could only look up to. But now, in the Azure Wood Great World, they could do as they pleased with her. How could it not excite them?</p>
<p>“What… what are the two of you going to do!?”</p>
<p>The girl turned flustered as she struggled with all her might, but the vine only tightened its grip on her. At that moment, the two men in front of her seemed to be more fearsome than the Black Blood Vine that wanted to consume her.</p>
<p>“Asking us what we want to do? Hehe, you are still asking such a silly question even at this point in time? Lass, all you can blame is that you are too willful. You entered this area riding on your master's coattails, I suppose? How you were trapped by the Black Blood Vine can be ignored, but for you to scream for help here really shows how quickly you want to die. But don't worry, in my hands, you will at least have a good time before your death.”</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, the lass looks like a virgin. Senior Brother, you were given the honor to take the last virgin's virginity, so shouldn't it be my turn this time?”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calamity Duo exchanged lewd and sinister words as they moved closer to the girl. However, they did not lower their guard either. It was imperative that they finished the Black Blood Vine first.</p>
<p>Of course, with their combined strength, a Black Blood Vine was not a problem.</p>
<p>“Cha! Cha!”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calamity Duo pulled out their sabers as they leaped up and coming from two different angles, they slashed at the Black Blood Vine!</p>
<p>The girl turned flustered as though she was extremely horrified, but at that moment, the black mud slush suddenly blasted open thirty feet in front of her!</p>
<p>“Si!”</p>
<p>The chilling sound of a snake's hiss echoed as a snake, whose circumference was about the arm span of three men, emerged from the mud and attacked the Heavenly Calamity Duo!</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“What is that!?”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calamity Duo was alarmed. Before their attack, they had used their perceptions to survey the surroundings, but they had failed to discover any danger. How did that enormous python appear?</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calamity Duo changed their targets suddenly as they slashed their sabers at the snake.</p>
<p>However, the snake opened its mouth at that moment and a black vortex swirled from its throat. The surrounding void began to collapse as the Heavenly Calamity Duo felt themselves losing control of their bodies. They even dropped their sabers.</p>
<p>Engulfing laws!?</p>
<p>It was a Fey beast that was proficient at engulfing laws!?</p>
<p>The two were horrified, but they eventually fell into the snake's mouth. Spear like-teeth stabbed into their bodies as they cried out in agony!</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>The duo spat out blood and felt extreme despair. However, the snake did not seem like it had any intention of giving them instantaneous deaths. They were forced to experience the torment before death.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the Heavenly Calamity Duo realized that the girl who was trapped by the Black Blood Vine had already escaped. She stood tall and gracefully above the marsh. The tip of her foot was gently placed above the water surface, while her watery-green dress was untainted. She looked like a beautiful lotus flower that had just bloomed, causing one to be ashamed of one's ungainly appearance.</p>
<p>And at that moment, there was a clear sneer on the girl's exquisite face.</p>
<p>“Wh… What?”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calamity Duo had drastic changes in expression as they came to a realization that the girl in front of them was not some unworldly girl. They were the ones who were actually silly. From the beginning, it was a meticulously laid out trap.</p>
<p>“You witch… ” One of the men said through gnashed teeth.</p>
<p>He wanted to lash out with more invectives, but his breathing was turning weaker. Finally, he was completely swallowed into the snake's belly.</p>
<p>“What dirty meat. Little Blue feels sick just eating you.” The girl said with a wrinkled frown.</p>
<p>Little Blue was none other than the gigantic snake in front of her. Mud flowed down the snake's body, revealing beautiful blue scales. Although the snake had been in the mud, it was not tainted by the mud at all.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was a distortion in the void beside the girl. Space was ripped open as a silver-haired girl walked out and appeared in front of the green-dressed girl.</p>
<p>“Chu He, you are up to your mischief again. You left the Azure Wood Divine Residence on a whim and came all the way here. If you meet someone really powerful, will you even be able to return?” The silver-haired girl reprimanded Chu He, clearly furious at her antics.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl was the successor of the Azure Wood Manor, who had just been praying in front of the Divine Tree Garden. She had prayed countless times, but she had never managed to stir the divine tree.</p>
<p>With her prayers unmet, the silver-haired girl came searching for her junior sister. To date, other than herself and her accompanying old servant, the Azure Wood Manor only had Chu He left.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister, these outsiders are here to rob us of our treasures, so can't I punish them?” The green-dressed girl pouted her lips as she answered unhappily.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl shook her head and said, “What they do cannot be faulted. Searching ruins is a justified act in the martial world. If there is anything to be blamed, it is that our Azure Wood Manor has waned.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Chu He as she blinked with her pair of black eyes. With a look of innocence, she said, “But I don't wantonly kill anyone that I meet. If not, why did I act? I could just get Little Blue to swallow them directly. I was acting so as to see who had bad intentions towards me. These people with ill intentions deserve death! If they are good, I'll spare them. I know too that the Azure Wood Great World is about to collapse. Even if the outsiders don't come to search for treasures, many of the items would be destroyed as well.”</p>
<p>“I really can't do a thing about you.” The silver-haired girl shook her head. Suddenly, her eyebrows pricked up. “Oh, there are more people coming again!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she vanished into the void. At that moment, about fifty miles away, a youth was shuttling through the sky with a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>And not far in front of him, a man looked ashen. He had sweat dripping down his forehead as he desperately fled. He was feeling extreme despair.</p>
<p>He never expected that the sword-wielding youth was that terrifying! The youth's cultivation level was only at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm, but his strength was extremely formidable!</p>
<p>A single strike. All it took was a single strike to kill his partner. Not only did his partner die, his partner's body aged rapidly and was reduced to bare bones.</p>
<p>Such a terrifying sword technique gave one the chills just thinking about it!</p>
<p>Without any thought, he fled immediately. Although he had stunning achievements when it came to his movement technique, he had never expected that the movement technique that he was proud of failed to help him escape the pursuit of the youth. Now, the gap was shrinking rapidly!</p>
<p>He would rather commit suicide than experience that terrifying sword technique that rotted bodies!</p>
<p>Chapter 999: No Sincerity</p>
<p>Despite how desperately the man ran, his speed was ultimately inferior to Yi Yun's.</p>
<p>“Punk! Don't you force me! No matter how powerful you are, you are only at the half-step Dao Manifestation realm. Being in the periphery of the Azure Wood Great World is already your limit. If you go any deeper into it, you will be met with certain death. If you continue to pursue me, you will not be able to get out!” The man yelled frantically, but the distance between Yi Yun and him continued to shrink rapidly.</p>
<p>“All I did was to conspire to hurt you, wasn't it? You were left with zero losses and you even killed my Senior Brother. Isn't that enough? Must you chase me all this way to put an end to me? How much enmity is there between us?”</p>
<p>As the man was speaking, Yi Yun suddenly slashed with his sword!</p>
<p>“Whew!”</p>
<p>A sword beam tore through the void and headed straight for the man's back.</p>
<p>The man exclaimed as he barely dodged it. Although he managed to dodge the sword beam, the wind that accompanied the sword beam brushed across his back.</p>
<p>Instantly, an indescribable feeling overwhelmed every cell in his body. The man began to convulse as he felt that the strike had struck the very source of his life. His vitality was rapidly being depleted and the flesh on the back of his body was shriveling. Even his clothes had turned to ash.</p>
<p>That was the power of the passage of time. Time laws and Withering laws synergized well with each other in the first place.</p>
<p>With the two laws merged into one, even though he had managed to dodge the sword beam, just the might of the winds that accompanied it had drained his vitality.</p>
<p>“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”</p>
<p>The man screamed in despair. He knew very well that Yi Yun's strike had already destroyed him because of his withering vitality. Not only could he no longer practice martial arts, his lifespan was also drastically shortened.</p>
<p>“I'll fight it out with you!”</p>
<p>The man turned around and frantically charged at Yi Yun, like an enraged beast.</p>
<p>Yi Yun raised his sword and thrust it at the man's glabella.</p>
<p>'”Puah!”</p>
<p>The man's body trembled violently as his eyes lost their luster. Corrosion of his body began from his glabella, and spread out in all directions. His skin and flesh were shriveling and drying up like they were turning to dust. In a few moments, the man's body looked like it had experienced millennia before being reduced to bones.</p>
<p>Yi Yun put his sword away — it was not the pure Yang broken sword anyway. He did not plan on using the pure Yang broken sword unless absolutely necessary. Doing so could prevent creating trouble for himself if others were to see the broken sword.</p>
<p>The whole scene of Yi Yun using the Sword of Time to kill the fleeing man was seen by Chu He.</p>
<p>Chu He was somewhat stupefied.</p>
<p>The youth's… cultivation level wasn't even higher than hers, so how was he that powerful?</p>
<p>The sword technique could sever another person's vitality with a single strike? The laws infused in it were way too horrifying!</p>
<p>Thoughts quickly flashed through her mind, but she was unafraid of Yi Yun. Even if her strength was inferior to Yi Yun's, she never depended on herself for battle because of her pet, Little Blue, which was an ancient spirit snake left behind by her master. Although it had not fully matured, its strength was much stronger than hers.</p>
<p>And it was because of Little Blue's existence that Chu He dared to roam the Azure Wood Great World freely and target people who had nefarious thoughts against her.</p>
<p>“That fellow can't be a good person to act so ruthlessly… ” Chu He muttered to herself as she began machinating a plan.</p>
<p>“Chu He, aren't you returning with me? Stop messing around.” In the void, the silver-haired girl's voice sounded.</p>
<p>“Senior Sister, don't worry. I know perfectly well.” Chu He was adamant as she retreated towards the marsh.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Save, save me… ”</p>
<p>A clear shout for help once again echoed above the black lake. As Yi Yun flew mid-air, his eyebrows pricked up slightly when he heard it.</p>
<p>Back when Yi Yun was pursuing the man, he had actually sensed that there was someone in the vicinity. However, Yi Yun's perception was locked onto the man. As he had a vague feeling that the other person spelled no threat to him, he did not carefully investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Now, with a sweep of his perception, he noticed that a green-dressed girl was dozens of miles away and was trapped in a marsh. Black vines were wrapped around her and she looked to be in grave danger.</p>
<p>Yi Yun faltered slightly, but with a flash of his body, he flew towards the green-dressed girl.</p>
<p>“Save me… Hero, save me!”</p>
<p>When the green-dressed girl saw Yi Yun, it was like she had seen a life-saving straw. She yelled for help even more enthusiastically, but at that moment, the black vines that wrapped around her limbs were retracting into the deep recesses of the marsh. It looked like the green-dressed girl was about to be devoured by the marsh.</p>
<p>Yi Yun was not one to turn a blind eye to someone's plight. Furthermore, the black vine did not seem to be particularly powerful. so without any possible threat to his life, Yi Yun did not mind saving the green-dressed girl.</p>
<p>“Cha! Cha! Cha!”</p>
<p>Sword sparks emerged around Yi Yun like snowflakes. However, just as Yi Yun was about to take action, he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Oh?</p>
<p>A majority of the sword sparks disappeared from Yi Yun's body as he stopped mid-air. He only watched the green-dressed girl, but he did not take another step forward.</p>
<p>He had found many things amiss with the situation, so he had immediately activated the Purple Crystal's energy vision. He was shocked by what he saw. Gosh, there was a large blue snake hidden in the marsh beneath the girl!</p>
<p>“Save me! Save me!” Chu He yelled again and she seemed to be extremely anxious, but Yi Yun remained unmoved. He watched her for a while before deciding to hug his sword in his arms. It was like he was watching her shout.</p>
<p>Chu He was immediately dumbfounded. She had acted a couple of times today and the people she met were people from leagues or tribes. Their strength was inferior and they looked no different to ruffians. Those people were here in the Azure Wood Great World to try their luck, and they mostly had nefarious intentions when it came to her. Either they wanted to kill and rob her, or they wanted to rape her. Chu He got Little Blue to eat them all.</p>
<p>There was also a group of people that most likely came from sects. They mostly behaved appropriately and had dignified appearances. When saving her, they would showcase their graceful demeanor but that did not mean that they were good. Amongst them, there might be wolves in sheep's clothing. However, the green-dressed girl could not be bothered to distinguish them. Unless they clearly revealed their malfeasant intentions, Chu He would basically spare them.</p>
<p>However, Chu He never expected that someone would be like Yi Yun. All he did was stay motionless mid-air as he watched her act. This left Chu He irrevocably committed. She was left at an impasse to continue or to stop shouting. Furthermore, in her 'script', the black vine were wrapped around her body and just before she was pulled into the marsh, Yi Yun should have taken action in a timely fashion, severing the black vine to prevent her from being dragged in. However, without Yi Yun taking action, wouldn't she be dragged into the disgusting marsh?</p>
<p>How could Chu He endure the dirty and nauseating marsh?</p>
<p>“Save me!” Chu He felt indignant as she yelled once more.</p>
<p>However, not only did Yi Yun not take any action, the corners of his mouth curved into a teasing smile.</p>
<p>“Why are you so ruthless? Why do you turn a blind eye to my plight!?” Chu He clenched her fist and was like an enraged kitten. Her embarrassment had turned into anger because she had a faint guess that the youth had seen through her!</p>
<p>“The black vine behind you sure is well mannered. It clearly has trapped you, but it is dragging you at such a slow speed. If you want to entice me to come towards you, you should have a modicum of sincerity. You don't even wish to taint yourself with a bit of mud. That's way too unprofessional,” said Yi Yun in derision.</p>
<p>When Chu He heard his words, her face turned blue from anger.</p>
<p>Chapter 1000: Hidden Dragon Pit</p>
<p>Chu He failed to figure out how Yi Yun had seen through her trap. Little Blue was an Ancient Fey beast species whose bloodline was extremely powerful. It had an innate ability to conceal itself, which prevented even seven or eight-floor Dao Palace warriors from discovering its existence, much less Yi Yun with his lowly cultivation level.</p>
<p>Chu He stopped acting after having her cover blown. The Black Blood Vine that entangled her gradually loosened as Chu He looked at Yi Yun and said with a huff, “How did you see through my trap?”</p>
<p>“Why should I tell you? You set up a trap by preying on the empathy of others and then use a Fey beast to devour them. Who knew that you would have such a wicked heart despite being so young and beautiful?”</p>
<p>Yi Yun naturally did not know about Chu He's background or goals. All he knew was that Chu He had set a trap to kill him and rob him. However, such incidents were common in the Ten Thousand Fey Empyrean Heaven. One could only blame themselves for being too weak if they were killed. There was not much to blame others for.</p>
<p>“You… ” Chu He blew her top. She did not know how to explain, so she gave up by pouting her lips and fell silent. She allowed the fellow to make up his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Yi Yun's eyebrows twitched slightly as he could tell from the girl's expression that there was a story behind the matter. There was no need for her to continue her facade since she had been seen through. However, regardless of the reason, Yi Yun would not foolishly approached the green-dressed girl. The spirit snake that the girl reared had an extremely strong aura. It made Yi Yun lack the confidence to deal with the blue snake unless he used Felicitous Rain Lord's sword Qi, but the losses would outweigh the gains.</p>
<p>A thought flashed in Yi Yun's mind as his eyes happened to glance at a spot not far from the girl. There was a distortion in the void and in the Purple Crystal's energy vision, Yi Yun confirmed that there was another person standing there. Furthermore, the person's aura was very unique…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At that moment, in the core area of the Azure Wood Great World, in a inhabited valley, there was large ravine. It was a long ravine that reached to the horizon and was ancient and rustic.</p>
<p>If one looked from above, the gigantic ravine was like a dragon that meandered through the lands. It would make one shudder in fear.</p>
<p>“This ravine is somewhat strange!” An elder floating mid-air said.</p>
<p>The person was thin and his body was hunched. He had six arms that hung softly from his body. If Yi Yun was here, he would immediately recognize the elder as the Fey Phantasm Sect's Supremacy, Gui Huazi.</p>
<p>Back when Yi Yun reached the Oracle Fey Kingdom, Gui Huazi had struck with a ghastly palm attack that nearly took Yi Yun's life.</p>
<p>And beside Gui Huazi was a middle-aged man whose body was covered in a faint swirling black fog. The middle-aged man had a pale face and had a mane of silver hair. It shimmered with a metallic luster and he looked outstandingly handsome. In between his eyebrows, there was a light stripe… It was a closed eye. He did not wear loose large black robes like the majority of the Fey Phantasm Sect's Elders, instead, he wore a well-fitted robe that befitted his position. He looked like an aristocrat from a mortal world.</p>
<p>The silver-haired man was the true person in power of the Fey Phantasm Sect — Demonic Eye Divine Lord.</p>
<p>The Demonic Eye Divine Lord looked at the gigantic ravine and pondered over it for a long time before he said, “If I'm not wrong, this is an ancient formation array named 'Hidden Dragon Pit'. I never expected that the 'Hidden Dragon Pit' recorded in the historical books would be seen here in the Azure Wood Great World. I thought that the art of the 'Hidden Dragon Pit' was long lost.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Hidden Dragon Pit?” Gui Huazi looked at the meandering ravine, and indeed, it looked like a pit dug up to bury a dragon.</p>
<p>“That's right. By using a powerful spirit root with a powerful enchantment sealed in 'Hidden Dragon Pit', it's used to protect a spatial zone. The so-called dragon should be a spirit root. I never expected that the Azure Wood Manor would have such a mystical item. However, I will dig it up regardless of what it is protecting!”</p>
<p>A sneer flashed in Demonic Eye Divine Lord's eyes as he suddenly waved a hand. Behind him, a plume of bloody mist burst out and transformed into a gigantic blood-colored skull.</p>
<p>“The Hidden Dragon Pit is powerful, but too much time has passed. The formation array has already weakened. Today, I'll use my Blood Jade Skull to devour the old dragon!”</p>
<p>As Demonic Eye Divine Lord spoke, he made a sweeping gesture with his hand!</p>
<p>“Boom!”</p>
<p>With an explosive sound, the blood-colored skull flew at 'Hidden Dragon Pit' like a meteor. Large swaths of ground collapsed as a tumultuous explosion boomed.</p>
<p>Such an explosion caused the collapse of a void. Large tracts of mountains in the distance collapsed as lava burst out of cracks in the rocks and shot fifty kilometers into the sky!</p>
<p>“Oh? This world is too weak. Grand Elder, that strike of yours nearly caused the collapse of the world.”</p>
<p>“The Azure Wood Great World is indeed weak, but it's not something so easily destroyed by my strength. It looks like the 'Hidden Dragon Pit' is not only protecting something, it is also holding the world in awe and prevent it from collapsing too soon. If I were to open the 'Hidden Dragon Pit', it would only accelerate the collapse of this world.”</p>
<p>Daoist You Ming, who was beside Gui Huazi, asked, “Then, are we still going to open it?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Although it will accelerate the collapse of this world, a true collapse would need a certain period of time. It will not affect us at all. This world is bound to collapse, so what's the point of forcibly stabilizing it with an array formation? I might as well give it a push.”</p>
<p>As Demonic Eye Divine Lord spoke, he produced his Blood Jade Skull once again.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The ancient 'Hidden Dragon Pit' had maintained an ancient ruin for tens of millions of years, but even though the strongest member of every generation of the Azure Wood Manor would enhance it, it was unable to withstand the Blood Jade Skull's devouring. It began to collapse from the source…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>And at this moment, more than 5000 kilometers away, Yi Yun was still observing the distorted space beside Chu He. He had confirmed that there was another girl standing there.</p>
<p>The girl's aura was very special and for some reason, he had a familiar feeling to it and it left Yi Yun baffled. Could he know that girl?</p>
<p>How could there be someone that he knew in this distant Azure Wood Great World?</p>
<p>Yi Yun immediately thought of Lin Xintong, but unfortunately, the girl's aura was clearly different to Lin Xintong's.</p>
<p>This made Yi Yun sigh lightly. How was he to find Lin Xintong in the expanse of the 12 Empyrean Heavens?</p>
<p>After a moment of reverie, Yi Yun looked at the distorted void once again. Although he was sure that she was not Lin Xintong, he wanted to know why the girl gave him such a familiar feeling.</p>
<p>As Yi Yun was thinking over it, the mud suddenly stirred in front of the green-dressed girl. A large blue snake emerged and splattering large amounts of black mud in every direction!</p>
<p>Yi Yun's heart leaped as he pulled his sword out. He thought that the blue snake would be attacking him, but he never expected the green-dressed girl to panic as well.</p>
<p>“Little Blue, what are you doing!?”</p>
<p>The green-dressed girl retreated because the mud that splattered all over was about to taint her clothes.</p>
<p>The blue snake flailed around and completely ignored the green-dressed girl's exhortations. Instead, it revealed extreme fear and unrest.</p>
<p>“Little Blue! Could it be… Oh no!”</p>
<p>Beside the green-dressed girl, space distorted as a silver-haired girl walked out of the void!</p>
