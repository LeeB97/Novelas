<p>Chapter 587: You've grown a lot 5</p>
<p>Alberu could feel someone poking at his cheeks.</p>
<p>His eye slowly opened to see who was responsible for this action.</p>
<p>“Huh?! He really woke up after I poked his cheek!”</p>
<p>"Crown prince, nya!”</p>
<p>The culprits were Raon and Hong.</p>
<p>Why was it that the two of them were becoming more like Cale every day and treating him as if he was some next-door neighbor?</p>
<p>He wanted to laugh in disbelief, however…</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked to his side. He could only groan after seeing the person next to his bed.</p>
<p>‘…The more I see him…’</p>
<p>Ron Molan was quietly sitting there observing him.</p>
<p>‘…He’s really vicious.’</p>
<p>He had thought that this man had looked different from normal servants from the beginning. However, learning that his true identity was the patriarch of the Molan Household that ruled over the Eastern continent's underworld made him think that this truly suited Ron.</p>
<p>But the more Alberu saw him…</p>
<p>The more he felt that this man was vicious.</p>
<p>“Ah, you're up, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu was stoic as Ron benignly smiled and asked that question.</p>
<p>Alberu took the cup of water from Ron as if Ron was his own servant before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“Molan patriarch, you don't need to stay here and protect me like this.”</p>
<p>He then casually added on.</p>
<p>“The young patriarch as well.”</p>
<p>Ron was next to the bed while Beacrox was by the head of the bed.</p>
<p>Ron slightly shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Your highness, someone must protect you when your guard is down like this. Furthermore…”</p>
<p>Ron started to smile.</p>
<p>“If someone must protect you, isn't it better for a stealthy person to protect you for something like this that requires a lot of secrecy? But I will tell my son to not come from now on as you wish, your highness.”</p>
<p>Beacrox, who was holding On by the head of the bed, shook his head.</p>
<p>“Father, I do not want to do that. I will protect his highness as well.”</p>
<p>“That’s what he says, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to think at that moment.</p>
<p>‘What they’re saying isn’t even funny. They want to protect me? Stealthy guards?’</p>
<p>Did they really think that Alberu wouldn’t know about their true intentions?</p>
<p>Alberu let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>‘They don’t want to protect me; they're just curious about Cale Henituse and Choi Han.’</p>
<p>That was why he turned toward the Cat children, Raon, and the Molan duo as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Both of them are doing well. They have not fallen, fainted, nor been heavily injured until now.”</p>
<p>The children averaging nine-years-old looked happy to hear that.</p>
<p>“Hehe. I'm going to go eat then! The human said to make sure to eat every meal!”</p>
<p>“I'm going to eat a lot and grow big, nya!”</p>
<p>Hong and Raon left Alberu’s side without any regrets and headed out of the tent.</p>
<p>On jumped out of Beacrox’s arms and followed behind them before looking toward Beacrox.</p>
<p>The other two looked toward him as well.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Beacrox debated for a moment after seeing their gazes before heading toward the tent entrance as well.</p>
<p>“I will be back after feeding the children.”</p>
<p>Beacrox walked out while removing the fur that was stuck on his clothes and the children averaging nine-years-old followed behind him.</p>
<p>That left only Ron and Alberu inside the tent.</p>
<p>Ron slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Your highness, are you really not planning on talking about…?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>Ron smirked while looking at Alberu who feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>“About what the test is about. You're highness, all you've told us is that you are able to chat with the young master-nim and Choi Han but nothing else, making me extremely curious.”</p>
<p>Ron observed Alberu who looked back at him.</p>
<p>Alberu had called over all of Cale's close confidants once he woke up from being the Dark Tiger the first time.</p>
<p>He only told them that he was able to communicate with Cale and Choi Han while he was asleep.</p>
<p>Alberu quietly observed Ron before starting to speak.</p>
<p>A quite cold voice flowed out.</p>
<p>“Hold back your curiosity.”</p>
<p>Ron’s benign smile became thicker.</p>
<p>“However.”</p>
<p>Alberu then added on.</p>
<p>"Cale is working hard and living pretty well. I can tell you that for sure.”</p>
<p>The benign smile disappeared.</p>
<p>Ron's now stoic face and sunken gaze slowly focused on Alberu.</p>
<p>But he soon had a benign smile on his face again as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“It seems as if the kingdoms of the Eastern continent will align themselves with the White Star.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown.</p>
<p>“…They have no intentions of chatting with us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness. We predict that all kingdoms other than the Molden Kingdom will end up on the White Star’s side and the ones that have already decided to do so are currently pushing the Mercenaries Guild out of their territories.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked as if he could not believe it.</p>
<p>“…Ha. I remember it wasn't like this when we were discussing the Molden Kingdom.”</p>
<p>The Molden Kingdom's Elisneh the First.</p>
<p>Cale and the Elves had infiltrated the Molden Kingdom and fought against the illusionist who was the White Star’s subordinate.</p>
<p>Elisneh the First's younger sister, Jopis, was going to take the throne.</p>
<p>Alberu had stepped up to help mediate all of that with the rest of the Eastern continent's kingdoms and they had all agreed to Alberu’s suggestions.</p>
<p>‘Even if they wouldn’t ally with us, I thought they would at least cooperate with us!’</p>
<p>But the Eastern continent's kingdoms had a different reaction now that Alberu was surrounding the area around this Gate to the Demon World and was about to start a fight with the White Star.</p>
<p>They were starting to ally themselves with the White Star one by one.</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’</p>
<p>Why were these kingdoms suddenly joining the White Star’s side?</p>
<p>All kingdoms except the Molden Kingdom led by Jopis had turned their backs on the Roan Kingdom and Alberu.</p>
<p>‘At this rate, it’ll be difficult to fight against the White Star on the Eastern continent even if Cale comes back.’</p>
<p>Forget being difficult, Cale, the Mercenaries Guild, the Molan Household, and the Western continent's kingdoms would seem to be the invaders who were causing chaos on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>Ron quietly continued to speak.</p>
<p>“We may need to withdraw from here soon.”</p>
<p>The troops that were gathered around the Gate to the Demon World might be forced to withdraw if they were pressured to do so by the Eastern continent's kingdoms.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“What about the infiltration?”</p>
<p>Ron answered that question without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“We have sent out informants from the Molan Household to try to infiltrate each kingdom’s palace or at least the homes of some chief executives.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s side wouldn't sit back and let those kingdoms pressure them.</p>
<p>The reason they were taking the White Star’s side.</p>
<p>They decided they needed to figure that out and sent the Molan Household's informants and assassins to stealthily go out and gather some information.</p>
<p>Furthermore.</p>
<p>“…Has the Whale tribe contacted us while I was asleep?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, your highness.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Alberu was working hard and chatting with many tribes in addition to the Western continent’s kingdoms in order to shake this playing field.</p>
<p>He thought for a moment before starting to speak.</p>
<p>"What about Miss Rosalyn?”</p>
<p>“I heard that she is currently doing a good job with the Western continent's issues along with Mary, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu hesitated before he started to speak again.</p>
<p>“…Have we received any contact from Eruhaben-nim?”</p>
<p>Cale had asked him to do something before he fell asleep again last time.</p>
<p>“No, your highness. We have not. I presume he will contact us in about an hour.”</p>
<p>Inside this sinkhole that was the Gate to the Demon World…</p>
<p>Eruhaben was hiding inside the Endable Kingdom's capital.</p>
<p>‘Your highness.’</p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p>‘You said you video chat with Eruhaben-nim at least once a day?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. We need to share information with each other.’</p>
<p>‘Then could you please deliver a message for me?’</p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p>Cale had answered with an extremely serious gaze.</p>
<p>‘Please tell him to not push himself too hard and to stay alive until I return. Please tell him that.’</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“Let me know as soon as Eruhaben-nim contacts us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Your highness.”</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment before Ron stood up and headed toward the tent entrance.</p>
<p>He was probably going to do the things Alberu told him to do.</p>
<p>"Also-”</p>
<p>Ron stopped walking after hearing Alberu’s voice.</p>
<p>Alberu remembered something else Cale had asked him to do.</p>
<p>“The ancient times. No, how is the task of gathering as much information as possible about the gods going?”</p>
<p>“Currently, the Saint-nim, Miss Cage, and Marquis Taylor Stan are leading the group gathering that information.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness. Then I will be on my way now.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I will head out soon as well.”</p>
<p>Ron silently left the tent and Alberu was left alone inside.</p>
<p>He quietly sat on the bed and recalled what Cale had said.</p>
<p>‘The sealed god.’</p>
<p>‘Yeah?’</p>
<p>‘Please gather information on it.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘This world is extremely weird.’</p>
<p>‘What’s weird about it?’</p>
<p>Cale, well, Cale in Kim Rok Soo's appearance, had quietly responded.</p>
<p>‘Choi Han said that the God of Death nonchalantly told him something.’</p>
<p>Alberu had noticed Cale's eyes cloud over.</p>
<p>Cale had continued in a quiet but firm voice.</p>
<p>‘The sealed god is not able to return to the past, but he is able to push his way into a different dimension.’</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>‘But you see…’</p>
<p>What Cale said next stabbed into Alberu’s ears.</p>
<p>‘Would a god say something useless?’</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>There was no way that a god would say something like that if it was useless.</p>
<p>Although he couldn't tell what a god was thinking about…</p>
<p>There must be a hint in there somewhere.</p>
<p>“And.”</p>
<p>He recalled the world that he had seen as the Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>No matter how he looked at it…</p>
<p>“That world is not an illusion.”</p>
<p>It was too elaborate to be an illusion.</p>
<p>‘And all those people trying their best to survive-’</p>
<p>Alberu quietly mumbled.</p>
<p>“…There’s no way that they are all fake.”</p>
<p>There was no way that all those people doing everything could do in order to survive were fake.</p>
<p>At least that was what Alberu thought.</p>
<p>That was why his mind was slowly becoming more complicated.</p>
<p>“Is this the training ground?”</p>
<p>“It sure is!”</p>
<p>Doctor Kang urgently nodded his head at Cale’s question.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang was extremely fidgety although Cale was calm.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>They heard a loud noise.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang jumped up in shock before he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I told them not to let anybody in. It seems like-”</p>
<p>The old man didn't know what to do as he looked back and forth between Cale and Choi Han.</p>
<p>Cale didn’t look at the old man and just looked at the door in front of him.</p>
<p>This iron door that led to the indoor training ground seemed extremely heavy and strong.</p>
<p>“Should I open it?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Choi Han’s question.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang looked extremely tense as he looked at the calm Choi Han and Cale.</p>
<p>He had called the two of them here because he didn’t want to be on bad terms with Cale's people, but things were going very differently than he had expected.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The door opened easily.</p>
<p>A large indoor training ground with high ceilings was revealed.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The three of them saw someone slam into the training ground wall after hearing an even louder noise than before.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The person who slammed into the wall before falling to the ground was groaning.</p>
<p>The person responsible for this started to speak.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jin Tae.”</p>
<p>It was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was the person who had slammed into the wall before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>“Huff, huff.”</p>
<p>Cale could see Lee Chul Min breathing heavily in a corner of the training ground with a pale face.</p>
<p>But he didn’t look there for long.</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s sword was at a corner of the training ground while Lee Soo Hyuk observed Park Jin Tae with gloves on his hands.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk did not look at them even though he knew that Cale, Choi Han, and Doctor Kang had entered.</p>
<p>He just started to speak again.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jin Tae. You need to get up.”</p>
<p>He slowly started to walk toward Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was slowly starting to stand up. His hands and feet were shaking.</p>
<p>But the completely fine Lee Soo Hyuk quietly asked a question.</p>
<p>“Your hyung will teach you something for the first time in a long while. Jin Tae, do you not want to learn?”</p>
<p>Cale briefly made eye contact with Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae avoided Cale’s gaze and pushed himself up all the way.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ptooie!”</p>
<p>He spat up some blood before getting back into a stance and responding to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Who said I didn't want to?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Yes. Jin Tae, that’s good.”</p>
<p>He then looked toward Cale and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. Han. Close the door.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was not smiling anymore. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 588: You've grown a lot 6</p>
<p>“I, is it okay to do this?”</p>
<p>Doctor Kang didn't know what to do while looking at Lee Soo Hyuk who was not smiling.</p>
<p>He had no choice.</p>
<p>‘It was to the point that even Kim Woo was at a loss for words.’</p>
<p>Kim Woo was nothing without his bluffing.</p>
<p>He would argue with Lee Soo Hyuk over the smallest of issues and would become extremely angry if anything seemed to decrease his power or influence.</p>
<p>Such a bastard had not said anything since coming back from supporting the rescue team. No, he could not say anything.</p>
<p>Of course, he did say one or two things.</p>
<p>Kim Woo had faced Heo Sook Ja, Doctor Kang, and Ma Seung Jin as soon as he returned to the central shelter.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja and the others had asked Kim Woo about Kim Rok Soo's group, but Kim Rok Soo had just walked past them with a frown.</p>
<p>He had then mumbled.</p>
<p>‘…Where the hell did these monster-like bastards come from?’</p>
<p>The rest of the rescue team and the reinforcements had returned as Doctor Kang was about to think about the meaning behind those words. They were able to hear about everything from the rescue team.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang had a thought on his mind after hearing everything.</p>
<p>‘If that unranked monster truly does attack Seomyeon, we must have these people with us!’</p>
<p>Doctor Kang then tried to hear more details about Kim Rok Soo's group from Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>But Lee Soo Hyuk just said that he had to chat with a pair of siblings in Kim Rok Soo's group before disappearing. He had come to the training ground after hearing that he was here, but-</p>
<p>‘I found him fighting with them.’</p>
<p>Doctor Kang was thinking that it would be bad if their relationship got soured after fighting like this since they needed Kim Rok Soo's group.</p>
<p>That was why he had urgently brought Kim Rok Soo and Choi Han over.</p>
<p>‘Why are they so calm?!’</p>
<p>The two of them were so calm that they looked almost asleep.</p>
<p>"Wait, if there's an issue, you should talk it out-”</p>
<p>Doctor Kang cautiously looked around at the people inside the training ground and started to speak, but…</p>
<p>“Hey! He said to close the door!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Choi Han with a frown and shouted.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang subconsciously started to speak after hearing that.</p>
<p>“T, that guy is saying that even as he's being beaten up-”</p>
<p>He sounded full of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Hey, Han.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk quietly called out to Choi Han again and Choi Han quietly observed Park Jin Tae for a moment before closing the door.</p>
<p>Choi Han felt someone walking behind him at that moment.</p>
<p>He turned around to see Cale standing there.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung?”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk and started to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm leaving.”</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae shouted from behind them at that moment.</p>
<p>"Why are you leaving without watching? Didn't you want to see me get beaten up?”</p>
<p>Cale then looked toward Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>He then nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“You see, I…”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked into Kim Rok Soo's eyes where he could see himself as if they were transparent glass eggs.</p>
<p>He really looked as if he did not care.</p>
<p>The owner of those eyes calmly continued to speak to Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>"I barely have enough time to look forward as I go.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae suddenly felt a sense of despondency fill his body.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could see that Kim Rok Soo’s eyes were firm.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae let out a weak scoff.</p>
<p>Cale turned away from Park Jin Tae without any regrets or hesitation.</p>
<p>He then took a step out of the door.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk's voice behind him.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk just looked at Cale without responding.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won and Lee Jin Joo had told him about what had happened at the shelter with Park Jin Tae in charge.</p>
<p>They had told him how Kim Rok Soo had been treated, as well as how Kim Rok Soo led and saved the people of their shelter and the nearby shelters.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo, who had eyes as calm as a lake, calmly started to speak to Lee Soo Hyuk again.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s anything for you to be sorry for.”</p>
<p>He then turned around again.</p>
<p>Choi Han walked over to Cale’s side.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale whispered quietly so that only Choi Han could hear.</p>
<p>“Park Jin Tae was on the national team for shooting. He has quite the athletic talent and fast reflexes.”</p>
<p>Choi Han made eye contact with Cale who was walking out.</p>
<p>“But Park Jin Tae is still no match for the team leader.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had talked about wanting to be an action or thriller movie actor, but he had not worked out as much as Park Jin Tae had done.</p>
<p>“You understand what I mean?”</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly looked into Cale’s eyes.</p>
<p>Cale looked back at him before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the team leader’s limit is.”</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>But Cale was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had continued to get stronger until the moment he died.</p>
<p>He had not perfected his ability.</p>
<p>But it had already been strong enough to put Lee Soo Hyuk as one of the top three strongest individuals and the best when it came to the sword.</p>
<p>“I plan on using this battle to raise the team leader’s strength to at least the level he had at the end.”</p>
<p>That was one of Cale’s goals.</p>
<p>He had left Choi Jung Soo’s issue to Choi Han, but nobody other than himself could take on Lee Soo Hyuk’s issue.</p>
<p>“So, you should take a look.”</p>
<p>Cale walked past Choi Han and was now outside the training ground.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk was born with this sense.”</p>
<p>Those words echoed in Choi Han's ears.</p>
<p>He held onto the doorknob for a bit and started to speak to Cale.</p>
<p>“I'll see you later, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>The door dividing the training ground and the hallway then slowly started to close.</p>
<p>Cale could hear Lee Soo Hyuk speaking to Park Jin Tae as the door closed.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jin Tae. You told me that you would follow my will.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had trusted Park Jin Tae quite a bit when he had been at the shelter.</p>
<p>“You said that you’ll at least let the shelter be a place where people can live in peace. That’s what you told me.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was now bringing up the promise Park Jin Tae made with him in an emotionless voice.</p>
<p>“You also promised me that you would protect the people in the shelter. Jin Tae, did you forget about that?”</p>
<p>“…Damn it.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae responded in a cracking voice.</p>
<p>Cale could not see what was going on inside because the door was closing, but it was obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk’s voice again.</p>
<p>“Come. We need to finish our sparring.”</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>He heard Park Jin Tae’s shout as well as the sound of someone running. It was almost certainly Park Jin Tae charging toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Cale chuckled.</p>
<p>“Looks like he’ll suffer for a while.”</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min and Park Jin Tae will suffer like this every single day.</p>
<p>The chances of today being the first day of many were very high. Lee Soo Hyuk would probably bug Park Jin Tae and Lee Chul Min over and over about how they need to share a proper lesson.</p>
<p>Cale chuckled as he could imagine that happening and slowly walked down the path he had come.</p>
<p>“…Rok Soo!”</p>
<p>“Hyung!”</p>
<p>Cale could see the Lee siblings and Grandma Kim coming around the corner.</p>
<p>The siblings called out to Cale but could not say anything else.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Grandma Kim walked over to Cale and grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>Her hands were very warm.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, grandmother.”</p>
<p>“Is the resentment in your heart now gone?”</p>
<p>Cale smiled in response.</p>
<p>‘Resentment in my heart.’</p>
<p>Grandma Kim was probably asking about Park Jin Tae… But Cale heard it differently.</p>
<p>The resentment in his heart.</p>
<p>The despair and regret recorded on his mind. Also, a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm doing well lately.”</p>
<p>Cale was doing quite well these days.</p>
<p>It might seem weird as the sealed god gave him this test in order to make him feel despair, but…</p>
<p>He really was doing well.</p>
<p>He felt as if he was slowly changing things one by one and that these balls of resentment on his heart were slowly getting resolved one by one even if he had to physically tax his body to get things done.</p>
<p>‘Of course, it doesn’t mean that I'll forget about it.’</p>
<p>He would not forget about his past memories.</p>
<p>However, good memories were slowly being placed next to those memories.</p>
<p>That was enough.</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s good enough for me if you say that is the case.”</p>
<p>Grandma Kim squeezed Cale’s hand once before letting go and starting to smile.</p>
<p>The Lee siblings nodded their heads as they observed Cale.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll be on my way now. Noona, Seung Won, see you guys later.”</p>
<p>Cale smiled at the three of them and started to walk.</p>
<p>And at that moment…</p>
<p>‘That’s why it’s weird.’</p>
<p>The smile disappeared from Cale's face.</p>
<p>‘Something is weird.’</p>
<p>The sealed god was trying to bring Cale over to his side.</p>
<p>In that case, would he leave Cale alone and let him successfully complete this test?</p>
<p>Would he just sit back and let Cale change the moments of despair in his heart one by one?</p>
<p>‘The God of Death and the Sun God wouldn't have done anything if that was the case.’</p>
<p>They would have left Cale alone, thinking that he could get things done on his own.</p>
<p>But the fact that two gods got involved and sent two people to interfere with this test meant that there was something fishy.</p>
<p>‘But no matter what that may be…’</p>
<p>Cale had firmed his resolve.</p>
<p>‘I will destroy it.’</p>
<p>He would destroy anything and everything the sealed god did to get in his way.</p>
<p>Alberu, who had repeated going back and forth as the Dark Tiger for a while, sighed while looking at the pile of paperwork in front of him.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Flap!</p>
<p>The tent flap opened, and the cold late autumn breeze blew inside.</p>
<p>“Your highness!”</p>
<p>“What is it, Saint-nim?”</p>
<p>Alberu stood up from the couch after seeing Saint Jack urgently approaching him.</p>
<p>“Huff, huff.”</p>
<p>Saint Jack was breathing heavily as he approached Alberu.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t run so fast when you don't have much stamina.”</p>
<p>Behind him was the at one point Holy Maiden, the sword master Hannah.</p>
<p>Alberu found it odd that the two of them were here.</p>
<p>But Hannah just slightly bowed her head to greet Alberu before tightly closing the tent entrance.</p>
<p>She then used her senses to see if there was anybody nearby.</p>
<p>Alberu just watched this with confusion.</p>
<p>‘It looks like something happened.’</p>
<p>He felt as if something extremely secretive was about to happen.</p>
<p>Alberu made eye contact with Saint Jack who barely managed to catch his breath.</p>
<p>"Saint-nim, may I ask what is going on?”</p>
<p>“We found it!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Saint Jack looked both urgent and happy.</p>
<p>“We found some text that seems to describe somewhere that might have information on the sealed god!”</p>
<p>Alberu’s expression instantly changed.</p>
<p>“…Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness! I swear!”</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>Saint Jack stopped talking for a moment after hearing Alberu's question and looked toward him.</p>
<p>“There are a few books stored in the Pope's office in the Vatican. They are the oldest books in there, so I decided to start there to investigate about the gods. By the way, those books are only for the Saint and the Holy Maiden. Oh, and the Pope; only those three people can read those books.”</p>
<p>Alberu could see Saint Jack pulling something wrapped in silk out of his pocket.</p>
<p>He could see that Saint Jack’s hands were shaking as he opened the silk.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Alberu soon saw a white book.</p>
<p>Jack started to turn the pages of this extremely old book.</p>
<p>Flip, flip.</p>
<p>But Alberu couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>“I can't see it either.”</p>
<p>Hannah shrugged her shoulders and informed him.</p>
<p>“Only my brother can read that book right now.”</p>
<p>“To be honest with you, I wouldn't have known what it was talking about if I had started to read it without any information.”</p>
<p>Jack continued to turn the pages as he spoke.</p>
<p>“There are three ancient books that are passed down, but only this is a record left behind by the first Pope. But it looks more as if he had copied down the words of the Sun God rather than created his own record.”</p>
<p>Jack's hands stopped moving.</p>
<p>“It’s over here.”</p>
<p>Alberu couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>But Jack started to read the words on the page.</p>
<p>“The sun will rise between two large cliffs facing each other. The memories of the sun will be buried where the sun rises.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s shoulders instantly flinched.</p>
<p>Jack continued to speak.</p>
<p>“And the only person who can reach the sun is someone who has overcome the curse of the sun.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“Only that person will be able to bring out the memories buried underneath this boulder.”</p>
<p>Jack stopped there before looking at Alberu and continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“I believe this memory of the sun mentioned here might be the memories of the sun god and that there might be information on the sealed god within it as well. That is why if we use this as a foundation to research-”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Ha!”</p>
<p>Saint Jack and Hannah could see Alberu scoff.</p>
<p>“Ha. How could this, this is unbelievable!”</p>
<p>Alberu was brushing his face with one hand without paying any attention to the twins.</p>
<p>He then casually commented.</p>
<p>“This is talking about me.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The twins responded in shock, but Alberu didn't have time to pay any attention to them.</p>
<p>‘The mark of the Roan Kingdom’s crown family.’</p>
<p>It was the sun rising between a cliff made of marble and a cliff made of granite.</p>
<p>‘In that case.’</p>
<p>The spot the Saint mentioned as where the sun rises…</p>
<p>That would be the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>‘It’s the Crossman household.’</p>
<p>Alberu quickly figured out who could reach the sun.</p>
<p>‘It’s me.’</p>
<p>It was talking about him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that last statement…</p>
<p>‘Only that person will be able to bring out the memories buried underneath this boulder.’</p>
<p>The Roan Kingdom's library had a secret staircase heading into the basement.</p>
<p>It was a place that only the master of the Crossman household could enter.</p>
<p>There was a stone room in that basement.</p>
<p>That stone room had a large boulder that covered one of the walls.</p>
<p>He recalled the phrases engraved on that boulder.</p>
<p>[ Descendants of the cursed blood. ]</p>
<p>[ The touch of the Sun God will always be by your side. ]</p>
<p>[ Never set your eyes on taking over the sky. ]</p>
<p>[ The Sun will always rise. ]</p>
<p>[ The moment darkness is planted in your bodies… ]</p>
<p>[ The moment a person with that darkness becomes the head of the household, the sky will be destroyed, and the ground will tremble. ]</p>
<p>Alberu clenched the half white half black video communication device and started to speak to the twins.</p>
<p>“I need to chat with Cale Henituse for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Your highness, we don't even know if this information will be useful. We must first find the record and see if there are any information about the sealed god-”</p>
<p>“It will be there.”</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Underneath that boulder…</p>
<p>They will find the information they are looking for.</p>
<p>Alberu’s instincts were making him certain about it.</p>
<p>“So, you're saying that you think the information will be under that boulder?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger calmly nodded its head and Cale’s gaze headed toward the calendar.</p>
<p>Today was November 3rd.</p>
<p>There were 3 days left until that day. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 589: Before the sun comes up 1</p>
<p>Cale turned back toward Alberu.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know whether the information underneath the boulder is related to the sealed god, but-’</p>
<p>He had a feeling that it would definitely be helpful.</p>
<p>Cale had currently walked out of the central shelter to talk with Alberu and Choi Han in a nearby area.</p>
<p>“That is why…”</p>
<p>Alberu was silent for a moment before he continued to speak.</p>
<p>‘I must explain to you what is going on right now.”</p>
<p>“I see. Please go ahead.”</p>
<p>Alberu opened and closed his mouth a few times before starting to speak, almost as if he was sighing.</p>
<p>"All other kingdoms on the Eastern continent except the Molden Kingdom have allied themselves with the White Star.”</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>“That is why it is likely that I will need to remove the troops that I have stationed by the Gate to the Demon World if I leave the Eastern continent.”</p>
<p>The reason they were able to stay there despite the pressure from the Eastern continent was because Alberu had personally been there.</p>
<p>The Eastern continent did not want to attack the future king of a strong kingdom on the Western continent.</p>
<p>They didn't want their actions to start a war between the continents.</p>
<p>“And it might be difficult to set up camp by the Endable Kingdom again if we withdraw now.”</p>
<p>Choi Han, who had been listening, started to speak.</p>
<p>“Your highness, what will happen to our allies who are currently stuck inside the Endable Kingdom?”</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim said that they should be able to last for a few weeks because they are with the priestess of the God of War.”</p>
<p>He looked toward Cale and added on.</p>
<p>“The Molan Household, Mercenaries Guild, and Duke Fredo have said that they will stay in the Eastern continent to help them as well. The Elves and Dark Elves will keep both sides informed.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve already planned to return to the Western continent, your highness.”</p>
<p>Cale and Alberu made eye contact.</p>
<p>“Yes. What we are doing right now is inefficient.”</p>
<p>Both of their eyes were calm.</p>
<p>"We must rescue you and our other allies who are currently stuck inside the Endable Kingdom. That fact has not changed.”</p>
<p>Alberu continued to speak.</p>
<p>“However, it is inefficient for us to just be gathered around the Endable Kingdom without a plan. We can’t even teleport into the Endable Kingdom because of the black barrier covering the sinkhole. It’s the same situation for the people inside.”</p>
<p>Of course, the White Star’s side might have a way to get out as they were able to negotiate with the other kingdoms on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>Either way, all Alberu had been doing was watching the black barrier.</p>
<p>“In that case, we might as well research a different method and get things prepared for the right time.”</p>
<p>The moment Alberu was waiting for…</p>
<p>“The moment when you finish your test.”</p>
<p>That moment would be when Cale returns from this test.</p>
<p>“I can tell when that would be.”</p>
<p>Alberu would plan accordingly as he was able to chat with Cale and knew when that would happen.</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed Alberu before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“You should be able to proceed with that plan as long as Eruhaben-nim and the others are safe.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Alberu smiled before adding on.</p>
<p>“I plan on just charging forward if our allies within the Endable Kingdom are in danger.”</p>
<p>He was smiling, but Cale and Choi Han could tell that Alberu was being serious.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I should be there to help you as well.”</p>
<p>Choi Han felt sorry for the others who were struggling while moving back and forth between the Eastern and Western continents.</p>
<p>Alberu awkwardly smiled as Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Why is the Eastern continent siding with the White Star?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“The Molan household and the Mercenaries Guild must be looking into it.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head instead of responding to Cale who seemed to understand the flow of things without needing him to explain.</p>
<p>“Then what is the situation on the Western continent like right now?”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s ears perked up as well as Cale asked about the Western continent.</p>
<p>That was where his home, his other hometown, was located.</p>
<p>“I plan on getting their cooperation to support us as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Alberu's voice was firmer than when he had been talking about the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>“I think we will need to gather as many strong individuals as possible.”</p>
<p>"Strong individuals……”</p>
<p>“Yes. We need strong individuals.”</p>
<p>Both Cale and Choi Han nodded their heads at Alberu’s firm statement.</p>
<p>They knew why Alberu was emphasizing the need for strong individuals.</p>
<p>"Cale, you said that you saw statues of 8 unranked monsters?”</p>
<p>The eight sculptures Cale had seen on the altar in the Endable Kingdom's underground…</p>
<p>“And that two of them were even stronger than the strongest monster you have ever seen.”</p>
<p>“I believe so.”</p>
<p>“Then we definitely need strong individuals.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger slightly frowned.</p>
<p>“But there are a lot of obstacles and not enough time to drag in these people who only care about their own kingdoms.”</p>
<p>The kingdoms on the Western continent were willing to cooperate with Alberu for the peace of the continent, but they were still hesitant to send their strong individuals, who were tied to the strength of their kingdom, into a dangerous situation where they might die.</p>
<p>Alberu understood this and did not want to force someone who did not want to come to come.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s complicating things for me right now.”</p>
<p>Alberu was able to talk about this because he was with Cale and Choi Han.</p>
<p>“We are lacking in both quantity and quality compared to the Eastern continent that has teamed up. I need to gather strong individuals no matter what it takes.”</p>
<p>“…There are some strong individuals.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Alberu turned toward Cale after hearing that comment.</p>
<p>“What did you just say?”</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak with an odd expression as Alberu asked in a slightly scolding tone.</p>
<p>“There are strong individuals who have not taken anybody's side yet. Very strong individuals.”</p>
<p>There were individuals like that?</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes opened wide and he immediately started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Who?”</p>
<p>Cale thought for a moment before slowly starting to speak at Alberu’s urging.</p>
<p>He then said a single word.</p>
<p>“Dragons.”</p>
<p>Each member of this race was very strong.</p>
<p>They were the greatest battle life forms in the world.</p>
<p>Nothing could match the strength of the Dragons.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I'm not talking about Raon or Eruhaben-nim. There are more of them.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked shocked for a moment before opening his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>He was laughing.</p>
<p>Alberu stopped laughing and started to speak.</p>
<p>"That makes sense.”</p>
<p>It really did make sense.</p>
<p>It made sense to drag the Dragons into this battle.</p>
<p>Cale leaned toward Alberu and started to speak.</p>
<p>“I have Lord Sheritt-nim and Eruhaben-nim who would know where the other Dragons are located. I also have Raon, who is said to have the potential to become a Dragon Lord in the future.”</p>
<p>There was no need to carry this heavy burden on their own.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>They would use all the cards they had available.</p>
<p>“Let’s drag the Dragons into it.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>"We’re not doing this just for our own benefits.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger slowly started to smile as well, revealing its fangs.</p>
<p>“Your highness, this issue is related to the Demon World.”</p>
<p>Sheritt had said the following.</p>
<p>She had said that the Dragons had closed the Gate to the Demon World whenever it showed signs of opening or actually opened.</p>
<p>“If we can find the Dragons that are scattered throughout the world… They should be willing to help at least once, if not more.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I'll be in even more of a time crunch if we need to drag the Dragons in as well.”</p>
<p>His eyes seemed full of energy even though he was saying that.</p>
<p>He looked as if he had found a way out.</p>
<p>“It'll all work out, your highness.”</p>
<p>Choi Han chimed in with a bright voice as well.</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly commented at that moment.</p>
<p>“You'll be in a time crunch, but, you'll feel quite confident when we barge in. These are Dragons.”</p>
<p>Choi Han and Alberu looked at each other for a moment before nodding their heads.</p>
<p>“That is true.”</p>
<p>“You're right, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale looked up at the sky for a moment and started to smile.</p>
<p>If they were able to gather the scattered Dragons and convince them…</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>The other two looked at Cale after hearing that odd laugh.</p>
<p>“Even that white thing will probably be shocked.”</p>
<p>Cale looked cheerful for the first time in a long while as he called the White Star that way.</p>
<p>The palace library inside the Roan palace.</p>
<p>In a stealthy room deep underground.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince! Can I get started now?”</p>
<p>Alberu who was leaning on the wall of the stone room nodded his head at Raon's signal.</p>
<p>“Yes. I leave it to you, Raon-nim.”</p>
<p>“Alright! I'll do a good job for your request, crown prince! You’ll give me delicious cookies!”</p>
<p>Only Raon and Alberu were in this place right now.</p>
<p>His gaze headed toward a large boulder located on one side of the stone room.</p>
<p>He could see the text on the boulder.</p>
<p>[ Descendants of the cursed blood. ]</p>
<p>[ The touch of the Sun God will always be by your side. ]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[ The moment a person with that darkness becomes the head of the household, the sky will be destroyed and the ground will tremble. ]</p>
<p>Alberu came here to find the potentially hidden record of the Sun God that was described in Saint Jack’s book.</p>
<p>Saint Jack, Cage, and Hannah tried to come here with him, but Alberu only brought Raon inside.</p>
<p>The three of them were waiting outside the library with the others.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what might come out.’</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘I also don’t know what might be left here.’</p>
<p>Whether it was his secret…</p>
<p>Or the secret of the Crossman household…</p>
<p>He had no plans to camouflage those secrets as something else.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t want too many people knowing about it.</p>
<p>It was not a good story.</p>
<p>That was why he came with Raon.</p>
<p>It was because Raon knew that Cale was Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>Raon also knew about Alberu’s true identity.</p>
<p>This young six-years-old Dragon and his aunt Tasha were the only ones Alberu could relax around right now with Choi Han and Cale missing.</p>
<p>“I'm getting started then!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Raon’s chubby front paws headed toward the boulder.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>Black mana started to gather at Raon's paws.</p>
<p>Alberu started to think as he watched.</p>
<p>‘Based on the blueprints of the library… Getting rid of this boulder shouldn't affect the foundation of the library.’</p>
<p>The boulder was exactly the size of the wall, so just taking this out of here safely would allow them to look underneath it.</p>
<p>The black mana headed toward the boulder.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>The boulder started to shake.</p>
<p>The boulder started to move with Raon using his now much better mana control.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The walls touching the boulder started to crack.</p>
<p>Alberu could not hide his anxiety as he watched.</p>
<p>What could be down there?</p>
<p>What secrets, what shameful things would be hidden underneath?</p>
<p>“…Oh my.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown.</p>
<p>Raon started to shout in shock.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince! This isn't moving!”</p>
<p>It shifted a little, but the boulder didn't move at all.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim, please step back for a bit.”</p>
<p>“I got it!”</p>
<p>Alberu walked past Raon and headed for the boulder.</p>
<p>The boulder was fine even though the walls on both sides of it were cracking.</p>
<p>He recalled what Jack had said.</p>
<p>‘The sun will rise between two large cliffs facing each other. The memories of the sun will be buried where the sun rises.’</p>
<p>‘And the only person who can reach the sun is someone who has overcome the curse of the sun.’</p>
<p>‘Only that person will be able to bring out the memories buried underneath this boulder.’</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“…Only I can take it out.”</p>
<p>Alberu slowly reached his hand toward the boulder.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>But nothing happened.</p>
<p>He could just feel that the boulder was warm.</p>
<p>“…It’s warm?”</p>
<p>The boulder was warm?</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>He started to think.</p>
<p>What would make this boulder react?</p>
<p>He thought about it some more.</p>
<p>He then decided to try out the few things that came to his mind.</p>
<p>"Crown prince!”</p>
<p>Raon shouted in shock as Alberu swung his dagger.</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>A small wound appeared on his palm.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>Blood started to drip from the wound.</p>
<p>‘This boulder is a boulder that curses the Crossman household and reacts to the one who has overcome the curse.’</p>
<p>How would this boulder recognize that person?</p>
<p>‘…Blood.’</p>
<p>His first idea was blood.</p>
<p>Alberu put his bloody palm on the boulder.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Boooom!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>There was a loud noise and Alberu stumbled.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>His head was starting to hurt.</p>
<p>His legs grew weak as if a large amount of blood had been sucked out.</p>
<p>"Crown prince!”</p>
<p>A shocked Raon tried to support the stumbling crown prince's back.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>But Raon removed his paws in shock.</p>
<p>“…It’s hot!”</p>
<p>The crown prince’s body was as hot as fire.</p>
<p>Alberu caught his breath and started to speak to Raon.</p>
<p>“I am okay, Raon-nim.”</p>
<p>He then looked forward.</p>
<p>“This seems to be the answer.”</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The boulder was changing.</p>
<p>Actually, it was melting.</p>
<p>It was slowly melting away as if it was reacting to Alberu’s fiery hot body and blood.</p>
<p>Alberu quietly watched the text on the boulder slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>And once the boulder stopped melting…</p>
<p>“…Ha!”</p>
<p>He took a step back and started to laugh.</p>
<p>About half of the boulder had melted.</p>
<p>There was new text inside the boulder.</p>
<p>Alberu recalled the original statements on the boulder.</p>
<p>‘Descendants of the cursed blood.’</p>
<p>‘The touch of the Sun God will always be by your side.’</p>
<p>‘Never set your eyes on taking over the sky.’</p>
<p>‘The Sun will always rise.’</p>
<p>‘The moment darkness is planted in your bodies…’</p>
<p>‘The moment a person with that darkness becomes the head of the household, the sky will be destroyed and the ground will tremble.’</p>
<p>He then looked at the new statements.</p>
<p>[ When a person with darkness is aiming to take over the world. ]</p>
<p>[ When the sky is being destroyed and the ground is trembling. ]</p>
<p>Alberu’s gaze headed toward the ground where the boulder used to be.</p>
<p>[ A member of the Crossman bloodline who has chosen a different path than the first Crossman. ]</p>
<p>[ Only you will be able to wield this spear. ]</p>
<p>At that spot…</p>
<p>[ During the time when darkness had descended on the world. ]</p>
<p>[ Is when the sun will rise. ]</p>
<p>There was a white spear.</p>
<p>[ You, someone with your own convictions. ]</p>
<p>[ Take out this spear. ]</p>
<p>[ Go forth. ]</p>
<p>[ Fight to protect your convictions. ]</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>[ Become the sun. ] </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 590: Before the sun comes up 2</p>
<p>Alberu looked at the white spear for a long time before he started to speak again.</p>
<p>“…It’s a divine item.”</p>
<p>A divine item. An item of a god.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Alberu just felt like laughing.</p>
<p>The corners of his lips twisted up.</p>
<p>The Crossman household.</p>
<p>People with this bloodline have always been worried about the gaze of the Sun God as they lived.</p>
<p>That was why they always worked hard to not fall into a path of evil, even if they did not do a very good job of leading the kingdom.</p>
<p>‘Who would have been at peace knowing about this curse from a god?’</p>
<p>They always had this sense of worry in a corner of their hearts.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the patriarchs of the Crossman household who knew about all these secrets.</p>
<p>It was even more so for Alberu, who had to live his life while hiding this Dark Elf blood.</p>
<p>Alberu subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Like he’s done anything for us.”</p>
<p>Worse words for this grudge that Alberu had in his heart did not flow out as he held himself back.</p>
<p>He said something else instead.</p>
<p>[ When a person with darkness is aiming to take over the world. ]</p>
<p>[ When the sky is being destroyed and the ground is trembling. ]</p>
<p>[ A member of the Crossman bloodline who has chosen a different path than the first Crossman. ]</p>
<p>[ Only you will be able to wield this spear. ]</p>
<p>[ During the time when darkness had descended on the world. ]</p>
<p>[ Is when the sun will rise. ]</p>
<p>[ You, someone with your own convictions. ]</p>
<p>[ Take out this spear. ]</p>
<p>[ Go forth. ]</p>
<p>[ Fight to protect your convictions. ]</p>
<p>[ Become the sun. ]</p>
<p>“Fight to protect your convictions-”</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>“Become the sun.”</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up in an odd way.</p>
<p>He didn't think he had always been like this, but it must be because he had faced all sorts of things these days while being involved with Cale’s test.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to do as a god tells me to do.’</p>
<p>He didn’t want to become the sun that the Sun God was talking about for some reason.</p>
<p>However, Alberu…</p>
<p>“Well… I’m sure it’s still considered becoming a sun.”</p>
<p>Alberu was planning on becoming the sun of the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lately, he had actually been thinking a lot about what kind of sun he wanted to become.</p>
<p>‘The Earth that Cale Henituse originally came from is too different from this world.’</p>
<p>According to Choi Han, there were social hierarchies like Alberu’s world and some nations still had monarchs.</p>
<p>But this country called Korea where Choi Han and Cale had lived did not have a monarch anymore.</p>
<p>Choi Han had told him many things to Alberu as Cale was busy.</p>
<p>Alberu learned many new things from these discussions and there were things he heard that were contrary to Alberu’s current thought process.</p>
<p>Alberu chuckled while thinking about those moments.</p>
<p>“…He sure felt like an instructor.”</p>
<p>Choi Han was actually quite talented in teaching people things.</p>
<p>‘Did he say that his original dream was to become a martial artist and a teacher?’</p>
<p>"Crown prince!”</p>
<p>Alberu, who had been thinking about something unrelated to this situation, heard Raon's voice.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince, what is this?”</p>
<p>Raon slowly moved toward Alberu and peeked his head to look at the white spear and the new words on the boulder.</p>
<p>Alberu could see where Raon's chubby paws were pointing.</p>
<p>The divine item of the Sun God.</p>
<p>The white spear.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>‘What is this? This is…’</p>
<p>“This is mine, Raon-nim.”</p>
<p>‘It’s mine.’</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up.</p>
<p>He had no plans to live as the Sun God's sun.</p>
<p>However, in order to live following his own wishes…</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>This white spear that had been making his heart beat wildly; this immense power that this white spear was channeling over to Alberu…</p>
<p>He would take it.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim, please step back a bit.”</p>
<p>“Alright!”</p>
<p>Alberu moved Raon behind him just in case.</p>
<p>Raon moved following Alberu’s hand while channeling mana in both paws. It was so that he could cast a shield at any moment.</p>
<p>Alberu took a few breaths before he took his bloody hand and the other hand… And moved both hands forward.</p>
<p>He then grasped the white spear.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.Hello sir.</p>
<p>“What the hell?”</p>
<p>Alberu quickly removed his hands from the spear.</p>
<p>The world was quiet.</p>
<p>Alberu looked at his hands before reaching them out again.</p>
<p>He touched the spear.Hello sir.</p>
<p>He could hear a stiff voice in his ear.</p>
<p>‘It’s the spear!’</p>
<p>Alberu was certain that this spear was talking to him.</p>
<p>“Son of a…”</p>
<p>Raon, who was watching, opened his eyes wide after hearing Alberu's comment.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince! What is it? Are you hurt? Crown prince, you don’t usually say things like that, unlike my human! What is going on?!”</p>
<p>Alberu could hear Raon's shocked voice, but he had no time to pay any attention to that.</p>
<p>It was because the white spear continued to speak to him.Hello sir.</p>
<p>But it was a bit weird.We will now commence the user registration.</p>
<p>It was very weird.Please state your name.</p>
<p>Was there a divine item like this?This product is an attack-type weapon created by Earth 3’s greatest expert and has a special ability.</p>
<p>‘……!’</p>
<p>Alberu was certain about what he had just heard.</p>
<p>‘It said Earth 3?’</p>
<p>Wasn’t the name of the planet Choi Han and Cale came from called Earth?</p>
<p>But it was Earth 3?</p>
<p>Did that mean there was an Earth 1 and Earth 2 as well?</p>
<p>Alberu was thinking that he might have ended up with something amazing.</p>
<p>Not because this weapon was strong…</p>
<p>Not because it was a divine item…</p>
<p>But because this weapon itself might be a bit of a hint for Cale and Alberu.Specifically, this item has significant durability as it was created from the bones of an Ex-Grade monster, which have been designated as the most terrible monsters. It is the only thing that is capable of breaking that monster’s bones and can be considered the life work of an expert.</p>
<p>Alberu flinched again.</p>
<p>‘The most terrible monsters?’</p>
<p>Earth 3. The most terrible monsters.</p>
<p>This, ‘Ex-Grade’ term.</p>
<p>For some reason, this seemed to be related to the monsters’ grades Cale, no, Kim Rok Soo had while living on Earth.</p>
<p>“…Would you look at this?”</p>
<p>Alberu realized that the situation was flowing in an odd way.</p>
<p>One corner of his lips started to slowly go up.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.Is your name, ‘Would you look at this’? The item will now be reg-</p>
<p>Alberu frowned at the stiff voice and urgently started to speak.</p>
<p>“No.”Canceling the registration. Please state your name again.</p>
<p>Raon was looking at him with a, ‘what is the crown prince doing?’ type of expression. However, Alberu didn't know this as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>A calm but firm voice flowed out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“My name is Alberu Crossman.”‘Alberu Crossman’ is being registered as the first user of the Unbreakable Spear.</p>
<p>Paaaat!</p>
<p>The white spear started to glow as the stiff voice said that.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince! The spear is glowing once you said your name!”</p>
<p>Alberu looked down at the white spear and started to think.</p>
<p>‘I should go back to sleep right away.’</p>
<p>He needed to hurry up and meet Cale.</p>
<p>He felt as if there would be a hint in this item given to him by the Sun God.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk peeked toward the Dark Tiger as it started to speak.</p>
<p>“This bastard is too different during the times it is blanking out and when it is not, don't you think?”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger moved according to Cale’s will when Alberu was not possessing it, but it was quiet.</p>
<p>“Lady. Saying such things is rude.”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk frowned at Mister Rabbit's response before turning away.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Rude, my ass. Look at you pretending to be all gentle! You just go around beating people up with your ears!”</p>
<p>“…Such words are a bit-”</p>
<p>“Whatever!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk ignored Mister Rabbit and looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng.”</p>
<p>“Yes, noonim.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the Steel Feather Hawk at her calling.</p>
<p>“I've been flying around looking for a place to stay.”</p>
<p>There was an odd glow in Cale's eyes before it disappeared.</p>
<p>‘She seems to have made a decision.’</p>
<p>Cale had made a special deal with these two leader monsters.</p>
<p>The contents of the deal could be easily explained.</p>
<p>‘Coexistence.’</p>
<p>The humans would give these two monsters their own territory, and in return, these monsters would work together with the humans to maintain their territory and the nearby areas to prevent monsters from attacking humans.</p>
<p>This was only possible because they were leader monsters that could instill fear and pressure to control Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters and communicate with humans.</p>
<p>“Noonim. Where do you wish to say?”</p>
<p>“I like Mount Jiri.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then I will speak with the people at the central shelter near Mount Jiri.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I will get rid of all the monsters causing them issues! So please tell them to accept my becoming the Queen of Mount Jiri!”</p>
<p>This leader monster’s natural instincts made it desire to become the monarch of a territory.</p>
<p>Giving some territory over to a leader monster might seem very dangerous and concerning.</p>
<p>‘But now that the world is already like this, mountains or wide forests are already beyond human control.’</p>
<p>Mountains, forests, oceans, all these places would turn into a haven for monsters.</p>
<p>In that case, wouldn’t it be better to have a monster that was on good terms with the humans and wanted to squash other monsters as a leader there?</p>
<p>‘It might actually be better.’</p>
<p>Of course, Cale didn’t completely trust these leader monsters.</p>
<p>He couldn't tell what they were thinking.</p>
<p>‘That’s why they each told me one of their weaknesses.’</p>
<p>Prior to making this deal, the Steel Feather Hawk and the White Rabbit had told Cale one of their weaknesses. What they told him were in line with the records he had, and could actually be recorded as critical weaknesses of these monsters.</p>
<p>‘And when the battle against the unranked monster ends…’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, Kim Min Ah, Choi Jung Soo, etc.</p>
<p>There would be enough people to take on these leader monsters.</p>
<p>That was why it would be pretty effective to coexist together even if they were wary of each other.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak to the Steel Feather Hawk.</p>
<p>“I understand, noonim. However, you will need to look for somewhere else if the people at the central shelter do not agree.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I can go elsewhere if the humans say no.”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk was quite generous.</p>
<p>Cale then looked toward the White Rabbit.</p>
<p>“Ahem. I still don't know yet, Mister Rok Soo. I enjoy beautiful places that set the mood, so I will need to keep looking a little longer.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Where the hell are you going to find a beautiful place when the entire world is full of monsters?!”</p>
<p>“Ahem. Ahem.”</p>
<p>Mister Rabbit feigned ignorance at the Steel Feather Hawk's comments.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Knock knock knock.</p>
<p>Cale opened the tall door to the training ground after hearing someone knock.</p>
<p>It was Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung. They’re asking for you to come.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Cale made sure his clothes were okay before he stood up.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk commented while looking at Cale.</p>
<p>“Hmm. The humans are probably having a mental battle amongst themselves and throwing a fit. Aren't they just dying to eat up our dongsaeng?”</p>
<p>Mister Rabbit agreed with that statement.</p>
<p>“I agree, madam. I don’t know whether they will accept Mister Kim Rok Soo as the leader.”</p>
<p>“But what can they do? What can they do when that’s what our dongsaeng wants?”</p>
<p>Cale said goodbye to the Steel Feather Hawk and Mister Rabbit who were chatting with each other.</p>
<p>“I must head out for now. I will be back later.”</p>
<p>“Bye, dongsaeng.”</p>
<p>“See you later, Mister Rok Soo. I will be cheering you on as you give your speech.”</p>
<p>Cale left the two monsters and walked away from the training ground with Choi Han.</p>
<p>Screeeeech, clunk!</p>
<p>The door closed and Choi Han looked toward Cale as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of time until your speech, but a lot of people have already gathered.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Choi Han gave a short response before stepping forward to lead the way.</p>
<p>Cale followed behind Choi Han to his destination.</p>
<p>The two of them walked out of the castle at the center of the Seomyeon central shelter.</p>
<p>“…We got here pretty quickly.”</p>
<p>Cale could see a large building close to the central castle.</p>
<p>This building was close to Seomyeon station and had originally been a large department store.</p>
<p>But there was a new, stylish building here instead of a large department store.</p>
<p>This was the meeting room and auditorium.</p>
<p>The people at the Seomyeon central shelter all gathered here whenever they had important information to share.</p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>“…It’s my first time in Busan.”</p>
<p>“Ha. Who knew this mess would come all the way here.”</p>
<p>There were people climbing the stone steps in front of the building and entering through the open door of the auditorium.</p>
<p>Most of them were not from Busan.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung. People are apparently here from more areas around Korea than expected.”</p>
<p>They were people who had traveled from all around Korea.</p>
<p>Starting from nearby Changwon, Yeosu, Ulsan, Gangneung, Chuncheon, Daejeon, Seoul, etc.</p>
<p>These were the 'ability users or leaders’ who had come from all around the nation.</p>
<p>There was a black invitation in their hands.</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed them without approaching the auditorium.</p>
<p>‘Each of them are people who will become at least Grade 3, if not Grade 2 or Grade 1 ability users in the future.’</p>
<p>Either that, or they had significant influence.</p>
<p>Well, some of them would die before they could get there.</p>
<p>“…Strong individuals.”</p>
<p>This was truly a gathering of all the strong individuals from around the country.</p>
<p>And one of those strong individuals…</p>
<p>Walked up the stone steps toward someone who was leaning on a pillar by the entrance.</p>
<p>“Woo hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>Kim Woo was the man leading on the pillar.</p>
<p>“It’s been too long.”</p>
<p>“It sure has! Have you been well, hyung-nim?”</p>
<p>“Just so-so.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Woo hyung-nim…”</p>
<p>The leader of Changwon’s Seongsan-dong central shelter asked Kim Woo a question.</p>
<p>“Who the heck is this Kim Rok Soo person?”</p>
<p>His voice was quite loud and caught the people gathering in the auditorium.</p>
<p>As for Kim Woo who had received that question…</p>
<p>He started to look somewhere.</p>
<p>He then started to speak.</p>
<p>“He’s coming right there.”</p>
<p>The people gathered inside the auditorium… The people chatting outside the auditorium… The people warily looking around…</p>
<p>All of them turned toward one person.</p>
<p>Kim Woo continued to speak.</p>
<p>“That person is Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile as all gazes focused on him.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I've been the center of attention like this.”</p>
<p>His voice sounded oddly entertained. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 591: Before the sun comes up 3</p>
<p>Choi Han took notice of every gaze that the people around the auditorium were giving Cale.</p>
<p>‘There’s nobody here as strong as Lee Soo Hyuk.’</p>
<p>Choi Han then thought about Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo should be in the training ground doing his best to reach his limits right now.</p>
<p>Choi Han had a slight smile before it disappeared.</p>
<p>He put on a poker face and looked around once more.</p>
<p>‘There’s nobody as strong as Lee Soo Hyuk, but there are a few ability users at Park Jin Tae's level.’</p>
<p>The atmosphere was tense as the strongest people in the country, as well as the people who had the greatest chance of joining that group in the future, were all here.</p>
<p>Of course, none of them were openly baring their fangs.</p>
<p>They were all smiling on the outside, but their gazes were extremely wary of each other.</p>
<p>Each of their greetings was filled with attempts to analyze the person that they were greeting.</p>
<p>Choi Han could see sharpness, curiosity, and wariness in the gazes of the people as they looked at Cale.</p>
<p>Choi Han recalled what Cale had told him.</p>
<p>‘It’s been a long time since I've been the center of attention like this.’</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak.</p>
<p>“You must have had a lot of situations like this, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“I may not look like it, but I did all sorts of things while I was a team leader.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded before adding on.</p>
<p>“This is new.”</p>
<p>“Which part?”</p>
<p>“Who knows?”</p>
<p>Cale did not say much and just smiled while looking at Choi Han.</p>
<p>“I see a lot of familiar people.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had become the team leader after Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>He did not have as many achievements as Lee Soo Hyuk at that time. Furthermore, he had started as a rear support team member.</p>
<p>Whether it was for that reason or not, there were many people who did everything they could to not help him out when he first became a team leader.</p>
<p>No, most of the people did not trust that he was capable of doing a good job as a team leader.</p>
<p>‘Even if Team leader Lee Soo Hyuk personally named Kim Rok Soo to be the team leader after him… He’s only in his mid to late twenties and did not develop his ability until much later.’</p>
<p>Whether it was within the company…</p>
<p>In the government…</p>
<p>Or even leaders of guilds and other organizations…</p>
<p>‘Mm… Things really are slower than when team leader Lee Soo Hyuk was in charge. Is it because you were originally from the rear support team? It is not as refreshing.’</p>
<p>‘You weren’t even an ability user at the beginning of the cataclysm. We know better than you do. We will just do things according to our guild's methods. You understand?’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had to report to those people or request for their assistance and cooperation.</p>
<p>‘Of course, I didn't just let things go either.’</p>
<p>Later on, people would say that they understood why team leader Lee Soo Hyuk named Kim Rok Soo as the new team leader. Some even said that he was even scarier than Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>But Cale didn’t care about all those gossips or gazes back then.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about any of that right now either.</p>
<p>But there was something new that he was feeling right now.</p>
<p>‘Those people that I had to report to and ask for assistance are all here.’</p>
<p>They were not as strong as they would become in the future as Cale remembered.</p>
<p>‘That is why I need to help them grow stronger.’</p>
<p>It needed to happen faster than it did in the past.</p>
<p>Cale was smiling, but his gaze was extremely cold.</p>
<p>Even Choi Han stiffened up a bit after seeing his gaze.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure this feels burdensome.’</p>
<p>Choi Han was thinking about how Cale was feeling.</p>
<p>Cale needed to ask for assistance from the ability users walking into the auditorium right now.</p>
<p>Then, Cale would need to convince them to let him be the commander.</p>
<p>It needed to happen so that they could safely handle the attack of the first unranked monster while keeping their casualties to a minimum.</p>
<p>Cale's group needed the help of as many people here as possible.</p>
<p>But it would not be easy.</p>
<p>‘I hope at least half of them will be willing to help us.’</p>
<p>As Choi Han was having that thought…</p>
<p>“It’s time.”</p>
<p>Kim Woo, who had been staring at Cale, stopped leaning on a pillar and walked into the auditorium.</p>
<p>“Woo hyung-nim! Wait for me!”</p>
<p>The leader of Seongsan-gu (Seongsan district) in Changwon, who had been standing next to Kim Woo, followed behind him.</p>
<p>Their actions made the others standing around the auditorium look away from Cale and start to enter one by one.</p>
<p>Choi Han was standing next to Cale as all of that happened. Choi Han then felt someone approaching them and looked back.</p>
<p>“Are you not going in?”</p>
<p>It was Heo Sook Ja, one of the three pillars here at the Seomyeon shelter alongside Kim Woo and Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Next to her was Ma Seung Jin, the man who would become the guild leader of Daejeon's greatest guild in the future.</p>
<p>“I will go in soon.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja stood next to Cale and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Will they cooperate with us?”</p>
<p>Choi Han frowned for a moment before he returned to normal. Heo Sook Ja seemed to be concerned about the same thing as Choi Han.</p>
<p>‘If at least a third of them help us…’</p>
<p>That was the minimum number of people they needed to agree to help them after hearing about Cale’s plan.</p>
<p>The two of them looked toward Cale with concern while Ma Seung Jin looked at Cale with curiosity.</p>
<p>Cale started to walk at that moment.</p>
<p>His voice reached them as he walked forward.</p>
<p>“I am not going in there for their cooperation but to give them an opportunity.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja flinched while Ma Seung Jin opened his mouth in order to ask what Cale was talking about.</p>
<p>But nobody could say anything to Cale who was walking into the auditorium without any hesitation. Only Choi Han smiled as he followed behind Cale.</p>
<p>“Noonim, shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go in for now.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja and Ma Seung Jin thought about the meaning behind Cale’s words for a bit before walking into the auditorium.</p>
<p>They saw Cale going up some steps toward the platform.</p>
<p>The auditorium was naturally full of whispers.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“I was wondering who gathered us here but it’s just a skinny little kid?”</p>
<p>A loud voice caused silence inside the auditorium.</p>
<p>Everybody looked toward the speaker.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man sitting at the seat closest to the platform was crossing his arms and looking at Cale as if he wasn’t impressed.</p>
<p>Changwon Seongsan-gu's leader Kim Kang Hoon was watching this with a curious expression.</p>
<p>He was seated in the middle and not next to Kim Woo who was up in front.</p>
<p>‘How will he respond?’</p>
<p>He looked down at the black invitation card while waiting for this young man named Kim Rok Soo to respond.</p>
<p>He heard the woman sitting next to him sigh at that moment.</p>
<p>“He should just shut the hell up if he doesn’t know anything.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon looked toward her.</p>
<p>“…Do you know that Kim Rok Soo person?”</p>
<p>The woman started to frown. She seemed to be asking why the hell he was talking to her.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon smiled in response and the woman just sighed again.</p>
<p>“I saw him when he went past our shelter area.”</p>
<p>She recalled what had happened when Cale's group had passed by her shelter area.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo's group had claimed they came to personally hand her an invitation as her shelter was on their way to Busan.</p>
<p>She got the chills thinking about that moment.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon cautiously asked at that moment.</p>
<p>“How is he?”</p>
<p>That question asked many things at once.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was extremely curious as he watched her mouth slowly start to open.</p>
<p>This was the same for the ability users around them as well.</p>
<p>The woman started to speak.</p>
<p>“He’s fucking strong.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon sounded confused.</p>
<p>The woman didn’t notice as she was deep in her thoughts about what had happened. She messed up her hair as she started to mumble.</p>
<p>“My goodness… After I saw those people fighting against the monsters… Wow, holy shit.”</p>
<p>A different ability user next to the woman started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Can you please tell us in detail what you mean?”</p>
<p>The woman started to blurt out as if she had been waiting for that question.</p>
<p>“First of all, they are very strong. Furthermore, some fucking strong monsters are on their side. And then, when some lunatic starts screaming, ‘I have faith!’ Those people became even stronger and… Wow, I only believed what I saw because I was sober at the time. I would have thought that my mind had done a 360 if I was drunk.”</p>
<p>‘360 would bring you right back to where you had started…’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon wanted to say that but held himself back.</p>
<p>“Is that person strong as well?”</p>
<p>He was looking toward Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>The woman scoffed as she looked at Cale.</p>
<p>There were others in this auditorium looking at Cale with similar gazes.</p>
<p>These were the people who had personally received the invitations from Cale on his way to Busan rather than from a messenger.</p>
<p>‘Is that person strong too?’</p>
<p>She started to speak again.</p>
<p>Her voice was firm without an ounce of hesitation.</p>
<p>“Totally.”</p>
<p>He was very strong.</p>
<p>But at that moment…</p>
<p>“I wouldn't have come if I knew the invitation was from a fucking kid! Who the hell are you to tell a busy person like me to come here?”</p>
<p>The man who had spoken in a loud voice earlier was still talking.</p>
<p>About half of the ability users who had not met Cale yet seemed to agree with this man.</p>
<p>He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>They truly were busy.</p>
<p>Every minute was important to build up their new central shelters and fend off the monsters.</p>
<p>The black invitations had been delivered to them in many ways.</p>
<p>[ Hello. My name is Kim Rok Soo and I have the ability of foresight. ]</p>
<p>The word, ‘foresight’ had caught their attention.</p>
<p>[ An extremely strong monster that is incomparable to the monsters you faced when the original central shelters were destroyed will soon attack Busan. ]</p>
<p>The invitation had then listed some information about the unranked monster.</p>
<p>It ended with a short request for their cooperation to fight against the unranked monster.</p>
<p>The leaders of the new central shelters or their chief executives who had read the invitation couldn't help but come to Busan.</p>
<p>They couldn't just pass it off as nonsense.</p>
<p>They needed to confirm the truth for themselves, which was why the leaders came or sent one of their chief executives if it was difficult for the leader to leave.</p>
<p>But they wondered if they had wasted their time as they saw a weak-looking barely twenty years old kid standing at the platform.</p>
<p>The man who had raised his voice was angry at the fact that he had come to Busan because of a puny kid like Cale.</p>
<p>He was also trying to show off his power.</p>
<p>‘Information. I will leave once I hear the prophecy.’</p>
<p>The man didn't care whether a monster appeared in Busan as long as his own shelter was safe. He finally got a safe place where he could act as king so why should he take part in a dangerous fight?</p>
<p>That was why he needed to show off his power and take control of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A little punk like this might spit everything out if he felt cornered even a little bit.</p>
<p>‘I can leave if others start to agree with me.’</p>
<p>He could stand around without saying anything before getting the information and heading back to his shelter.</p>
<p>That was why the man looked toward the people who seemed to agree with him and raised his voice again.</p>
<p>This was the last thing he had to say.</p>
<p>“I came all the way here because of some nonsense about foresight. Tsk! Just hurry up and tell us the prophecy! Stop wasting our time! We are all busy!”</p>
<p>Choi Han, who was standing behind Cale, started to frown.</p>
<p>Tap!</p>
<p>Cale stopped walking once he arrived at the top of the platform.</p>
<p>His gaze slowly headed down.</p>
<p>It was directed at the man who had raised his voice.</p>
<p>The man snorted while looking at Cale.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Even your gaze is that of a little kid.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>"Ability user Kang Il-Rae.”</p>
<p>The man, Kang Il-Rae, flinched.</p>
<p>It was because he heard his name.</p>
<p>“139 survivors.”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae flinched once more after hearing what Cale said.</p>
<p>His face stiffened up.</p>
<p>139 people.</p>
<p>It was a number he could not forget.</p>
<p>But the other ability users who could not understand what Cale was saying couldn't help but frown.</p>
<p>Cale's gaze moved to the people next to Kang Il-Rae.</p>
<p>“Ability user, Jo Min Yeh.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged woman flinched.</p>
<p>“398 survivors.”</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wide after hearing what Cale said.</p>
<p>“…No way.”</p>
<p>She knew the meaning behind that number.</p>
<p>Cale was still speaking.</p>
<p>He looked toward the man next to Jo Min Yeh.</p>
<p>“Ability user Kim Tae Hoo. 176 survivors.” </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 592: Before the sun comes up 4</p>
<p>The man next to Jo Min Yeh stiffened up.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“…How do you know the number of survivors from our original shelter-”</p>
<p>The auditorium had become silent. The people slowly started to realize the meaning behind the numbers Cale was mentioning after hearing Kim Tae Hoo's comment.</p>
<p>Everybody here were leaders or chief executives of the newly created central shelters.</p>
<p>That meant that the chances of them being leaders or people in charge of an original central shelter or smaller shelters were high.</p>
<p>The people Cale had just called had all been leaders of the now destroyed original shelters.</p>
<p>Kim Tae Hoo instantly started to sweat.</p>
<p>‘176 people. That’s the number of people who survived from our shelter!’</p>
<p>The numbers Cale was saying was the number of people who managed to survive through the hell that had appeared when the original shelters were destroyed.</p>
<p>Of course, there were more people in the new central shelter where Kim Tae Hoo was the leader.</p>
<p>But that was the number of people who had made it out of his original shelter.</p>
<p>“…How did you?”</p>
<p>‘How does this person know about that?’</p>
<p>Cale started to speak again as the ability users started to stiffen up.</p>
<p>He was looking at the man next to Kim Tae Hoo.</p>
<p>“Ability user Park Young Hoon. You had quite a lot of survivors. 412 people.”</p>
<p>Park Young Hoon's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the people who couldn't hide their shocks and held in the bitterness he was feeling.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae, Jo Min Yeh, Kim Tae Hoo, and Park Young Hoon.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what these people had experienced when their original shelters had fallen.</p>
<p>What monsters appeared, what buildings were destroyed…</p>
<p>How these people managed to survive…</p>
<p>He didn't know about any of that.</p>
<p>Cale remembered what happened around Korea on that day but had not been there to record it.</p>
<p>But he did remember the numbers.</p>
<p>Numbers were data that could give an overview of what had happened even without knowing the details.</p>
<p>The number of survivors from the original central shelters.</p>
<p>That hellish time had been recorded on a few sheets of A4 paper.</p>
<p>It did not record the number of dead people.</p>
<p>They could not check those numbers.</p>
<p>There were too many people.</p>
<p>When the world first experienced the cataclysm…</p>
<p>Quite a lot of people had died.</p>
<p>Then, when the original shelters crumbled…</p>
<p>Humanity faced danger once again.</p>
<p>That was the reason that the new central shelters that could fit tens of thousands of people had less than 10,000 total occupants.</p>
<p>This was why only the number of survivors were recorded.</p>
<p>There weren't any records of you if you died.</p>
<p>The original central shelters…</p>
<p>Cale slowly looked around at the people who had been leaders of those shelters as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>“Do I need to keep going?”</p>
<p>The entire auditorium was quiet.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh quietly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Is this the power of foresight?”</p>
<p>The number of survivors.</p>
<p>That wasn't enough to claim it to be foresight.</p>
<p>But she had no other word than foresight to describe how this man who looked like a teenager could know the number of survivors from shelters around the country.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae, who was next to Jo Min Yeh, was keeping his mouth shut as he glared at Cale with a piercing gaze.</p>
<p>Cale looked around before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“I guess I will stop there.”</p>
<p>Cale was standing at the center of the platform. Choi Han was by the wall of the auditorium and looking around as if he was Cale’s guard.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm sure that not everybody here feels the same way as I do. Some of you probably just came for information and there may be some of you who will fight with us here in Seomyeon, but many of you likely do not wish to do so.”</p>
<p>‘Why should I fight with them to kill an unranked monster in Seomyeon? Why do I need to do that? It's hard enough for me to survive. It’s hard enough to care for our people.’</p>
<p>There were many thoughts going through people’s mind even without Cale having to say so.</p>
<p>Everybody was aware of that fact.</p>
<p>But the atmosphere inside the auditorium quickly changed.</p>
<p>“I will now make a prophecy.”</p>
<p>Prophecy.</p>
<p>That magical word caught people's attention.</p>
<p>“The future.”</p>
<p>Cale wasn’t actually making a prophecy; he was just telling them the things he experienced.</p>
<p>“Population will start to expand once more through these new central shelters and people will start to create a social system once again.”</p>
<p>Some people nodded their heads.</p>
<p>These were the people who had recognized the defensive strength and expansive capabilities of the new central shelters.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, ability users will develop their abilities even more. Beyond that, there is data.”</p>
<p>Cale gently continued to speak with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“We will gain data by facing these monsters and we will be able to hunt monsters with a sense of organization.”</p>
<p>The people who had felt chills at Cale’s ability just now were starting to look better.</p>
<p>“When that happens, people will start to expand our territory once again; similar to what our ancestors had done, starting from the area around this shelter.”</p>
<p>More people were now nodding their heads.</p>
<p>That seemed to be what they want in the future as well.</p>
<p>“The destroyed environment will slowly start to return to normal.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped after saying that.</p>
<p>He needed to lead as many people, if not all of them, there.</p>
<p>The selfish people, the greedy people, even they needed to come.</p>
<p>He needed all of them to experience taking down an unranked monster.</p>
<p>That was the only way to give them the data to survive the uncertain future.</p>
<p>Because of that…</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Half of you here will die in order for us to get to that point.”</p>
<p>Silence filled the auditorium and it felt as if it had suddenly gotten many degrees colder.</p>
<p>Cale still had a smile on his face as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Over half of you will die.”</p>
<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>That was the future that Cale had experienced.</p>
<p>“Altruistic people will die. Selfish people will die. People who were chasing after greed, going after the greater good, sacrificing themselves, running away on their own, all sorts of people will die.”</p>
<p>The smile disappeared from his face.</p>
<p>“All of that will happen in the next 15 years.”</p>
<p>Cale looked down at the people underneath the platform.</p>
<p>“But I wish to change what I saw through my foresight.”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae started to speak again.</p>
<p>“…How can you change something that you saw through foresight?”</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with Kang Il-Rae.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae flinched after seeing the gaze of the person he had called a child.</p>
<p>Cale, the man with an unfathomably deep gaze, started to speak again.</p>
<p>“0 people.”</p>
<p>Before people could even think about the meaning behind that number…</p>
<p>"That’s the number of people who died at the original central shelter I was at.”</p>
<p>People started to gasp in response.</p>
<p>This was not the number of survivors but the number of deceased people.</p>
<p>Nobody had died.</p>
<p>“Originally, less than 100 people would have survived.”</p>
<p>That was the record of the past that Kim Rok Soo had experienced.</p>
<p>“But the present had changed and therefore, the future has changed.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo and the others had changed it.</p>
<p>“I hope that everybody here is able to survive.”</p>
<p>He really meant it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>“The more we shape the foundation to expand the number of people, the more chances humanity has for survival.”</p>
<p>He wanted to save as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Some of them would go on to become the worst possible people, but he just had to pass a list with the names of those people to Lee Soo Hyuk and say that it was the result of his ‘foresight.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was strong enough to look after those people and make sure they don't end up on that path.</p>
<p>“Have you heard this phrase?”</p>
<p>Cale started to again smile.</p>
<p>“Nothing beats numbers.”</p>
<p>Whether the unranked monsters were strong or not, whether monsters continued to appear…</p>
<p>“That’s right. There's nothing. There are no monsters that can win when going up against a large number of people.”</p>
<p>That was how humans managed to survive in the future.</p>
<p>The people in Kim Rok Soo's memories would overcome everything.</p>
<p>“The unranked monsters are the greatest enemies for humans to recreate society in the future.”</p>
<p>Everybody was focused on what Cale had to say.</p>
<p>"Why? It is because they are monsters with unbelievable strength that can destroy the new central shelters.”</p>
<p>His voice was quieter but it was still loud enough for everybody in the quiet auditorium to hear.</p>
<p>"And because you don’t know when that enemy might attack where you are.”</p>
<p>That meant that they could die whenever and wherever because of a strong enemy with unfathomable strength.</p>
<p>The weight of Cale’s words was heavy to these people who were slowly starting to trust what Cale had to say.</p>
<p>One of the people who were listening urgently shouted out.</p>
<p>“That! You can just use your foresight to tell us!”</p>
<p>"Who knows when I will die?”</p>
<p>The person who asked flinched and closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Kim Woo and Heo Sook Ja. The two of them, as well as Choi Han's gazes were headed toward Cale.</p>
<p>“My foresight is not omnipotent. I can only see a sliver of the future and even I don't know when I will die. That is why I can only move in the best possible direction.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja, who had been listening, started to speak.</p>
<p>“…The best possible direction……”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Cale lightly stomped his foot.</p>
<p>Everybody focused on him once again.</p>
<p>“I will now give all of you an opportunity.”</p>
<p>Opportunity. That word made people's expressions change.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the changes in each of their expressions as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“The way to defeat an unranked monster.”</p>
<p>The way to defeat a formidable enemy with unfathomable strength.</p>
<p>“I will give you the opportunity to experience the way to take them down. That experience will exponentially increase all of your chances of surviving the unpredictable future.”</p>
<p>Cale no longer looked like a feeble kid as he stood at the center of the platform.</p>
<p>He reached his hand out toward the people and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Will you take this opportunity?”</p>
<p>The air inside the auditorium was heating up and as the silence looked ready to be broken…</p>
<p>“Ah. Let me tell you one more fact.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>"As long as I am here, this Busan central shelter will not be destroyed like the original shelters you all have experienced.”</p>
<p>Some people flinched.</p>
<p>0 people dead. Cale's words echoed in their minds.</p>
<p>If they fought with him this time, they might be able to learn the way to save all of the people in their shelters with 0 people dead in the future as well.</p>
<p>The strong individuals from throughout the country were all gathered here.</p>
<p>It would be hard to find this many strong people anywhere else.</p>
<p>If they were with all these people?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be a bit safer?</p>
<p>As Kim Rok Soo mentioned, wasn't this the opportunity to fight against an unranked monster in the safest possible situation?</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the people here will fight while looking at my back the most, at least for this battle.”</p>
<p>That meant that he would be in the front fighting more than anybody else.</p>
<p>“I will let you experience victory instead of experiencing just survival for the first time in a long while.”</p>
<p>Cale’s words felt like thunder to these people who had barely managed to survive through difficult times and were doing their best to continue to survive in the future.</p>
<p>Experiencing victory.</p>
<p>They would be victorious against these motherfucking monsters that had dragged them to hell for the past few months that felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>They would be victorious against one of the strongest monsters at that.</p>
<p>Some of their expressions started to change even faster.</p>
<p>Cale started to look bigger to the people inside the hall who were looking at his outreached hand.</p>
<p>“Please make your decision.”</p>
<p>Cale was done speaking and it was now time to hear their responses.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>One person stood up after a moment.</p>
<p>Screech, screech-.</p>
<p>More people started to stand up as well.</p>
<p>None of them were vocalizing the fact that they would fight with him, but it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja clenched her fist while watching them.</p>
<p>It looked as if they would easily surpass one third or even half of the people in the auditorium at this rate.</p>
<p>She then looked back toward Cale.</p>
<p>‘I guess we won't even need to discuss the matter of making him the commander.’</p>
<p>Their original plan was to convince everybody that Kim Rok Soo was the best person to be the commander for this plan to take down the unranked monster.</p>
<p>But he had said that the Busan shelter would not be destroyed as long as he was here.</p>
<p>He had said that he would fight in front of everybody.</p>
<p>He had said that he would give them the opportunity to experience victory.</p>
<p>Cale was already the commander and the leader of this place by saying that. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 593: Before the sun comes up 5</p>
<p>The gazes focused on Cale as he headed down from the platform were extremely heated.</p>
<p>But Cale didn't look at those people.</p>
<p>“I leave it to you, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja, who was walking up the stairs to the platform as Cale walked down, gave a short response.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja walked past Cale with Ma Seung Jin and one of her subordinates behind her.</p>
<p>“It's nothing. I should be thanking you. I'll take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>She then added on.</p>
<p>“…Our dearest Commander-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped walking and looked toward Heo Sook Ja.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja smiled when they made eye contact and continued to walk.</p>
<p>Ma Seung Jin, who was following behind her, gently elbowed Cale's arm with his elbow as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“You looked cool.”</p>
<p>He then walked past Cale as well.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja started to speak once she made it up the platform.</p>
<p>“My name is Heo Sook Ja and I am responsible for the defense here at the Seomyeon, Busan shelter. Everyone who wishes to participate in this battle against the unranked monster, please come this way!”</p>
<p>The gazes that had been on Cale moved to Heo Sook Ja.</p>
<p>Cale watched this for a moment before starting to walk once again and headed out of the auditorium. Choi Han followed behind him.</p>
<p>There was someone standing at the entrance of the auditorium to greet him.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, that was a great speech.”</p>
<p>It was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Cale stared at Lee Soo Hyuk, who was leaning against a pillar and looking at him with his arms crossed, and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Where’s Park Jin Tae?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk still had black gloves on.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p>
<p>“Jin Tae is with Senior Kang.”</p>
<p>That meant that Park Jin Tae was beaten to a pulp and had to be carried over to Doctor Kang's for treatment.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>“I'll see him again when he wakes up.”</p>
<p>Cale started to think after hearing that.</p>
<p>‘He really is getting beaten up properly.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk added on with a stoic expression at that moment.</p>
<p>“Jin Tae also said, ‘see you later,’ before he fainted.”</p>
<p>Cale had a thought about this as well.</p>
<p>‘Park Jin Tae really is a crazy bastard as well.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk laughed once more as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Wouldn’t it be great if both Jin Tae’s mind and body developed right now?”</p>
<p>Cale, who could sense the vicious meaning behind those words, calmly responded.</p>
<p>“That sounds great.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk watched Cale respond as if he was hearing about strangers before he started to speak again.</p>
<p>“…You've been through a lot.”</p>
<p>He was not talking about giving the speech; he was talking about all the things Cale had to face up until now.</p>
<p>Both Cale and Lee Soo Hyuk knew about the many different meanings but did not reveal their fangs to each other.</p>
<p>‘Anyway, Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“That monster that is going to show up in Gwangalli…”</p>
<p>The unranked monster that would appear in Busan’s Gwangalli shores would then move toward the Seomyeon central shelter.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk slowly took off his black gloves as he asked.</p>
<p>“What is the name of that thing?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was asking about the monster’s name.</p>
<p>Cale pulled its name out from his memories.</p>
<p>“Electric Eel.”</p>
<p>“…Ho.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk let out a short gasp.</p>
<p>“A scary monster that is unranked has such a stupid name?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. That’s its name.”</p>
<p>“Did you give it that name?”</p>
<p>‘No. Team leader, you came up with the name later after you survived the attack.’</p>
<p>Cale held back those words. Lee Soo Hyuk interpreted that short duration of silence as he pleased.</p>
<p>“You must have come up with that name since your foresight probably only let you see or hear the monster. Your naming sense is terrible.”</p>
<p>“No-”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Cale felt wronged.</p>
<p>But Lee Soo Hyuk ignored Cale’s expression and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Ah, there was one thing I didn’t like about your speech.”</p>
<p>‘Something he didn’t like?’</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk in confusion.</p>
<p>"Which part?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked back at Cale for a moment before taking a short look at Choi Han and then turning back toward Cale.</p>
<p>“I will be in the foremost position.”</p>
<p>‘Ah.’</p>
<p>Cale recalled what he said in his speech earlier.</p>
<p>‘Furthermore, the people here will fight while looking at my back the most at least for this battle.’</p>
<p>The part about how they will see Cale's back the most…</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk did not seem to like that comment.</p>
<p>That was why Lee Soo Hyuk was saying that he would be standing in the foremost position.</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>He looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk who was walking away and started to speak.</p>
<p>“The person who will be in the foremost position will be decided based on the person's abilities.”</p>
<p>He was saying that Lee Soo Hyuk could not stand in the front just because he wanted to do so.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stopped walking for a moment to say something.</p>
<p>“That’s great.”</p>
<p>He then started to walk away without any regrets once more.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk and started to speak.</p>
<p>“How long do you think the current Lee Soo Hyuk would need to become the Lee Soo Hyuk at his strongest?”</p>
<p>Choi Han had seen the final images of Lee Soo Hyuk’s battle through Choi Jung Soo's memories.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was already stronger than all of the ability users here, but he was much weaker than his future self.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's battle abilities would only be completed in a few years.</p>
<p>Choi Han was curious about how long that would take.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale and nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“Probably soon.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>‘What does he mean by soon? Shouldn’t it at least take a year or two to get there?’</p>
<p>Choi Han looked toward Cale in shock.</p>
<p>Cale didn't pay any attention as he shared his expectations.</p>
<p>“He’ll probably be close to that level by the end of this battle.”</p>
<p>“…Is something like that even possible?”</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>Cale scoffed and then responded.</p>
<p>“That person is a genius.”</p>
<p>Choi Han, who was at a loss for words, started to think about something else.</p>
<p>‘It’s not an issue with his battle strength.’</p>
<p>It was similar to how Choi Han was teaching a sword art to Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Cale wasn’t personally teaching Lee Soo Hyuk as Choi Han was doing with Jung Soo, but there were things he wanted to show Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>These were things that did not come from strength but from experiences.</p>
<p>Those things would all be visible and remembered in Lee Soo Hyuk's memories after this battle.</p>
<p>Cale slowly thought about the battle that would happen in less than three days.</p>
<p>The image was being completed more and more as people started to slowly leave the auditorium.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel.</p>
<p>Unlike its stupid name, this unranked monster was extremely difficult to handle.</p>
<p>‘It is extremely smart.’</p>
<p>It was not the type of monster that would just attack and destroy things without thinking by relying on its wild instincts.</p>
<p>There were some unranked monsters like that, but the Electric Eel was extremely intelligent.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung. Are we heading over to Gwangalli right away?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Choi Han’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes, we need to head there now. We need to confirm things in advance and get things prepared.”</p>
<p>There were less than three days left.</p>
<p>He needed to use every minute wisely without wasting it.</p>
<p>Cale would head to Gwangalli and prepare for the monster’s arrival.</p>
<p>‘I need to prepare for everything.’</p>
<p>Cale firmed his resolve over and over to be victorious.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>He heard someone gasp in shock.</p>
<p>‘…Kang Il-Rae?’</p>
<p>It was the man who had raised his voice toward Cale when he went up to the platform.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>That man had tried to approach Cale before quickly retreating in shock.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>“W, what the hell is that?!”</p>
<p>It was the same for the others as well.</p>
<p>Cale felt someone tapping his shoulder at that moment.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung.”</p>
<p>Cale turned his head after hearing Choi Han quietly calling his name.</p>
<p>He then looked toward where Choi Han was looking.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>In the distance…</p>
<p>He could see why everyone had been shocked.</p>
<p>He could tell why the ability users who had not seen Cale's group on their way to Busan were extremely shocked.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae started to point as he shouted.</p>
<p>“A, T, Tiger monster!”</p>
<p>The large Dark Tiger was quickly jumping across buildings and headed over.</p>
<p>“Why are there no alarms going off?”</p>
<p>“What the-?! Is this okay-”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, the Changwon Seongsan-gu shelter’s leader, couldn't finish speaking after realizing something about his surroundings.</p>
<p>‘Everybody is quiet!’</p>
<p>People didn't seem to mind that a Tiger monster was jumping over buildings to get here.</p>
<p>In fact, some of the Seomyeon shelter’s people were looking at the Tiger monster with a positive gaze.</p>
<p>“…What is going on?”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was not the only one who realized this.</p>
<p>That was why everybody prepared to attack but did not dare to attack.</p>
<p>“Ah. I haven't seen it in a while.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon looked toward the woman who had been sitting next to him for Cale’s speech.</p>
<p>"Do you know that monster?”</p>
<p>The ability users nearby all focused on her.</p>
<p>The woman shrugged her shoulder and pointed somewhere with her chin.</p>
<p>Cale was standing there.</p>
<p>“It’s that person's hyung.”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger landed in front of the auditorium at that moment.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The tiger that landed with a loud noise fitting its large body approached Cale with its black mane fluttering majestically.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale warmly called out to the Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>“It really is his hyung?”</p>
<p>“Why is a monster his hyung?”</p>
<p>“Ho.”</p>
<p>There were many gasps of shock and admiration.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja walked up from behind them and said something.</p>
<p>“He is our ally.”</p>
<p>As people's expressions changed once more…</p>
<p>They all heard the Dark Tiger's voice.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng, can we chat for a bit?”</p>
<p>“Of course, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale didn't care about the people who were shocked at this sight they had never seen before and headed to a quiet spot with Alberu.</p>
<p>They were outside the Seomyeon shelter walls.</p>
<p>Cale confirmed that only Choi Han and Alberu were with him outside the castle walls as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“You were already able to complete everything I asked for, your majesty?”</p>
<p>Cale had asked Alberu to meet with Sheritt and the Dragon half-blood regarding the issue with the Dragons.</p>
<p>“No. I fell asleep for a moment before heading out to meet Lord Sheritt-nim.”</p>
<p>Fell asleep for a moment.</p>
<p>That meant that Alberu found time for a quick nap as he had something urgent to tell Cale.</p>
<p>Alberu would come to this place once he fell asleep.</p>
<p>“Did something urgent happen?”</p>
<p>Cale’s expression stiffened up.</p>
<p>“…Did the White Star launch an attack?”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s face was even stiffer as he asked that.</p>
<p>Alberu shook his head. His mane fluttered majestically.</p>
<p>“No. It isn’t either of those.”</p>
<p>“Then what-?”</p>
<p>Choi Han asked in confusion as Cale cut in.</p>
<p>“Did something happen in the library basement?”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I think I got some amazing information.”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale slightly flinched.</p>
<p>‘Not I got some amazing information but I think I got some?’</p>
<p>It was different from how Alberu usually spoke.</p>
<p>“Let me first tell you what happened.”</p>
<p>Alberu shared everything that had happened when he was in the stone room at the basement of the Roan Palace library with Raon.</p>
<p>The Unbreakable Spear.</p>
<p>He explained everything that had happened as he earned that White Spear and Choi Han's face slowly filled with astonishment.</p>
<p>Cale kept his mouth shut and saved his comments.</p>
<p>“…This really seems to be some amazing information.”</p>
<p>That was what Choi Han had to say once Alberu was finished.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger silently showed his agreement and looked toward Cale. Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Earth 3?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Choi Han interjected once Alberu answered.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that mean that there are also Earth 1 and Earth 2? Maybe it is a parallel dimension or a parallel world-!”</p>
<p>“I had the same thought. I believe that if we use this information as the foundation to figure out some more things, we should be able to find the secrets about this world and this test, as well as get some benefits for what we need to do in the future.”</p>
<p>Choi Han raised his voice.</p>
<p>“That’s right! I'm sure we will find some beneficial information if we gather some more.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head.</p>
<p>“That is why I chatted with the spear before I came here.”</p>
<p>Alberu had chatted with the Unbreakable Spear before falling asleep.</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly commented.</p>
<p>“Is it an AI?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing, your majesty.”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head and motioned for Alberu to continue.</p>
<p>‘Another Earth. How many are there in total?’</p>
<p>Was the place Cale and Alberu were from also an Earth?</p>
<p>Or was it a different planet?</p>
<p>Cale was starting to get a headache at the fact that the scale of all of this was slowly getting bigger.</p>
<p>‘I will only gather the information I need.’</p>
<p>Rather than being interested in Earth 3 or whatnot, he would listen to the information Alberu had gathered and just try to remember the information that was related to this place and the place he would return to.</p>
<p>"That spear introduced itself as ‘Taerang’.”</p>
<p>Alberu stopped talking as if he was organizing thoughts before starting to speak again.</p>
<p>"Apparently dungeons suddenly appeared in that world and caused the birth of hunters.”</p>
<p>‘Hmm? What?’</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>“Hunters?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>"And dungeons?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A Monster Wave? There was apparently something like that as well.”</p>
<p>“…Ho.”</p>
<p>Cale could only laugh.</p>
<p>Alberu didn't care as he wanted to quickly share the information he had gathered.</p>
<p>“It seems like the ability users here are called Hunters in that world, but that place looked a bit different than here.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>Choi Han seemed very interested as he asked.</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes were sparkling at this new information.</p>
<p>"According to Taerang, something called levels exist in that world and you can gain stats by going through the dungeons. You can use the stats you gain from leveling up to get stronger. Ah! But even that cannot overcome natural talents.”</p>
<p>“…It really is different than here. There is no system of leveling up in this place. There is the application and development of abilities, but it is not displayed as a numeric value.”</p>
<p>Choi Han nodded his head with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Yes. The natural-born talents in that world range from FFF-Grade to SSS-Grade. Beyond that, there is even an EX-Grade. An FFF-Grade Hunter who levels up would still find it difficult to catch up to an SSS-Grade Hunter.”</p>
<p>Cale silently wiped his face after hearing what Alberu had to say.</p>
<p>"According to Taerang…”</p>
<p>Alberu remembered it clearly as it was quite peculiar and seemed very important.</p>
<p>That was why he was able to repeat it word for word.</p>
<p>“It said that, ‘By using me, even an FFF-Grade Hunter would become extremely wealthy and their path in life would be a breeze with no obstacles.’ ”</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Cale, who had read all sorts of different genres of novels, brushed his face once again with both hands.</p>
<p>But Cale soon lowered both hands and had no choice but to look at Alberu. It was because of what Alberu said next.</p>
<p>“In addition… I asked Taerang about the monster that was used as the ingredient to create that spear.”</p>
<p>Alberu had instantly figured out what he needed to ask the moment he heard about Earth 3.</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze headed up to Alberu’s eyes.</p>
<p>“That monster that was extremely strong to the point it was almost unbelievable is an alien race with two legs, eight wings, Dragon scales, a Lion’s head, and an Eagle’s claws.”</p>
<p>Cale and Alberu made eye contact at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“It's one of the sculptures that was in the Temple of the Demonic God.”</p>
<p>“…As I expected.”</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>“The strongest of the monsters.”</p>
<p>Out of the 8 sculptures… He had faced 6 of those monsters.</p>
<p>But there were two monsters that were most likely stronger than those six monsters.</p>
<p>The monster that was the strongest of them all…</p>
<p>Alberu was describing the appearance of that monster.</p>
<p>Cale, who had been getting many headaches at the fact that there were two monsters even stronger than those six yet he had no data about them, finally saw a ray of hope.</p>
<p>Alberu, who had the same thought as Cale, started to speak again.</p>
<p>“Apparently, my spear is the only weapon that can destroy that monster’s bones?”</p>
<p>“Then we just have to destroy it.”</p>
<p>Cale and Alberu… Both the human and the tiger started to smile.</p>
<p>“Commander-in-Chief-nim.”</p>
<p>The first strategy meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting room was filled with the representatives of each region that were selected by the ability users from all around the country.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, the Gyeongnam representative, looked toward Cale and asked.</p>
<p>"The Electric Eel… How is that monster going to infiltrate the Seomyeon shelter?”</p>
<p>The intelligent first unranked monster.</p>
<p>The monster that appeared in front of the people who never even dreamt about the existence of these unranked monsters…</p>
<p>The monster had quietly appeared from underwater and used a stealthy method to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Cale gave a short response.</p>
<p>“The subway.”</p>
<p>The Seomyeon shelter was connected through the underground.</p>
<p>That was the reason this place had no choice but to become a ferocious battlefield in the past.</p>
<p>1. Taerang might translate to Bright Sun but I am not certain of it. I will just leave it as Taerang as I do not want to make any assumptions. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 594: Before the sun comes up 6</p>
<p>“The monster is going to attack through the subway?”</p>
<p>“…We would have been screwed if we didn’t know about it.”</p>
<p>The subway. The people in the room repeated that word in their minds.</p>
<p>This meeting room was the size of an indoor gymnasium.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak again.</p>
<p>"The Electric Eel… That monster will use the subway to travel close to Seomyeon before showing itself and attacking the Seomyeon shelter.”</p>
<p>“Something seems weird.”</p>
<p>Someone raised their hand at that moment.</p>
<p>It was Jo Min Yeh, the Jeonnam representative.</p>
<p>“What is weird?”</p>
<p>She responded to Cale’s question.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the situation at Busan, but I'm certain that most of the subway tunnels are destroyed and full of debris. There should be many paths that are impossible for it to cross.”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh looked toward Heo Sook Ja who was next to Cale.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja nodded her head.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Our Seomyeon shelters rescue team members have checked out the subway tunnels, and although none of them are fully blocked, many of them are at least partially destroyed.”</p>
<p>“But this monster is still able to stealthily cross through those paths to get to Seomyeon?”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh shook her head.</p>
<p>She then looked back toward Cale and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I was expecting a large monster as it is an unranked monster, but I guess it is smaller than I expected.”</p>
<p>Flutter.</p>
<p>They heard wings fluttering at that moment.</p>
<p>Most of the people inside this auditorium-like meeting room peeked toward the direction.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk glared at them as she fluttered her wings.</p>
<p>The different representatives had a thought on their minds as they looked at her.</p>
<p>‘He said that this monster was a Grade 1 monster. Even this monster would not be able to properly cross through the subway tunnels.’</p>
<p>‘He said that the unranked monsters were incomprehensible and incomparable to Grade 1 monsters. It must be much smaller than we expected.’</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk could not cross through the subway tunnels because of her wings.</p>
<p>“Ahem. That unranked monster is not small.”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae, the Jeonbuk representative coughed as he interjected.</p>
<p>“It might be smaller than what we all expected, but the subway tunnels are not small.”</p>
<p>He peeked toward Cale as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>"And our Commander-nim over here…”</p>
<p>He pointed toward Cale with both hands.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh, who had been sitting next to Kang Il-Rae during Cale’s speech, chuckled at Kang Il-Rae's demeanor, but Kang Il-Rae feigned ignorance as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“According to what our Commander-nim mentioned, the monster’s name is the Electric Eel. It is probably like a snake in that it may have a small body, but it wouldn’t be small if it was extremely long, would it?”</p>
<p>That made sense.</p>
<p>Ki Hee Ran, the Chungbuk representative, started to speak.</p>
<p>"And the monster’s size is not important; the main thing to worry about is its destructive force.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, the Gyeongnam representative nodded his head after hearing her being serious unlike how she had acted while sitting next to him during the speech and talking about Cale’s strength.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Either way, we just need to catch the one bastard coming through the tunnel, no?”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon smiled as if it would be simple.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon turned after hearing someone disagree with him.</p>
<p>Cale was the one who had spoken.</p>
<p>“It is not just one.”</p>
<p>“What do you mea-”</p>
<p>“Hmph!”</p>
<p>He heard someone snort at that moment.</p>
<p>“Woo hyung-nim?”</p>
<p>It was Kim Woo, the person who was a central figure at the Seomyeon shelter with Heo Sook Ja and Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was looking at Kim Woo, who had snorted at his comment, with a confused expression. Kim Woo showed no reaction to his gaze and just turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>It was as if he was saying that Cale would give the answer.</p>
<p>Tap!</p>
<p>They heard someone lightly tap on the table at that moment.</p>
<p>It was Cale.</p>
<p>"The Electric Eel has two heads.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“It is able to split its body in half as well.”</p>
<p>The representatives of each region opened their eyes in shock.</p>
<p>“…Two of them!”</p>
<p>The monster that had two heads was able to split its body into two.</p>
<p>That pretty much meant that there would be two monsters.</p>
<p>Cale recalled an old record as he looked at these astonished people.</p>
<p>‘That was the reason people at the Seomyeon shelter struggled.’</p>
<p>The unranked monster that had traveled from Gwangalli to Seomyeon underground fused its body together around Seomyeon and started to attack.</p>
<p>‘The people at Seomyeon shelter did not notice it traveling underground as they were busy dealing with the monsters that were going by from the appearance of the unranked monster.’</p>
<p>That was why it had felt as if a large monster had suddenly appeared and started to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Tap!</p>
<p>Cale tapped on the table once more.</p>
<p>“We will now show you the map of our operation.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon and Lee Jin Joo who were standing behind him brought a large piece of paper forward.</p>
<p>Chhh-</p>
<p>The paper was opened on top of the table.</p>
<p>“…The subway route?”</p>
<p>The map of Busan’s subway system was in front of them.</p>
<p>The route map that had been useless until recently because there were no trains going through had now been turned into a strategic map for the operation.</p>
<p>“Now then.”</p>
<p>Cale pointed toward the map.</p>
<p>“Is there only one train that comes to Seomyeon?”</p>
<p>Gwangan station was nearby Gwangalli beach. The route heading from there to Seomyeon station…</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh answered quietly.</p>
<p>“…There are two……”</p>
<p>There were two routes from Gwangan station to Seomyeon station.</p>
<p>They were part of different transfer routes, but none of that mattered now that the subways were not in use.</p>
<p>What mattered was that there was a path.</p>
<p>That was what was important.</p>
<p>“This……”</p>
<p>Moon Se-Woon, the Gangwon-do representative, started to frown.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>“…So then the monster must not be small.”</p>
<p>Cale calmly answered.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It is not small. It is quite large even when it is split into two, but it is extremely large when it fuses together. It grows exponentially when it fuses together.”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae touched his dry lips as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“The monster should become a bit weaker when it splits into two? Am I right?”</p>
<p>Cale slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p>“It is much weaker when it is split compared to when it is fused together.”</p>
<p>“Of course! That’s a relief!”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae's face lit up before it stiffened up after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“Of course, it is much stronger than the Grade 1 monsters that attacked the original shelters even when it is split into two and only has one head.”</p>
<p>“…Ho. It is stronger than not just a Grade 1 monster, but the Grade 1 monsters plural?”</p>
<p>Kim Woo started to speak as Kim Kang Hoon stated in disbelief.</p>
<p>“That is why it is unranked. It is at a different level of strength.”</p>
<p>Kim Woo slowly started to look toward Cale.</p>
<p>His voice was slow as he continued to talk.</p>
<p>“And our Commander is planning on killing all of those monsters.”</p>
<p>The people surrounding the table all looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“Yes. I plan on killing all of them one by one.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, the Gyeongnam representative, started to speak.</p>
<p>“W, will that be possible?”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile as he responded to the nervously stated question.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I, and we, will make it happen.”</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>The representatives of each region could see some files being placed in front of them.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon, Lee Jin Joo, Lee Seung Won were putting thin piles of paper explaining the operation.</p>
<p>“Those documents will tell you all of your respective roles.”</p>
<p>The representatives of each region picked up the documents placed in front of them.</p>
<p>“Please become familiar with it by tomorrow.”</p>
<p>They were all listening to what Cale had to say.</p>
<p>"We plan on heading out at noon tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The people would all head to their respective battlefields tomorrow.</p>
<p>Everybody looked toward Cale again.</p>
<p>"And the day after tomorrow…”</p>
<p>Unlike the past, the humans were now aware of the enemies aiming for them.</p>
<p>"We will start the hunt, no, the battle.”</p>
<p>The battle that was to come was a hunt to take down an unranked monster, a battle between humanity and monsters for victory.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>A teacup was placed on the table.</p>
<p>The finger holding the teacup moved away from the cup as the person started to speak.</p>
<p>“You came at Cale’s request?”</p>
<p>“That is correct, Sheritt-nim.”</p>
<p>Sheritt's gaze headed toward the blonde hair and blue eyed man sitting across from her.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman. He smiled after seeing her gaze and quietly looked at the man standing behind Sheritt.</p>
<p>It was a stoic gaze that seemed to be inspecting something.</p>
<p>“…You are alive.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood looked so pale that he could probably die at any moment, but he looked back at Alberu with an emotionless gaze.</p>
<p>Sheritt turned to look at the Dragon half-blood at that moment.</p>
<p>Flinch!</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood flinched after making eye contact with Sheritt and lowered his head.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Everything should be the same when Cale returns.”</p>
<p>Sheritt’s gaze that was full of loneliness, bitterness, sorrow, and all sorts of other emotions moved away from the Dragon half-blood as she continued to speak in an emotionless voice.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think we should cause any aspect to become any worse than it is now until that child returns. Wouldn't that child only be able to do as he wishes if things stay the same?”</p>
<p>Sheritt was using her magic to delay the Dragon half-blood's death as much as possible.</p>
<p>This was only possible because she was extremely skilled in magic and because she was the Dragon Lord, the Dragon who knew the most about the power of the Dragons embedded in the Dragon half-blood's heart.</p>
<p>‘Of course, I'm sure the pain became even worse.’</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood's pain exponentially increased in order to prolong his life.</p>
<p>It was probably difficult to just breathe.</p>
<p>Alberu asked the Dragon half-blood a question.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood just stood behind Sheritt without responding.</p>
<p>Alberu thought that he looked like a knight trying to protect his liege.</p>
<p>However, that was not something he should say out loud without thinking.</p>
<p>Crunch crunch.</p>
<p>Raon was quietly sitting down while munching on a cookie.</p>
<p>Sheritt was petting his head.</p>
<p>Alberu saw the quiet Raon peeking toward Sheritt and the Dragon half-blood as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“That’s great.”</p>
<p>As he made eye contact with the Dragon half-blood again…</p>
<p>“Cale told me that the Dragon half-blood should still be alive for me to ask something.”</p>
<p>Both Sheritt and the Dragon half-blood flinched.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I will get right to the point as I am busy right now.”</p>
<p>He was still looking at the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>Alberu recalled what Cale had told him.</p>
<p>‘Your majesty, I will tell you the conversation I had with the Dragon half-blood in the past.’</p>
<p>Cale, Eruhaben, the Dragon half-blood, and Raon. It was apparently a conversation among the four of them.</p>
<p>There was something the Dragon half-blood had said when Eruhaben and the Dragon half-blood first met.</p>
<p>‘That was why you ended up being the last one.’</p>
<p>He took a sip of tea as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“According to Cale, you said that Eruhaben-nim was the last Dragon to kill.”</p>
<p>“Correct. The White Star designated Eruhaben as the last Dragon to kill.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head and recalled something else.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had asked the Dragon half-blood who responded to him.</p>
<p>‘Was my heart meant to be yours as well?’</p>
<p>‘No. That’s not it. That person just said he needed it. But I don't know what he was going to use it for.’</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak while recalling the conversation Cale shared with him.</p>
<p>“You still don’t know where Eruhaben-nim's heart was to be used?”</p>
<p>“I don’t. I've been thinking about it, but I cannot figure it out at all.”</p>
<p>“Then how many Dragons have you killed in total?”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood flinched after hearing this question.</p>
<p>But Alberu didn't give him the opening to say anything.</p>
<p>“Based on what Cale told me, the reason Eruhaben-nim was selected as the last Dragon to kill was because Eruhaben-nim communicated with other Dragons. Doesn't that mean that you were worried about being found out by the other Dragons after killing Eruhaben-nim?”</p>
<p>“…You could say that.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Alberu put the teacup down on the table.</p>
<p>Dragons.</p>
<p>He had been mesmerized at the thought of using such an existence as his allies.</p>
<p>But it was now time to calmly assess the situation now.</p>
<p>“Sheritt-nim.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“How many Dragons were there when you were the Lord, Sheritt-nim?”</p>
<p>Sheritt slowly responded as if she was thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Usually… There were a total of 15-25 Dragons on the Eastern and Western continents combined in a generation. 10 if there were less than normal.”</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Alberu's index finger tapped on the armrest.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood's heart had five Dragons.</p>
<p>Then there was Olienne.</p>
<p>There were at least six dead Dragons.</p>
<p>Whether the White Star gave the order or personally killed them…</p>
<p>There were probably more than six dead.</p>
<p>“Anyway, there should be some living Dragons even if there aren’t that many.”</p>
<p>Even if the White Star moved stealthily, it would have been difficult for him to kill so many Dragons without the Dragon half-blood, who was sensitive to the aura of Dragons, knowing about it.</p>
<p>He made that comment and looked in front of him. He looked at the three existences related to Dragons.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Knock knock knock.</p>
<p>Someone knocked and they heard the Wolf boy Lock's voice.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Tasha-nim is here!”</p>
<p>Alberu stood up from his seat.</p>
<p>“I asked her to come.”</p>
<p>He then walked over to the door and turned the doorknob.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>The door opened and Tasha smiled at the people inside.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, everyone.”</p>
<p>She looked a bit tired as she looked toward Alberu.</p>
<p>“I came because you said you had an urgent question for me, what is going on?”</p>
<p>Why had he asked her to meet him here at Sheritt-nim’s castle?</p>
<p>Tasha was curious about that as well but did not ask in front of the Dragons.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Cale told me something.”</p>
<p>Sheritt, Raon, and the Dragon half-blood all looked toward Alberu once again after hearing him mention Cale.</p>
<p>“He said that in the past, Mayor Obante-nim-”</p>
<p>Obante, the mayor of the Underground City of the Dark Elves.</p>
<p>He was Tasha's grandfather and a 522 years old Dark Elf.</p>
<p>“Told Cale that he had met a Dragon before.”</p>
<p>“Ah! You're right!”</p>
<p>Raon jumped up and fluttered his wings.</p>
<p>Raon recalled something from his memories.</p>
<p>It had happened when they first went to the Underground City in the Desert of Death with Tasha.</p>
<p>It was when they had met Mayor Obante for the first time and before they had met Mary.</p>
<p>Obante had looked toward Cale and said the following.</p>
<p>‘I have met a Dragon-nim in the past. I felt the same feeling that I am feeling now. My Elemental, which met that Dragon-nim with me, says it is similar as well.’</p>
<p>Mayor Obante had said that before welcoming Raon, who had shouted, ‘I am the great and mighty Raon Miru!’</p>
<p>“That’s right! The Dark Elf Gramps said that to the human! He said he saw a Dragon with his Elemental!”</p>
<p>Alberu recalled a moment during his conversation with Cale.</p>
<p>He had asked Cale a question.</p>
<p>‘It is a minimum of 6 Dragons according to what the Dragon half-blood had said, but if the White Star killed some Dragons without him knowing… Do you think there are any Dragons left? Even if there are, I don’t think there will be many.’</p>
<p>Alberu had cautiously asked because he knew that the White Star was the Dragon Slayer.</p>
<p>Cale had calmly answered.</p>
<p>‘First, please check with Eruhaben-nim to see if there are any other Dragons he could contact and find out the locations of other Dragons. Other than that, mm.’</p>
<p>Cale had then said someone's name.</p>
<p>‘Dragons are extremely independent, so there is no way Eruhaben-nim is in contact with every Dragon.’</p>
<p>‘Then wouldn’t they be difficult to locate?’</p>
<p>‘I think you should first dig into Mayor Obante-nim’s side, your majesty.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm? The Mayor-nim?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir. If you find one Dragon, you might somehow end up finding the rest of the Dragons as well.’</p>
<p>Alberu, who had found it odd to talk about his relative, stopped thinking about that moment and asked Tasha a question.</p>
<p>“Mayor Obante-nim… Where did great grandfather see a Dragon?”</p>
<p>Alberu was slowly preparing things one by one for Cale's return, no, for the battle that might be the last war.</p>
<p>He was preparing to start a war to end all things and bring peace to the world the moment Cale returns.</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>Cale slowly opened the door to the training ground.</p>
<p>“Choi-”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud noise right next to Cale.</p>
<p>He turned his gaze.</p>
<p>The door he opened…</p>
<p>At the wall right next to it…</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>A person had slammed into the wall before falling down to the ground.</p>
<p>It was Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>He did not even notice Cale as he started to swear. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 595: Before the sun comes up 7</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo pushed against the ground in order to stand up.</p>
<p>“…So easily!”</p>
<p>He was speaking his thoughts out loud.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo raised his head and looked forward. Choi Han was standing there with a loose grip on his sword.</p>
<p>‘How many times has it been?’</p>
<p>He had stopped counting a long time ago.</p>
<p>He had sparred with Choi Han too many times to count, however, he still couldn't win.</p>
<p>‘Just the tip of his clothes…! I would win if I could even touch the tip of his clothes!’</p>
<p>The way for Choi Jung Soo to defeat Choi Han was to cut even 1 millimeter off the tip of Choi Han's clothes.</p>
<p>But forget Choi Han’s clothes, Choi Jung Soo had not even been able to block Choi Han’s sword properly for the last few days.</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>His clenched fist was shaking.</p>
<p>It was because of his anger toward himself.</p>
<p>He heard a calm voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Are you guys at least eating properly while you fight?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>He had not realized that someone had shown up. His head urgently turned toward the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo and Cale made eye contact.</p>
<p>“…You’re covered in dust.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked away after hearing Cale’s emotionless voice.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked like a mess right now.</p>
<p>His clothes and body were covered in dust and he was drenched in sweat. Most importantly, his eyes were bloodshot and looked terrible.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was aware of how terrible he looked right now.</p>
<p>That was why he was avoiding Cale’s calm face.</p>
<p>He heard Choi Han’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“We are making sure to eat every meal. I am making sure that he gets the proper nutrients for each meal as well.”</p>
<p>Cale's expression turned odd.</p>
<p>‘Vicious bastard. He looks fine.’</p>
<p>Choi Han looked completely fine without even a single drop of sweat.</p>
<p>It made Cale recall when he watched Choi Han training the Wolf children.</p>
<p>The children had looked similar to Choi Jung Soo at that time.</p>
<p>‘But he's not hurt anywhere.’</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze moved to the wall that Choi Jung Soo had crashed into.</p>
<p>It was not a regular stone wall but a wall with a soft cushion on it.</p>
<p>That wall was the only one with a dent while the other stone walls did not show any signs of damage at all.</p>
<p>‘He’s also feeding him on time and making sure he gets proper nutrients.’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's complexion was good for someone going through a difficult training schedule.</p>
<p>‘Well… Everything other than his bloodshot eyes that is…’</p>
<p>Peek.</p>
<p>Cale's gaze headed toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s gaze as he looked at Choi Jung Soo was innocent and full of warmth and satisfaction.</p>
<p>‘He’s totally pampering him.’</p>
<p>Cale’s expression turned even odder.</p>
<p>‘Shit.’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo lowered his head after seeing Cale’s face turn even odder.</p>
<p>It looked as if Cale was feeling pity for him after seeing his condition.</p>
<p>He couldn't even raise his head to look at Choi Han.</p>
<p>‘How weak must I be to……!’</p>
<p>How weak and easy of an opponent must he be that Choi Han could smile and defeat him without even trying?</p>
<p>He had gotten the chills after watching Choi Han fight before, but he could truly tell how strong Choi Han was after going up against him.</p>
<p>He felt like a tall and sturdy wall.</p>
<p>Cale looked back and forth between Choi Jung Soo, who had his head down, and Choi Han, who was looking at him with a satisfied expression, before making a comment.</p>
<p>"Do you just spar with each other?”</p>
<p>Choi Han responded to him.</p>
<p>“Training the body is all about the basics.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's shoulders flinched at that moment.</p>
<p>It was because he had heard what Choi Han had just said somewhere else.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo thought for a moment before recalling some memories that he had buried deep inside.</p>
<p>‘Training the body is all about the basics!’</p>
<p>His father had said that.</p>
<p>‘Jung Soo. Training the body is something any martial artist in our Choi family must do.’</p>
<p>That was what his grandmother had said.</p>
<p>‘Hey. How can you defeat me when I'm older than you? I've been training my body for two years longer than you have. My foundation is much stronger than yours, so how can you win?’</p>
<p>And his older cousin.</p>
<p>He recalled the things that the people close to him had said over and over.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at Cale and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“And you must build experience through sparring.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's father had said the following.</p>
<p>‘Build your experiences through sparring!’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's lowered head slowly started to rise.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Choi Han and asked at that moment.</p>
<p>“It looks like a real fight rather than a spar.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo had a response to that in his mind.</p>
<p>It was something that his mother had said at some point.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>His pupils were slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at Cale and responded to the question at that moment.</p>
<p>“The intensity of the sparring might seem too much, but a real battle is a place full of death. You can’t compare the weight of such battles with this spar.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could hear his mother’s voice in his mind.</p>
<p>‘Son. The weight of a real battle cannot even compare to a spar like this. Real battles are situations where you may be close to death at any time.’</p>
<p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p>
<p>“In a real battle… You are fighting for your life and the lives of your allies on the battlefield. In order to save everyone…”</p>
<p>‘Jung Soo, in order to protect yourself and your people at that time…’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to speak.</p>
<p>‘For yourself and your people…’</p>
<p>“…You have to work your ass off while you train.”</p>
<p>Both Choi Han and Cale looked toward Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo smiled after seeing their gazes.</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly looked at him before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“That is correct.”</p>
<p>His mother and father, as well as everybody who had taught Choi Jung Soo, had said the following.</p>
<p>‘You must work your ass off and train in order to protect yourself and your people.’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo realized something at this moment.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword art and his family's sword art had the same foundation.</p>
<p>Although the foundation was the same, Choi Han’s sword art had been developed further for real battles.</p>
<p>‘It’s there.’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked directly at Choi Han who had the same family name as him and became more certain about something.</p>
<p>‘There’s definitely some type of relationship between this person and me.’</p>
<p>His eyes clouded over as he quietly observed Choi Han.</p>
<p>Choi Han avoided his gaze at that moment.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to smile.</p>
<p>Cale, who was watching this, started to smile as well.</p>
<p>‘Looks like Choi Jung Soo is sharper than Choi Han.’</p>
<p>Would the innocent Choi Han be able to keep the two of their relationship a secret from the sly and smart Choi Jung Soo?</p>
<p>‘Well, I'm sure he’ll take care of it.’</p>
<p>It was only right for Cale to just watch what happened between these two people without getting involved.</p>
<p>"Choi Han already knows about this, but we are planning on leaving at noon tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Choi Han had a stoic expression while Choi Jung Soo looked toward Cale with a slightly nervous expression.</p>
<p>“Do what you need to do to prepare.”</p>
<p>Cale then walked back out of the training ground after saying that.</p>
<p>But he saw someone open the training ground door and come out before he could even let go of the doorknob.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>The person groaning was Lee Chul Min.</p>
<p>Cale looked at him and calmly started to speak.</p>
<p>“You look like shit.”</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>Someone started to speak from behind him at that moment.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to move?”</p>
<p>The person sounded quite tired.</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min flinched and quickly walked out of the doorway and the person behind him appeared as well.</p>
<p>It was Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>“…Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale and Park Jin Tae made eye contact and both of them let go of the door.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The door of both training grounds closed.</p>
<p>The two of them stood with the doors to the two training grounds behind them as they quietly observed each other.</p>
<p>Eventually, Park Jin Tae looked away and started to walk.</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min peeked for a bit before quickly following behind Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>Cale just watched Park Jin Tae and Lee Chul Min walk away.</p>
<p>‘They look terrible.’</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min and Park Jin Tae looked much worse than Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked much worse than Lee Chul Min.</p>
<p>‘…His hand.’</p>
<p>Both of Park Jin Tae's hands were covered in bandages and those bandages were bloody.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>They heard a loud noise that filled the hallway.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the wall right next to the door from where Park Jin Tae had come out.</p>
<p>The wall was sticking out and starting to crack.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“The training ground wall is going to be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae stopped walking.</p>
<p>But Cale was still looking at the cracked training ground wall.</p>
<p>There was a loud noise coming from inside the training ground even after Lee Chul Min and Park Jin Tae had left.</p>
<p>The person responsible for this was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was currently training Lee Chul Min and Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>‘Of course, Lee Chul Min probably thinks it is torture rather than training.’</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min just completely avoided Cale's gaze.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Park Jin Tae who had turned around and nonchalantly commented.</p>
<p>“Having more training is always good.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae’s shoulders stiffened a bit after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“But it's bad if it is going to affect you in the real battle.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae's expression sank while Lee Chul Min who saw this quickly looked back at Cale before not knowing where to look after seeing Cale’s even colder gaze.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae soon started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I am taking care of my body.”</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could see Kim Rok Soo walk past him.</p>
<p>He was looking at Kim Rok Soo's back as he had quickly passed by him when Cale started to speak again.</p>
<p>“Good, that’s how it should be.”</p>
<p>He then made one last comment.</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Cale then didn't even look at Park Jin Tae and Lee Chul Min before opening the door and walking into the third training ground.</p>
<p>There were some people waiting for him there.</p>
<p>“Sir, you’re here?”</p>
<p>“You’re here?”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum, the man who rides the wind, and Kim Min Ah, the woman with Herculean Strength.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, you're here?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rok Soo, you’re here.”</p>
<p>Jang Man Soo, the defensive wall, and Joo Ho-Shik, the man with the power of faith.</p>
<p>Cale headed toward the middle of these four people who were training.</p>
<p>He started to speak to the four people who were looking at him.</p>
<p>“We are heading out tomorrow, so let’s only train for about two hours today. Training is-”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah cut Cale off and finished his sentence.</p>
<p>“Is all about efficiency!”</p>
<p>“Is all about efficiency?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, you are correct.”</p>
<p>Cale chuckled and stretched out his arms.</p>
<p>Crackle. Splash-</p>
<p>A current and water.</p>
<p>Those two powers started to come out of Cale's body.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep it light today.”</p>
<p>He flicked his hand toward the four people.</p>
<p>“Come at me.”</p>
<p>The day before they headed out.</p>
<p>The final training was happening throughout the entire shelter.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The large castle gate slowly opened.</p>
<p>Early November. The air that was cold even though it was the middle of the day spread out to the outside of the castle gate.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>And once the castle gate was completely opened…</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Of course, my dongsaeng.”</p>
<p>The large tiger whose black mane was majestically fluttering revealed itself.</p>
<p>There was a young man wearing a black military uniform on top of the tiger.</p>
<p>This man was between a boy and a young man.</p>
<p>Cale, this man who was in between those two ages, looked toward the castle wall.</p>
<p>And on top of the castle wall…</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja, who would be responsible for the defense of the Seomyeon shelter while they went to fight against the unranked monster, was standing there.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and Heo Sook Ja blew into the horn flute in her hand.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>A large bird shot up into the air from inside the castle walls.</p>
<p>“Screeeech-!”</p>
<p>The Hawk with steel feathers flew in the sky with some people on her back as she cast her shadow down at the castle.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk was looking somewhere.</p>
<p>At the end of her gaze was…</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger who slowly turned around.</p>
<p>Cale could now see the numerous people gathered behind him.</p>
<p>These people had followed behind Cale with Choi Han at the front.</p>
<p>There were the Seomyeon shelter’s people standing behind Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>There were also the representatives from around the country who had agreed to participate in this battle.</p>
<p>Cale looked down toward them and caressed the tiger’s mane.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger slowly looked forward again.</p>
<p>Cale could feel the nervousness and excitement in the people behind him as he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>‘It starts now.’</p>
<p>He would change one more thing just as he had already done.</p>
<p>‘I will completely change the future.’</p>
<p>No, he would destroy his despair.</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes again.</p>
<p>The ruined city was in front of him. However, he could clearly see the path he needed to take.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Everybody, to your positions.”</p>
<p>Numerous people quickly started to move out of the Seomyeon shelter and toward their respective positions for the operation. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 596: Look at the back of the person standing in the front 1</p>
<p>[ The names of places and businesses showing up in this novel are fictional. ]</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won started to use his ‘Recording’ ability.</p>
<p>“It is currently 12pm on November 6th.”</p>
<p>Time had flown by since they left the shelter yesterday.</p>
<p>The words coming out of Lee Seung Won's mouth were being recorded.</p>
<p>"We are currently stationed on the third floor of Moonlight Hotel located directly across from Gwangalli beach.</p>
<p>There were many hotels built on the street facing Gwangalli beach.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won was currently standing inside Moonlight Hotel, one of those many hotels.</p>
<p>This hotel was originally over 10-stories high but only about four stories of it now remained.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>They could feel the ocean breeze.</p>
<p>“The area around Gwangalli beach is covered in a thick fog, making it difficult to see anything.”</p>
<p>The fog made it impossible to tell where that breeze was coming from.</p>
<p>"Forget the Gwangan Bridge, we are unable to even see the sand on the beach.”</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won’s heart was beating wildly from nervousness.</p>
<p>The fog had suddenly pushed in from the horizon at midnight.</p>
<p>That fog covered a part of Gwangalli and the entire Busan area according to their reports.</p>
<p>It was as if it was announcing the arrival of the enemy king.</p>
<p>That was why Lee Seung Won was anxious as he stood here without being able to see much.</p>
<p>He felt his lips drying out as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>"We are currently waiting for the first unranked monster, the Electric Eel.”</p>
<p>He was scared.</p>
<p>His ability would not let him defeat a Grade 3 monster let alone a Grade 1 monster.</p>
<p>But he was in the vanguard in the fight against this unranked monster.</p>
<p>‘…It’ll be fine.’</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won consoled himself.</p>
<p>In this hotel room with the windows all broken… There was someone leaning on a pillar by the window sill with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Are you done recording?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I'm done, hyung.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was here with him.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's finger started to move.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won’s first recording ended with that quiet click.</p>
<p>“My heart is beating so quickly.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's gaze started to move.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, the Changwon Seongsan-gu shelter’s leader and current Gyeongnam representative, was sitting on an old couch he found from who knows where.</p>
<p>Cale, Lee Seung Won, and Kim Kang Hoon.</p>
<p>Only these three people were here right now.</p>
<p>They were the only ones in all of Gwangalli.</p>
<p>‘…I didn’t really think that only the three of us would come here.’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was getting a bad feeling as time passed on.</p>
<p>The fog had slowly started to cover Busan starting on November 6th as Commander Kim Rok Soo had mentioned.</p>
<p>He could feel the foresight becoming a reality with his own body.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be nervous.”</p>
<p>He turned his head after hearing a voice.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was looking at him.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be worried either.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon became even more worried after hearing his calm voice.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>"We are not attacking the monster from here. We are just here to watch.”</p>
<p>‘Exactly! That’s why I'm even more scared! That’s the reason only three of us are here!’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was wondering if he should not have stepped up.</p>
<p>This combination seemed more unreliable the more he thought about it.</p>
<p>“…Lee Seung Won is not an attack-type ability user. He isn’t a defense-type either. He has zero fighting ability.”</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘I heard that Kim Rok Soo is strong, but I have not seen it with my own eyes.’</p>
<p>That was why he could only trust himself.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon bit down on his lips with nervousness.</p>
<p>“Uhh, uhh-!”</p>
<p>He then heard Lee Seung Won's voice and…</p>
<p>“It's here.”</p>
<p>He also heard Kim Rok Soo's calm voice.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p>Cale pulled on the string of the blinds they had installed yesterday.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the window was covered starting from the top.</p>
<p>“Put the light out.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won, who had been stuttering, quickly put out the candle after hearing Cale’s stern voice.</p>
<p>“Huuuuuuuu-”</p>
<p>The room instantly turned dark.</p>
<p>But that darkness was not what Lee Seung Won and Kim Kang Hoon were focused on right now.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>This noise was different from the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>It was definitely the sound of something moving through the water.</p>
<p>It was the sound of the monster getting closer.</p>
<p>They could then see it.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon moved over to Cale who was crouching and looked out the open third of the blinds.</p>
<p>“…M, my goodness.”</p>
<p>He could see it.</p>
<p>Out in the distance where the water should be but he could only see white fog right now…</p>
<p>“…M, monster-!”</p>
<p>It was large. Something much larger than the buildings located in Gwangalli was slowly cutting through the water and headed toward them.</p>
<p>He couldn't see its shape properly, but he could tell that it had two heads.</p>
<p>“Commander, that-”</p>
<p>“Your mouth.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon subconsciously covered his mouth after hearing Cale’s comment.</p>
<p>Cale didn’t even look at Kim Kang Hoon as he put his index finger up to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won, who had been about to speak as well, quickly shut his mouth.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>All they could hear was the monster approaching from the distance.</p>
<p>Closer…</p>
<p>Slowly getting faster…</p>
<p>The monster was getting closer.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon tried not to say anything, but he couldn't hold back.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim, how can such a large monster go through the subway?”</p>
<p>The large monster that was covered by the fog would not be able to fit inside the subway tunnels even if it was split in half.</p>
<p>‘Even if it gets smaller when it splits into two…! There should still be a limit to it!’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon subconsciously continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Even if it splits its body into two and shrinks- mmph!”</p>
<p>Cale covered his mouth.</p>
<p>“It’ll hear you.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon recalled what Cale had explained about the ‘Electric Eel.’</p>
<p>‘As this monster has two heads, each head has different abilities.’</p>
<p>‘This stays the same even when the body is split into two.’</p>
<p>That meant that the abilities of the Electric Eel would be split following the abilities of each head when split into two bodies.</p>
<p>‘That is why it is possible to take it down.’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon covered his own mouth after Cale removed his hand.</p>
<p>‘The yellow head specializes in sounds and electricity.’</p>
<p>He then heard Cale's quiet whisper.</p>
<p>“Please get started.”</p>
<p>Cale then shut up as well.</p>
<p>But that was enough. Kim Kang Hoon quickly formed a hand seal.</p>
<p>Oooooo-</p>
<p>It felt as if the quiet cry of an animal could be heard.</p>
<p>Paat!</p>
<p>A half-transparent blue light surrounded Kim Kang Hoon, Cale, and Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>Cale had an odd expression while looking at the light surrounding his body.</p>
<p>He peeked toward Kim Kang Hoon.</p>
<p>‘Kim Kang Hoon, the Shadow of the Moon.’</p>
<p>That was the nickname that would be given to Kim Kang Hoon, the Gyeongnam representative, in the future.</p>
<p>He had a special ability related to stealth and movement.</p>
<p>‘…I remember that enemies would not be able to see him nor sense him when he uses his abilities as long as the sun is not out.’</p>
<p>They wouldn’t be able to sense a certain level of noise and presence that came with moving around. Furthermore, the enemies would not be able to see them moving.</p>
<p>However, people surrounded by the blue light could sense each other.</p>
<p>Of course, if the enemy caught them once because they made too much noise or failed an attack, it could not be used on the same enemy ever again.</p>
<p>In addition, it could not be used underneath the sun.</p>
<p>That might seem like quite the restriction, but the night was scarier than the day in this world.</p>
<p>‘The sun is not visible because of the thick fog right now.’</p>
<p>Although it was the middle of the day, the sun was not visible and the thick fog made it feel quite gloomy.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon gently tapped on Cale’s arm.</p>
<p>He then nodded his head.</p>
<p>‘Commander-nim, you don’t need to worry about our presence anymore.’</p>
<p>He could tell that that was the message being conveyed through Kim Kang Hoon's eyes.</p>
<p>That was why Cale brazenly lifted the blinds a little more.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>They heard a different noise than the sound of something moving through the water.</p>
<p>Finally, the faintly visible large monster was now clearly visible.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won held back a gasp and covered his mouth with both hands.</p>
<p>‘…This, what the-!’</p>
<p>The monster with two different looking heads, one yellow and one blue, cut through the sand and landed on Busan.</p>
<p>‘That’s an eel?’</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was having the same thought as well.</p>
<p>‘That’s a snake, no, an imugi-’</p>
<p>His hands were sweating.</p>
<p>‘No, should I call it a dragon?’</p>
<p>This indescribable monster with quite the presence was leisurely moving.</p>
<p>Silently.</p>
<p>Majestically.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel was moving its two heads in different directions as it slowly looked through the fog.</p>
<p>It was as if it could see everything even with the fog covering the city.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon had this thought in his mind.</p>
<p>‘It looks like a monster from mythology!’</p>
<p>Its scales were inside the fog but the mixture of blue and yellow was sparkling.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>That was why he was scared.</p>
<p>It looked like a monster at the level of the gods.</p>
<p>He started to get the chills.</p>
<p>‘Kim Rok Soo was right!’</p>
<p>The unranked monsters…</p>
<p>These were completely different than the monsters they had fought against until now.</p>
<p>The presence they gave off was completely incomparable to the Grade 1 monsters.</p>
<p>‘If we had to face this kind of monster without knowing anything……!’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon was starting to sweat.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won was curling up in fear.</p>
<p>The large monster started to move at that moment.</p>
<p>Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The buildings were being destroyed as it moved past them.</p>
<p>‘Mmph!’</p>
<p>‘Gasp!’</p>
<p>Shhhhh-</p>
<p>That large body moved past right in front of the Moonlight Hotel.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon and Lee Seung Won froze where they were standing.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>The two of them felt a warm hand on their shoulders at that moment.</p>
<p>It was Cale.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head with his usual expression on his face.</p>
<p>Let’s move.</p>
<p>That was what he was saying with this motion.</p>
<p>Cale cautiously started to walk toward the roof even though their presence was hidden.</p>
<p>‘Ah. That’s a relief.’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon subconsciously had that thought for a moment.</p>
<p>His frozen body started to melt as he felt relief while looking at the person walking in front of him and his unwavering back.</p>
<p>He offered his back to Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won got on and the three of them soon reached the hotel's roof.</p>
<p>The large monster had its body in a straight line and was looking at a single spot with both of its heads when they got up there.</p>
<p>‘As expected.’</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel was looking directly at the Gwangan station entrances heading underground.</p>
<p>“Ssssssssss-”</p>
<p>The yellow head opened its mouth and let out an odd noise.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue head started to make a noise as well and then something shocking happened.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon and Lee Seung Won's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>‘It’s shrinking!’</p>
<p>‘It’s splitting!’</p>
<p>The large monster’s legend-like beautiful body was slowly starting to shrink.</p>
<p>The body then split in half.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon held back a groan.</p>
<p>The monster’s size had shrunk quite a bit.</p>
<p>‘It’s similar to a Grade 1 snake monster now!’</p>
<p>The fact that it was the same size as a Grade 1 monster was not the issue.</p>
<p>It was now small enough to go through the subway.</p>
<p>“Ssssssssss!”</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The monster that had split into two made noises at each other before they went down the seventh exit and third exit.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>They broke through the narrow entrance to get underground.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon had a thought as he watched the monsters move.</p>
<p>‘I guess the entrance to get down is smaller compared to the subway tunnels.’</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As the yellow head made a loud noise and half of its body was inside the tunnel…</p>
<p>“The yellow head should not be able to hear us anymore.”</p>
<p>The two of them heard Cale's voice.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon and Lee Seung Won turned their heads.</p>
<p>“Let’s move.”</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>A gust of wind surrounded the three people.</p>
<p>Cale kicked off the ground and jumped across buildings to head toward Gwangan station.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon followed behind him with Lee Seung Won on his back.</p>
<p>“They’re fast.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon could see the yellow head and blue head moving underground quickly.</p>
<p>It had been loud when they were destroying the entrances into the subway, but their movements were extremely stealthy after that.</p>
<p>The Seomyeon shelter would never see them coming.</p>
<p>"Are we following them down?”</p>
<p>The three of them stopped at a building near Gwangan station and Cale checked the time before nodding his head at Kim Kang Hoon’s question.</p>
<p>“Carefully.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>The three of them were extremely careful on their way down even though their presences were hidden.</p>
<p>‘It’s a mess.’</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won looked at the subway station that had turned into a mess.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, the three of them couldn't see anything other than the area around them lit up by the blue light surrounding them, but they could see some damages from the monster moving through.</p>
<p>Flick.</p>
<p>Cale motioned for them to follow him.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon headed farther down following behind Cale.</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>Cale then stopped walking.</p>
<p>The two eels were already gone.</p>
<p>They should have moved in different directions.</p>
<p>Cale crouched down.</p>
<p>He reached his hand out and touched some water.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the paths with traces of water.</p>
<p>He then raised his other hand.</p>
<p>“Squad 1, Squad 2, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>There was a walkie-talkie in his hand.</p>
<p>Yes, sir, we can hear you.</p>
<p>We can hear you, Commander-nim!</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, who had been watching him, gulped after hearing the others’ voices.</p>
<p>‘It’s starting!’</p>
<p>The plan to hunt this monster that gave off quite a lot of pressure when he saw it in person was starting.</p>
<p>Cale’s calm voice echoed through the area.</p>
<p>“The two Electric Eels have started to move.”</p>
<p>There were two paths to get from Gwangan station to Seomyeon using the subway.</p>
<p>The first path was using Line 2 that went directly to Seomyeon.</p>
<p>The other path was going through Gwangan-Suyeong-Yeonsan-Seomyeon.</p>
<p>“The yellow head is moving toward Suyeong.”</p>
<p>Gwangan-Suyeong-Yeonsan-Seomyeon</p>
<p>The one headed down that route was the yellow head that specializes in electricity and sounds.</p>
<p>“I am giving an order as the Commander.”</p>
<p>Cale gave his first order.</p>
<p>“Destroy Suyeong station once the yellow head passes through.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander-nim!</p>
<p>“At the same time…”</p>
<p>He was not done giving his order.</p>
<p>“Also destroy Yeonsan station.”Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Beeeeeep-</p>
<p>A different walkie-talkie in Cale’s inner pocket started to go off at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale took the walkie-talkie and heard a familiar voice.Commander-nim.</p>
<p>It was Choi Han who was hiding elsewhere.It is moving past Suyeong station.</p>
<p>Suyeong station was right after Gwangan station.</p>
<p>The yellow head was going through the tunnels extremely quickly.</p>
<p>It wanted to get to the Seomyeon station as quickly as possible and start killing people.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>He channeled the Sound of the Wind once more at the same time.</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>Including Lee Seung Won and Kim Kang Hoon… All three of them were surrounded by the wind.</p>
<p>Line 3 that connects Suyeong station and Yeonsan station.</p>
<p>While the first head was stuck in between the two stations…</p>
<p>‘We will kill the second head first.’</p>
<p>Cale kicked off the ground.</p>
<p>His body quickly started to move while following the traces of water left behind.</p>
<p>The second head. He was chasing after the blue head.It has passed Suyeong station.</p>
<p>Cale heard Choi Han’s voice and raised his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>“5. 4. 3. 2.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon gulped while following behind him.</p>
<p>“1.”</p>
<p>Cale calmly gave the order.</p>
<p>"Detonate.”</p>
<p>Detonate!</p>
<p>Detonate!</p>
<p>He heard the voices of the people in charge of Squad 1 and Squad 2.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>Boooooooom-!</p>
<p>Cale felt a strong rumbling coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>It was caused by the explosion down the tunnel without any traces of water, the tunnel that the yellow head traveled through.</p>
<p>“Is it here?”</p>
<p>Cale stopped in front of a subway tunnel.</p>
<p>Line 2, the train that would go straight from Gwangan to Seomyeon.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>He looked toward Kim Kang Hoon.</p>
<p>“Let’s maintain our stealth.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>It didn't matter if the blue head found them now, but Cale was hiding his presence in order to increase their chances of success.</p>
<p>Blue lights appeared once again in the path the blue head passed through.</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Alright then, shall we go step on its tail?”</p>
<p>They were now the predators instead of the prey running away.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon and Lee Seung Won's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>Cale was still surrounded by wind.</p>
<p>Crack. Crackle.</p>
<p>Rose gold colored thunderbolts started to appear around him.</p>
<p>The blue head…</p>
<p>The second head’s attribute was water and it had strong poisonous fangs.</p>
<p>A red current on top of Cale's hand was shining through the darkness. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 597: Look at the back of the person standing in the front 2</p>
<p>Detonate.</p>
<p>The moment they heard Kim Rok Soo’s voice through the walkie-talkie…</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum raised his voice.</p>
<p>“The attack has started!”</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>They heard the ground rumbling in numerous locations.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was on the ground above Daeyeon station, located between Gwangan station and Seomyeon station. The people here were guarding all exits 1 through 4 heading underground to Daeyeon station.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>“Screeeeeech!”</p>
<p>Monsters started to appear from within the thick fog.</p>
<p>The monsters were running wild as if they had gone crazy, no, as if they were struck with fear.</p>
<p>‘It is exactly as our Rok Soo hyung, no, our Commander-nim said it would be!’</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum recalled what Kim Rok Soo had said as he watched.</p>
<p>‘Other monsters will run wild once the unranked monster appears. It will be different than when the monsters attacked the original shelters, but monsters from all around Busan will start to rampage.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had said that in a stern tone.</p>
<p>‘We need to kill the unranked monster first without getting swept up by that rampage.’</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum’s heard someone's voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“I guess we can get started now?”</p>
<p>The person who spoke was Ki Hee Ran, the Chungbuk representative who was responsible for Squad 5.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum responded energetically and repeated what Kim Rok Soo had told them, word for word.</p>
<p>‘In order to not get swept up in that rampage… Please quickly and efficiently take care of the monsters above ground.”</p>
<p>“You just need to quickly and efficiently take care of the monsters!”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Ki Hee Ran then started to run toward the monsters that had appeared from within the fog.</p>
<p>She then started to shout.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>The Chungbuk ability users all cast their abilities as they moved away from the Daeyeon station entrance and rushed toward the monsters.</p>
<p>Ki Hee Ran’s eyes were glowing gold.</p>
<p>“One behind the building in the 3 o'clock direction! One 500 meters in the 7 o'clock direction next to the shopping mall building!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>The Chungbuk ability users quickly split up and headed toward the locations she had shouted.</p>
<p>Everything she saw would have been monsters.</p>
<p>“Fuck them up one by one!”</p>
<p>The fog did not hinder her sight at all.</p>
<p>This was the reason Cale had asked Ki Hee Ran to be the squad leader for the above-ground attack team along Line 2.</p>
<p>“Wow. She’s no joke.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was amazed by Ki Hee Ran's efficient and accurate orders before flinching.This is Squad 2.</p>
<p>It was from Squad 2 that had just detonated the bombs in Suyeong station.We have confirmed that the first head is blocked in the tunnel.</p>
<p>‘Mm!’</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum subconsciously clenched his fists.</p>
<p>The first step had succeeded.</p>
<p>Their plan was to barricade one of the two monsters between Yeonsan station and Suyeong station to start.</p>
<p>‘Now we just need to get rid of the second head during this time!’</p>
<p>He needed to wait for Kim Rok Soo to contact him in order to do that.</p>
<p>Did Cale read Bae Puh Rum's thoughts?Good job.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo gave a short praise before commenting on the next step.I'm currently by Namcheon station.</p>
<p>Flinch!</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum flinched once more.</p>
<p>‘Soon.’</p>
<p>Daeyeon station was one stop away from Namcheon station.</p>
<p>He slowly looked behind him… He looked toward Exit 1.</p>
<p>They had destroyed exits 2, 3, and 4 on purpose.</p>
<p>Exit 1 was the only exit that was clear to go through.</p>
<p>And right here at Daeyeon station… The members of Squad 3 were waiting at the stairs heading underground through Exit 1.Will step on the second head’s tail soon.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo's stoic voice continued.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum looked at each of the people stationed at the stairs.</p>
<p>“I guess it's time to go.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah got up after making eye contact with him, and behind her…</p>
<p>“I truly believed it would succeed.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik had his hands clenched together as he stopped leaning on a pillar.</p>
<p>“…Boss.”</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min quickly got up after seeing Park Jin Tae get up while Park Jin Tae was quietly looking somewhere with his face that was full of injuries.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum and the others were all looking in the same direction as well.</p>
<p>The dark Exit 1…</p>
<p>One of the people who was standing at the boundary between the dark staircase and the outside picked up his sword.Squad 3, go.</p>
<p>That person started to speak after hearing Kim Rok Soo's voice.</p>
<p>“Let’s go down.”</p>
<p>That person was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Please have a safe trip!”</p>
<p>“Leader-nim, please return soon!”</p>
<p>"We’ll be waiting for you right here!”</p>
<p>Around Exit 1… No, the rescue team members stationed by all exits at Daeyeon station raised their voices toward the people heading underground.</p>
<p>There were a couple hundred of them.</p>
<p>These were Lee Soo Hyuk’s original rescue team members as well as some battle-type ability users from the Seomyeon shelter.</p>
<p>Their goal today was not to rescue people but battle monsters.</p>
<p>There was also another group of people.</p>
<p>It was the group of ability users led by Jo Min Yeh, the Jeonnam representative.</p>
<p>“…I hope this goes well.”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh could not help but be concerned as she looked at the people heading underground.</p>
<p>The violent rampage of the monsters, the fog covering all of Busan…</p>
<p>And this unknown monster…</p>
<p>She couldn't help but be concerned.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh stood in front of Exit 1 and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Everybody stay alert!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum, the last of the people heading underground, heard Jo Min Yeh's voice as he quickly headed down.</p>
<p>He then held the walkie-talkie out as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Umm, leader-nim?”</p>
<p>He called Lee Soo Hyuk leader as the rescue team does.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze slowly headed toward Bae Puh Rum before looking down at his hand.</p>
<p>“You hold onto it.”</p>
<p>He said that before quickly heading down.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk and quietly sighed.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had not even spoken sharply to him… But the atmosphere around Lee Soo Hyuk was no joke.</p>
<p>‘It’s not just that person.’</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was serious as well.</p>
<p>The two of them were standing shoulder to shoulder in the front of their group.</p>
<p>“Hey, come to the back.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Okay.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum quickly headed back after hearing Kim Min Ah's voice and put the walkie-talkie up to his lips.</p>
<p>“This is Squad 3. We are currently heading underground. We will get there soon.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo did not respond.</p>
<p>That meant that the three people on Kim Rok Soo's side had found the second head’s tail and were stealthily following behind it.</p>
<p>Everybody here realized that fact and came to a single conclusion.</p>
<p>‘The monster will be here soon!’</p>
<p>They would finally meet the monster they had been preparing to defeat.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze sunk a bit as they continued to head underground.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Are you not nervous?”</p>
<p>He heard Park Jin Tae's voice behind him.</p>
<p>“I'm not sure. Nervous……”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk gave a short response.</p>
<p>“I really don't know.”</p>
<p>He really didn't know.</p>
<p>He didn't know whether he was nervous or excited.</p>
<p>Or-</p>
<p>‘Maybe I'm looking forward to something.’</p>
<p>Fighting against a monster did not cause excitement or anticipation.</p>
<p>But for some odd reason, Lee Soo Hyuk had multiple emotions going through his mind today.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk slightly loosened the grip on his scabbard.</p>
<p>‘Maybe I am like this because of how things are.’</p>
<p>He had been feeling tired.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no end to these battles and people who needed saving.</p>
<p>He had seen too many of his friends fall down and leave this world.</p>
<p>After experiencing all those things over and over again for close to a year, Lee Soo Hyuk had become filled with this unknown fatigue.</p>
<p>But Lee Soo Hyuk's mindset had slowly changed after meeting Kim Rok Soo again.</p>
<p>The weight of his burdens and responsibility had moved to someone else.</p>
<p>‘Kim Rok Soo.’</p>
<p>Although his identity had not changed, that punk had changed too much while they had been away from each other.</p>
<p>“I've been properly stimulated.”</p>
<p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p>
<p>“I'm going to light the torches!”</p>
<p>The torches started to light up one by one after Bae Puh Rum shouted.</p>
<p>The torches they had prepared in advance were now lit.</p>
<p>They could see inside Daeyeon station now.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stood in front of the platform.</p>
<p>He then looked to the right.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum heard a noise from the walkie-talkie in his hand.Passed Kyunsung Univ. &amp; Pukyong Nat'l Univ. station.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stepped off the platform.</p>
<p>Step step.</p>
<p>He then started to walk.</p>
<p>He was headed in the direction of Kyunsung Univ. &amp; Pukyong Nat'l Univ. station.</p>
<p>Not quickly…</p>
<p>But not too slowly…</p>
<p>He was just walking.</p>
<p>He could feel it under his feet.</p>
<p>Baaaaang-</p>
<p>In the distance…</p>
<p>In the darkness away from the platform lit by torches…</p>
<p>He could hear something destroying things and getting closer.</p>
<p>‘It’s coming. The second head is coming.’</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk tapped the hilt of his sword with his thumb.</p>
<p>The blue blade became visible every time he tapped it.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.Go.</p>
<p>The moment he heard Kim Rok Soo's voice in the walkie-talkie behind him…</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk kicked off the tracks and darted forward.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae and Kim Min Ah were right behind him.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk didn't even look back at the two of them.</p>
<p>He only looked forward.</p>
<p>Even though it was pitch black and he couldn't see anything…</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh- bang! Bang!</p>
<p>He could feel the monster getting closer and closer as the sounds of destruction became louder.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could feel his heart beating wildly.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>“…I guess I am in the front as I wanted.”</p>
<p>He had been placed in the vanguard.</p>
<p>‘The person who would run into the monster’s face first…’</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>‘…Is me, Lee Soo Hyuk.’</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The blade that had been hidden inside the scabbard revealed itself.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk saw the bright eyes of the blue monster that glowed in the darkness.</p>
<p>He finally met it.</p>
<p>He met his prey.</p>
<p>He met someone once again as well.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. Didn’t I get here right on time?”</p>
<p>He couldn't see behind the large blue monster.</p>
<p>However, he was certain that the punk who would soon step on this monster’s tail was there.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>In the darkness behind the blue monster…</p>
<p>Crack, crackle!</p>
<p>There were red currents shooting up.</p>
<p>He didn't need a response from Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“You're here.”</p>
<p>That was the response.</p>
<p>He heard a voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Release!”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon released his stealth ability as soon as Cale shouted.</p>
<p>The blue head flinched.</p>
<p>It noticed the enemies behind it once the stealth was broken.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon quickly retreated with Lee Seung Won on his back. He heard Lee Seung Won's voice as they moved.</p>
<p>“This is the start of the recording.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon Rum got chills all over his body.</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack!</p>
<p>The red current that was roaring along with the wind…</p>
<p>The current that was traveling through Cale’s body and overflowing made the blue head stop moving.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack!</p>
<p>The subway tunnel cracked as the blue head tried to turn around to face them.</p>
<p>Was it because this eel had twisted its body?</p>
<p>Cale and the others could see a person with his sword drawn behind the blue head.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon retreated even farther as he heard Lee Seung Won's voice.</p>
<p>"Commander Kim Kang Hoon and Rescue team leader Lee Soo Hyuk.”</p>
<p>The rose gold current shot forward with the wind.</p>
<p>“The first battle of this war has started.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon saw Cale’s mouth start to open at that moment.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk!”</p>
<p>Cale could see Lee Soo Hyuk smiling after hearing him calling his name.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to speak.</p>
<p>“Are you just saying my name like that because you became the commander?”</p>
<p>He said that to himself before looking toward Cale and saying something else.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>He had been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>The moment he could fight against the enemies with his team leader once again.</p>
<p>He had gone through numerous simulations in his head to not only survive but to achieve a perfect victory.</p>
<p>He would see the end of that simulation now.</p>
<p>He gave Lee Soo Hyuk an order.</p>
<p>“Cut the poisonous fangs off.”</p>
<p>The snake-like blue eyes of the monster looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>He looked toward the monster and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I will hold this bastard down.”</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The person surrounded by rose gold thunderbolts crashed into the blue monster that looked similar to an imugi of legends.</p>
<p>On the other side of that rose gold thunderbolt was a person with the ability of the slashing nature of a sword charging in as well. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 598: Look at the back of the person standing in the front 3</p>
<p>Inside the dark subway tunnel…</p>
<p>The rose gold light that was as red as blood flowed out in all directions.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The loud noise that sounded as if the entire tunnel would crumble shook the surrounding area.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon subconsciously took a few steps back.</p>
<p>His eyes were in pain from the sudden bright light.</p>
<p>He could not hide his shock.</p>
<p>“…Such strength-!”</p>
<p>‘He had such strength?’</p>
<p>He had heard a lot of people talk about Kim Rok Soo’s strength, but it was completely different seeing it in person.</p>
<p>‘He has foresight and a thunderbolt like this-!’</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon heard Lee Seung Won, who was on his back, start to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“That’s not all.”</p>
<p>"What?”</p>
<p>“There’s more.”</p>
<p>“…Ho.”</p>
<p>He could only gasp in shock as he stepped farther back.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>He gasped once more.</p>
<p>As the rose gold light disappeared…</p>
<p>“…I guess it is an unranked monster even when it is split into two!”</p>
<p>The blue headed monster that had curled up its body could be seen.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum shouted as well.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any injuries!”</p>
<p>He recalled what Cale had said.</p>
<p>‘This Electric Eel has scales. They’re so strong that most attacks won't even leave a scratch.’</p>
<p>He had also said something else.</p>
<p>‘That is why we need rescue team leader Lee Soo Hyuk.’</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum looked toward the spot where the rose gold light had disappeared.</p>
<p>In the short opening created when the blue head that was curled up slowly raised its head…</p>
<p>He could see Lee Soo Hyuk running toward that opening.</p>
<p>‘The blue head will curl up and protect itself with its scales when I attack.’</p>
<p>That was their chance.</p>
<p>‘Leader Lee Soo Hyuk will definitely create an opening.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo's voice echoed on his mind.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“How disappointing.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and the blue monster’s eyes met.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p>
<p>“I was planning on chopping off your poisonous fangs first, but I guess I'll just have to put that off until later.”</p>
<p>His sword then slashed sideways.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah started to speak while standing next to Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>“There’s no noise.”</p>
<p>The sword was swung.</p>
<p>However, there was no noise at all.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik started to frown.</p>
<p>“…Is he cutting the wind as well?”</p>
<p>There wasn't a black aura like Choi Han.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like Kim Min Ah’s attack that caused a gust of wind or an earthquake due to its strength.</p>
<p>A fancy rose gold light or a shield did not appear as with Cale.</p>
<p>All he did was silently swing his sword sideways.</p>
<p>But Cale could see the drops of sweat gathering on Lee Soo Hyuk’s forehead.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk gave everything he had to this silent action.</p>
<p>His sword, his attribute, activated its powers stronger than ever before in response to Lee Soo Hyuk giving it his all.</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>These scales that Cale wouldn't have been able to damage even if he used any or all of his current half-powered ancient powers together…</p>
<p>A portion of those scales was slashed.</p>
<p>Slaaaaaash!</p>
<p>The tender skin underneath the damaged scales was cut open and blue blood shot out.</p>
<p>Compared to this large and long body…</p>
<p>This small injury was extremely small.</p>
<p>It was only about half the size of an adult woman’s palm.</p>
<p>The reason that people were able to survive the attack of the first unranked monster in the past…</p>
<p>It had a lot to do with Lee Soo Hyuk's power.</p>
<p>“…Huff.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stumbled and knelt down after creating that opening.</p>
<p>“You worked hard, sir.”</p>
<p>“…You’re speaking respectfully again?”</p>
<p>Cale supported Lee Soo Hyuk from behind.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's back was completely drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeeeeech!”</p>
<p>The blue monster that had never expected a sword to cause it an injury screamed and raised its body.</p>
<p>Blood dripped down from the cut, but the monster was so angry that it did not care.</p>
<p>They could feel the monster preparing to release its powers in anger.</p>
<p>“…It truly is no joke as you mentioned. I could only cause that small injury while using this much of my strength.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk scoffed before using his sword as support to stand up.</p>
<p>He had won most fights in the end until now.</p>
<p>But he felt something while looking at this unranked monster.</p>
<p>‘I wouldn't have been able to defeat this monster if I wasn’t prepared.’</p>
<p>And if he had tried to carry the weight of everything on his own…</p>
<p>Not only would he have had to use all of his strength, but he would also have had to put his life on the line.</p>
<p>‘But not now.’</p>
<p>He had created an opening.</p>
<p>‘Now then, next!’</p>
<p>It was someone else’s turn now.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt Cale pushing him back down and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Park Jin Tae!”</p>
<p>The opening.</p>
<p>The opening that was half the size of a cheek.</p>
<p>It looked small, but it was quite large for a certain someone.</p>
<p>Especially since that person was Park Jin Tae who had a gun in his hand.</p>
<p>“Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae let out a deep breath.</p>
<p>The barrel of his gun had already been pointed at the opening from the moment Lee Soo Hyuk had slashed it open.</p>
<p>“Roooooar!”</p>
<p>The moment the blue head noticed Park Jin Tae…</p>
<p>“You're too late.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had already pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>Two bullets shot out in succession.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue head tried to twist its body to dodge the things it would have normally scoffed at that were flying toward it.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>This subway tunnel only left a bit of open space for a monster of its size.</p>
<p>Choosing to split into two and make itself weaker for stealthy movement…</p>
<p>Choosing to go through this narrow tunnel…</p>
<p>When those things became an obstacle for the monster…</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>One bullet hit the wall of the subway tunnel and exploded.</p>
<p>As for the remaining bullet…</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>It pierced into the monster’s injury and exploded.</p>
<p>The exposed skin without any protection was no longer gushing out blue blood. Once the explosion happened, the injury opened farther and it started bleeding black.</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeech! Roooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The monster twisted its body in pain.</p>
<p>But even that was not easy in this narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>There were still many hunters left.</p>
<p>“I’m going.”</p>
<p>A person reported to Cale before darting forward toward the blue head.</p>
<p>It was Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>Her eyes were focused on the flailing blue monster’s body.</p>
<p>‘Your accuracy still needs work.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had said that to Kim Min Ah after their few days of training had come to an end.</p>
<p>‘But I won't tell you the direction this time. You need to aim on your own.’</p>
<p>‘Will that be okay?’</p>
<p>‘Of course.’</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah could feel the wind that was surrounding her body as she moved forward.</p>
<p>This wind belonged to Kim Rok Soo, who was paler now after using the rose gold thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had added the wind for her, but it was up to Kim Min Ah to decide how the wind would move.</p>
<p>‘Your strength is the greatest.’</p>
<p>She swung a spear.</p>
<p>‘You should be able to pierce through it even without perfect aim as long as even a bit of it touches that injury.’</p>
<p>‘You don’t need me to hit it perfectly?’</p>
<p>‘Well, you’ve worked hard the last few days. It should work since you trained hard.’</p>
<p>She had trained hard.</p>
<p>She had trained a lot as well.</p>
<p>She couldn’t recall how much sweat she had shed in the training ground with Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>She clenched her hand.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The spear cracked a little under the pressure of her strength.</p>
<p>She was not using the weapon she usually summoned.</p>
<p>That was why it now had a crack.</p>
<p>The blue head twisted its body in order to dodge the spear.</p>
<p>Her spear did not manage to reach the opening on the blue-headed monster’s wound.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeeeeech!”</p>
<p>“Ugh! You should know that I'm here too! I can't let our Min Ah's attack end up missing.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was surrounded by the wind as he slammed into the blue head.</p>
<p>That made the monster return to its original position.</p>
<p>They had planned for Bae Puh Rum to do this.</p>
<p>The monster's injury ended up being located exactly where Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum had planned.</p>
<p>“Bae Puh Rum, good job.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Thanks to him, her spear ended up landing on target.</p>
<p>Craaaaaack!</p>
<p>She heard it crack.</p>
<p>“Hooo.”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon gasped.</p>
<p>“I knew it! I knew they could do it!”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won was cheering.</p>
<p>The injury caused by Lee Soo Hyuk and expanded by Park Jin Tae…</p>
<p>There was a steel spear that was somewhat crushed from Kim Min Ah’s Herculean Strength stabbed into that spot.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah had stabbed the spear into the monster’s body, all the way down to its bones.</p>
<p>“Huuuuuu, huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Although it was only half of the monster, it still took a lot of strength to stab an unranked monster with enough force to pierce a weapon into its bone.</p>
<p>“…Haaa.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah continued to breathe heavily.</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon's eyes opened wide at that moment and he started to shout.</p>
<p>“Huh? Huh? Dodge!”</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The monster glared at Kim Min Ah and charged toward her.</p>
<p>“Roooooar!”</p>
<p>There were two large fangs visible in its open mouth.</p>
<p>Those fangs were dripping black liquids and looked ready to pierce right through her.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>The moment Kim Kang Hoon heard Lee Seung Won's confident voice…</p>
<p>“Did I do well?”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum quickly flew over, hugged her, and retreated.</p>
<p>This area might be narrow for the monster, but it was wide for humans, allowing him to quickly move around.</p>
<p>“Yes. You did well.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah patted Bae Puh Rum’s head and then looked toward Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>"Good job."</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah started to smile once she saw Cale's mouth form what seemed to be those words.</p>
<p>Cale smiled as well.</p>
<p>The steel spear stabbed into the blue head’s body…</p>
<p>And the fact that the blue head’s ability was water…</p>
<p>"Why aren’t you using your ability?”</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue head glared at Cale.</p>
<p>It realized that the leader and the person who would land the final attack was Cale.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to mumble while looking at the blue monster that was glaring at Cale.</p>
<p>“Steel and water. It should work properly this time.”</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack.</p>
<p>“Kim Rok Soo’s thunderbolt should work.”</p>
<p>Cale’s entire body was surrounded by rose gold thunderbolts once again.</p>
<p>A person next to Cale clasped his hands together.</p>
<p>“I have faith.”</p>
<p>It was Joo Ho-Shik.</p>
<p>“I have faith that the Commander-nim’s thunderbolt will follow the spear into that monster's body and make that bastard perish!”</p>
<p>His gaze and his faith headed toward Cale.</p>
<p>“I have faith!”</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>The rose gold light became even stronger.</p>
<p>Cale felt the power of the Fire of Destruction with his entire body as he started to think.</p>
<p>‘…I will give it my best.’</p>
<p>Cale decided to use as much strength as he could possibly use in the present situation.</p>
<p>He needed to do that this time.</p>
<p>‘The yellow head……!’</p>
<p>There was one more bastard to take down.</p>
<p>Choi Han and the others should be holding that bastard back right now.</p>
<p>This group needed to quickly meet up with them over there.</p>
<p>Cale noticed the blue head look somewhere at that moment.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Above!”</p>
<p>The blue head had already changed directions by the time he had shouted.</p>
<p>The blue head headed for the ceiling of the subway tunnel.</p>
<p>The others started to run toward the blue head at the same time.</p>
<p>"We were expecting that!”</p>
<p>“Bae Puh Rum, shut up and attack!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah recalled what Cale had said.</p>
<p>‘If it keeps being attacked and is placed in a dangerous situation, the monster will try to get out of the tunnel and head above ground.’</p>
<p>The two of them had wondered if that would be bad.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>‘But it doesn't matter.’</p>
<p>Cale picked up the walkie-talkie and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Please get it ready.”Yes, sir. I got it.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh would be up there even if the blue head managed to make it out.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh, the spider web fisherwoman.</p>
<p>The spider web she casts was a thicker web than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Even if the blue head managed to make a hole in the ceiling, Jo Min Yeh's spider web would be waiting for it.</p>
<p>That was why Cale had said the following to the others.</p>
<p>‘Once the blue head is flustered because of the spider web…</p>
<p>I will kill it.’</p>
<p>Crackle.</p>
<p>Cale headed toward the blue monster that was pushing its head into the ceiling.</p>
<p>‘It’s possible.’</p>
<p>It was possible to hunt them one by one without having anybody die.</p>
<p>Cale had that thought and channeled even more of his Fire of Destruction into his hands.</p>
<p>“I have faith!”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik shouted and the others prepared to attack to support Cale.</p>
<p>“I'll slash off one of the poisonous fangs for now.”</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk next to him.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Cale started to laugh after hearing that even though he was extremely tense.</p>
<p>“If you have time to say that- mm?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Cale saw something.</p>
<p>“Our dear Commander Rok Soo. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk found Cale's reaction odd and looked at him before turning toward where Cale was looking.</p>
<p>He then saw it.</p>
<p>"A horn?”</p>
<p>There was a horn coming out of the blue head’s forehead.</p>
<p>He then had a thought.</p>
<p>‘Rok Soo never mentioned a horn?’</p>
<p>He had not heard about a horn at all.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk quickly started to turn toward Cale after realizing that.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was the only one who could hear Cale’s quiet mumbling.</p>
<p>“…It’s different than the record.”</p>
<p>‘Record?’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze was focused on Cale.</p>
<p>However, Cale had no time to pay any attention to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>It was because something else he had not expected had happened as well.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>There was a sharp noise coming through the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>‘An emergency signal!’</p>
<p>This was the noise for when there was an urgent situation.</p>
<p>Cale turned on the walkie-talkie and heard Choi Han's voice.Rok Soo hyung! It has one more ability!</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to frown in shock.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cale’s gaze started to sink.</p>
<p>‘I knew it-’</p>
<p>Why had Cale continued to be tense while preparing to fight this unranked monster when his record should have had all the information?</p>
<p>Why had Cale gathered as many people as possible even though his record told him all of the monster's weaknesses?</p>
<p>It was because of a simple reason.</p>
<p>‘The record’s blind spot.’</p>
<p>There were times his record did not have all the facts.</p>
<p>‘Just like what happened right now.’</p>
<p>The appearance of the first unranked monster.</p>
<p>All of the records he had about this incident were based on the memories of the survivors because it was before the new system had been created.</p>
<p>In that case…</p>
<p>Couldn't their memories have been wrong?</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p>‘It's possible that they did not see all of the monster's abilities.’</p>
<p>Wasn’t it possible the monster had more abilities than they had seen?</p>
<p>The battle against the first unranked monster had been when most people had not properly developed their abilities to their fullest extent.</p>
<p>Their judgments and experience were lacking compared to the future as well.</p>
<p>There could be missing variables in his record.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The now horned blue head slammed its horn into the ceiling.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack. Craaaaaaack.</p>
<p>The ceiling slowly started to crack.</p>
<p>But it did not matter. Jo Min Yeh's spider web and people to help her should be waiting above.</p>
<p>‘But the situation had changed.’</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Choi Han. What is the yellow head’s other ability?”Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>He could hear loud noises and things breaking coming from the other side of the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>Things were urgent on that side as well.</p>
<p>No, it should be even harder than this side.</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>“Choi Han!”</p>
<p>He heard Choi Han urgently responding after he shouted Choi Han’s name once more with anxiety.Earth! Or maybe dirt!</p>
<p>‘Earth? Dirt?’The yellow head has currently changed directions and is digging through the ground!</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with Lee Soo Hyuk at that moment.</p>
<p>Both of them realized it at the same time.</p>
<p>‘It’s coming.’</p>
<p>‘It’s heading over.’</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze slowly headed back toward the blue head.The yellow head is moving south! It is heading toward Daeyeon station!</p>
<p>The yellow head was heading over here toward the blue head. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 599: Look at the back of the person standing in the front 4</p>
<p>The other monster was headed to Daeyeon station.</p>
<p>It was coming to meet up with its other half.</p>
<p>After having that thought, Lee Soo Hyuk grabbed Cale’s wrist and pulled the walkie-talkie in Cale’s hand close to him.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>His voice sounded urgent.</p>
<p>“Prevent the yellow head from coming here as best as you can!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk knew because he had faced off against the blue head.</p>
<p>'We… Won’t be able to do it if the yellow head gets here!’</p>
<p>After going up against the blue head, he could tell how unbelievably strong this monster would be if the blue head and yellow head came together.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could hear Choi Han’s urgent voice.We are trying to prevent it as best as possible, but we are unable to attack from the front nor the sides as it is digging a hole to travel underground!</p>
<p>And most importantly…It is moving too quickly that it is difficult to launch attacks from the rear as well!</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to frown. He couldn’t understand something.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? There should be some ability users with speed-related abilities there. I thought we split the people with speed-related abilities equally between each squad.”Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>They could hear things breaking through the walkie-talkie.That-</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt frustrated after hearing Choi Han hesitate.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>A cold and calm voice reached Lee Soo Hyuk’s ears.</p>
<p>“I'm sure the foundation is crumbling.”</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>But Cale brushed Lee Soo Hyuk’s hand away and brought the walkie-talkie closer to him again.</p>
<p>“Choi Han, properly report about the situation.”…My apologies.</p>
<p>Choi Han then continued to speak in a much calmer voice.The foundation has started to crumble because the yellow head is digging a hole to move, which is why we had to evacuate the people positioned at the stations.</p>
<p>“The foundation will probably crumble in an instant. You must have used the speed-type ability users to move all of our allies to safe areas.”Yes, sir.</p>
<p>‘Ah.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>He had not even considered that the foundation might be crumbling.</p>
<p>But he quickly realized that the chances of that happening were very high.</p>
<p>‘Even if we started some work to repair it, this is a destroyed city. It would be weird if the foundation didn't crumble.’</p>
<p>The foundation could not be held up with only a few days worth of repairs.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked toward Cale with an odd expression.</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak in a calm voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Was that your decision?”It was a joint decision by Mr. Man Soo, Grandma Kim, Miss Lee Jin Joo, and I.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence through the walkie-talkies.</p>
<p>Eventually, Choi Han started to speak again.</p>
<p>-… I'm sor-</p>
<p>"Good job.”</p>
<p>Choi Han shut up after hearing Cale’s response.</p>
<p>“If we could only attack from the rear anyway, it’s better than pushing people to the point where some of them get hurt.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk agreed with Cale and nodded his head.</p>
<p>Each and every person was precious right now.</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak to Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see Kim Rok Soo’s gaze turn sharp.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes were looking at the ceiling as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm sure you’re chasing it, aren’t you?”That’s right. Of course I am chasing after it. I left the rest to Mr. Jang Man Soo, Grandma Kim, and Miss Lee Jin Joo.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head as if this was the obvious response.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt odd looking at Cale and hearing that it was obvious for Choi Han to chase that strong monster on his own.</p>
<p>It felt as if he was seeing the bond between two people who had been through many battles together.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>He started to think about the people Choi Han had left behind to take care of things.</p>
<p>Mr. Jang Man Soo's shield should be able to delay the crumbling foundation.</p>
<p>Grandma Kim would heal the wounded while Lee Jin Joo’s amplification would allow them to move people without any confusion or chaos.</p>
<p>Cale started to look at something else.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The horn on the blue head started to expand the crack in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>The ceiling would break soon.</p>
<p>He started to speak to Choi Han again.</p>
<p>“Don’t get hurt.”No need to say something so obvious, Rok Soo hyung.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack!</p>
<p>The blue head finally cracked through the ceiling and pushed its horn toward the surface.</p>
<p>"Choi Han, see you soon.”</p>
<p>Cale could see the light as soon as he said that.</p>
<p>Although the sky was covered in fog, the outside was still brighter than the underground.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The blue head roared as it pushed its body toward that light.</p>
<p>It felt as if the blue head was an imugi leaving a dark cave and ascending to the heavens.</p>
<p>‘Ascending?’</p>
<p>Cale contacted the walkie-talkie to someone else as soon as he had that thought and started to shout.</p>
<p>“Spider web!”</p>
<p>The blue head seemed to be responding to him as it started to head toward the surface even faster, looking like a blue imugi in the process.</p>
<p>The horn and head were already above ground and the body was quickly coming up as well.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>However, the blue head could not stop screeching even though it was above ground.</p>
<p>“Hold onto the spider web!”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh shouted and her long white hair that came down to her hips shot out in all directions.</p>
<p>A large white spider web instantly appeared.</p>
<p>“Grab onto it as the squad leader-nim mentioned! Hold on tight!”</p>
<p>“Push your legs into the ground and hold on! We can’t be dragged by the monster!”</p>
<p>The white spider web fell on the blue monster.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue monster started to flail.</p>
<p>“Pull!”</p>
<p>“Raise it up! We need to capture it!”</p>
<p>All ability users nearby pulled the spider web from their respective locations with both hands held tightly onto the web.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>They could hear the monster’s angry shouts.</p>
<p>Cale heard Jo Min Yeh's voice through the walkie-talkie at that moment.We won’t be able to last long!</p>
<p>Cale was already moving up.</p>
<p>“I have faith!”</p>
<p>He could hear Joo Ho-Shik's shout.</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Although the situation had changed with an unexpected variable…</p>
<p>"We still have to do what we need to do.”</p>
<p>Of course, Cale probably had to do more than he had expected to do.</p>
<p>The people could see something shoot up from underground after the blue monster.</p>
<p>It was a person covered in rose gold thunderbolts.</p>
<p>“…Commander.”</p>
<p>Foresight.</p>
<p>They had only heard about that ability, but they had never seen his attacking ability before.</p>
<p>They had only heard rumors about how he was strong.</p>
<p>As their young commander shot up into the air…</p>
<p>“Screeeech!”</p>
<p>The blue monster made a noise that was different than before as it pulled its body above ground. It then tried to get out of the spider web.</p>
<p>Riiiiiip-</p>
<p>The spider web started to rip because of the blue head’s horn.</p>
<p>"Squad Leader-nim!”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh raised her hand toward the people shouting at her.</p>
<p>Her commander had given an order to the walkie-talkie in her other hand.Retreat.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh shouted with one hand still in the air.</p>
<p>“Retreat!”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The spider web covering the blue head quickly disappeared. That white spider web came back to the tips of Jo Min Yeh’s hair and the others quickly retreated as well.</p>
<p>They then saw it.</p>
<p>"Screeeeeeeeeech!”</p>
<p>They saw that there was a steel spear stabbed into the body of the monster that had just come above ground.</p>
<p>They could also see some grey clouds that were different from the fog start to form above the blue monster.</p>
<p>In addition, they could see their commander being surrounded by wind as he floated high up in the air above the monster and pointed down at it.</p>
<p>Finally, they could see a rose gold thunderbolt that seemed to take away all noise and light from the area shoot down toward the monster, specifically, toward the steel spear.</p>
<p>They saw all these things.</p>
<p>They had seen these things in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>After a few more seconds…</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>A loud explosion covered the ground.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Such strength-!”</p>
<p>“…Eek, move back, move farther back!”</p>
<p>The people escaping the thunderbolt retreated while being unable to take their eyes off this fearsome yet beautiful rose gold light.</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeeeeech!”</p>
<p>The rose gold thunderbolt flowed down the steel spear and into the blue monster’s body.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't even a scratch on the beautiful blue scales.</p>
<p>“Grrr, grrrrrrrrr!”</p>
<p>The thunderbolt that had crawled into the injury like a snake and attacked the blue monster’s weak insides was destroying it from inside.</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction. It was living up to its name.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>As someone gasped…</p>
<p>The blue monster’s body slowly tilted to the side.</p>
<p>Boom-</p>
<p>It fell on the ground with a loud noise.</p>
<p>It sounded as if a large tree had fallen.</p>
<p>Everybody was at a loss for words for a moment.</p>
<p>One ability user pointed to the sky at that moment.</p>
<p>“Huh?! The Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>Cale's body curled forward as he floated in the air.</p>
<p>The grey cloud was already gone and the wind surrounding Cale was slowly disappearing as well.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>A handful of dark red blood burst out of Cale’s mouth.</p>
<p>Cale quickly covered his mouth with his hand, but everybody had clearly seen the blood.</p>
<p>Cale kept his mouth covered with his hand as he quietly mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>“…Did I use too much power?”</p>
<p>He had used more strength than he had planned because he had felt rushed.</p>
<p>“I can't faint right now.”</p>
<p>Cale mumbled as he felt his body slowly fall to the ground.</p>
<p>He had called back the Sound of the Wind on purpose.</p>
<p>However, the people watching him were thinking that their commander had used too much strength such that he was unable to use his wind power any longer and was coughing up blood as he fell unconscious.</p>
<p>They couldn't help but flinch because a person, who already looked weak to start, was falling down looking like a weak autumn leaf.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Bae Puh Rum!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk called out Bae Puh Rum's name.</p>
<p>“Y, yes?”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum, who had followed Cale into the air and had blankly watched Cale use his powers, quickly turned toward the extremely cold voice calling his name.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and support him!”</p>
<p>“Ah, of course!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum snapped out of it after hearing Lee Soo Hyuk’s cold yet urgent voice.</p>
<p>He then quickly flew up.</p>
<p>It was to save the falling Cale.</p>
<p>However, Bae Puh Rum had a thought on his mind as he flew over.</p>
<p>‘That was completely different.’</p>
<p>This one was completely different than the thunderbolt that Kim Rok Soo had used in the original shelter.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt he had used just now was so destructive that it felt as if the numerous thunderbolts he had used during the original shelter battle had all gathered into one.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum finally realized the difference between a battle where they only had to last for 24 hours and a battle that they needed to finish as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>At the same time…</p>
<p>‘He’s an amazing person.’</p>
<p>His feelings for Kim Rok Soo had moved past respect and towards admiration.</p>
<p>That was why he raised his speed as he needed to rescue the falling Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum flinched.</p>
<p>There was something that was quicker than him.</p>
<p>"Tsk. Are you coughing up blood again?”</p>
<p>Something black had burst out from in between the fog-covered buildings.</p>
<p>"This is why I need to keep an eye on you.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger majestically caught Cale and put him on its back as its black mane fluttered.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It then landed in a similarly majestic fashion.</p>
<p>As everybody flinched at this…</p>
<p>Cale lifted his body up as he sat on Alberu’s back.</p>
<p>He then started to shout while his mouth was covered in dark red blood.</p>
<p>"What are you all doing?”</p>
<p>Everybody flinched at Cale’s completely emotionless and cold voice.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk made eye contact with Cale at that moment and Cale started to speak again.</p>
<p>“Are you all blanking out with the enemy in front of you?!”</p>
<p>‘Ah.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk quickly turned his gaze toward the monster.</p>
<p>‘It’s still alive!’</p>
<p>It was still alive.</p>
<p>They had forgotten about checking the status of the enemy because they had been focused on Kim Rok Soo’s unbelievable strength and the enemy that had flailed before it fell.</p>
<p>“Chh…chhhhhhhhhhhh-”</p>
<p>The eyes of the heavily breathing blue monster were looking for an opening to escape.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>‘Did I really have such a stupid reaction?! How many friends left this world before me while acting the same way?!’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to frown and immediately pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>He then started to run toward the monster.</p>
<p>He was not the only one.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum followed behind him to support him.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae’s gun was pointed at the blue monster’s eyes as well.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom!</p>
<p>The ground started to shake.</p>
<p>They could feel vibrations coming from underground.</p>
<p>It was coming from the north.</p>
<p>It was coming from something underground headed toward them from the north.</p>
<p>It was that bastard.</p>
<p>It was the yellow headed monster.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>Cale and Lee Soo Hyuk both started to swear.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk, hurry! Cut its neck off!”</p>
<p>Cale said that before starting to speak to Alberu.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, to the north!”</p>
<p>“…Even I can tell. If it is this aura…”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger's body headed north to where Cale was pointing.</p>
<p>Everybody looked toward that direction as well.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Someone subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>“The ground, the ground is moving up and down?”</p>
<p>The ground was indeed moving up and down.</p>
<p>It was as if something was headed toward them from beneath their feet.</p>
<p>It was as if that something was trying to shoot up into the air from underground.</p>
<p>Cale looked at this and started to shout.</p>
<p>“Everybody move behind me! And Lee Soo Hyuk!”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“I know!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's back became covered in cold sweat again and his full strength was gathered at the tip of his sword.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk then swung his sword.</p>
<p>“Chh… Chhhchhh…. chhh!”</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>The moment Lee Soo Hyuk's sword slashed through the airway of the heavily breathing blue head….</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The yellow headed monster shot up from underground right in front of Cale’s eyes. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 600: Look at the back of the person standing in the front 5</p>
<p>The yellow eyes were looking directly at Cale.</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>Cale quietly mumbled to himself as he stopped his assessment of the yellow head. But it was not the same for the others.</p>
<p>“…This quickly?!”</p>
<p>“Was the other one supposed to come?! I didn't know! Did the plans go wrong?”</p>
<p>“Wow, shit. This bastard seems even stronger-”</p>
<p>People were busy responding based on the information they had after seeing the yellow head appear.</p>
<p>But that did not last long either.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p>Blue blood shot into the air as if it was river water flowing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“Grrr, grr!”</p>
<p>The grounded blue head’s body was flailing wildly.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>All people saw was Lee Soo Hyuk, who was covered in blue blood, bursting up.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's eyes were not focused on the people looking at him but somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The yellow head's eyes started to glow.</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack!</p>
<p>Golden currents rose out to cover the yellow monster’s body.</p>
<p>The yellow eyes and Lee Soo Hyuk's black eyes…</p>
<p>The two sets of eyes were directly looking at each other.</p>
<p>"Commander.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk called out to Cale as he slowly started to walk.</p>
<p>He was walking toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>“I'll slash again if you just take care of that electricity.”</p>
<p>He had said that he wanted to be in the front.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was someone who kept his word.</p>
<p>‘Based on what Kim Rok Soo mentioned, only I am able to slash through those scales right now.’</p>
<p>Crack, crackle!</p>
<p>The yellow head that was now covered in beautiful golden light slowly opened its mouth.</p>
<p>“Grrrr, grrrrr-”</p>
<p>The monster’s eyes were full of anger as it growled like an animal.</p>
<p>“Even if you do that.”</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk took his sword out of the scabbard again.</p>
<p>“You’re still just my prey.”</p>
<p>His body started to charge off the ground and toward the enemy once again.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Kim Rok, no, Commander?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stopped moving as he was shocked at Cale's shout.</p>
<p>But Cale didn't have time to look at Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>‘I missed the moment!’</p>
<p>Cale had the people prepare for everything but had forgotten about it for a moment because of the sudden appearance of the yellow monster.</p>
<p>He might not have the time to use what he had prepared anymore.</p>
<p>‘I can't let that happen!’</p>
<p>Crack. Crackle!</p>
<p>The beautiful monster that was covered in bright golden currents resembled a yellow dragon.</p>
<p>Boooom-</p>
<p>The monster glared at Lee Soo Hyuk and raised its head.</p>
<p>“Cover your ears!”</p>
<p>Cale sounded urgent.</p>
<p>He immediately shouted again.</p>
<p>“I said, cover your ears!”</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk flinched after hearing that before recalling something.</p>
<p>The yellow monster’s ability to handle dirt was something they had just learned.</p>
<p>It also had control of currents, as visible by the radiant currents surrounding the yellow head right now.</p>
<p>There was one last ability.</p>
<p>The yellow-headed monster’s other ability that the Commander had told them about…</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had been distracted by the golden currents such that he had not noticed that the monster’s neck was stiffly headed toward the sky.</p>
<p>But he could see it clearly now that he noticed it.</p>
<p>The yellow monster's body was bloated.</p>
<p>It looked as if it had sucked in a lot of air.</p>
<p>It looked as if it was about to scream…</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to frown as he quickly dropped his sword.</p>
<p>He then put his hand into his inner pocket to try to look for the earplugs.</p>
<p>But he quickly realized it.</p>
<p>‘It’s too late!’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk made eye contact with the yellow monster at that moment.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Its yellow eyes curled up like crescent moons.</p>
<p>‘It’s smiling?’</p>
<p>It seemed to be sneering as if it was human.</p>
<p>He could feel it based on the monster's action.</p>
<p>‘That bastard covered its body in currents on purpose!’</p>
<p>It used its electricity to gather people's attention and then acted as if it would attack Lee Soo Hyuk in anger…</p>
<p>‘But in the end!’</p>
<p>It was planning on using its sound ability.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked toward someone.</p>
<p>The yellow head’s mouth opened at the same time.</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeeeeeeeech------------!”</p>
<p>Cale was able to cover his ears in time as he had taken out his earplugs while shouting at the others to cover their ears.</p>
<p>Cale then realized his mistake.</p>
<p>“Hey, you should have told me in advance too-!”</p>
<p>“…Hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>That was the case.</p>
<p>Alberu was also here.</p>
<p>Cale lowered his head.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger, which had much larger ears than he did, started to frown.</p>
<p>"Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeech-----!”</p>
<p>The yellow head’s screech that continued without stopping was not a simple scream.</p>
<p>It caused vibrations in the air which made Cale's clothes flutter. It was quite loud even with the earplugs in his ears.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu’s body staggered.</p>
<p>Cale urgently got off his back.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Cale’s body staggered as well since he was a bit worn out.</p>
<p>‘Shit!’</p>
<p>But he was still in a better condition than the others.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“My ears, my head-”</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>There were ability users all around who had not managed to cover their ears and could no longer control their bodies properly.</p>
<p>Some of them were bleeding from their ears while others were clutching their heads.</p>
<p>Most of them looked quite dazed.</p>
<p>‘A few of them might snap out of it in a few seconds but most will be like this for a few minutes!’</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the people who were the closest to him.</p>
<p>“Ugh! To think I would make such a mistake-!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae stumbled while holding his ears with his gun still in his hand.</p>
<p>“Min Ah!”</p>
<p>“…You’re so loud.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was staggering but still managed to get to Kim Min Ah, who was on one knee, and supported her. Bae Puh Rum's eyes were full of fear.</p>
<p>‘It could cause such damage with just noise!’</p>
<p>He now understood why Kim Rok Soo kept warning them over and over about the unranked monsters.</p>
<p>‘The Commander-nim didn't give the blue monster any time to attack properly because these unranked monsters are so scary.’</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum clenched his eyes shut after seeing that even Lee Soo Hyuk had his eyes closed and was holding his head.</p>
<p>“Fuck, something like this happened as soon as we followed it up!”</p>
<p>Kim Kang Hoon, Lee Seung Won, and Joo Ho-Shik who were climbing up from the subway tunnel were holding their ears as well.</p>
<p>“Ssssssssss!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum’s suddenly felt chills on his back.</p>
<p>“Ssssh!”</p>
<p>In this short moment while everybody was out of it…</p>
<p>There was an enemy that would not miss this opening.</p>
<p>It was the yellow monster that had screeched.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum tried to focus his sight that was shaking from having a headache and looked toward someone.</p>
<p>He was looking for the person who had shouted for them to cover their ears.</p>
<p>That person was charging toward the yellow monster on his own.</p>
<p>“N, n…no……”</p>
<p>That person had just cast a shockingly strong rose gold thunderbolt just now and had coughed up blood.</p>
<p>That person charging toward the monster on his own sounded dangerous.</p>
<p>“Ssssssssss! Ssssssssss!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster was using this moment when everybody was out of it to quickly move.</p>
<p>“…I need to hurry up and-!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum could hear Kim Min Ah mumbling. She was certainly looking at the back of their Commander-nim who was charging toward the monster as well.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum heard something breaking at that moment.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum could see Lee Soo Hyuk slowly standing up straight with his sword stabbed into the asphalt.</p>
<p>Drip.</p>
<p>Blood was dripping from Lee Soo Hyuk's ears.</p>
<p>He seemed to have taken even more damage than Bae Puh Rum. It made sense since Lee Soo Hyuk had been closest to the monster after Cale and the Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's closed eyes slowly opened.</p>
<p>His bloodshot eyes were full of anger.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum got the chills from looking at those eyes, even though he knew that the anger was not directed at him.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster roared as its large body quickly started to move.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum tried to look for Kim Rok Soo once again.</p>
<p>He was probably charging forward on his own still.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum could see that Kim Rok Soo was smiling once he finally found him.</p>
<p>‘He’s smiling?’</p>
<p>Before he could say anything about it…</p>
<p>Cale was looking at something.</p>
<p>He was not looking at the yellow monster.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“As I expected…”</p>
<p>He made a short comment as he called for someone.</p>
<p>“Choi Han!”</p>
<p>He was looking at the underground tunnel from which the yellow monster had come.</p>
<p>Someone shot up from that tunnel.</p>
<p>“Yes, Rok Soo hyung?”</p>
<p>Choi Han, who had been covering his ears, had jumped up from underground.</p>
<p>He then immediately took out his sword.</p>
<p>Slaaash-!</p>
<p>His shining black aura looked violent as it shot out.</p>
<p>Cale and Choi Han made eye contact.</p>
<p>“You were covering your ears?”</p>
<p>Choi Han responded to Cale’s question with an innocent expression.</p>
<p>“I'm very good at listening to your orders, hyung.”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword then headed toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>The black aura struck down on the yellow scales that looked gold because of the currents.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion.</p>
<p>Dust and smoke covered all directions that even Cale could not see the condition of the yellow monster.</p>
<p>Choi Han had used as much strength as possible to finish this hunt quickly.</p>
<p>“…Such strength!”</p>
<p>People who were seeing Choi Han's power for the first time clutched their dizzy heads and ears as they quickly retreated back in shock.</p>
<p>This was a smart decision.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The large monster was still quickly moving forward through the dust cloud.</p>
<p>“Fuck! This smart bastard!”</p>
<p>Cale frowned and couldn't help but swear.</p>
<p>He quickly channeled his ancient powers.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to frown.</p>
<p>“Sssssss!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster had controlled the dirt underneath the asphalt to cover its body like a sturdy armor the moment Choi Han launched his attack.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword naturally destroyed that dirt armor.</p>
<p>But the black aura was unable to make even the smallest of dents on the extremely strong yellow scales after its impact was decreased by the dirt armor.</p>
<p>Choi Han's brows scrunched together.</p>
<p>But he didn't have time to stand there and just stare at the monster.</p>
<p>“Block it!”</p>
<p>He heard Cale’s urgent voice.</p>
<p>The yellow monster was smart as Cale mentioned.</p>
<p>This bastard had dodged the attack and was charging toward the humans who were still unable to snap out of it from the aftershock of the sound attack.</p>
<p>The people plopped down on the ground looked full of despair as the yellow monster charged toward them with its jaws open.</p>
<p>Cale started to move after seeing the despair in their eyes.</p>
<p>‘Attacking it is not the issue!’</p>
<p>He needed to save these people.</p>
<p>Cale's body moved quickly once he surrounded it with the Sound of the Wind and he pushed one hand forward as soon as his foot touched the ground.</p>
<p>Paaaat!</p>
<p>A silver shield with two wings appeared in front of the people.</p>
<p>The Indestructible Shield appeared and cut through the fog.</p>
<p>‘Ugh.’</p>
<p>Cale groaned internally.</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction. The Sound of the Wind. The Indestructible Shield.</p>
<p>Even though he could only use all these powers at half-strength, he had still used them more than he had expected.</p>
<p>Drip.</p>
<p>More blood trickled out of his mouth.</p>
<p>However, the people could not see the blood flowing down from his lips as they were looking at his back.</p>
<p>Cale did not see his blood either.</p>
<p>He was looking at the eyes of the yellow monster on the other side of the shield.</p>
<p>And the moment he looked into those eyes… Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>The yellow monster truly was shrewd.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The yellow head’s eyes curled up again as it smiled.</p>
<p>Cale finally realized what this bastard was aiming to do.</p>
<p>He had not been able to look at the yellow monster’s movements properly because it looked as if it was charging toward the people.</p>
<p>He had not noticed it because he suddenly recalled his forgotten time as Kim Rok Soo the employee after seeing the despair in the people's eyes as they stood in front of this unranked monster.</p>
<p>The yellow head instantly turned its large body to the side.</p>
<p>“Ssssssssss!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster was charging toward the blue monster that was now coughing up blue blood and was almost dead.</p>
<p>The blue monster was barely breathing and had no chance of revival.</p>
<p>The yellow monster changed directions to head toward the blue monster.</p>
<p>And its large body would arrive there soon.</p>
<p>Cale realized its plan.</p>
<p>‘If the bodies come together…!’</p>
<p>He could not let that happen!</p>
<p>It would become multiple times stronger than right now if the two monsters fused together and returned to its original form.</p>
<p>He had to prevent that at all costs.</p>
<p>There were three people who had the same thoughts as Cale.</p>
<p>No, these people had realized it even before Cale.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Choi Han! Kim Min Ah! Lee Soo Hyuk!”</p>
<p>Choi Han… Along with Lee Soo Hyuk and Kim Min Ah, the two people who had snapped out of it before everybody else, were charging toward the monster in different directions.</p>
<p>Cale continued to shout toward them.</p>
<p>“Watch out!”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaaaaaackle!</p>
<p>Golden currents shot out from the yellow monster’s body in all directions, resembling a spider web.</p>
<p>They were heading toward all of the people charging toward it.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Aaah!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Kim Min Ah had no choice to stumble and retreat backward.</p>
<p>They were holding a sword and a spear.</p>
<p>They were made of steel.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>Only the black aura slammed into the golden currents.</p>
<p>‘I'm going to pierce through it!’</p>
<p>Choi Han used the small opening created when his black aura clashed with the current to head toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>But the yellow monster was a bit faster.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The yellow monster’s face touched the tail of the barely alive blue monster.</p>
<p>Choi Han slashed his sword toward the yellow monster as he started to shout.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>‘We can't let those two fuse together again!’</p>
<p>Choi Han had a look of urgency on his face. He felt some wind gathering at his ankles at that moment.</p>
<p>It was Cale.</p>
<p>Cale had used his powers once again so that Choi Han could reach a bit farther forward.</p>
<p>It was obvious that he had overdone it already but it looked as if Cale might end up fainting.</p>
<p>Choi Han bit down on his lips and let the momentum in the wind carry his body.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Through the small opening created by the black aura and the currents….</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword pierced through like a fang and stabbed into the yellow scale.</p>
<p>Puuk.</p>
<p>As Choi Han started to frown after feeling that his sword stabbed into dirt armor again…</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>In the short moment someone gasped…</p>
<p>Everybody's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>They saw it.</p>
<p>Chomp!</p>
<p>The yellow head had done everything it could to barely make it to the blue head.</p>
<p>Everybody had been thinking that it had done all this so that they could fuse together and become stronger.</p>
<p>Even Cale had thought that.</p>
<p>Chomp, chomp!</p>
<p>The yellow head bit down on the blue head’s tail and dragged its body down.</p>
<p>It then bit down on the yellow monster’s head.</p>
<p>And then… It started to eat.</p>
<p>It chomped off the head of the blue monster.</p>
<p>It then started to chew.</p>
<p>Its movements were quite quick.</p>
<p>Although these two monsters were originally part of one body and probably akin to being siblings, the yellow monster ruthlessly cut off the blue monster’s head and put it in its mouth without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>It then started to hide underground.</p>
<p>It was running away.</p>
<p>The monster quickly moved while people were shocked by this yellow monster’s cruel cold-hearted nature.</p>
<p>“This crazy bastard!”</p>
<p>Cale released his shield and tried to cast another ancient power.</p>
<p>But he could not do that.</p>
<p>The yellow monster had launched its final electricity attack as it hid underground.</p>
<p>There were people who had gotten out of the aftershock of the sound attack and were quickly chasing the yellow monster.</p>
<p>Choi Han, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Kim Min Ah like before… There were also Jo Min Yeh and some other ability users as well now.</p>
<p>The shrewd monster did not launch its electrical attack toward those people.</p>
<p>It aimed its attack at the people who had been struggling for a few minutes and were barely snapping out of it.</p>
<p>The golden currents were aimed at those people as if they were sharp daggers or hail.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion as the silver shield blocked the currents once again.</p>
<p>The shock shook the ground and made it difficult to see as the dust mixed together with fog and smoke.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Cale's body staggered once more.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh supported Cale who was about to fall over.</p>
<p>The people who had taken the longest time to snap out of it were the ability users who were helping Jo Min Yeh hold onto the spider web.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh, who had been about to cast her spider web to protect them, grabbed Cale who had faced those currents in her place.</p>
<p>“…Haaaaaaaaaa……..”</p>
<p>Cale was breathing heavily and dark red blood was dripping out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“D, did it get away?!”</p>
<p>Some people poked their heads out of the tunnel that the yellow head and Choi Han had come through earlier.</p>
<p>They were Kang Il-Rae and Park Young Hoon's people who had come over after evacuating the people at Yeonsan station.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh sharply yelled back to Kang Il-Rae who asked if the monster got away.</p>
<p>“Didn't you see what happened?!”</p>
<p>“We just got here and saw the end bits!”</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae was about to keep speaking before shutting up after seeing the area once the dust settled.</p>
<p>There were people who were bleeding out of their ears and finally getting back up.</p>
<p>The entire area was a mess because of the electricity attacks and the digging.</p>
<p>Then there was the large headless body of the blue monster.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae lamented the fact that he could not hurry over any faster and barely managed to speak.</p>
<p>“…I'm sorry. We would have rushed over if we knew it would get away-”</p>
<p>"Who said that?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>His gaze headed toward Cale who was being supported by Jo Min Yeh.</p>
<p>Kang Il-Rae had flinched after seeing a pale Cale bleeding out of his mouth before flinching once more after looking into Cale's eyes.</p>
<p>Cale's cold sunken gaze had the persistence of a hunter.</p>
<p>Cale slowly asked again.</p>
<p>“Who said… That it got away?”</p>
<p>Everyone's gazes headed toward one person at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale looked in the direction the monster had disappeared to as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>"We’re going to Seomyeon.”</p>
<p>Even if it left this area…</p>
<p>Even if it started to hide…</p>
<p>Even if it ran away…</p>
<p>“That’s the only place that that bastard can come.”</p>
<p>Both that bastard and he had the same final destination.</p>
<p>The first unranked monster had appeared on November 6th.</p>
<p>One day had passed since then.</p>
<p>Currently, it was 11pm on November 7th.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel monster still had not shown up again.</p>
<p>Only the thick fog around all of Busan let them know that the bastard was still alive and hiding somewhere while aiming to take them out.</p>
<p>Cale was standing at the watchtower when he heard Lee Soo Hyuk's voice behind him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. Isn’t it your birthday tomorrow?”</p>

<p>700 chapters will get here quickly too, right? ^-^ Haha</p>
<p>Lately, a lot of things have happened to me, making me have a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>However, I am able to forget about everything whenever I sit down in front of the monitor to continue writing.</p>
<p>It always makes me so thankful that I am able to keep writing the story I want to write.</p>
<p>I will cherish these thoughts as I continue to give my best to write [ The Trash of the Count’s Family ].</p>
<p>Thank you very much for being with me. I truly mean it from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I think the thing that I like the most about writing an author’s note is that I can share my gratitude with all of you. :)</p>
<p>Please continue to enjoy the series. :)</p>
<p>I hope that you stay healthy during the hot summer and pray that your days are full of peace and joy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yoo Ryeo Han </p>

<p>Chapter 601: Even if it takes my last breath 1</p>
<p>Cale continued to look forward without turning around as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall ever telling you my birthday.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had not shared his birthday with anyone during this time.</p>
<p>He had recorded his birthday later, when he joined the company and had to give some personal information. Lee Soo Hyuk remembered that information and took care of Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo's birthdays.</p>
<p>That was how it went until the two of them died.</p>
<p>“Han told me about it.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded to Lee Soo Hyuk’s answer.</p>
<p>“Did you know that it is Choi Han and Choi Jung Soo's birthdays as well?”</p>
<p>“…Really?”</p>
<p>Cale slowly turned his body and looked at Lee Soo Hyuk since it was rare for him to sound flustered.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, whose mood had been quite sharp since yesterday, seemed oddly anxious.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile in response.</p>
<p>"What is it? Did you prepare a birthday party for me or something?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had an awkward expression on his face.</p>
<p>“It’s not a party since we are in a pretty serious situation.”</p>
<p>He then scratched his cheek.</p>
<p>“Just some late-night snack time?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you included Choi Han and Choi Jung Soo to prepare for that late-night snack time?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked flustered again.</p>
<p>“No, I-”</p>
<p>“Shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“For the thing you prepared. Let’s celebrate all of us.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk jovially scoffed after hearing Kim Rok Soo say everything he wanted to say.</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>He then looked elsewhere.</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja and Jo Min Yeh were walking toward Cale and Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Have a safe trip.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja smiled as she addressed Cale.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry.”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh waved her hand to say no after seeing Cale lower his head and apologize.</p>
<p>“Not at all. Everybody knows how hard you've worked today, Commander-nim. We heard you didn't even get a chance to eat properly.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja who was standing next to her started to frown.</p>
<p>She had not heard the details of the battle because she was here defending the Seomyeon shelter.</p>
<p>All she had heard was that the yellow head had escaped in the end.</p>
<p>She had also heard that it had run away with the blue head in its mouth.</p>
<p>That meant that the plan had failed.</p>
<p>However, she could not be angry about the situation.</p>
<p>She had seen how Commander Kim Rok Soo was covered in blood compared to everybody else who only had light injuries or no injuries at all.</p>
<p>Everybody had said the same thing.</p>
<p>They would have all been seriously injured or dead if he was not there.</p>
<p>“Commander-”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja opened her mouth before stopping herself mid sentence.</p>
<p>‘Commander, you should rest a bit.’</p>
<p>That was what she wanted to say, but she could not say it.</p>
<p>‘He can't rest.’</p>
<p>This young man could not rest.</p>
<p>She felt sorry about it, but it was the truth.</p>
<p>“Please enjoy your time.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk who was quietly walking next to him started to speak.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>
<p>“You’re really good at keeping your promises.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk with a confused expression.</p>
<p>However, Lee Soo Hyuk did not look at Rok Soo at all on their way to the room closest to the watchtower and the castle wall.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled and slowly answered after Cale finally asked.</p>
<p>“Yesterday and today. People probably saw your back the most.”</p>
<p>Cale recalled what he had said to them a few days ago.</p>
<p>‘The people here will fight while looking at my back the most, at least for this battle.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk continued to speak.</p>
<p>“It was the case during yesterday's battle. Even today, your back was clearly visible as you stood by the watchtower all day.”</p>
<p>“I need to keep my promise.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk grabbed the doorknob and looked toward Cale, who answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s the Kim Rok Soo I know.”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>Cale could see the sights inside the door.</p>
<p>He slowly started to smile.</p>
<p>“Huh?! Mister! I thought you would give us a signal first. How can you just suddenly open the door like that?”</p>
<p>"Ah, it wasn’t supposed to be like this.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum shouted in shock.</p>
<p>There was quite a lot of food on the table inside this small office.</p>
<p>It was not a fancy feast, but it was the best they could do in their current situation.</p>
<p>Choi Han, Choi Jung Soo, Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum, Park Jin Tae, the Lee siblings, and everybody else who had a connection with Cale were all gathered in this small office.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“Looks great.”</p>
<p>The two words he said made the entire office go silent.</p>
<p>Then people started to openly or discreetly smile one by one.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to point at that moment.</p>
<p>“Hey, Han and Jung Soo.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo flinched at the sudden attention.</p>
<p>“I heard it’s both of your birthdays tomorrow as well. Come over here.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's eyes opened wide after hearing what Lee Soo Hyuk said.</p>
<p>“…How did you?”</p>
<p>“Rok Soo told me.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum rubbed his arm as if he had the chills before starting to shout.</p>
<p>“Damn! Does foresight tell you things like that too?”</p>
<p>“Who knows?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk responded to Bae Puh Rum before looking toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders and looked back with a gaze that seemed to be asking if there was a problem. Lee Soo Hyuk quietly looked at him for a while before asking a question.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>His voice was extremely quiet, as if he was whispering.</p>
<p>“Is foresight really how you can know about things like this too?”</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other for a bit before Cale broke the eye contact and walked toward the table.</p>
<p>The words Cale whispered as he left echoed in Lee Soo Hyuk's ear.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Why don’t you figure it out if you're so curious?”</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk chuckled before starting to speak to everyone.</p>
<p>“Alright! Let’s sing for the three of them!”</p>
<p>“You're right.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik nodded his head in agreement before clasping his hands together.</p>
<p>“Sir, hap-”</p>
<p>“Hey, why are you saying sir?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae started to frown before looking toward a corner of the ceiling and continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“Just say happy birthday.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I can’t call him sir, now can I?”</p>
<p>Grandma Kim smiled before starting to clap.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to you-”</p>
<p>She started to sing and the rest of the people in the room joined in as well.</p>
<p>Cale reached his hand out while standing at the center of the songs.</p>
<p>“You guys come join me.”</p>
<p>One hand grabbed Choi Jung Soo, the other hand grabbed Choi Han, and he pulled the two of them closer to him.</p>
<p>“No. Ah, really, wut the heck is going on?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked flustered and confused as he accepted the birthday song directed toward him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Choi Han was completely stiff.</p>
<p>Cale just patted Choi Han’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s pupils slightly shook.</p>
<p>His eyes moved past Cale and Choi Jung Soo to take in this whole scene.</p>
<p>The song soon came to an end.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to all three of you!”</p>
<p>“Happy birthday. I believe that November 8th is a great day.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright! Let's eat!”</p>
<p>Everybody made a comment once the song ended.</p>
<p>Choi Han heard Cale's calm voice next to him at that moment.</p>
<p>“There’s still some time left, but…”</p>
<p>Choi Han turned back toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>Cale could see the ripples in Choi Han’s eyes.</p>
<p>They were not like strong waves crashing against the shore but gentle waves splashing and shining brightly.</p>
<p>“…Happy birthday to you too, hyung.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and turned his gaze.</p>
<p>“Choi Jung Soo.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo still seemed confused. Cale started to speak after a long pause.</p>
<p>Cale recalled Choi Jung Soo's voice in his mind at that moment.</p>
<p>‘Rok Soo! Super duper happy birthday to you! Ahahahaha!’</p>
<p>‘Shut up.’</p>
<p>‘Haaaaaaaa. Hey Rok Soo, can’t you be excited and wish me a happy birthday too? I guess not. Kim Rok Soo is not that kind of person.’</p>
<p>‘Who said I wasn’t going to wish you happy birthday?’</p>
<p>‘Keke. So you’re going to wish me happy birthday?’</p>
<p>‘Of course. How could I not?’</p>
<p>Cale slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The words Cale said with a gentle smile on his face seemed quite meaningful to brush aside.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn't just brush it aside.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo subconsciously started to stare at Cale.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Cale patted Choi Jung Soo's shoulder once and then started to walk toward the others.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had watched all of it. His gaze was following Cale, as if he was trying to analyze him.</p>
<p>Cale knew about it as well. He just pretended not to know.</p>
<p>Now that both Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze and Cale were gone…</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo, who was calming himself down, could see someone walking toward him.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we head outside for a moment?”</p>
<p>It was Choi Han.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was about to ask why they needed to go out before he saw Choi Han's hand.</p>
<p>The hands of the guy who seemed younger than him, but had many scars that proved he had lived a difficult life, were fidgeting as if he was a bit nervous.</p>
<p>‘He’s fidgeting?’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo felt as if this was not like Choi Han before he was swept up with an eerie feeling.</p>
<p>His last name, birthday, and sword art…</p>
<p>They were all the same or similar.</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo followed Choi Han outside.</p>
<p>They then stood in a corner of the hallway facing each other.</p>
<p>Choi Han did not say anything for a while.</p>
<p>“…What did you want to see me for?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could not hold it in any longer and asked, and Choi Han responded by taking a thick pile of papers out of his pocket and handing it to him.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“Take it.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was confused but still accepted the pile of paper.</p>
<p>He peeked at it for a moment but it was difficult to tell what it was as the first page did not have anything written on it.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo had no choice but to look toward Choi Han for an answer.</p>
<p>“…It’s a present.”</p>
<p>He didn't know why, but he started to frown after hearing that.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo subconsciously started to speak.</p>
<p>“Do you know me?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo slightly regretted the thing he said.</p>
<p>The hands that looked nervous until now calmed down and Choi Han’s face no longer showed any emotions.</p>
<p>“I will not answer any of your questions.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo became frustrated after hearing Choi Han’s response.</p>
<p>That was why he impulsively responded back.</p>
<p>“Then I guess you won't mind me figuring it out on my own.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could see a small smile appear on Choi Han’s face at that moment.</p>
<p>“Yes, I would have no choice if you did that.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo felt as if his heart was tightening for some reason.</p>
<p>He had already been thinking about his family because everybody had wished him a happy birthday. His heart was beating restlessly.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo's expression and his demeanor calmed down in order to hide the restlessness inside him.</p>
<p>It was similar to what Choi Han was doing.</p>
<p>Neither Choi Han nor Choi Jung Soo knew how similar they were right now.</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo put the present in his pocket and started to speak.</p>
<p>“I will definitely figure it out.”</p>
<p>He then looked toward Choi Han and added on.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a present for you. However, happy birthday.”</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes opened a little wider.</p>
<p>“I mean it.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo answered honestly.</p>
<p>“You’ve helped me with my sword art and training.”</p>
<p>He didn’t know why Choi Han did all of that, however…</p>
<p>Actually, there were too many suspicious things for him to claim that he didn’t know the reason at all. He couldn't help but have many ‘maybe?’ types of thoughts.</p>
<p>But Choi Jung Soo did not say those out loud.</p>
<p>It was okay to say it once everything became certain.</p>
<p>“I know that you are taking a lot of time to help me.”</p>
<p>That was why Choi Jung Soo slightly bowed toward this man who was younger than him but did not seem younger at all.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Maybe…</p>
<p>Just maybe, Choi Han was the first sword instructor Choi Jung Soo ever had, aside from his family.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo had just called him Mr. Choi Han since Choi Han didn't call himself instructor nor master and didn't want to be addressed that way, but…</p>
<p>Choi Han was still like a master for Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to raise his slightly lowered head.</p>
<p>He heard Choi Han’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>
<p>His voice was a bit cracked.</p>
<p>“It’s me who is thankful.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo urgently raised his head after hearing Choi Han speaking informally in a different voice than normal.</p>
<p>But Choi Han’s expression was the same as usual.</p>
<p>It was as still as his blade.</p>
<p>“Please head in first.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo suppressed this iffy feeling inside after hearing Choi Han’s comment and nodded to say goodbye before heading toward the door.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>He flinched after seeing Cale standing by the door, but managed to get the words out.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo opened and closed his mouth a few times after hearing Cale’s calm response before he walked past Cale and back into the room.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to think.</p>
<p>‘I have a lot of time.’</p>
<p>After they took care of this unranked monster that was trying to attack this Seomyeon shelter… He could get rid of these frustrating and annoying things on his mind at that time.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>‘If we get a bit closer…’</p>
<p>They could talk about it at that point.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo had those thoughts as he closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Choi Han and Cale were the only ones left in the hallway.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Rok Soo hyung?”</p>
<p>Cale, who quietly looked at Choi Han who was acting as if everything was fine, chuckled before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“I thought you had no plans on revealing the truth, but I guess that’s not the case?”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s shoulders slightly flinched.</p>
<p>“…That-”</p>
<p>He opened his mouth but could not say anything.</p>
<p>He wasn’t planning on telling Choi Jung Soo that he was his paternal cousin once removed.</p>
<p>But it was his birthday.</p>
<p>It was the birthday of Choi Jung Soo who was all by himself now.</p>
<p>For Choi Han, who didn't know when he would leave this world, this might be the first and only time he could celebrate Jung Soo's birthday with him.</p>
<p>But Choi Han had endlessly worried about whether he was making the right decision.</p>
<p>That concern was still going on.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was continuously questioning Choi Han’s existence.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>"Good job.”</p>
<p>He heard Cale’s warm voice.</p>
<p>Choi Han focused to hear the quiet voice that only he could hear.</p>
<p>“You wanted celebrate it with him. Your family member’s birthday.”</p>
<p>Choi Han couldn't respond to that.</p>
<p>“Good job.”</p>
<p>But Choi Han’s lips started to move after hearing Cale praise him.</p>
<p>His lips formed a straight line, making it unable to tell whether he was trying to smile or stop himself from crying.</p>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>Cale patted Choi Han’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Choi Han could see Cale heading out of the hallway once those pats did not feel weird anymore.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?”</p>
<p>"The watchtower.”</p>
<p>“…Let’s go together, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Choi Han could not tell him to get some more rest.</p>
<p>It was because Choi Han was the person who understood Cale’s desire to protect this place and quickly head back to the people waiting for him more than anybody else.</p>
<p>But even Choi Han didn't know everything.</p>
<p>Cale quietly looked down at the watch in his hand.</p>
<p>11:55 pm.</p>
<p>That day would soon arrive.</p>
<p>The day that the God of Death told him to make a decision would arrive in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>He recalled the text from his memories.</p>
<p>[ Grade 1 ability user Kim Rok Soo. ]</p>
<p>[ Do you wish to return to your original world? ]</p>
<p>[ Or will you die in this world? ]</p>
<p>In five minutes…</p>
<p>The time to make that decision would be here.</p>
<p>Cale felt the calm night air as he quietly looked at the watch.</p>
<p>Choi Han walked toward him.</p>
<p>The people standing guard had headed down and only Cale and Choi Han were up here right now.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung, why don't you head down and have a warm cup of tea-!”</p>
<p>Choi Han stopped talking.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>It was because Cale suddenly clutched the area by his heart and curled forward.</p>
<p>Choi Han saw it at that moment.</p>
<p>He saw that Cale seemed to be in so much pain, pain that was incomparable to anything he had felt until now.</p>
<p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
<p>Choi Han subconsciously called him Cale and started to support him.</p>
<p>But Cale was looking down at the watch.</p>
<p>“…Why? Ugh!”</p>
<p>It felt as if his heart was being ripped out.</p>
<p>No, an intense pain that felt as if his soul was being ripped out overwhelmed Cale.</p>
<p>"Why?”</p>
<p>It wasn't November 8th yet.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>November 8th.</p>
<p>Something was supposed to happen on that day.</p>
<p>The God of Death was going to do something. That was what Cale had thought.</p>
<p>But it was still November 7th.</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.How entertaining.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Cale started to frown even more after hearing a voice in his head.I can’t just let you overcome your despairs, now can I?</p>
<p>The sealed god was the one talking to him.</p>
<p>Author’s Note</p>
<p>Hello, it’s Yoo Ryeo Han!</p>
<p>I just left an author’s note two days ago with chapter 600, but here I am again.</p>
<p>I am leaving this author’s note because we have some great news!</p>
<p>Immediately! Immediately!</p>
<p>Right now!</p>
<p>In 60 seconds!</p>
<p>Well, not really…</p>
<p>But!</p>
<p>The [ Trash of the Count’s Family ] webtoon is launching!</p>
<p>The launch date is September 1.</p>
<p>On the first day of September…</p>
<p>I’m happy and thankful that we will be able to release an amazing piece of work thanks to the work of a wonderful webtoon artist, dramatist, and many others.</p>
<p>Now that I have given the good news, I will take my leave.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you continue to stay healthy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yoo Ryeo Han</p>
<p>1. This is different from the raw because in Korean, there is a respectful way to say ‘birthday’ which you use for your elders. English doesn't have such equivalent, so I added sir to find the best suitable translation. Grandma Kim says she can’t use the respectful term for birthday since she is older than Cale.</p>
<p>2. Remember, accents are translated like this. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 602: Even if it takes my last breath 2</p>
<p>Cale clenched his chest.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>November 7th, 11:55 pm.You are overcoming the situations quite well so far.</p>
<p>The sealed god started to speak to Cale.That is why I desire you even more.</p>
<p>“Gasp.”</p>
<p>Cale took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
<p>Choi Han could not hide his anxiety while observing Cale.</p>
<p>But Cale was looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>He heard the voice again.The other gods are pulling strings in order to help you probably because you are such a desirable child.</p>
<p>He felt as if his heart was being ripped out.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t his heart, but something deeper inside. It felt as if some spot deep in his body that he couldn't pinpoint was being twisted.</p>
<p>However, Cale had a different thought first.</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>Why had he been connected to the sealed god instead of the God of Death?</p>
<p>And why did it have to be now of all times?</p>
<p>‘Furthermore, this bastard knows about how the other gods have interfered.’</p>
<p>That meant that he had realized Choi Han and Dark Tiger Alberu’s existences.</p>
<p>‘That means he was watching me.’</p>
<p>He had not said anything until now, but he had been watching everything.</p>
<p>‘That means that…?!’</p>
<p>The god’s voice echoed in his mind again as Cale’s eyes clouded over.You seem to have realized that this is not your past as well.</p>
<p>Choi Han had said the following to Cale.</p>
<p>‘The God of Death nonchalantly told me something. This is what he said. ‘The sealed god is not able to return to the past, but he is able to push his way into a different dimension.’ ’</p>
<p>Cale had thought that this was probably a different world and not his past after hearing that as well as hearing about Earth 3 from Alberu.</p>
<p>“…A, are you admitting, haaaa, that this is r, reality then? Are you admitting to it?”</p>
<p>Cale barely managed to ask while looking at the air.My limit while I am sealed is to throw you into a different dimension.</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips were shaking but curled up after hearing that.</p>
<p>Choi Han quickly realized that Cale was talking to someone right now after hearing that.</p>
<p>He realized that it was a god as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he realized that this world was ‘reality’ and a ‘real’ world.</p>
<p>‘It really was a parallel world.’</p>
<p>Choi Han’s eyes sparkled before Choi Jung Soo's face suddenly brushed past his mind.</p>
<p>‘That punk is not fake, nor a memory, nor even an illusion, but a living breathing person like me.’</p>
<p>Choi Han pushed Cale up a bit stronger.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
<p>However, Cale's condition was not good as he continued to groan and cough up blood.</p>
<p>This pain seemed much more painful than any other pain Cale had experienced in the past.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff. W, why am I like this?”</p>
<p>Cale looked up in the air as he asked.Shouldn’t I interfere as well since the other gods have each sent one of their children?</p>
<p>“…Is your way of interfering to give me pain?”</p>
<p>Cale barely managed to say the next sentence word by word as he thought about what Choi Han told him.</p>
<p>“Ugh. I, I thought you couldn’t m, mess with the test?”</p>
<p>The God of Death had said something while sending Choi Han here.</p>
<p>‘One of the absolute rules for the God of Death is to make a vow of death. Similarly, this sealed god can create tests per his absolute rule, but he cannot mess with the contents of that test.’</p>
<p>He could not mess with the content of the test.</p>
<p>That was what Choi Han had told Cale.Hahahaha!</p>
<p>The god started to laugh out loud as if he was amused.That’s right. Child, I am unable to mess with a test that is already in progress.</p>
<p>In addition…You are not my child because you are rejecting me. You have no connections to me whatsoever. I am unable to do anything to you since you are already in the middle of a test.</p>
<p>Cale looked confused.</p>
<p>‘If he can't do anything to me… And he can't mess with the test… What is this pain?’However, there is a child who wishes to be with me.</p>
<p>Cale's eyes clouded over after hearing that.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>He started to swear.</p>
<p>He immediately thought about the person who would want to be with this god.</p>
<p>The White Star.</p>
<p>He was certain that it was that bastard.</p>
<p>And that bastard did not exist here, but in the world with Cale Henituse's body.</p>
<p>Yes, Cale's body was still on that side.The world inside the test is not your only world. I can easily mess with you from the outside as well.</p>
<p>The god warmly answered, as if he was leisurely teaching Cale something.</p>
<p>Cale covered his mouth with his hands that were shaking in pain. He started to frown.I should use my children to deliver my will as well, shouldn’t I?</p>
<p>‘What does he mean by, ‘use his children?’ ’</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze was firm even though he was in pain.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?”You'll understand after you experience it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>His heart thumped wildly at that moment.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
<p>More blood started to drip out of Cale’s mouth.</p>
<p>It was so black that it didn't even seem like blood.</p>
<p>It almost seemed as if it was dead mana.Alright, will you be able to overcome this test and your despair?</p>
<p>The god warmly laughed as he whispered.</p>
<p>His whisper started to become faint, as if he was slowly disappearing into the fog.Flail around inside your despair. When it feels impossible to get out from within your despair…</p>
<p>The whisper sounded as if the god was offering a sweet deal.I will reach my hand out to you. I hope you smile as you grab my hand at that time.</p>
<p>But for Cale, it was really, truly…No, it would probably be more entertaining if you grabbed my hand while you were full of despair.</p>
<p>It was annoying for him to hear.I will be watching with joy.</p>
<p>The faint voice disappeared and he could not hear the sealed god’s voice any longer.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaa. Haaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale was breathing heavily.</p>
<p>The pain in his body was not going down at all.</p>
<p>But he stood up straight.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>The watch hands were both at 12.</p>
<p>November 8th, at 12:00:00 am.</p>
<p>It was the promised time with the God of Death.I finally reached you.</p>
<p>The voice was warm yet cold…</p>
<p>Quiet yet firm…</p>
<p>Making it difficult to tell who was speaking.</p>
<p>He heard the voice of the God of Death.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile after hearing the voice echoing in his mind.</p>
<p>However, he just focused on catching his breath as it was difficult to say anything.You were waiting to hear my voice, weren’t you?</p>
<p>The God of Death continued to speak, as if he understood that Cale could not respond right now.Cale Henituse, who is also Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>His voice sounded oddly amused.I am a god who is incapable of foresight. However, I am able to see one kind of future.</p>
<p>Cale slowly lowered the hand that had been covering his face while he was chatting with the sealed god.</p>
<p>The corners of his lips were curled up.</p>
<p>The God of Death asked him a question.Which future do you think I see?</p>
<p>Cale slowly closed his eyes before opening them back.</p>
<p>There was only one answer.</p>
<p>"Death.”</p>
<p>The only human future the God of Death could see was ‘Death.’</p>
<p>The god asked once again.Do you remember the opportunity to decide that I gave you?</p>
<p>Of course, Cale remembered everything that had been written on it, word for word.</p>
<p>He recalled what had been written on it.</p>
<p>[ Grade 1 ability user Kim Rok Soo. ]</p>
<p>An opportunity to decide given by a god.Do you wish to return to your original world?</p>
<p>Cale had thought that the original world it was talking about was his life as the 36 years old Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>However, right now, on November 8th…</p>
<p>At this exact moment…</p>
<p>“Or will you die in this world?”</p>
<p>This world was Kim Rok Soo's world.</p>
<p>That meant the original world was talking about Cale Henituse’s world.</p>
<p>Cale started to laugh even though he was in pain and asked a question.</p>
<p>“God. You must have seen me die today.”</p>
<p>The future that the God of Death could see was the date of a person's death.Yes.</p>
<p>The god laughed as he responded.Today, on November 8th…</p>
<p>Cale had debated about it for a long time.</p>
<p>What could the God of Death have been trying to tell him?</p>
<p>Why did he randomly tell him to pick a world?Between Kim Rok Soo here and Cale Henituse over there…</p>
<p>One of the two would die.</p>
<p>He then had a thought.</p>
<p>Wouldn't the God of Death only be able to give him an opportunity to decide when he was in front of the crossroads of death?</p>
<p>In that case, was this the God of Death giving him a hint?</p>
<p>‘I don’t know if that hint will be beneficial to me or not.’</p>
<p>Choi Han had said something when he came over to this world.</p>
<p>‘Miss Cage said that the God of Death needed to make a sacrifice as well. This god is strong even if he is sealed, so the God of Death had to pay a steep price to meddle in that god’s test. Don’t hate the God of Death too much. That is what Miss Cage said.’</p>
<p>The God of Death had to pay a price to send Choi Han here to help Cale.</p>
<p>The god asked once again.Cale Henituse who is also Kim Rok Soo. I'm sure that you have already prepared for this.</p>
<p>Cale continued to smile through the pain.</p>
<p>Today was the day that one of his two identities would die.</p>
<p>“Of course, I prepared for it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman jumped up from his seat.We received a call from Eruhaben-nim!</p>
<p>Tasha's face looked urgent. The Vampire, Duke Fredo, was standing next to her with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>“What did he say?”</p>
<p>Tasha immediately answered Alberu’s question.He mentioned that something is weird about the inside of the Endable Kingdom! There was suddenly a loud noise!</p>
<p>She continued to speak.Furthermore, the magic shield surrounding the Endable Kingdom has disappeared! We are now able to go into the Endable Kingdom!</p>
<p>The God of Death asked Cale once more.One of the two yous will die today. What did you prepare?</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>“But you see…”</p>
<p>November 8th.</p>
<p>That day was not the same.</p>
<p>“This place and that place are not having the same November 8th right now.”Pfft.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know about that as well?”Hahaha!</p>
<p>The god ended up laughing out loud.You truly are intelligent. No, you are shrewd.</p>
<p>The god admitted that Cale was skilled.Yes. The time here and the time there flow differently. It is not the same November 8th.</p>
<p>The today here was not the same as the today there.Cale Henituse's November 8th will pass faster than Kim Rok Soo's November 8th.</p>
<p>The time in Cale Henituse's world was about three times as fast as this world.</p>
<p>The God of Death sounded happy as he asked.It seems as if you want to make me eat shit. Do you think that you will succeed?</p>
<p>Cale responded while smiling.</p>
<p>“It was written on your letter.”</p>
<p>The God of Death had clearly written it on the letter that told Cale that he had an opportunity to decide.</p>
<p>[ Kim Rok Soo. ]</p>
<p>[ You were the one who was supposed to die. ]</p>
<p>[ Yes, you were the one who was supposed to die. ]</p>
<p>[ However, the world’s laws and coincidences… Humans are one of the few existences who can destroy all of those things. ]</p>
<p>[ The people who tried to save you broke the law that said that you were supposed to die. ]</p>
<p>[ That is why I respect and admire humans. ]</p>
<p>The God of Death had said that he respects and admires humans who broke the world’s laws and coincidences.</p>
<p>[ You learned many things from those people and put those lessons to use in your life. ]</p>
<p>[ I'm curious to see what your decision will be. ]</p>
<p>The God of Death had already given Cale the answer in advance.</p>
<p>Cale responded to the gods who were bound to be watching him from who knows where.</p>
<p>‘I don’t trust the sealed god and I don't trust the God of Death either.’</p>
<p>What he did trust was…</p>
<p>“I trust my friends and I trust myself.”</p>
<p>The God of Death responded as if he was truly happy.I knew that a person like you, whose friends made the hands of death fail to take you, would respond that way.</p>
<p>The god mischievously asked.You were probably able to prepare decently thanks to me?</p>
<p>Cale mischievously answered back.</p>
<p>“Of course.”Your highness! What should we do?</p>
<p>Alberu turned away for a moment after seeing Tasha's anxious face.</p>
<p>He looked toward the couch that was past the table with the video communication device.</p>
<p>People he could call his companions were all there.</p>
<p>Raon, Rosalyn, Mary, Ron, Beacrox, Lock, Cage, etc were all sitting on the couch looking at him.</p>
<p>Alberu looked back at them as he recalled what had happened a few days ago.</p>
<p>It was a short conversation that took place when even Choi Han was not around and it was just Cale and Alberu.</p>
<p>‘Your highness, if I am unable to return by November 7th…’</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward the clock.</p>
<p>The current time was November 8th at 12:00am.</p>
<p>Cale had said the following.</p>
<p>If he was unable to return by November 7th…</p>
<p>‘For about a day.’</p>
<p>Actually, for exactly a day…</p>
<p>‘Please keep me alive.’</p>
<p>Alberu had felt his heart sink when he heard Cale calmly tell him that.</p>
<p>He had turned toward Cale who was caressing his mane at the time.</p>
<p>‘…What do you mean by that?’</p>
<p>He asked that question, but was looking for an answer on his own as well.</p>
<p>November 8th was the day they were supposed to catch the unranked monster if things went according to plan. But a variable must have come up if that failed.</p>
<p>That was why Alberu thought that Cale was asking him to be the Dark Tiger and support him to deal with the fall out of that variable.</p>
<p>‘You want to fight together?’</p>
<p>Alberu had asked while being slightly concerned.</p>
<p>‘Yes, your highness. Let’s fight together.’</p>
<p>Cale had continued to calmly respond and caress Alberu's mane.</p>
<p>Cale’s hand appeared and disappeared over and over as he caressed the Dark Tiger's abundant black mane.</p>
<p>Cale had started at some point to caress Alberu’s mane whenever he had the time.</p>
<p>‘Dongsaeng, why do you need to be so serious to ask me to fight together?’</p>
<p>‘I guess you’re right.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Alberu had flinched internally at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale had pretended to caress his mane while writing with his finger that could not be seen.</p>
<p>His movements were very stealthy, as if he could not let someone see it. Alberu saw that Cale's face was completely calm, as if he was not doing anything.</p>
<p>Cale was stealthily writing on the skin underneath the Dark Tiger’s mane while standing there with a calm expression on his face.</p>
<p>[ In different places. ]</p>
<p>Let’s fight together in different places.</p>
<p>Alberu had barely managed to keep his expression from changing.</p>
<p>He was acting stealthily. He knew that he had to do so since he saw how Cale was moving so that nobody could see what he was doing.</p>
<p>Cale was only telling Alberu about this.</p>
<p>He continued to leisurely caress the mane again, as if he never did anything else, before he continued to speak.</p>
<p>‘We need to all survive. Everybody should survive without dying.’</p>
<p>Cale’s hand that was hidden underneath the mane again stealthily wrote something else.</p>
<p>[ Definitely. ]</p>
<p>Everybody must definitely survive and not die.</p>
<p>Alberu gave a short response to everything Cale had just asked.</p>
<p>‘Let’s make sure to fight together.’</p>
<p>Cale had then laughed, as if he was very happy.</p>
<p>That had happened a few days ago.</p>
<p>Alberu snapped out of his thoughts and started to speak.</p>
<p>Although they were in different places…</p>
<p>‘Today, we will fight together.’</p>
<p>“We only have one goal.”</p>
<p>All of his companions looked toward Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu was speaking not as the crown prince, but as Cale Henituse's sworn brother today.</p>
<p>“We will definitely keep Cale Henituse alive for the whole day.”</p>
<p>Alberu, who was wearing his armor, picked up his helmet.</p>
<p>“We will also not die either.”</p>
<p>In the quiet area where nobody was saying anything…</p>
<p>Alberu asked his companions a question.</p>
<p>“Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Their gazes had already given him their responses.</p>
<p>Cale grabbed Choi Han's shoulder as he was being supported.</p>
<p>Choi Han would not have heard the gods’ voices, but he would have heard everything Cale had said. He was the person Cale could trust the most right now.I'll be watching you.</p>
<p>On top of the quiet watchtower now that the God of Death's voice was gone…</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>"Do you see that?”</p>
<p>In the distance…</p>
<p>They could see something large approaching them through the fog with its head up.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can see it.”</p>
<p>The yellow head had shown itself once again.</p>
<p>Beeeeeeeeep- Beeeeeeeeeeeep-</p>
<p>An alarm echoed throughout the castle, breaking the night of rest at the Seomyeon shelter.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“Until 8 am…”</p>
<p>A day for Cale Henituse would be about 8-10 hours for Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“Keeping everybody here alive. That is my goal.”</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at his shoulder.</p>
<p>Cale's voice was calm, but his hand that was on Choi Han’s shoulder was still shaking quite a bit.</p>
<p>‘The pain is still there.’</p>
<p>Cale was barely keeping himself together with his amazing perseverance.</p>
<p>Choi Han knew that was it.</p>
<p>That was why he pushed aside the things that Cale had said into the air, most likely to the gods, to a corner of his mind.</p>
<p>He then focused on what he needed to do.</p>
<p>He grabbed Cale’s shoulder to support him as he responded.</p>
<p>“I will be with you.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile again.</p>
<p>“Good. Let’s do this.”</p>
<p>It would be an extremely blood-drying 8 hours, but…</p>
<p>It was worth trying. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 603: Even if it takes my last breath 3</p>
<p>Tatatap!</p>
<p>They heard some quick footsteps.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the watchtower entrance.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>It was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“It looks like we’ll need to fight with the yellow head toni-”</p>
<p>His words that were coming out not too quickly yet not too slowly had stopped.</p>
<p>His urgent footsteps quickly stopped as well.</p>
<p>"Why are you stopping? Is something going on on the watchtower-”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae shoved his head to Lee Soo Hyuk's side before flinching.</p>
<p>“…Hey, you……”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could see Kim Rok Soo, who had an extremely pale face and was shaking.</p>
<p>Choi Han, who was supporting Kim Rok Soo, had a terrible expression on his face as well.</p>
<p>But the way he was supporting Kim Rok Soo made it seem as if he had done it many times before.</p>
<p>‘I was wondering why they went back so quickly, was it because of this?!’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had quickly returned to the watchtower even though they had set everything up to celebrate his birthday.</p>
<p>They thought he was just worried about the enemy that could come at any moment and had also quickly eaten before they were about to return to their posts.</p>
<p>But Park Jin Tae had come to the watchtower with Lee Soo Hyuk after hearing the alarm go off.</p>
<p>But what he saw was not the cold commander he had seen until now but a young kid who was suffering in pain with only Choi Han by his side.</p>
<p>‘What is going on? Why was he in so much pain?’</p>
<p>He had seen Kim Rok Soo being tired and bleeding during the battle at the original central shelter.</p>
<p>He had not been in this much pain then.</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>Why was Kim Rok Soo looking like this right now?</p>
<p>The same question kept repeating itself in Park Jin Tae’s mind, but he could not open his mouth and say anything.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Instead, his eyes focused on Lee Soo Hyuk’s back as Lee Soo Hyuk headed toward Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s expression was calm as he quietly called out to Cale.</p>
<p>However, his eyes were focused on Cale, who was barely standing up with Choi Han supporting him while his hand was clutching his chest.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s footsteps quickened.</p>
<p>“Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale looked back at Lee Soo Hyuk who was now calling him by his full name.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stood in front of Cale.</p>
<p>“Kim Rok Soo, I know that you are hiding something.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was calm.</p>
<p>It was actually Choi Han and Park Jin Tae who flinched after hearing Lee Soo Hyuk’s question.</p>
<p>“You are the same Kim Rok Soo I know from the past, but I know that something has changed.”</p>
<p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p>
<p>“But you should still tell me the things you should tell me, don't you think?”</p>
<p>Cale already knew that Lee Soo Hyuk was quite angry even though he was smiling.</p>
<p>“You should tell me if you're in pain, hmm? Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk watched as the corner of Cale's lips slowly started to go up.</p>
<p>He could feel the amount of effort it took to smile through the pain.</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing--- Beeeeeeeeep----</p>
<p>As they were surrounded by all sorts of alarms…</p>
<p>Cale smiled and slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“It feels like someone is trying to pull my heart out.”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s fists clenched while Park Jin Tae subconsciously closed his eyes and turned away from Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>Another person came up to the watchtower at that moment.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim! They said they’re going to move the device to the castle wall and activate the defense!”</p>
<p>It was Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>He had come to the watchtower to deliver this message for the others who were busy getting ready as he was not going to participate in the battle like Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum, and then he saw Cale.</p>
<p>He gasped while standing behind Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>However, there was someone whose expression had not changed.</p>
<p>“And the method?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was still smiling as he asked.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the large figure heading toward them from the distance in this night fog.</p>
<p>The yellow head was coming.</p>
<p>His life…</p>
<p>And the lives of everyone in the Seomyeon shelter…</p>
<p>The method to take care of everything.</p>
<p>‘The God of Death gave me a hint.’</p>
<p>[ The people who tried to save you broke the law that said that you were supposed to die. ]</p>
<p>Humans were able to break laws and fate.</p>
<p>That was how Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Jung Soo had died to save him.</p>
<p>‘Nobody can die this time.’</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“I’ve mentioned the method quite a few times already.”</p>
<p>His voice sounded weak as he was breathing heavily, but his tone was firm.</p>
<p>Cale looked around past Choi Jung Soo and Park Jin Tae, before looking at Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Successfully completing this hunt without anybody dying.”</p>
<p>That was one of two ways for Cale to change fate.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Is that the answer?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>He asked once more after hearing Cale’s response.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Was he sure that this was the correct answer?</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see Cale smiling at him after asking that question.</p>
<p>Cale then started to frown as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Only being somewhat certain is not enough in order to change fate.”</p>
<p>Was he sure?</p>
<p>It wasn’t that level of commitment.</p>
<p>Cale quietly started to speak.</p>
<p>“I will make that be the case.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk flinched after seeing Kim Rok Soo’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Definitely.”</p>
<p>His eyes were completely still with the violent nature that seemed to be strong enough to cause a severe storm.</p>
<p>“No matter what.”</p>
<p>He was slowly saying each word as if he was chewing on something.</p>
<p>“With absolute certainty.”</p>
<p>His body was standing straight while ignoring the pain.</p>
<p>His gaze was firm.</p>
<p>Definitely. No matter what. With absolute certainty.</p>
<p>“Successfully completing this hunt without anybody dying.”</p>
<p>Cale said that before speaking to the others.</p>
<p>“Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Cale moved his hand away from Choi Han’s shoulder and stood up on his own.</p>
<p>“Please return to your posts.”</p>
<p>He then nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>“And we will hide my condition as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to frown after hearing that. He could hear Park Jin Tae's annoyed voice.</p>
<p>“Do you really think we can hide that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae snorted at Cale's response, however, he did not say anything else.</p>
<p>He knew the chaos that would happen if people found out that their commander, forget being able to fight, could not even stand up on his own without being in pain.</p>
<p>It was something Cale and everybody else here knew as well.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>Cale took a flute out of his pocket and started to play.</p>
<p>However, the individual he was trying to call with the flute was already headed toward him.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng!”</p>
<p>It was the Steel Feather Hawk.</p>
<p>She got close to the watchtower and shoved her face close to Cale.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Why does my little dongsaeng look like this? Did someone feed you poison?”</p>
<p>As the Steel Feather Hawk was inspecting Cale in shock…</p>
<p>“I'm heading over first.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was the first to turn away from Cale.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk later, Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Haa, fuck!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae kicked the watchtower once before following behind Lee Soo Hyuk. He had already taken his gun out of his pocket.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo tried to follow them as well, however…</p>
<p>“Hold on.”</p>
<p>Someone called him. Choi Jung Soo turned his head.</p>
<p>Choi Han was motioning toward him.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Cale was looking at Choi Han with confusion. It was because Choi Han had suddenly stopped Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Choi Han grabbed Choi Jung Soo’s shoulder once he got close and started to speak to Cale and Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“Mr. Choi Jung Soo, you should come with us.”</p>
<p>The original plan was for only Cale and Choi Han to be on the Steel Feather Hawk.</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>“You have to look okay in front of the others. Rok Soo hyung, weren’t you the one who said that?”</p>
<p>Choi Han cut Cale off and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“We can’t have you staggering or falling off the Steel Feather Hawk-nim, so it would be good for Mr. Choi Jung Soo to make sure that you don’t fall off.”</p>
<p>“…Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“We do not have much time.”</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-!</p>
<p>The yellow head was now much closer than before.</p>
<p>They could also see people moving around and lighting torches all around the castle walls.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Cale ended up doing as Choi Han said and headed toward the Steel Feather Hawk with Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng. You don’t need to get treated?”</p>
<p>“Noonim, I am okay.”</p>
<p>Cale calmly responded to the Steel Feather Hawk's concerned voice and got on her back.</p>
<p>‘Ugh!’</p>
<p>He was moving as slowly as possible, but his heart was hurting.</p>
<p>To be more specific, it wasn’t his heart but more that his body and his soul were not aligned with each other, making them twist around and cause him pain.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure that the White Star is either trying to or is doing something to my body right now.’</p>
<p>The aftershock was being transferred to Cale in this body.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo took a step forward to help the struggling Cale.</p>
<p>But he felt his shoulder getting pulled and had to hear Choi Han whisper in his ear.</p>
<p>His voice was so quiet that nobody else could hear it.</p>
<p>“Hold onto Rok Soo hyung properly so that he doesn't end up in danger.”</p>
<p>He was speaking informally for the first time. However, Choi Jung Soo wasn’t upset about it and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I got i-”</p>
<p>“And.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Retreat with Rok Soo hyung if you think your lives are in danger.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo suddenly recalled someone else after seeing Choi Han’s gaze.</p>
<p>He recalled how his father and mother had been worried about him when he went to Seoul to take his practical skills exam for college.</p>
<p>He also recalled his grandfather’s stern gaze.</p>
<p>The man who was clearly younger than him but had eyes that seemed to hold the weight of time continued to speak to Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“You cannot die. You absolutely cannot die.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was suddenly at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Choi Han then asked him a question.</p>
<p>“Do you understand, sir?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo barely managed to respond.</p>
<p>“…I got it.”</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Choi Han laughed at that moment. As Choi Jung Soo flinched…</p>
<p>“Please speak formally to me.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo sounded confused at what Choi Han just said. Choi Han then put a hand on Choi Jung Soo's head.</p>
<p>“Well, speaking informally makes us sound close, so that’s nice too.”</p>
<p>He then ruffled Choi Jung Soo’s hair.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked at him with shock but Choi Han didn't care and just pushed him forward.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo ended up right behind Cale.</p>
<p>Choi Han sat behind him and the Steel Feather Hawk started to fly up once all three of them were seated.</p>
<p>“Here we go!”</p>
<p>The moment the Steel Feather Hawk cut through the night fog and headed toward their destination…</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja shouted from the castle wall below them.</p>
<p>“Point the light at the enemy!”</p>
<p>All of the lights inside the castle and on the castle walls were tilted in one direction.</p>
<p>These lights were created with abilities, electricity, and anything else that they could find.</p>
<p>“Point the lights at the yellow head!”</p>
<p>They were all pointed at the enemy.</p>
<p>They could finally see the enemy through the fog.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk was the closest to the monster right now.</p>
<p>Cale slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Hehe.”</p>
<p>He quietly laughed.</p>
<p>“…Shit.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo gasped.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak at the same time.</p>
<p>“It really is going to be difficult.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>The yellow head had changed.</p>
<p>Actually, the yellow head was no longer just yellow.</p>
<p>It was now a large monster with a blue horn and blue and yellow scales that made it look as if it had stripes.</p>
<p>This monster that now looked like a dragon that could not fly was looking directly at the Steel Feather Hawk, no, Cale who was on the Steel Feather Hawk.</p>
<p>The yellow head had eaten the blue head.</p>
<p>“Did its abilities really get absorbed?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo mumbled in a concerned voice.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk started to speak.</p>
<p>“The abilities are one thing, but its body seems larger than before too.”</p>
<p>The yellow head was now 1.5 times its original size.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk and Choi Jung Soo…</p>
<p>The people who had already seen the yellow head before…</p>
<p>And even the people who had faced an unranked monster for the first time…</p>
<p>None of them dared to say anything.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>“Screeeech-”</p>
<p>“Kaaaaaaaa, kaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p>
<p>The nearby monsters would start to rampage, whether it was due to fear or anger, whenever an unranked monster appeared.</p>
<p>They could hear the sounds of the monsters rampaging all around them.</p>
<p>“…Really.”</p>
<p>Kim Woo was standing on the castle wall taking all of this in as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Everything that young kid predicted was really on target.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had said something to them.</p>
<p>He had said that there was a good chance that the yellow head would have changed when it comes back.</p>
<p>‘The blue head… This monster ripped the part with the horn and ran away with it in its mouth. It could have done it out of friendship, but the chances are high that there was a different reason for it. We must consider all potential variables.’</p>
<p>One of those situations was that the yellow head would come back after having absorbed the blue head’s powers.</p>
<p>Kim Woo subconsciously looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>He was not the only one.</p>
<p>Everybody was looking up and searching for the Steel Feather Hawk.</p>
<p>That was where the battle would start.</p>
<p>Cale, who was up in the sky, was quietly observing the yellow head instead of looking back at the people who were looking at him.</p>
<p>“Chsssssssss-”</p>
<p>The monster quietly growled as it glared at Cale.</p>
<p>Cale heard Choi Han's voice behind him at that moment.</p>
<p>“How long will the pain continue?”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to frown after hearing Cale's nonchalant response.</p>
<p>It was because he could see that Cale’s body was still shaking and he was breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“But soon.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked at Cale, who was still standing up straight, as he heard Cale continue to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm certain it will die down soon.”</p>
<p>Cale was certain that that would happen.</p>
<p>It was because he knew that his friends would have started to make their move.</p>
<p>He trusted the abilities of his friends who were in a different world right now.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>That was why Cale could not stop.</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>“I'll be back soon.”</p>
<p>Choi Han kicked off of the Steel Feather Hawk’s back and started to fall down.</p>
<p>He pulled his sword out.</p>
<p>Slaaaaaash!</p>
<p>His black aura that was rampaging more wildly than ever before shot up as if it would pierce the heavens.</p>
<p>The moment people saw this black signal…</p>
<p>“Open the castle gate.”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>The gate opened and Lee Soo Hyuk, Kim Min Ah, and Mr. Rabbit headed out.</p>
<p>The representatives of the different regions and hundreds of warriors were following behind them.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman raised his head.</p>
<p>He could only see the stars in the night sky through his helmet.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman was wearing a black armor without the Roan Kingdom's crest today.</p>
<p>He was here today not as the crown prince, but as a friend and as a hyung.</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>The black barrier was gone from the sinkhole.</p>
<p>He looked down at the large sinkhole where the Endable Kingdom was located and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Let’s head down.”</p>
<p>Cale’s friends stepped into the sinkhole without any hesitation. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 604: Even if it takes my last breath 4</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman.</p>
<p>Ron and Beacrox of the Molan Household.</p>
<p>Mercenary King Bud Illis.</p>
<p>On and Hong.</p>
<p>"We're going invisible!”</p>
<p>Finally, Raon.</p>
<p>This was the list of people infiltrating the sinkhole with Alberu.</p>
<p>“Wow, Raon-nim, you truly are amazing.”</p>
<p>Bud was amazed as he watched the black mana surrounding all of them.</p>
<p>They were now invisible and other people could not see them.</p>
<p>“I am great and mighty so I was able to upgrade my invisibility magic so that people in our group would still be able to see each other! Something like this is just basics for me now! Of course, I don't expect our human to praise me and give me an allowance once he returns!”</p>
<p>Raon shouted before surrounding the now invisible group with wind magic.</p>
<p>Bud blurted out in amazement while watching everybody quickly and stealthily descend.</p>
<p>"Being able to use magic truly makes things easier.”</p>
<p>“Our human told me something! He said to use things that make life easier! Those were some cool words! I really want to see the human!”</p>
<p>Hong and On responded to Raon's shouts.</p>
<p>“I want to see him too, nya.”</p>
<p>“We're going to see him for the first time in a long while, nya!”</p>
<p>Raon's chubby cheeks twitched after hearing On’s words while Hong’s round eyes were starting to sparkle.</p>
<p>Bud looked at the three of them with pity before cautiously starting to speak.</p>
<p>“But we… Won’t get caught, right?”</p>
<p>Bud received Beacrox's cold gaze at that moment.</p>
<p>“We will not get caught. The Molan household does not get caught.”</p>
<p>“…Ah… Of course.”</p>
<p>Bud awkwardly responded to Beacrox's cold, no, completely frigid voice.</p>
<p>‘As expected of the Molan household. He truly is vicious.’</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Bud heard someone scoff at that moment.</p>
<p>Bud turned his head toward the voice and saw Ron.</p>
<p>He flinched after seeing Ron who was laughing while touching a small dagger that seemed extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>‘…The father is even more vicious.’</p>
<p>Ron started to speak to the Mercenary King who was looking at him, regardless of whatever thought was on Bud’s mind.</p>
<p>“Nobody will notice us until we get to our destination. Isn't that right, your highness?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Alberu was still looking at the different floors of the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>As they continued to pass floor by floor… He nonchalantly continued to speak while they headed down.</p>
<p>“There’s a unique existence here that could make it so that the Endable Kingdom won't care about us at all.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mea-”</p>
<p>Bud suddenly got chills on his back.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Loud explosions started to shake the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>“It is starting.”</p>
<p>Ron started to look at something.</p>
<p>He was looking toward the source of the explosion.</p>
<p>There were radiant golden rays of light shooting upward as if they were stars floating close to the ground.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>The golden dust shot up, exploded, and roared.</p>
<p>“It’s Goldie gramps!”</p>
<p>Raon subconsciously clapped his front paws together as he looked toward the golden dust with joy.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Bud finally realized the unique existence that Alberu was talking about.</p>
<p>Eruhaben.</p>
<p>A strong enemy that the White Star could not ignore had been quietly waiting inside the Endable Kingdom this whole time.</p>
<p>Alberu looked at the golden dust as he recalled a conversation he had with Eruhaben.</p>
<p>‘Eruhaben-nim, isn't it difficult?’</p>
<p>‘Haha. Are you worried about me right now?’</p>
<p>Eruhaben had been quietly laying low because he could not use teleportation magic once Cale’s test had started. He had laughed while responding to Alberu who was asking about his situation.</p>
<p>‘This isn't very hard compared to the things I've had to deal with in my 1,000 years of life as a Dragon.’</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Priest Cotton. The resting place created by the God of War’s priestess was safe.</p>
<p>There had been endless attacks from the outside, but as long as this resting place was safe… It wouldn't be much of an issue for Eruhaben.</p>
<p>‘In order to survive, you need to know how to recover and rest properly in the middle of war and chaos.’</p>
<p>That recovery and rest would become strong weapons to protect yourself and others during the important moments.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had been resting and recovering his strength while worrying about Cale and the children.</p>
<p>It was because he knew that the time would come to use his strength.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had said the following to Alberu.</p>
<p>‘The God of War’s resting place is a great place to relax.’</p>
<p>The only issue was that the resting place would only last for about three months.</p>
<p>‘It was about to run out of time.’</p>
<p>Alberu recalled how Eruhaben had a cold expression on his face while leisurely laughing.</p>
<p>‘I will cause quite the chaos as you asked.’</p>
<p>That was what he had said in the past.</p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>That chaos was full of bright radiant golden light.</p>
<p>The fluttering golden dust particles were symbols of Eruhaben doing as he pleased.</p>
<p>Alberu thought about someone as he saw that golden light.</p>
<p>“That ghost-like bastard.”</p>
<p>The person he was thinking about was Cale.</p>
<p>He recalled the long message Cale had written on his, no, the tiger’s back.</p>
<p>It was after he had discussed fighting together.</p>
<p>It had been an extremely long letter.</p>
<p>When Eruhaben had told him he would cause quite the chaos, Alberu had mentioned a portion of that letter. It was something that Cale said he must tell Eruhaben.</p>
<p>‘Eruhaben-nim. There was something Cale said you must make sure you do.’</p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p>‘You must survive.’</p>
<p>Alberu had been able to see the shock on Eruhaben’s face.</p>
<p>‘…What?’</p>
<p>Alberu realized that something was up with Eruhaben after hearing him asking back in shock.</p>
<p>That was why he shared Cale’s will in an even more stern voice.</p>
<p>‘That is what Cale told me. He said that that was the only way for him to survive.’</p>
<p>‘…What does my survival have to do with that punk's life-’</p>
<p>‘He said that the entire plan would fail and he would die if you lost your life, Eruhaben-nim.’</p>
<p>‘…That-’</p>
<p>‘It’s the truth.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben just closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Alberu had continued to speak while looking at Eruhaben.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse is not the type of person who would lie about such a thing.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben’s silence was his way of agreeing with Alberu.</p>
<p>The Cale Henituse he knew would not say things like that for no reason.</p>
<p>‘Eruhaben-nim. The goal of this mission is for nobody to die. Do you understand, sir?’</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon had soon responded.</p>
<p>‘Ha, hahaha-’</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon had laughed for a while before smiling and nodding his head.</p>
<p>‘Yeah. I will only use my strength to the point I will not die.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir. He said that you cannot be close to death either.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben had started to frown.</p>
<p>‘Close to death? My goodness. That unlucky bastard has no problem saying such disrespectful things to a Dragon.’</p>
<p>‘That punk does like to do that.’</p>
<p>‘I guess he wouldn't be Cale Henituse if he didn’t.’</p>
<p>Alberu had thought that Eruhaben seemed happier than ever before through the video communication device screen.</p>
<p>‘Anyway, I got it.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben agreed to do as Cale asked and he was now moving those words into action.</p>
<p>“…But it is still too early to relax.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes sank coldly behind the helmet.</p>
<p>He could now see the white castle that was the center of the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>They would soon land in the central region of the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>“We will be as quiet as possible from here on.”</p>
<p>But he was the first to be unable to do what he just said.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>He heard an explosion.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>Alberu's gaze started to move.</p>
<p>Crackle! Crack!</p>
<p>The 8 sculptures that seemed to be in the shape of the unranked monsters…</p>
<p>The underground area he presumed they were located…</p>
<p>The area where the black orb that had captured Cale Henituse was located…</p>
<p>The ground right above that underground area was starting to crack.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaaaack, craaaaaack-</p>
<p>That crack was completely visible even in the dark and was quite large.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim! Please increase the speed!”</p>
<p>‘I got it, crown prince!”</p>
<p>Alberu’s body quickly started to head toward the cracking area.</p>
<p>There were many people already there.</p>
<p>“It’s the White Star!”</p>
<p>Raon shouted as Alberu started to frown underneath the helmet.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The ground had crumbled.</p>
<p>Something black then shot up from underneath.</p>
<p>“I, it’s our human!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>Inside the half-transparent black orb…</p>
<p>Cale was weakly lying inside it.</p>
<p>He couldn't even tell if Cale was breathing.</p>
<p>Once the ground crumbled and the underground area appeared…</p>
<p>“T, they're all attacking o, our human!”</p>
<p>Numerous black mages were launching attack magic toward the black orb.</p>
<p>They seemed to be trying to destroy the black orb at all costs.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The black orb with Cale inside was shaking every time it was hit.</p>
<p>There were no cracks nor even scratches on it, but it wouldn't be weird if it broke at any moment.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse's body inside the orb was shaking left and right from the aftershock of the attacks.</p>
<p>“I will destroy them. I, I will destroy them all!”</p>
<p>“I'm going to destroy them too, nya!”</p>
<p>Raon and Hong subconsciously raised their voices.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Calm down. We can't raise our voices, nya.”</p>
<p>The two children shut up after hearing On's comment.</p>
<p>They then looked toward Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu was looking at the center of the enemies.</p>
<p>‘…The White Star.’</p>
<p>The White Star was standing there with his white mask that covered half his face as he quietly observed the black orb.</p>
<p>A large number of his subordinates were next to him.</p>
<p>There were others in addition to the black mages who looked ready to attack the black orb at any moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness, it doesn't seem as if that many of them went to handle Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>Ron’s voice was calm and gentle.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the majority of the enemies had remained here even though Eruhaben was causing a mess.</p>
<p>‘That means that the White Star is focusing everything he has to destroy that black orb.’</p>
<p>That was probably why he made it possible for magic to be used again.</p>
<p>That was probably why he was willing to risk being attacked from the outside.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“What about the Chief Priest?”</p>
<p>Alberu recalled how Cale had written for him to be wary of the Chief Priest.</p>
<p>‘Hyung-nim, the Chief Priest might try to call forth the unranked monsters.’</p>
<p>He could not let that happen.</p>
<p>At least not in the current situation.</p>
<p>Beacrox pulled out his greatsword and started to speak.</p>
<p>“He is in the front.”</p>
<p>Alberu nonchalantly commented.</p>
<p>“Fuck that bastard up first.”</p>
<p>Bud smiled and mischievously shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Wow. I love your choice of words, your highness.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Archers!”</p>
<p>The White Star shouted and people holding bows aimed their arrows toward the black orb.</p>
<p>The White Star reached his hand out.</p>
<p>‘The sealed god said so. He said to do as I please.’</p>
<p>He had wanted to destroy this black orb from the beginning.</p>
<p>However, as the sealed god’s contractor, he had to be wary of the god’s reaction and had only launched weak attacks toward the black orb while observing it.</p>
<p>‘I still need the sealed god for now.’</p>
<p>He had a lot of things to eat up while using that god.</p>
<p>There was something he needed to steal from a god in the end.</p>
<p>‘That’s why I couldn't let Cale Henituse become a contractor like me no matter what.’</p>
<p>But the sealed god finally told him.</p>
<p>He said to do as the White Star pleased.</p>
<p>That meant that he could kill Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>He would definitely kill him.</p>
<p>The White Star shouted.</p>
<p>"Archers and black mages. Attack!”</p>
<p>Numerous magic attacks struck the black orb.</p>
<p>Numerous arrows tried to destroy the black orb.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>The moment they heard an explosion that was much louder than the others…</p>
<p>As the citizens of the Endable Kingdom who had been quietly laying low for the past few months were shaking in fear inside their homes while holding their breaths…</p>
<p>Craaaackle!</p>
<p>The White Star held the crackling fire sword in his hand.</p>
<p>“I will kill him.”</p>
<p>He would destroy the black orb and kill Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>However, the White Star, Cale Barrow, soon started to laugh.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>Some of his subordinates started to shout.</p>
<p>"That is……?!”</p>
<p>“…A silver shield……!”</p>
<p>Once the dust from the explosion disappeared from the black orb…</p>
<p>They could all see a silver shield that was completely surrounding the orb.</p>
<p>The White Star frowned for a moment before he started to smile and shout.</p>
<p>“You're here!”</p>
<p>The White Star could now see Alberu and the others who were no longer invisible.</p>
<p>The White Star was happy to see the enemies he had expected to appear.</p>
<p>He was going to kill all of them this time.</p>
<p>Alberu, who had been watching the White Star, started to speak.</p>
<p>“Look at you laughing like a fucking buffoon.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak to On and Hong, who were on his shoulders now, while Bud stood there in shock of the crown prince's choice of words once again.</p>
<p>“I leave it to you guys.”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeeeeeeow! I got it, nya!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>As Hong and On jumped off his shoulders…</p>
<p>“Fog! Dodge!”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Poison, it must be Cale Henituse's Cats!”</p>
<p>Fog and poison.</p>
<p>The combination of the two attacked the enemies.</p>
<p>“Get started.”</p>
<p>Bud, Ron, and Beacrox headed towards the ground after Alberu gave the signal.</p>
<p>On and Hong were controlling their poisonous fog so that the three of them wouldn't be affected.</p>
<p>“I'm heading toward the black orb!”</p>
<p>Raon headed to his position on his own. Raon’s magic would be the strongest shield to protect Cale.</p>
<p>Alberu watched as everybody headed for their positions.</p>
<p>He then reached his hand up into the air.</p>
<p>“Taerang.”Yes, Alberu Crossman-nim.</p>
<p>A white spear appeared in thin air and ended up in Alberu’s hand.The Unbreakable Spear's first battle. Congratulations on using it for the first time.</p>
<p>The spear knight in black armor headed toward the center of the battlefield, toward the White Star.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Hey, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo quickly supported Cale who was coughing up blood.</p>
<p>Cale, who barely managed to avoid falling to the ground, clenched the Steel Feather Hawk's feathers as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“…This isn't enough.”</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes were looking at Choi Han's black aura.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion but the yellow head was still standing firm once the dust settled.</p>
<p>“Chhhssssssschhh!”</p>
<p>The monster had many small injuries covering its body, but its roar shook the area around them as it opened its jaw.</p>
<p>Its sharp fangs were revealed.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>The poison that should have been the blue head’s ability was dripping to the ground.</p>
<p>“…It became way too strong.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze sunk down as he charged toward the monster.</p>
<p>Choi Han, who had just launched an attack, was charging toward it once again as well.</p>
<p>“Prepare to attack!”</p>
<p>The long-distance attack squad on the castle walls was supporting the vanguard attack squad as well.</p>
<p>But Heo Sook Ja, the leader of the long-distance attack team, started to mumble.</p>
<p>“…It’s not enough. We need something big, we need a strong attack.”</p>
<p>They needed something to make the yellow head instantly stop in its tracks.</p>
<p>They needed a strong attack that would give them the opening to launch everything they had.</p>
<p>The person who was watching this from up in the sky knew that that was the case as well.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>Cale wiped the blood away from his mouth as he made a comment.</p>
<p>“Looks like I need to fight too.” </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 605: Even if it takes my last breath 5</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo instantly started to frown after hearing that Cale wanted to fight.</p>
<p>“What do you think you can do in your current condition-?!”</p>
<p>“Do you have any other ideas?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Was there another way to take down this upgraded yellow monster right now?</p>
<p>There weren’t.</p>
<p>This damn upgraded monster was even using the blue head's abilities.</p>
<p>It was larger than before and its body was even stronger.</p>
<p>It had the yellow head's original electricity, dirt, and sound abilities.</p>
<p>It now also had the blue head’s water, horn, and poisonous fangs.</p>
<p>Finally, it had those scales that only Lee Soo Hyuk's sword was able to pierce.</p>
<p>Was there a way to overcome all these things and kill this monster?</p>
<p>‘…For a very long time.’</p>
<p>It was possible if they fought with it for a long time.</p>
<p>There was only one monster. In comparison, they had a lot of people.</p>
<p>But Choi Jung Soo lowered his head after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“A lot of people will die if it continues like this.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could see the battlefield as he looked down.</p>
<p>He could see Choi Han charging forward again.</p>
<p>"Aren’t you pushing yourself too hard?”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah was following behind him.</p>
<p>“I can’t stop.”</p>
<p>She started to frown after hearing Choi Han’s response.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>She swore before charging past Choi Han.</p>
<p>She then swung the large spear in her hand with everything she had.</p>
<p>“Chhhssssssschhh!”</p>
<p>The monster’s eyes headed toward Kim Min Ah. They then curled up.</p>
<p>It was as if it was laughing at him.</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh at me, you stupid oversized eel!”</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The spear started to crack from the strength in Kim Min Ah’s grip. That was how angry she was at the monster right now.</p>
<p>One hour.</p>
<p>She had not been able to damage the yellow monster at all while fighting against it for an entire hour.</p>
<p>The spear stabbed forward to try to break through the scales.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>However, the spear hit the firm dirt surrounding the yellow monster, no…</p>
<p>“It’s boulder.”</p>
<p>It hit the dirt barrier that was as strong as a boulder and the attack was nullified.</p>
<p>Then the yellow monster released its ability.</p>
<p>Crackle, crack!</p>
<p>Golden currents turned into a spear and attacked Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>Choi Han rushed past her and moved forward.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah started to frown.</p>
<p>‘Again.’</p>
<p>Choi Han was in the front once again.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The currents crashed into the black aura.</p>
<p>The powers that clashed so hard that they looked as if they wanted to gobble each other up exploded and disappeared.</p>
<p>Choi Han jumped through the smoke created from the explosion.</p>
<p>“Han has such great stamina.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah saw Lee Soo Hyuk make that comment before he disappeared into the smoke as well.</p>
<p>Choi Han's sword slashed against the yellow head’s horn.</p>
<p>The yellow head then quickly moved its large body.</p>
<p>“…What a smart eel.”</p>
<p>It was to handle Lee Soo Hyuk as it expected him to come after Choi Han.</p>
<p>That was dangerous for Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Water turned into arrows.</p>
<p>Electric currents then surrounded those water arrows as they flew toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's body rolled on the ground to dodge those arrows.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>The yellow head’s tail that was covered in dirt thorns came flying toward him.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Choi Han parried that tail away.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk chuckled before getting up.</p>
<p>"Aren't you protecting me too much?”</p>
<p>There were two reasons as to why they had not been able to attack properly until now.</p>
<p>One was that Cale, who was able to launch widespread attacks, was currently unable to fight.</p>
<p>The other was that Choi Han could not go all out.</p>
<p>“…We cannot let anybody die.”</p>
<p>Choi Han was busy making sure that nobody would be killed by the yellow head such that he could not fight properly.</p>
<p>Cale had said that they must make sure that everybody survived.</p>
<p>‘The vanguard attack squad has already retreated to the back.’</p>
<p>The vanguard attack squad was waiting at a distance in order to dodge the monster's numerous AOE attacks.</p>
<p>But they were not just waiting, they were fighting.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>“Screeeeeeeeeeeeech!”</p>
<p>There were extremely agitated monsters that would show up to attack every so often even with an unranked monster being here.</p>
<p>“Slash it! We can’t let it pass the boundary!”</p>
<p>"Gather together to fight if you don't want to die!”</p>
<p>The vanguard attack squad was dealing with these monsters.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s gaze headed toward the castle walls for a moment.</p>
<p>‘Long distance attacks aren’t easy either.’</p>
<p>They couldn't damage the boulder-like dirt armor and the scales no matter how many times they attacked from a distance.</p>
<p>The only damage they could cause was with Lee Soo Hyuk slashing at the monster while Choi Han and Kim Min Ah distracted it.</p>
<p>At first, they had assumed that they would be able to attack it in the same manner they had attacked the blue head once Lee Soo Hyuk damaged the scales.</p>
<p>‘But the scales are much thicker than last time.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had damaged the black scales, but his attacks had not been enough to completely cut through the scales and reveal its skin.</p>
<p>Was it because he lacked the strength to do so?</p>
<p>It wasn't that.</p>
<p>This was not a narrow subway tunnel like before and the yellow head was able to move quickly despite its large body.</p>
<p>That was why minor injuries were all he could cause.</p>
<p>“Han, I don’t think it’s going to work.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk needed to properly slash those scales.</p>
<p>The other options were to attack its horn or inside its mouth.</p>
<p>Those were its weaknesses.</p>
<p>But the yellow monster thoroughly protected its horn and the inside of its mouth from Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>It was quite the intelligent monster.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk knew that as well.</p>
<p>That was why he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I need to climb onto that monster’s body.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk calmly continued to speak.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for me to grab that monster, so I need to at least get on it in order to launch a proper attack.”</p>
<p>No matter how fortified these scales have become, Lee Soo Hyuk's sword would be able to slash it until its flesh is revealed as long as the monster stopped moving.</p>
<p>“But the chances of you being seriously injured goes up if you do that.”</p>
<p>“Han, we don’t have time.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had given everything he had to attack the yellow head a couple times already.</p>
<p>He might not have enough strength to use his slashing ability soon if it continued like this.</p>
<p>“Han, as long as I create a deep enough injury, Jin Tae, Min Ah, or you will be able to open it up.”</p>
<p>If they could do that, the long-distance attack squad had much higher chances of hitting the enlarged injury.</p>
<p>“This is the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's plan was decided while keeping Kim Rok Soo still out of the fight.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak.</p>
<p>“I will climb on top of it and suppress it. Please aim for that opening.”</p>
<p>"We have better chances of success if you distract the yellow monster and I get on top of it.”</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>That was why Choi Han closed his mouth for a moment.</p>
<p>He recalled Cale’s gaze.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Han. I won’t die.”</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak after seeing the smile on Lee Soo Hyuk's face.</p>
<p>“Please take care of it.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>The plan had been set.</p>
<p>All that was left was to put it into action.</p>
<p>The two of them made eye contact with the yellow head that was quietly looking down at them.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to speak while looking at them from up in the sky.</p>
<p>“Yeah. We can't let anybody die.”</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked at Cale’s back.</p>
<p>Cale was standing firm, but his back looked quite weak compared to usual.</p>
<p>Although he couldn't see it because Cale was wearing a thick uniform, Cale’s neck and hair were quite wet from cold sweats.</p>
<p>“…Then what about you?”</p>
<p>That was why Choi Jung Soo asked this question.</p>
<p>“Will you not die if you do that?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo hated himself for being so weak.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, he was not weak. But he didn't have enough experience to fight in the vanguard and he was weak compared to Choi Han, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Kim Min Ah.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I won't di-, ugh!”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could see the dark red blood spurting out of Cale’s mouth even while standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Look at you lying about not dying when you’re in such a serious condition!”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was telling Cale to hold onto him, but unfortunately, Cale could not hear him.</p>
<p>‘…Why all of a sudden?!’</p>
<p>He felt a pain that was much more painful than before.</p>
<p>The pain from earlier was already hard enough to handle, but Cale’s body was now shaking from a pain that was much worse.…Cale!</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>He heard a voice.</p>
<p>Hey, are you sure this is connected?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Then why is he not responding?</p>
<p>They were familiar voices.</p>
<p>I knew we shouldn't trust the Super Rock!</p>
<p>…My hypothesis should not be wrong.</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>“Why can I hear your voices?”Huh? You can hear us?</p>
<p>He heard the Fire of Destructions voice.I guess he can hear us.</p>
<p>The husky voice of the Sound of the Wind commented as well.I knew that my hypothesis was correct. Ahem. Ahem.</p>
<p>The Super Rock chimed in with a tone of relief as well.</p>
<p>This was the first time in a long while he had heard the voices of the ancient powers since he had not heard them since he came to this world.</p>
<p>‘Why am I able to hear their voices?’</p>
<p>He could hear the Super Rock's voice.A gap was created as your body and soul was shaken up which created an opening for us to communicate with you.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>This extreme pain that was quite dangerous for him…</p>
<p>The White Star’s attack that was probably taking place on the other side…</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>These things did not only bring negative results.</p>
<p>Cale could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>“Hey, why are you suddenly laughing after talking to yourself?! Hey, Kim Rok Soo! Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>Cale just ignored Choi Jung Soo's anxious voice.</p>
<p>His mind became clear even through the pain.</p>
<p>A path had been created.</p>
<p>"Am I able to use my original powers now?”</p>
<p>He had been using the ancient powers at half-power until now.No. You are not able to use all of your original powers.</p>
<p>The Sound of the Wind calmly responded.But we are able to connect one power to you!</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction had added on.</p>
<p>The Super Rock started to speak in a serious tone at that moment.It sounds like you know about it already, but your body on this side is under attack. Your friends are trying to save you, but it won't be easy.</p>
<p>He knew it would be hard.</p>
<p>The White Star was quite strong and neither Cale nor Choi Han were there right now.Anyway, we will send the Vitality of the Heart to you since we can only connect one of us.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”What? Do you know how much you’ve bled already?</p>
<p>Cale shook his head after hearing the Fire of Destruction ask in shock.</p>
<p>The Vitality of the Heart.</p>
<p>He did not need that power right away.</p>
<p>‘The pain I'm feeling right now won't disappear just because my ability to regenerate and heal comes over.’</p>
<p>His face that was pale from coughing up so much blood might look better, but his friends on the other side needed to work hard for this pain to disappear.</p>
<p>There was one more thing.</p>
<p>‘I need to overcome this present situation.’</p>
<p>Cale looked down.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Han had stepped forward with Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum following behind them.</p>
<p>It was obvious what they were trying to do.</p>
<p>It was easy to tell after having observed everything until now.</p>
<p>“…They’re probably thinking about fighting knowing that they might get injured.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk or Choi Han, one of those two probably made up their minds to do something that could get them injured.</p>
<p>That was the only way to grab this yellow monster and create an opening to slash its scales or attack an area without any scales.</p>
<p>"Shield.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“I need the shield.”</p>
<p>-…You-</p>
<p>The Super Rock barely managed to speak as if a cat got his tongue.Are you still thinking about protecting others in your current situation?</p>
<p>Cale closed his eyes so that he could focus on his conversation with the Super Rock.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo and the Steel Feather Hawk were looking at him with gazes that seemed to be asking how a person could be like this.</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk was actually tearing up.</p>
<p>“…My dongsaeng… Is too good of a person…….”</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>But neither of their voices reached Cale.</p>
<p>He was focusing on the Super Rock and the other ancient powers.</p>
<p>At this exact moment…</p>
<p>The Indestructible Shield was what he needed.Then should I go?</p>
<p>The glutton priestess cautiously asked.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to like this idea.</p>
<p>But Cale needed her.</p>
<p>His eyes were brimming with vitality when he opened them again.</p>
<p>“Noonim.”</p>
<p>“Huh, huh? Dongsaeng? What is it, my dearest dongsaeng?”</p>
<p>“Let’s head to the castle walls.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! I'll do whatever my dongsaeng asks me to do!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk quickly headed toward the castle walls.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was looking at him with confusion.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>It was because he knew that Kim Rok Soo was not going back to get some rest.</p>
<p>Cale smiled and started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“To find a way for us to win.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo asked back, but the Steel Feather Hawk had lowered her head after arriving at the castle walls.</p>
<p>Everybody could now see Cale who was on her back.</p>
<p>“…Shit… Commander-”</p>
<p>This was the moment Heo Sook Ja and the others finally realized why Cale had only been watching from the air after giving the order to attack.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim. Are you ill-”</p>
<p>“I don't have time to chat right now.”</p>
<p>Cale was looking at every corner of the castle walls until… He saw someone standing with Grandma Kim and mister Jang Man Soo.</p>
<p>He had asked this person to come here with Jang Man Soo just in case, but he had no reason to use his powers until now.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jae Ha-Jung.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>During the battle at the original shelters…</p>
<p>Bae Cheol-Ho, Park Jin Tae, and Joo Ho-Shik had been the leaders of the original central shelters.</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung was from Bae Puh Rum's eldest uncle, Bae Cheol-Ho's shelter.</p>
<p>He had protected the shelter from the monsters’ attacks until Cale’s reinforcements had arrived.</p>
<p>He had used wood to do it.</p>
<p>“Please get on.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>While Jae Ha-Jung was confused by Cale's comment…</p>
<p>“Noonim.”</p>
<p>“I got it!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk bit down on the back of Jae Ha-Jung's clothes and threw him into the air.</p>
<p>“What is going on?!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk had placed Jae Ha-Jung on her back while he was frozen stiff in shock.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo caught him and sat him down.</p>
<p>“Please help me.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>He heard Cale’s request as soon as he was seated.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jae Ha-Jung, you are able to create trees and make them grow, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes… I can? But I can only grow five trees at max.”</p>
<p>“That’s plenty.”</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung suddenly got the chills after seeing a pale Cale who was covered in blood smiling brightly at him.</p>
<p>The people who had no idea what was going on could only look up at the sky with confusion.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Han, who had been about to go attack the monster, were two of those confused people.</p>
<p>"What is Rok Soo trying to do? Who is that person?”</p>
<p>“That person is Mr. Jae Ha-Jung and his ability uses wood-”</p>
<p>Choi Han flinched as he responded.</p>
<p>It was because a thought passed through his mind at that moment.</p>
<p>One of Cale’s abilities that really astonished people and made them gasp in the past…</p>
<p>Wood.</p>
<p>In the central region of the Jungle… When dead mana was going to be spread all over the area Litana lived in…</p>
<p>Cale had used this power at that time.</p>
<p>“…Is he planning on using the tree trunks?!”</p>
<p>Choi Han started to frown.</p>
<p>The numerous tree roots and trunks had traveled through the night in the past and headed for the palace at the center of the Jungle.</p>
<p>This astonishing power…</p>
<p>If it was this power…</p>
<p>‘It can tie the yellow head down!’</p>
<p>Choi Han started to frown significantly once his thoughts reached that point.</p>
<p>"Why?!”</p>
<p>‘Even though he tells us to live, why?! Why?! Why does he push himself overboard each and every time?!’</p>
<p>Choi Han glared at the sky instead of at the yellow head. This was a glare of sorrow and not anger.</p>
<p>“Han, what is it?”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk started to head down as Lee Soo Hyuk asked with confusion after seeing Choi Han just looking up at the sky instead of attacking.</p>
<p>Very small seeds fell to the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>Plop. Plop. Plop.</p>
<p>These seeds that were so small that most people would not be able to see them as they fell into the ground.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Trees started to quickly grow from these seeds.</p>
<p>The trees stopped growing once they were the size of an average adult.</p>
<p>“That’s good, Mr. Jae Ha-Jung. I'll take it from here.”</p>
<p>Cale looked down.</p>
<p>The yellow head was glaring at him. It was an inspecting gaze that seemed to be wondering what Cale was trying to do now.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.Don't overdo it.</p>
<p>He heard the Super Rock's concerned voice.Don’t worry. I’ll do a good job.</p>
<p>The moment he heard the glutton's response…</p>
<p>Cale reached out both hands.</p>
<p>That was how it started.</p>
<p>Plop. Plop.</p>
<p>The trees started to awaken.</p>
<p>Crack, crack.</p>
<p>The asphalt started to crack and the crack started to spread while looking like spider webs.</p>
<p>And through those cracks…</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>Large roots started to come up.</p>
<p>The trees started to grow once again and their trunks became thicker.</p>
<p>All of the roots and trunks started to move in one direction.</p>
<p>“Chhhssssssschhh!”</p>
<p>They all seemed to be heading toward the yellow head.</p>
<p>It was now a battle of strength between Cale and the yellow head. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 606: Even if it takes my last breath 6</p>
<p>The trees that had just been saplings until a moment ago were growing exponentially.</p>
<p>“…My goodness!”</p>
<p>The person who was the most shocked was the person who had spread the seeds and grown those saplings. Jae Ha-Jung was the most shocked.</p>
<p>It was because he had a similar ability. That was the reason he was shocked more than anybody else.</p>
<p>‘How can he have such an ability?!’</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung’s gaze looked astonished, no, mesmerized as he looked past Choi Jung Soo to Cale.</p>
<p>‘How many abilities does this person have? And each of them are extremely strong abilities!’</p>
<p>But Jae Ha-Jung’s eyes were sparkling even more as he looked at these growing trees.</p>
<p>‘It’s different!’</p>
<p>The power Cale had used during the original shelter battle and this power were fundamentally different.</p>
<p>‘This is at a completely different level!’</p>
<p>He could feel a strong power coming from the trees that was incomparable to what he experienced before.</p>
<p>That was why his sparkling gaze started to shake.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Cale coughed up more blood.</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung was thinking that things might end up really bad like this. That was how serious Cale’s condition was right now.</p>
<p>“…Haaaa. Noonim.”</p>
<p>But Cale just wiped away the blood and ignored his condition.</p>
<p>No, he tried his best to forget about it.</p>
<p>What he did from here on was very important.</p>
<p>He needed to focus.</p>
<p>In order to do that, it would be best to be closer to the spot he needed to focus his power.</p>
<p>“Please put me down.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Dongsaeng, will you be okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“O, okay! I’ll do as you say for now!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk quickly moved to where Cale had pointed.</p>
<p>Cale’s body staggered from the speed, but Choi Jung Soo quickly supported him.</p>
<p>"Thanks.”</p>
<p>“……Sure.”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk stopped on the tree that was closest to the castle gate.</p>
<p>Cale landed on the top branch of a tree that grew resembling a watchtower.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo and Jae Ha-Jung were with him as well.</p>
<p>But the people on the castle walls that had been fighting off the monsters until now could only see Cale.</p>
<p>“…Shit.”</p>
<p>“My goodness.”</p>
<p>They were at a loss for words after properly seeing Cale's condition.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Someone started to mumble.</p>
<p>“…We really… Are seeing the most of that back.”</p>
<p>They recalled the promise that their young commander had given them.</p>
<p>‘Furthermore, the people here will fight while looking at my back the most, at least for this battle.’</p>
<p>Their commander had kept his promise.</p>
<p>Everybody could feel the weight of that promise after seeing his current condition.</p>
<p>“Are we just going to stand around like this?”</p>
<p>“No. We need to do something as well.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere on top of the castle walls had changed.</p>
<p>They could not just keep going like this.</p>
<p>They needed to do something.</p>
<p>Those emotions started to roar wildly in their hearts. The sight of their leader fighting in the front was bound to light a fire in the hearts of those who followed him.</p>
<p>“What is that?!”</p>
<p>There were some people whose hearts were lit up more than the others.</p>
<p>In fact, the heat was reaching up to the top of their heads.</p>
<p>These people were Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum. These two who had trained with Cale could now see Cale’s condition up close.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he can hold on!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum looked ready to fly up to the top of the tree where Cale was standing at any moment.</p>
<p>“We do not have much time.”</p>
<p>But everybody stopped after hearing a person's voice.</p>
<p>It was Choi Han.</p>
<p>“I’m going first.”</p>
<p>That was all he said before he started to move.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum then saw it.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>They saw Choi Han getting on top of a large tree root that was quickly growing.</p>
<p>That tree root then quickly headed toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>“Chsssssssssssssch! Ch!”</p>
<p>The monster seemed flustered after seeing the tree roots and trunks that were trying to bind it from all directions.</p>
<p>It tried to dodge, but that would not be easy to do.</p>
<p>“It can't dig underground!”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum could see the roots thoroughly covering the ground.</p>
<p>He finally realized what Cale was trying to do.</p>
<p>‘He’s trying to tie it up!’</p>
<p>He was trying to bind the monster.</p>
<p>‘That means that there will be an opening for us to attack!’</p>
<p>The yellow monster could use water, electricity and poison, but Cale could also use water and electricity.</p>
<p>‘It’s worth trying!’</p>
<p>They would finally be able to attack properly!</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was the last one to realize that fact.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Kim Min Ah were already on top of other tree roots and heading toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>The first large tree root reached the yellow monster at that moment.</p>
<p>It started to bind it.</p>
<p>“Roooooar!”</p>
<p>A different cry than before came out of the monster’s mouth.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>A sturdy boulder-like dirt covered the monster’s body.</p>
<p>It had its almost invincible scales underneath it as well.</p>
<p>But these trees that were moving toward the monster as if they were snakes did not wish to cause damage to this monster.</p>
<p>They wanted to twist the life out of it. They wanted to make it unable to move.</p>
<p>The monster realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>Golden currents charged toward the trees in the shape of spears.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“I can't let you do that.”Will you be okay?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Rose gold currents flew over like arrows and exploded once they crashed into the spears.</p>
<p>Cale lowered his body as if he was leaning on the ledge of the watchtower.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>His nose was bleeding without stopping.</p>
<p>He had used the half-powered Fire of Destruction while using the full powered version of the Indestructible Shield's tree ability.</p>
<p>The burden on his body was to be expected.</p>
<p>But Cale was smiling.</p>
<p>It was because the opening created by that explosion had given him just the thing that he had needed.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The first tree root wrapped around the monster’s tail.</p>
<p>The yellow monster’s bluish yellow eyes could see tens, no, hundreds of tree roots and branches swarming toward it.</p>
<p>This was completely different than any of the abilities that the other humans had used until now.</p>
<p>It felt as if this person was controlling nature itself.</p>
<p>The yellow monster made eye contact with Cale.</p>
<p>That was the beginning.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The monster started to flail and Cale clenched a branch on the tree that he was standing on.</p>
<p>The former did it to run while the latter did it to capture it.</p>
<p>The only common thing between these two existences was that they were both fighting with their lives on the line.</p>
<p>They were both quite desperate as well.</p>
<p>They both knew that they didn't have much time.</p>
<p>If there was a difference between the two…</p>
<p>Cale had friends by his side.</p>
<p>“Min Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>
<p>“It’s my turn after Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“Puh Rum and I will go after you then.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Choi Han who was up in the front.</p>
<p>But Lee Soo Hyuk was looking at Cale. Unlike Kim Min Ah who couldn't bear to look, Lee Soo Hyuk was remembering each and every one of Cale’s appearances.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I would be fighting while looking at his back.”</p>
<p>The corners of Lee Soo Hyuk’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>He then looked forward.</p>
<p>He heard a voice drifting away as he looked at Choi Han’s back.</p>
<p>“Horn.”</p>
<p>That was all Choi Han said before jumping off the tree root and into the air.</p>
<p>Tatap.</p>
<p>A different tree root appeared just under his feet.</p>
<p>It was the same tree root that had wrapped around the yellow monster’s tail.</p>
<p>‘We can’t let it get away.’</p>
<p>Choi Han was desperate.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the time to look back or to stop.</p>
<p>He knew that the opportunity that Cale had created for them was extremely precious.</p>
<p>That was why he quickly started to run up the monster’s body.</p>
<p>“Rooooooooooooar! Roooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The monster flailed around.</p>
<p>It shot out electrical currents, but they were all blocked by Cale, giving it no choice but to twist its body to flail around.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The monster’s body made dull noises as it slammed into the trees.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Choi Han ended up slamming into a few trees because of the movements as well.</p>
<p>He almost fell off a couple times.</p>
<p>But he did not stop.</p>
<p>In fact, he was smiling.</p>
<p>“It knows I’m here.”</p>
<p>Peek.</p>
<p>The yellow monster was looking at him.</p>
<p>The enemy had already noticed Choi Han a long time ago.</p>
<p>That was why it was flailing around even more.</p>
<p>It was because it knew that Choi Han had something that could injure it.</p>
<p>But Choi Han was already close enough to the monster’s head that the two of them could make eye contact.</p>
<p>‘This is enough!’</p>
<p>Choi Han jumped into the air after making that conclusion.</p>
<p>He then had a sad smile on his face before it disappeared.</p>
<p>Wind gathered around his ankles and tree trunks appeared in the air to create stepping stones for him.</p>
<p>Choi Han could feel Cale supporting him and creating a path for him.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p>A violent black aura viciously wrapped around his sword.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The monster opened its mouth and revealed its poisonous fangs toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>But tree trunks quickly blocked its mouth.</p>
<p>Choi Han was finally able to reach his destination thanks to his friend’s power that had blocked the attack.</p>
<p>He was looking at the places on the monster’s body that were neither covered in scales nor dirt.</p>
<p>Slash.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword slashed in a horizontal line.</p>
<p>Slaaash!</p>
<p>He had not been able to make any damages on the scales.</p>
<p>However, the things he was slashing right now were…</p>
<p>"Screeeeeeeeeech---!”</p>
<p>Bluish yellow blood spurt out of the monster’s two eyes.</p>
<p>“First the eyes.”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s sword started to move again.</p>
<p>He could not stop.</p>
<p>A proper fight was finally starting.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The White Star started to frown.</p>
<p>His fire sword clashed against a white spear.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The noise was extremely loud compared to the sounds of battle all around them.</p>
<p>It was proof that two very strong powers were clashing against each other.</p>
<p>“…You're persisting better than I expected.”</p>
<p>The White Star’s eyes had an odd glow to them.</p>
<p>He was looking toward Alberu, the black armored knight.</p>
<p>Alberu started to smile under the helmet.</p>
<p>He started to speak in a disguised voice.</p>
<p>“How odd.”</p>
<p>But Alberu’s gaze instantly sunk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, his voice seemed quite light as he spoke.</p>
<p>It was as if he was inspecting something.</p>
<p>“White Star, you seem much weaker than usual today.”</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>The White Star laughed.</p>
<p>“I'm just gathering information. The people on Cale Henituse's side always have something prepared. Shouldn’t I confirm what that is first in order to lessen the variables against me?”</p>
<p>Alberu didn’t believe him at all.</p>
<p>The White Star was weaker than usual.</p>
<p>When the two of them had fought last time… And based on the information he had gathered about the White Star's strength since then…</p>
<p>He was very weak compared to everything Alberu knew.</p>
<p>This place should have been extremely advantageous to the White Star.</p>
<p>That was why Alberu, who had prepared quite a bit to fight here while protecting something at the same time, could not help but be curious about the White Star's current condition.</p>
<p>But he ended up making eye contact with the White Star who seemed just as curious.</p>
<p>The White Star’s fire sword pointed at something.</p>
<p>"What kind of weapon is that?”</p>
<p>The White Star did not even have a scratch from all of their clashes even though it was quite narrow.</p>
<p>The White Star was asking about this weapon and Alberu responded back.</p>
<p>He had not come here as the crown prince today.</p>
<p>The only person around him right now was this white thing as well.</p>
<p>That was why he answered honestly.</p>
<p>“Why the hell do you care?”</p>
<p>He also answered like a rascal.</p>
<p>“White Star, a bastard like you wouldn’t know the greatness of an Ex-Grade item.”</p>
<p>“…What grade?”That was a great response, sir. I, Taerang, am very happy that Alberu Crossman-nim understands my greatness.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu had a smile underneath his helmet that Cale and Raon would say was quite annoying.</p>
<p>The White Star could not see that smile properly, but he could imagine it based on Alberu’s chuckle.</p>
<p>Alberu flicked his spear after seeing the White Star start to frown in front of him.</p>
<p>“Come on. I'll give you the chance to fight properly with an important person.”</p>
<p>The White Star must have been extremely annoyed by those words as he started to frown even more.</p>
<p>Even though he was under pressure, Alberu had a refreshed smile on his face as he started to think.</p>
<p>‘It really is fun messing with the White Star as Cale Henituse mentioned.’</p>
<p>Just like this…</p>
<p>‘Let’s drag things out.’</p>
<p>Alberu fixed his grip on his spear.</p>
<p>It would soon be dawn.</p>
<p>He started to think about the long day ahead of him. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 607: Even if it takes my last breath 7</p>
<p>He then thought of a plan regarding how he would spend this day.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Numerous arrows and magic spells flew toward the black orb.</p>
<p>Ron, Beacrox, Bud, and Alberu were all fighting against the enemies, but there were too many of them.</p>
<p>Even though On and Hong were with them as well, the two of them were only supporting them from the rear, making everybody other than Alberu unable to hide their anxiousness.</p>
<p>“Ah, we're in a rush! Why the hell do they keep popping out?!”</p>
<p>Bud lightly shouted as he swung his sword. A cold blue aura turned into a sharp thorn and stabbed an enemy’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Next!”</p>
<p>Bud just kicked that enemy away as if he didn't have any time to rest before charging toward the next enemy.</p>
<p>His actions looked quite bold.</p>
<p>‘The smell……!’</p>
<p>In reality, he was actually more sensitive than ever before.</p>
<p>He had a wind ancient power. He was using his ability to figure out an enemy's level of strength at its max capacity.</p>
<p>‘I need to prepare for what the crown prince said. He said that in the worst situation, someone or something that is as strong as, if not stronger than Eruhaben-nim might appear at some point.’</p>
<p>That meant that Bud was the person who could figure that out faster than anybody else.</p>
<p>His eyes were already bloodshot as he was using his abilities to the max starting from the beginning of the battle.</p>
<p>But he could not stop.</p>
<p>“Ah, why the hell do more of them keep popping up no matter how many I take down?!”</p>
<p>A blue aura rushed forward like a thorn toward an enemy's neck.</p>
<p>This time, there was someone who was faster than him.</p>
<p>Slash!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>A large greatsword slashed at the enemy’s back.</p>
<p>Beacrox nonchalantly said something to Bud with a stoic expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Back.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Bud swung his sword toward the back.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A black arrow crashed into the blue aura and shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks!”</p>
<p>Bud thanked Beacrox, but Beacrox was already swinging his greatsword at another enemy.</p>
<p>‘…I can't believe such a vicious bastard can use such covert stealth techniques.’</p>
<p>What a scary household.</p>
<p>However, Beacrox was not vicious at all when compared to Ron.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! M, my arm!”</p>
<p>“Ugh, my leg, my leg!”</p>
<p>There were enemies falling over with severe injuries all around them.</p>
<p>“Where the hell are these attacks coming from……?!”</p>
<p>The problem was that these enemies had no idea where the attacks were coming from.</p>
<p>‘Scary old man.’</p>
<p>Bud realized that these quiet attacks were coming from Ron.</p>
<p>He was right as Ron was running wild in this thick darkness before the sun came up.</p>
<p>These were the enemies that had destroyed his household and killed his family members.</p>
<p>It had happened a long time ago, but he still could not erase the incident from his memories.</p>
<p>‘You want to touch my family again?’</p>
<p>Ron was filled with more anger than ever before. His son Beacrox was the only one who had realized this.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>His dagger slashed without making any noise.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>An enemy fell down grabbing his injured back. Ron didn't pay any attention to the fallen enemies. His emotionless gaze just moved to find the next target to attack.</p>
<p>‘…The young master-nim was quite like a puppy.’</p>
<p>He was thinking about Cale right now.</p>
<p>He had somehow ended up at Count Henituse's household after escaping the Eastern continent and heading to the Western continent.</p>
<p>A lot had happened until that point, but there were so many more stories that had come up during the time he spent in the Henituse household.</p>
<p>Almost half of them were related to Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>It could not be helped. He was quite an entertaining young master.</p>
<p>However, such a young master…</p>
<p>‘We will definitely keep Cale Henituse alive for the whole day.’</p>
<p>The sentence from crown prince Alberu Crossman regarding their goal for the day had fueled the seeds of anger for Ron.</p>
<p>These seeds had grown into a large fire.</p>
<p>“Shoot the arrows- ugh!”</p>
<p>That was why Ron attacked the Dark Elf that was giving orders to attack the black orb.</p>
<p>The sharp dagger stabbed through the Dark Elf’s neck and burst out the other side.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh!”</p>
<p>The Dark Elf heard Ron's voice behind him.</p>
<p>“You don’t need that neck since you just say useless things with it, right?”</p>
<p>Ron then disappeared into the darkness so that the enemies pointing their arrows at him would not be able to hurt him.</p>
<p>His eyes headed up as he did that.</p>
<p>Numerous attacks were headed toward the sky.</p>
<p>There was a black orb surrounded by a silver shield at the center of those attacks.</p>
<p>Cale was quietly lying inside the half-transparent black orb.Grandpa Ron! Do not worry! I will protect him properly!</p>
<p>Ron started to smile after hearing Raon speak to him as if he knew that Ron was looking at him.</p>
<p>Raon’s only task was to protect Cale.Ah!</p>
<p>Raon started to speak to Ron and the rest of their allies.Tasha, Rosalyn, and Mary said that they have started to move!</p>
<p>Alberu clenched the white spear in his hand after hearing that.</p>
<p>Their friends were staying with the plan and moving properly.</p>
<p>That was why he started to think about people who were elsewhere even as he was fighting.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse.’</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘Choi Han. I know that you will be able to protect Cale.’</p>
<p>He started to think about Choi Han, Cale's knight.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>Choi Han moved his sword toward the monster that was spurting out bluish yellow blood as it screamed.</p>
<p>First were the eyes.</p>
<p>After that…</p>
<p>“Open your damn mouth.”</p>
<p>He headed toward the screaming monster’s poisonous fangs.</p>
<p>There was black poison dripping down from the two fangs.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it already open?”</p>
<p>Choi Han heard Lee Soo Hyuk’s voice behind him.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had reached next to Choi Han at some point.</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's sword came out of the scabbard.</p>
<p>Choi Han blankly looked at him for a while before he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I'll take the right side, sir.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take the left.”</p>
<p>The yellow monster was flailing in pain after suddenly losing its eyes and its sight.</p>
<p>In this short opening provided by that chaos….</p>
<p>They needed to take a lot of things from this bastard right now.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The flailing monster screeched and opened up its mouth.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see a violent black light coming out of Choi Han's sword as Choi Han rushed past him.</p>
<p>‘Mmph!’</p>
<p>He gasped.</p>
<p>He had already used too much of his abilities.</p>
<p>But the results were satisfactory for how much he had used so far.</p>
<p>‘I can only use it a few more times.’</p>
<p>That was why he had to focus.</p>
<p>He had to make sure to slash something with each attack.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's eyes focused on one of the fangs that was dripping a black liquid.</p>
<p>He took a step forward.</p>
<p>Sturdy tree branches became like stairs for him.</p>
<p>He kicked off one of those steps and jumped up.</p>
<p>The moment he reached the apex of his jump…</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk completely focused on his sword.</p>
<p>Many things were being carried by this sword right now.</p>
<p>The flow of the battle that was to come…</p>
<p>The lives of numerous people…</p>
<p>And finally, Kim Rok Soo’s pain-filled power that was serving as a stepping stone for him right now.</p>
<p>‘I must succeed this time if I have any sense of responsibility.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk couldn't hear anything around him.</p>
<p>However, he was so focused that he didn't even realize that he couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p>His sword slowly slashed down.</p>
<p>And the noise around him actually disappeared for a moment.</p>
<p>The monster’s screeches…</p>
<p>The noises from the trees growing…</p>
<p>The sound of Choi Han’s sword crashing into a fang…</p>
<p>Even the sound of his own heart beating.</p>
<p>His ability had slashed all noise as well.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt it at that moment.</p>
<p>‘Ah. I've grown. My power has gotten stronger.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was certain once he felt this change.</p>
<p>‘That fang will be cut.’</p>
<p>He soon saw something that would verify that he was right.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar---!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk heard the monster’s pain-filled roar once he could hear again.</p>
<p>Pat.</p>
<p>Choi Han placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“You’ve gotten better, sir.”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s voice was filled with joy.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see the right fang that had turned into dust as well as the left fang that was cleanly cut off as he listened to Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Hey Han, you did well too.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's voice was a bit brighter at the fact that they had finally managed to land a proper attack.</p>
<p>They finally managed to take care of one of this mutant yellow monster’s abilities.</p>
<p>There was still a lot of fighting left to be done, however, his gaze automatically turned somewhere after feeling this small amount of joy.</p>
<p>He wanted to show this to the punk to whom he was both thankful and concerned about.</p>
<p>“Shit, Ca--!”</p>
<p>Choi Han suddenly screamed before shutting up and starting to run without being able to finish what he was saying.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see Kim Rok Soo who was standing on a pillar on top of the trees that looked like a watchtower.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was plopping on the ground as if he had fallen over.</p>
<p>“Rok-”</p>
<p>It was different than before.</p>
<p>The way he was plopped down made it look as if he had really reached his limits.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk subconsciously started to run toward Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>But he soon stopped moving.</p>
<p>It was because Choi Han had stopped.</p>
<p>Choi Han had his head down.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>The usually calm and composed bastard’s face was seriously contorted with a frown right now.</p>
<p>“Fuck. This is really annoying.”</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes were scrunched together as he turned around. It made Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Han make eye contact.</p>
<p>“…Why-”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to speak but could not finish his question.</p>
<p>‘Why did he stop heading over?’</p>
<p>He just asked himself internally.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>Because, that bastard who had fallen down…</p>
<p>The bastard who was kneeling and barely holding onto the ledge of the watchtower, the bastard who was still conscious but seemed to be in terrible, terrible pain…</p>
<p>That was bastard was telling them something.</p>
<p>He was telling them to attack.</p>
<p>He was telling them not to stop.</p>
<p>He was telling them to not come to him.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>There was a tree branch tapping on Choi Han’s back. It was pushing him toward the yellow monster.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Choi Han mumbled in a shaking voice as he started to move in the direction the tree branch wanted him to go.</p>
<p>Cale had plopped down on the ground…</p>
<p>It seemed as if he had reached his limits…</p>
<p>But his tree branches had not crumbled yet.</p>
<p>That meant that Cale had not released his control over his power even in his terrible condition.</p>
<p>That was telling them to keep fighting.</p>
<p>That was Cale’s will to persist no matter what it took.</p>
<p>Choi Han had to keep fighting because he understood Cale’s will better than anybody else.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was able to understand Kim Rok Soo's will based on the sturdy tree root under his foot.</p>
<p>They were not the only ones who understood Cale’s will.</p>
<p>Choi Han urgently raised his head.</p>
<p>He felt something brush past him.</p>
<p>Once he figured out the identity of that ability…</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>He saw an explosion in the monster’s right eye.</p>
<p>It was a bullet.</p>
<p>A bullet had flown over and pierced through the injury on the monster’s eye before exploding.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaa. Haaaa.”</p>
<p>On top of a different tree near Cale…</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was breathing heavily as he aimed toward the monster again.</p>
<p>“Crazy bastard. A fucking lunatic.”</p>
<p>He was swearing without stopping.</p>
<p>He felt as if he was going crazy because of this unexplainable anger and annoyance. That was why he could not just stand still.</p>
<p>“Ah fuck it, let’s just keep going.”</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>Another bullet shot out from the barrel of the gun.</p>
<p>Other people started to speak as well.</p>
<p>“Long-distance attack squad, aim for the head! Attack the head!”</p>
<p>“Hey! Run across the trees! You can attack the monster if you use the trees!”</p>
<p>"Squad 1! Let’s quickly take care of these monsters and we will head toward the trees as well! Archers, leave these to us and climb the trees! Attack the monsters like Park Jin Tae is doing!”</p>
<p>None of them could stop.</p>
<p>They could all tell the importance of these trees that their commander had sacrificed so much to create.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo urgently crouched while on the watchtower.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey!”</p>
<p>He was checking Cale's condition and offered Cale his hand.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He then jerked his hand back in shock.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had suddenly plopped down on the ground.</p>
<p>“…Why, no, how is his body so hot-”</p>
<p>Cale's body was extremely hot.</p>
<p>It was not just at the level of a fever.</p>
<p>It was so hot that it felt as if he would burn. It made him wonder how Cale was not dying right now. Normal people would have some issues if their body heated up like this.</p>
<p>But Cale looked the same as he did before.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo then realized that something seemed to be surrounding Cale.</p>
<p>That ‘something’ was the reason Cale was so hot right now.</p>
<p>‘What the hell is going on with this punk right now?!’</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was feeling extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>He heard a pain-filled quiet voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Kim-”</p>
<p>“Hey, Kim Rok Soo! Are you okay?!”</p>
<p>He quickly asked Cale.</p>
<p>But Cale quietly mumbled again, as if he couldn't hear Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“…Kim Rok Soo……?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was wondering what was going on as Kim Rok Soo was calling out his own name.</p>
<p>Actually, Cale was the one who was really wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>He had subconsciously plopped down on the ground after his body felt as if it was shaking from intense pain.</p>
<p>It was amazing that he managed to maintain his ancient power.</p>
<p>He had heard a voice at that moment.</p>
<p>It was different from the voices of the ancient powers or the voices of the gods that echoed throughout his body.Am I finally able to chat with you?</p>
<p>It was Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>‘It’s my voice. No, it’s not.’</p>
<p>It was different, but the tone of the voice was oddly similar to the current Kim Rok Soo and Cale.</p>
<p>That was why Cale figured it out.</p>
<p>He figured out that the owner of this voice was Kim Rok Soo, but not the Kim Rok Soo he knew.Yes. I am the original from this world. I am the Kim Rok Soo who used to live in that body.</p>
<p>If this was a parallel universe…</p>
<p>If this was a different world than where Cale used to live…</p>
<p>It was someone who should have existed.</p>
<p>The original Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>It was a different Kim Rok Soo who should be experiencing the end of fall as a twenty years old kid.My voice can finally reach your soul now. I didn't know that I would see myself who was over thirty-five like this.</p>
<p>“…Ha!”I guess nice to meet you isn't fitting for such a situation, but…</p>
<p>Cale couldn't help but laugh.Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>‘I know, right?’</p>
<p>It didn't fit this occasion, but it was nice to chat with each other.Hey. That sealed god or whatever… I want to smack that motherfucking god in the back too.</p>
<p>He liked the words coming out of the mouth of this world’s Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>‘It really is me.’ </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 608: Even if it takes my last breath 8</p>
<p>“Are all of my thoughts being read?”Yeah. I saw it all.</p>
<p>Cale closed his eyes for a moment after hearing the original Kim Rok Soo of this body respond.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo added on at that moment.Including your past. All of it. I saw all of it.</p>
<p>Cale could hear that Kim Rok Soo’s voice was slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Twenty years old.</p>
<p>The Kim Rok Soo of this world was still young and had not experienced a lot of things.</p>
<p>But he had seen Lee Soo Hyuk and many others die, team leader Kim Rok Soo who continued to live even after their deaths, and even his life as Cale Henituse after that.</p>
<p>Even if he was a cold and stoic bastard, these were extremely difficult memories for the twenty years old Kim Rok Soo.… You've suffered quite a bit.</p>
<p>This was the thought that Kim Rok Soo had after looking at Cale.</p>
<p>“We need to stop suffering. And that’s both you and I.”</p>
<p>‘And the others as well.’</p>
<p>These were Cale’s honest desires.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo and Jae Ha-Jung, who were next to Cale, understood what Cale was mumbling to himself and stopped moving for a moment.</p>
<p>They didn't know why he was mumbling like this.</p>
<p>But the fact that he was saying such a thing on the battlefield made their hearts hurt.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim-”</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung subconsciously called out to Cale.</p>
<p>He couldn't stand not calling out to him during this pitiable situation.</p>
<p>But Cale heard the Super Rock's voice at that moment.Cale.</p>
<p>Cale's eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>The pain had lessened.</p>
<p>It was less than half of what it used to be.</p>
<p>I can't see because your eyes are closed on the other side, but the attacks on the black orb surrounding you have disappeared.</p>
<p>He's right. The shock transferring from the black orb to your body is gone!</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction added on with excitement.</p>
<p>Cale realized it at that moment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the attacks toward the black orb have stopped.</p>
<p>‘…Raon!’</p>
<p>He was certain that Raon's shield was protecting the black orb.</p>
<p>His friends were also defending against the attacks headed toward him inside the black orb.</p>
<p>‘They’re doing well.’</p>
<p>His friends were doing a good job.</p>
<p>Cale's eyes filled with energy.</p>
<p>It had been about 1 hour and 30 minutes since the battle had started.</p>
<p>That meant that it would soon be dawn on the other side.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale let out a short chuckle.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.You're at your limit.</p>
<p>It was the voice of the glutton priestess.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p>He was at his limit.You can’t faint.</p>
<p>Putting the White Star’s attacks on the other side aside, Kim Rok Soo's body would not be able to handle it and he would faint if he used any more of his ancient powers.</p>
<p>Cale slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>“Y, you’re getting up?”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo and Jae Ha-Jung quickly supported Cale.</p>
<p>Cale raised his head and could see the battlefield that was bright from numerous people's light abilities.</p>
<p>It was bright even though it was night time.</p>
<p>“…Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Cale slowly started to catch his breath.</p>
<p>The pain was only half of what it was before, but it was still painful.</p>
<p>“Everybody is doing well.”</p>
<p>Cale started to think.</p>
<p>‘My friends here are doing well too.’Hey. You cannot die.</p>
<p>He heard this world’s Kim Rok Soo’s voice.</p>
<p>Cale could not die right now as he mentioned.</p>
<p>‘That’s why I should rest for a bit.</p>
<p>I can’t let anybody die.</p>
<p>I can’t die either.</p>
<p>I will definitely survive.’</p>
<p>He had persisted through everything until now so that he could survive.</p>
<p>He needed to survive to create a small farm and be a slacker.</p>
<p>He would achieve everything he’s wanted to achieve.Yes. Let’s chat some more while you rest.</p>
<p>As Cale started to smile after hearing the shaking voice of the young Kim Rok Soo…</p>
<p>Booboobooboooooom----.</p>
<p>The trees stopped moving.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>The others quickly understood what was going on.</p>
<p>Everybody's heads turned toward the watchtower on top of a tree.</p>
<p>They could see their commander looking down at the battlefield while being supported by two people.</p>
<p>Someone started to speak.</p>
<p>“Don’t stop the attacks!”</p>
<p>The trees had stopped.</p>
<p>That meant that there was nothing to hold the yellow monster down anymore.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>Crack, crack.</p>
<p>The yellow monster started to twist its body and roar out loud.</p>
<p>But nobody was complaining about the fact that the trees were no longer helping them fight this monster.</p>
<p>“Don’t waste this opportunity that the Commander-nim has created for us!”</p>
<p>“Attack some more before the trees are destroyed!”</p>
<p>Everybody knew what they needed to do and started to move even without Cale giving any orders.</p>
<p>This was not the case for only the people involved in the attack.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won, who was stationed in a large area on one side of the castle wall…</p>
<p>He was currently using his Recording ability.</p>
<p>“Commander Kim Rok Soo’s attack has stopped. But the trees he created are still present and the attack squads are using them as support to attack as much as possible before the trees are destroyed.”</p>
<p>Everything happening on the battlefield was being recorded through his mouth.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had said something to them.</p>
<p>‘We need to record everything that happens. It is for the future.’</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won didn't have any power to join the fight, but he was fighting in his own way.</p>
<p>He was thinking that recording everything was his way of fighting.</p>
<p>He turned to the side.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon, who had the Message ability, had tens of walkie-talkies around him as he delivered information all around.</p>
<p>"Squad 7! Squad 5 says they are about to move up to attack. Please support them from behind!”Got it.</p>
<p>"Squad 2. Long-distance attacks will soon start coming from the 3 o’clock direction. Please keep that in mind.”Yes sir.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's older sister, Lee Jin Joo, ran into the castle with a document Kim Min Joon created for him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Min Joon. I just need to read all of this, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please help everyone not be so anxious.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>She would use her Amplification ability to inform the people inside the shelter what was going on and lessen their anxiety.</p>
<p>Everybody was fighting.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won saw an ability user speak to Joo Ho-Shik at that moment.</p>
<p>“Mr. Joo Ho-Shik, are you not participating in the battle?”</p>
<p>He was someone who had seen Joo Ho-Shik's abilities when they took care of the blue head last time.</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won could see the stiff expression on Joo Ho-Shik's face.</p>
<p>He had his arms crossed as he shook his head.</p>
<p>“I wish to fight but I cannot go to the battlefield.”</p>
<p>Grandma Kim and Doctor Kang. Joo Ho-Shik was next to them along with Jang Man Soo.</p>
<p>“Mr. Joo Ho-Shik, wouldn’t you ability make it so that our attacks become stronger?”</p>
<p>They could use his faith to amplify their attacks.</p>
<p>That power would be very useful on this battlefield.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik knew this as well.</p>
<p>But he could not do that today.</p>
<p>“My faith will be focused on healing today.”</p>
<p>The numerous healing-type ability users who were gathered here heard a tired voice through Kim Min Joon's walkie-talkie at that moment.We are moving the first round of injured people.</p>
<p>Everybody looked toward the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>It was Kim Rok Soo's voice.Our number one goal is everyone's survival.</p>
<p>His voice was coming out of not just Kim Min Joon’s walkie-talkie but the walkie-talkies of all squad leaders.Move all of our injured comrades.</p>
<p>To have the person next to you survive…</p>
<p>There was no battle more difficult than that.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon, who knew that was the case, listened quietly before starting to speak.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim-”</p>
<p>Grandma Kim made a comment as he was unable to finish what he was saying.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo. We should probably bring you over first.”</p>
<p>Cale put his mouth to the walkie-talkie and responded to the concerned voice he heard through it.</p>
<p>“I am okay.”…Haaaaaaaa.</p>
<p>He could hear Grandma Kim sighing after hearing his response.You need to get healed.</p>
<p>Cale immediately responded after Grandma Kim asked once more.</p>
<p>“It is useless.”</p>
<p>Cale was telling the truth about other people’s healing abilities being useless on him right now.</p>
<p>The attacks on Cale Henituse's body on the other side and the rebound from using his ancient powers…</p>
<p>Neither of those were things he could take care of on this side.</p>
<p>All they could do was lessen some fatigue.</p>
<p>‘That is why it is more beneficial to use their powers on other injured people rather than me.’</p>
<p>But the others did not hear Cale’s words the same way.It is useless.</p>
<p>Doctor Kang subconsciously started to shout once he heard those words through the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it's useless?! You need to have faith that all illnesses can be cured!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You must have faith.”</p>
<p>The injured members of the attack squads were being moved over as Joo Ho-Shik quietly added on.</p>
<p>Once the first group of injured people arrived while being supported by their fellow squad members…Please heal the others first.</p>
<p>They all heard their commander’s voice.I am okay.</p>
<p>Silence filled the castle wall at that moment.Until later then.</p>
<p>Cale’s walkie-talkie then disconnected.</p>
<p>They heard someone start to swear after a few seconds of silence.</p>
<p>“That rotten son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>It was Joo Ho-Shik.</p>
<p>The person who always calmly said, ‘I have faith’ and seemed quite serene was angry even though his face still looked calm.</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s go until I faint.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik pointed to the injured people.</p>
<p>“Please lay down.”</p>
<p>Doctor Kang pulled up his sleeves while Grandma Kim headed over to the injured people with the other healing ability users.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik started to speak to the injured.</p>
<p>“You guys will definitely get better. You will all become energetic. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>The injured kept their mouth shut after seeing the look in Joo Ho-Shik's eyes. Joo Ho-Shik didn't care and started to speak to the two elderly healers next.</p>
<p>“Grandma, grandpa, please have the same belief. No, everybody here needs to believe that.”</p>
<p>The belief that all of the injured will get better.</p>
<p>The belief that everybody would survive.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik pulled off his white jacket and threw it to the side.</p>
<p>“That is how my faith can be as strong as possible.”</p>
<p>An aura started to appear around his body that was full of scars.</p>
<p>He clasped his hands together and started to shout.</p>
<p>“I have faith!”</p>
<p>He believed it would happen.</p>
<p>He believed that everybody here would survive.</p>
<p>The reason behind it was simple.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he believed in Grandma Kim and Doctor Kang’s abilities.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>That damn Commander’s actions and words.</p>
<p>The warmth hidden underneath those words…</p>
<p>Those were what gave him certainty and faith more than anything else.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik didn't know it yet, but his faith in Cale was stronger and more certain than any faith he had ever had in anything before.</p>
<p>His ability started to explode, similar to the aura that was becoming stronger around his body.</p>
<p>His ability shot up as if it was exploding stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>He was not the only person going through such a situation.</p>
<p>Similar to how Lee Soo Hyuk's ability had grown to where he could even slash through sound…</p>
<p>Similar to how Joo Ho-Shik's faith was more certain that ever…</p>
<p>Similar to how Kim Min Joon continued to slam against his limits to create more walkie-talkies as needed…</p>
<p>Similar to how Grandma Kim, Doctor Kang, and the others were desperately using their healing abilities for the injured…</p>
<p>People all around were reaching the limits of their abilities and exploding past them.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>A hand holding a walkie-talkie weakly fell to the ground at that moment.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was slightly shocked and quickly started to ask.</p>
<p>"Are you really okay?”</p>
<p>He could hear Cale mumble something instead of responding to him.</p>
<p>“…This is enough.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo looked as if he was about to cry as he responded to the weak voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah! This is enough!”</p>
<p>They were able to injure the monster’s eyes and slash the monster’s poisonous fangs because Kim Rok Soo had held the monster down.</p>
<p>They had finally been able to land some successful attacks and the atmosphere on the battlefield had changed.</p>
<p>The trees were no longer moving but everybody was trying to prolong this ability that their Commander had created for them as long as possible.</p>
<p>But they could not be completely happy.</p>
<p>The moment the trees stopped…</p>
<p>Crackle! Crack!</p>
<p>“Rooooooooooooar---!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster started to move more intensely than before and started to destroy the tree roots and branches.</p>
<p>It looked extremely intense that most people would find it difficult to even approach it.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo started to frown while looking at it but his frown loosened up after he saw something else.</p>
<p>He saw a smile.</p>
<p>He saw that Cale was smiling.</p>
<p>“…They will grow stronger now.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Cale started to think while seeing the change in atmosphere.</p>
<p>This was enough.</p>
<p>The wheels had started to turn one by one now.</p>
<p>“If the hunter is weaker than the prey…”</p>
<p>Numerous hunters were waking up.</p>
<p>“You just need to make the hunters grow stronger.”</p>
<p>The unranked monsters that showed up became stronger each time one appeared.</p>
<p>But humans managed to survive and create a new society.</p>
<p>It was because they continued to grow through the dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Humans learn and continued to grow stronger as they put in the effort.</p>
<p>And they survive.</p>
<p>Until finally…</p>
<p>They can work together to hunt the monsters.</p>
<p>‘By the time morning arrives…”</p>
<p>Cale looked around at his surroundings that were bright even though it was night time.</p>
<p>Once the Cale Henituse on the other side and his friends successfully make it past the day…</p>
<p>Once morning arrives on this side…</p>
<p>“The hunters’ counterattack will start.”Crown prince, are you okay?</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu clenched the hand holding Taerang, his white spear.</p>
<p>His palm was numb.</p>
<p>He heard Raon's voice again.Hey crown prince! Is it time to get started with phase 2?</p>
<p>Dawn had arrived on this side. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 609: Even if it takes my last breath 9</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu let out a short groan.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The wall cracked once he slammed into it.</p>
<p>“I should be asking you why you are so weak.”</p>
<p>The White Star openly sneered at Alberu.</p>
<p>He was still only using his fire sword.</p>
<p>He pointed the tip of the sword toward Alberu and continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to use your magic?”</p>
<p>Alberu was only using spear arts as well.</p>
<p>‘I guess it really is difficult to defeat a sword art that has been sharpened for 1,000 years.’</p>
<p>These results were to be expected.</p>
<p>Alberu was not someone who specialized in any one thing.</p>
<p>Whether it was his magic or spear arts… Neither was at the level for him to be considered the best on the continent. He was only strong because he combined the two together.</p>
<p>"Well, fine. I'm sure there’s a reason you are not using your magic.”</p>
<p>Step step.</p>
<p>The White Star started to walk toward the wall where Alberu had slammed into.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Alberu tried to raise his body that was covered in armor that was now crushed and cracked in many spots.</p>
<p>The White Star, who had been looking at him with a stoic expression, started to smile.</p>
<p>"But is it okay for the sun of the Roan Kingdom to look like this?”</p>
<p>He continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Was that radiant and holy appearance from before all just a lie?”</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown under the helmet.</p>
<p>It was not because of the White Star.Is it okay to just let him talk shit like this to you, sir?</p>
<p>It was because of Taerang.The owner of an Ex-Grade must show such trash who provokes you the taste of sprite in reality.</p>
<p>‘What the heck is it saying?’</p>
<p>It is something that my creator often said.</p>
<p>Personally, I hate sweet potatoes. I recommend a road of flowers, money, or sprite. Ah, of course, I accept a decent level of sweet potato for an extremely carbonated sprite.</p>
<p>Alberu felt as if he was going to sigh.</p>
<p>But his expression stiffened after hearing what Taerang said next.Why are you not using my full strength, sir? I am not a normal spear! Please use me! I will send this shitty trash flying away. I will show you the greatness of an Ex-Grade weapon, sir. I will break all of his teeth.</p>
<p>But it definitely is weird. You are only using about half of your strength as the trash mentioned, sir. You are also not calling your allies over. Why is that so?</p>
<p>‘Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>There’s a reason for it.’Ah. Is that so?</p>
<p>Taerang suddenly started to speak with admiration.Hiding the strength of the main character. It's something like that, isn’t it?</p>
<p>‘What the heck is it saying now?’</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess that’s not wrong.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t the main character, whatever that meant, but…</p>
<p>‘I am hiding my strength.</p>
<p>I am… and so is that bastard.’</p>
<p>“Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Alberu stood up straight and looked toward the White Star.</p>
<p>The White Star was leisurely looking around.</p>
<p>Beacrox, Ron, and Bud were fighting around them but it had already been a few hours.</p>
<p>They looked tired and the three of them were not enough to handle the numbers advantage of the White Star's subordinates.</p>
<p>He made a comment after taking a look.</p>
<p>“…I'm sure there’s a reason you didn’t bring your other allies as well.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the same for you?”</p>
<p>Alberu walked away from the wall and started to smile.</p>
<p>‘I don’t see the Bear tribe or the Lion tribe. The black knights aren't here either.’</p>
<p>He could see the Chief Priest but the other priests weren’t visible.</p>
<p>Not only that but the Dark Elves and black mages were less than the numbers Duke Fredo had told them about.</p>
<p>There were no vampires either.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure we’ll be able to figure out what is going on with the Vampires once Duke Fredo contacts us.’</p>
<p>The individuals who could be considered the core of the White Star’s forces were not here.</p>
<p>‘I have a pretty good idea as to where they might be.’</p>
<p>Alberu thought he had a good idea as to why he didn’t see the White Star’s subordinates.</p>
<p>The White Star nodded his head without much change to his expression.</p>
<p>“Mm. That is true.”</p>
<p>He then added on.</p>
<p>“I have a need to conserve my subordinates right now.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to sneer as he responded back.</p>
<p>“Ah. Is it because of that Vampire bastard named Naru and that old Dark Elf?”</p>
<p>They were the White Star’s subordinates who had gone to attack Cale’s castle in the Forest of Darkness and then could not be contacted.</p>
<p>“Yes. I've also been questioning my subordinates’ loyalties lately.”</p>
<p>Alberu nonchalantly responded to that as well.</p>
<p>"Who could have expected your Deputy Chief Priest to betray you?”</p>
<p>The corners of the White Star’s lips started to twist into a frown.</p>
<p>“…I didn't expect a bitch who serves another god to sneak into my land.”</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Priest Cotton served the God of War.</p>
<p>She had been protecting Eruhaben and the members of the Mercenaries Guild in the God of War’s resting place.</p>
<p>The White Star seemed to be thinking that she was the traitor who brought Cale here.</p>
<p>‘Is he not suspicious of Duke Fredo?’</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was still said to be unconscious at his place.</p>
<p>The problem was that he was not in his bed for the past three months, but the White Star had not visited his residence during that time.</p>
<p>That was why Alberu could not quickly come to a decision.</p>
<p>‘Hmm.’</p>
<p>Other than the few times they cast spells on the God of War’s resting place, it had been difficult to use magic in the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>That was why the White Star couldn't try to figure everything out in such a situation.</p>
<p>‘Anyway.’</p>
<p>The only thing he could do was to push forward in the best direction.</p>
<p>Alberu continued to speak as if he was making fun of the White Star.</p>
<p>“I guess you had no way of knowing that Deputy Chief Priest Cotton was a follower of the God of War.”</p>
<p>One corner of the White Star’s lips twisted up as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I also didn’t know that she would bring a vermin into this land.”</p>
<p>Vermin. He was talking about Cale.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Our human is not a vermin!”</p>
<p>A large black spear shot toward the White Star.</p>
<p>The White Star turned toward the black orb with Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>He could not see the black Dragon.</p>
<p>But he could see something start to cover the silver shield.</p>
<p>“He’s here.”</p>
<p>A gold light covered up the silver light.</p>
<p>"Where are you looking?”</p>
<p>The White Star turned toward the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>Eruhaben, who was covered in golden light, waved his hand.</p>
<p>“Now the Dragons are coming at me.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben started to frown at what he heard.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by coming at you? This esteemed Dragon is being nice and teaching you a lesson.”</p>
<p>He then looked into the air and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Little kid, you stay out of it.”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Stay out of it.”</p>
<p>Slash.</p>
<p>Raon's black spear was slashed by the White Star's fire sword.</p>
<p>It then exploded.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>Golden dust shot out toward the White Star through the explosion.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-!</p>
<p>A water wall was created to defend against the golden dust.</p>
<p>The White Star could then see Alberu Crossman aim his spear toward him again.</p>
<p>“Are you finally using your second power?”</p>
<p>He then saw Eruhaben next to Alberu.</p>
<p>The White Star was wary of the enemy he could not see as well.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure the black Dragon is nearby while invisible.’</p>
<p>It was a three on one battle.</p>
<p>This would be difficult even for the White Star.</p>
<p>‘I can’t use more of my powers either.’</p>
<p>He started to think about how much power he could use right now.</p>
<p>But the enemies didn’t give him time to think very long.</p>
<p>“I guess that's enough thinking.”</p>
<p>The golden dust turned into numerous arrows and shot out toward the White Star.</p>
<p>“Let’s just face them for now. My body is itchy after not fighting for a few months.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben started to charge toward the White Star.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The arrows exploded after crashing into the water wall and the Water wall could see a fist covered in golden light through the explosion.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a noise that was incomparable to anything until now and the wall was destroyed.</p>
<p>“You're just stupidly strong!”</p>
<p>“Of course a Dragon is strong, did you think Dragons were weak? Are you an idiot?”</p>
<p>The White Star dodged the second fist and then quickly ducked.</p>
<p>Shhhhhh-</p>
<p>The white spear stabbed at where the White Star's heart had just been.</p>
<p>“What a pity.”</p>
<p>He could hear Alberu Crossman’s entertained voice.</p>
<p>The one person and one Dragon continued to attack the White Star without giving him an opening.</p>
<p>“How annoying!”</p>
<p>Alberu started to think while seeing the White Star frown.</p>
<p>‘The White Star’s subordinates would show up if we continue like this.’</p>
<p>Either that, or he would figure out why the White Star was only using a small amount of his powers.Hey crown prince! I'm leaving!</p>
<p>No matter what, it would at least make it easy for Raon to move around.</p>
<p>Inside the gold shield…</p>
<p>Raon’s silver shield had disappeared.</p>
<p>‘I'll succeed!’</p>
<p>Raon quickly started to move while remaining invisible.</p>
<p>He left the battlefield, flew past the white castle, and headed somewhere.</p>
<p>There was a white necklace around Raon’s neck.</p>
<p>It was a magic artifact Lord Sheritt had created for him.</p>
<p>‘Raon-nim.’</p>
<p>The black Dragon recalled the conversation he had with Alberu as he continued to move.</p>
<p>‘We have two goals. The first is everyone’s survival.’</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘The second is to steal the sculptures.’</p>
<p>Cale and Alberu were planning to steal the sculptures when they had the chance.</p>
<p>‘Even if we could survive today without them, we must get the sculptures for the future.’</p>
<p>Alberu’s words echoed inside Raon’s mind.</p>
<p>‘The monsters that will appear if those sculptures become alive are all extremely strong. I believe they will cause a lot of damage so we must prevent those sculptures from coming alive.’</p>
<p>Raon’s dark blue eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>He had arrived.</p>
<p>This was the God of War’s resting place.</p>
<p>It was now a mess because of Eruhaben’s rampage.</p>
<p>He walked over to a shadow of a destroyed wall.</p>
<p>This was the location they had discussed.I'm here!</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Lock were there.</p>
<p>Caw.</p>
<p>There was also a crow.</p>
<p>Rosalyn had brought Lock here while Eruhaben was causing a ruckus.</p>
<p>The crow had snuck into the Endable Kingdom as well.</p>
<p>The Tiger shaman Gashan would be somewhere in the darkness.Let’s go!</p>
<p>Lock looked nervous while Rosalyn looked calm. Lock used invisibility magic on both of them.</p>
<p>The three of them quickly started to move, relying on their magic or physical strengths.</p>
<p>‘Raon-nim. Miss Rosalyn and Lock… Please move around with the two of them. Gashan will follow you while supporting you from the rear.’</p>
<p>Raon had agreed with the crown prince’s decision.</p>
<p>Lock was capable of close combat and would be their tanker.</p>
<p>Rosalyn was capable of long-distance attacks and attacking numerous enemies at once.</p>
<p>Gashan was skilled in both fighting and incantations.</p>
<p>‘And I am great and mighty!’</p>
<p>This was a great combination.</p>
<p>It was disappointing that Choi Han and his human were not there, but it was worth trying.</p>
<p>The three of them quickly started to move without saying anything.</p>
<p>Alberu had said the following.</p>
<p>‘Raon-nim, we must first find those sculptures.’</p>
<p>‘I'm certain the White Star would have placed a lot of his forces at that location. Either that or they will be low in numbers but extremely skilled. He needs them to protect the sculptures.’</p>
<p>Raon believed Alberu would be right.</p>
<p>That was why he thought of Cale in order to find the sculptures.</p>
<p>‘The human told me!’</p>
<p>Cale had talked about observing the battlefield.</p>
<p>That was why Raon had been looking around the Endable Kingdom while protecting the black orb.</p>
<p>He did not see the Bear tribe, Lion tribe, or the black knights.</p>
<p>He was certain they would be protecting the sculptures.</p>
<p>Although the Chief Priest was on the battlefield, that was probably just a ruse.</p>
<p>‘In addition, the White Star was only using a small amount of his powers! It felt as if he was controlling it!’</p>
<p>Raon believed he was correct about the White Star's condition.</p>
<p>It was because he had learned by watching his human.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure the White Star is up to something!’</p>
<p>The White Star probably decided that he could not let it continue like this after fighting against them multiple times.</p>
<p>‘That’s why I'm sure there’s more to his plan than just attacking the black orb with our human inside it!’</p>
<p>The corners of the Raon's mouth started to twitch.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure our human would have had the same thoughts! I'm certain of it!’</p>
<p>It was because he was thinking about Cale who would have come to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Raon was repeating the thought in his mind as he efficiently continued to move.</p>
<p>Lock and Rosalyn followed behind while looking at this small black Dragon's back.</p>
<p>Rosalyn made sure nobody was around them before she quietly asked Raon a question.</p>
<p>Nobody had noticed the three of them quickly moving.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim. Is there a place you believe they are guarding the sculptures?”</p>
<p>Alberu had told the three of them something.</p>
<p>“There is a great chance that the sculptures are no longer in their original location. They probably moved it because we found out the location.</p>
<p>That is why we must analyze the new location while observing the battlefield. No, we must find it.’</p>
<p>Raon recalled those words as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“The black orb with the human shot up into the air while destroying the underground. It was quite a large explosion and destroyed the ceiling of the underground area.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn immediately added on.</p>
<p>“Then the chances of the sculptures still being there are pretty low as we expected.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They wouldn't have destroyed it completely like that if the sculptures were there. But although the chances are low, they could still be there.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn looked at Raon, who was calmly sharing his thoughts, with an odd gaze.</p>
<p>It was the same for Lock.</p>
<p>Raon’s calm demeanor reminded them of a young version of a certain someone.</p>
<p>Raon didn’t know what they were thinking as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>"That is why we will check out that underground area too.”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes turned toward where Alberu, Eruhaben, and the others were fighting in the distance.</p>
<p>The sculptures had originally been in the underground area around that battlefield.</p>
<p>“However.”</p>
<p>There was a building that was on the way back to that battlefield.</p>
<p>His chubby paw pointed at a building.</p>
<p>"We will check out that white castle first!”</p>
<p>It was oddly quiet and there was no light coming out of the building.</p>
<p>The inside was completely quiet, filled with darkness unlike its white exterior.</p>
<p>“That place is the only place that is extremely quiet when such a ruckus is going on outside!”</p>
<p>Raon had seen everything while floating around the black orb.</p>
<p>He had seen the houses of the Endable Kingdom's civilian residents. Those places were quiet chaotic even as they hid away because of the battle.</p>
<p>Light would flash out of the gap between the curtains, windows would be slammed shut, and he had even seen eyes peeking out to see what was going on.</p>
<p>All of them showed signs of life at least once.</p>
<p>But the largest building in the Endable Kingdom that should have a lot of people inside…</p>
<p>That place had oddly been quiet since the battle had started.</p>
<p>He had not seen signs of life even once.</p>
<p>That made no sense.</p>
<p>Unless they were hiding on purpose.</p>
<p>"The human would have suspected a place like that first.”</p>
<p>The white castle was on Raon’s route back to the battlefield.</p>
<p>"We will go to the castle first!”</p>
<p>They headed over.</p>
<p>He felt as if the sculptures would be there for some reason.</p>
<p>Raon recalled something Alberu had mentioned again.</p>
<p>‘Please send a signal as soon as you find the sculptures.</p>
<p>Then our full forces will come to the Endable Kingdom.’</p>
<p>‘At that time… We will grab Cale Henituse and retreat out of the sinkhole.’</p>
<p>Alberu had said that while smiling.</p>
<p>Once they retreat without anybody dying…</p>
<p>‘We will then fight somewhere that is advantageous to us. We will fight safely.’</p>
<p>One corner of Raon's lips twitched before rising up.</p>
<p>This smile looked very similar to a certain someone's smile.</p>
<p>1. In Korean novels, a sprite novel is a refreshing novel where the MC plows through everything while a sweet potato novel is an extremely stuffy one that the MC builds up strength painfully slow. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 610: Even if it takes my last breath 10</p>
<p>Once they were around the white castle…</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes flashed.There are a lot of hidden forces around here.</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Lock closed their mouths.</p>
<p>Lock looked around before pointing to the roof of a building.</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>Rosalyn nodded her head and Lock carried her before jumping onto the roof without making any noise.</p>
<p>Raon followed behind them while continuing to observe the white castle.It would be difficult to go through the main door! It would be easy if we destroy it, but the human said that we need to do things like this stealthily in order to smack people on the back even harder!</p>
<p>Nod nod.</p>
<p>Lock silently nodded while Rosalyn pointed somewhere with a calm expression.Oh! That’s a great spot, smart Rosalyn!</p>
<p>It was one of the numerous windows that had a terrace.</p>
<p>Rosalyn confirmed that nobody was around them before she quietly started to speak.</p>
<p>“That should be the terrace where the White Star’s bathroom is located.”Rosalyn! Did you get some information about the layout of the castle?</p>
<p>“Of course.”You really are smart!</p>
<p>Raon was smiling brightly as he waved his front paw.</p>
<p>Lock and Rosalyn shot up into the air and the three of them quickly headed toward the terrace using flight magic.</p>
<p>‘As expected, this place is suspicious.’</p>
<p>Rosalyn’s eyes were cold as she looked down at the ground.</p>
<p>‘There are many enemy soldiers stealthily hiding around the castle. I see the black knights as well.’</p>
<p>That meant that this place was important.</p>
<p>‘We need to find the sculptures.’</p>
<p>It also meant that the chances of the sculptures being here were high.</p>
<p>‘To be more specific, we need to find the sculptures and the place they plan on conducting the ritual.’</p>
<p>She peeked toward Lock.</p>
<p>He looked calm, unlike his usual self.</p>
<p>‘He’s angry.’</p>
<p>She immediately noticed Lock’s condition.</p>
<p>But she did not say anything.</p>
<p>She was angry as well.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>The three of them landed on the terrace without making much noise.</p>
<p>“There’s nobody inside.”</p>
<p>Lock peeked inside before pushing the terrace window open.</p>
<p>Shhhh.</p>
<p>It opened without making a sound.</p>
<p>They followed Rosalyn out of what they presumed to be the White Star’s bathroom and passed through the hallway while invisible.</p>
<p>All of the doors are closed!</p>
<p>There’s nobody inside the rooms!</p>
<p>…There is nothing on this floor!</p>
<p>Raon’s voice was delivered to their minds as they quickly moved.</p>
<p>There’s nobody here even though there are a lot of people guarding the palace outside. The fact that nobody was in any of the rooms here including the White Star's bathroom meant that…</p>
<p>This place is very suspicious.</p>
<p>And where people are gathered…</p>
<p>Raon nonchalantly commented.That’s where everything will be.</p>
<p>The three of them soon received confirmation that Raon was right.Stop!</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Lock stopped walking as soon as they heard Raon’s voice.</p>
<p>Raon’s ears twitched as he looked off in a direction.</p>
<p>Sniff.</p>
<p>Lock took a sniff before his eyes slowly turned cold and they headed down the staircase toward a place that was slowly becoming visible.</p>
<p>The Grand Assembly hall.</p>
<p>This was the location where Cale had participated in the meeting with the White Star and the Endable Kingdom’s core individuals while disguised as young master Naru.</p>
<p>Crackle, crackle.</p>
<p>There were magic flames burning all around the hallway headed to the hall.</p>
<p>‘There are a large number of them inside.’</p>
<p>There were tens to hundreds of individuals lining up against the walls of the hall.</p>
<p>They consisted of…It’s the Bear tribe! The black knights are there too!</p>
<p>They consisted of humans, Bears, and black knights.Each and every one of them are strong. Of course, they are weaker than one of my snorts! Anyway, it’s obvious that the White Star's core forces are gathered here!</p>
<p>Raon's chubby cheeks were twitching as his eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>Rosalyn started to frown.</p>
<p>‘How do we get closer?’</p>
<p>Based on what she had heard from Duke Fredo, this hallway was the only path to the Grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>‘Would all three of us be able to get past without them noticing?’</p>
<p>They were currently invisible, but the enemies were still tightly guarding the hallway.</p>
<p>A small mistake might cause a big issue.</p>
<p>She could see Lock looking at her.</p>
<p>Lock silently mouthed something to her.</p>
<p>‘I will go take a look.’</p>
<p>He determined that it would be best for him to go since he was the swiftest.</p>
<p>However, Rosalyn shook her head.</p>
<p>‘If someone goes, it should be me.’</p>
<p>Raon had to stay behind just in case something happened, leaving her as the person who could react the most fluidly regardless of the situation based on her experiences.</p>
<p>Lock bit down on his lips after seeing Rosalyn’s gaze.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>A chubby paw tapped both of their shoulders.I truly am great and mighty!</p>
<p>It was Raon.</p>
<p>Raon pointed toward somewhere.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rosalyn, what room is above the Grand assembly hall?</p>
<p>‘Perhaps?’</p>
<p>As Rosalyn’s eyes clouded over…</p>
<p>Raon confidently puffed up his chubby tummy as he continued to speak.Let’s create a small hole on the floor of that room! It should be doable without them noticing! We can look down through the hole!</p>
<p>We should be able to look inside the Grand assembly hall that way.</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>The corners of Raon’s mouth curled up.I learned it from our human! Hehe!</p>
<p>Raon triumphantly continued to speak.We will then gather everything we need before destroying the ceiling! Then we don't need to do something as annoying as fighting them as we move through this hallway!</p>
<p>Lock started to move and all three of them quickly headed back upstairs.</p>
<p>They were using a different route then when they came down but Rosalyn’s information helped them quickly move close to the room they believed to be above the grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>‘…As expected.’</p>
<p>The room presumed to be above the Grand assembly hall…</p>
<p>The door to that room was wide open, unlike the other rooms.</p>
<p>There were some knights and Bears inside as well.</p>
<p>Rosalyn stealthily entered the room.</p>
<p>‘They were more thorough than I expected.’</p>
<p>The White Star would not normally station soldiers here as well.</p>
<p>‘We need to first knock them unconscious-’</p>
<p>Rosalyn suddenly stopped walking.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>It was because the door closed and the room was cut off from the outside.I closed it!</p>
<p>It was Raon's magic.</p>
<p>"What-?!”</p>
<p>A Bear was knocked unconscious as soon as it started to speak.</p>
<p>Lock had done it.</p>
<p>Red mana gathered around Rosalyn's hand as soon as she saw that. Raon started to move as well.</p>
<p>Plop. Plop. Plop.</p>
<p>Inside the silent room…</p>
<p>Tens of Bears and knights all fell to the ground one by one without being able to say anything.</p>
<p>The regular Bears and knights who were not at the Bear King's level could not stop the ambush from these three individuals.</p>
<p>Once Raon, Lock, and Rosalyn were the only ones left standing…I kept one conscious but covered his mouth!</p>
<p>“I guess we can talk now.”</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>The gagged Bear looked around while looking at his fallen comrades with shaking pupils.</p>
<p>The Bear started to sweat.</p>
<p>“Well, we can ask our questions later.”</p>
<p>He couldn't see anybody but he could hear voices as his allies fell one by one.</p>
<p>It must be people from Cale Henituse's side. All he could do was shake in fear as he could not see them, his mouth was covered, and his limbs were tied up.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p>There was a quiet noise before three holes were created on the floor.</p>
<p>They were very small.</p>
<p>The holes were only the size of a person's pinky.</p>
<p>‘What is that?! I need to hurry up and report these things!’</p>
<p>The Bear slowly moved away from the three holes in fear.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Something hit him from behind at that moment.</p>
<p>“Don’t move. Unless you wish to die.”</p>
<p>The Bear stopped moving after hearing a woman’s vicious voice.</p>
<p>Swish, swish, swish.</p>
<p>It was because he could see the bodies of his fainted allies being thrown into a corner of the room and piling up like a mountain.</p>
<p>The problem was that he could not see the individual who was strong enough to throw them like that.</p>
<p>“All done! Someone as great and mighty as me has no problem stealthily creating holes like this!”</p>
<p>The woman's vicious voice and the individual throwing his allies’ bodies aside all stopped after hearing an excited child’s voice.</p>
<p>This situation made the Bear shake even more but Raon, Rosalyn, and Lock did not care.</p>
<p>Rosalyn slowly crouched down and looked through the hole Raon had created.</p>
<p>Underneath the small hole…</p>
<p>She could see the inside of the Grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>Rosalyn heard someone gasp in shock next to her.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>Raon was looking inside before urgently raising his head to look at Lock.</p>
<p>But Rosalyn did not react.</p>
<p>“…As I expected.”</p>
<p>She just started to frown while looking down.</p>
<p>The Grand Assembly hall.</p>
<p>A large number of enemies were stationed inside that room.</p>
<p>Warriors, swordsmen, archers, mages…</p>
<p>The core of the White Star’s forces was all stationed here.</p>
<p>‘The Bear King and the Lion King.’</p>
<p>She could see the two of them as well.</p>
<p>And at the center of the assembly hall…</p>
<p>There were eight sculptures.</p>
<p>They looked exactly as Alberu had described them.</p>
<p>There was also something else.</p>
<p>Raon looked toward Lock and started to shout.</p>
<p>“This is weird! Why are there children……?!”</p>
<p>On top of the altar with the sculptures…</p>
<p>There were unconscious children who were chained up.</p>
<p>“T, they look like children of the Wolf tribe!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn clenched her eyes shut after hearing Raon speaking anxiously.</p>
<p>‘I didn't inform Raon-nim because he is still young, but I will tell the two of you just in case.’</p>
<p>Rosalyn recalled what Alberu had told her.</p>
<p>‘Duke Fredo told me something.’</p>
<p>She saw that Alberu was talking to her but his gaze had been focused on Lock who had been awkwardly sitting down.</p>
<p>That let her know that Lock was the focus of this conversation.</p>
<p>‘He said that the White Star gathered seeds that have been disowned by the gods.’</p>
<p>Lock, who had been finding it awkward to be in the palace, had turned toward Alberu as soon as he had heard that.</p>
<p>Races that have been disowned by the gods.</p>
<p>The Wolf tribe was one of those races.</p>
<p>That was why they could neither use potions from the temples nor any items infused with the power of the gods.</p>
<p>Whether it was Vampires, Dark Elves, etc…</p>
<p>There was a god that opposed each of these special races.</p>
<p>Those races were said to be disowned or despised by those gods. That was why they were weak against that god’s divine items.</p>
<p>But there were only a few races that were disowned by all gods.</p>
<p>‘I heard from Cale. He said that Arm attacked the Blue Wolf tribe at one point. They killed the adults and tried to run off with the children.’</p>
<p>That was a memory Lock could never forget.</p>
<p>That was when he had lost his family and the others in his village, with Maes and around ten or so other children being the only survivors.</p>
<p>It was all thanks to Choi Han and Rosalyn… As well as Cale and his other new family members.</p>
<p>‘Apparently, those attacks happened to Wolf tribes all around the Western and Eastern continents and not just to the Blue Wolf tribe. The White Star was gathering people disowned by the gods, especially children.’</p>
<p>Lock's complexion had turned pale after hearing that.</p>
<p>‘Lock.’</p>
<p>Alberu had firmly grabbed Lock's shoulder at that moment.</p>
<p>That was the first time Alberu had spoken directly to Lock and been so close to him.</p>
<p>‘Lock, there are Wolves that are still alive.’</p>
<p>Lock had suddenly felt his back go cold before he had snapped out of it.</p>
<p>‘They are the ones Duke Fredo managed to secretly save. He moved independently to steal away some of these ‘seeds’ from the White Star. He said that there are about five tribes or so.’</p>
<p>Duke Fredo could not easily stash away more than that. Saving five tribes had already been his limit.</p>
<p>‘Furthermore, Fredo modified the information they had, making it so that Arm did not know about some of the tribes. I'm sure that they are all lying low while waiting. They will come to the Endable Kingdom immediately once Duke Fredo contacts them.’</p>
<p>Rosalyn raised her head.</p>
<p>She was still thinking about what Alberu had said to Lock.</p>
<p>‘Duke Fredo said he doesn't know why they are called seeds. It seemed like the Chief Priest knows about it, so we believe it might be related to the sculptures.’</p>
<p>She could see Lock in front of her.</p>
<p>His fists were clenched so hard that his hands had turned white.</p>
<p>Lock looked the same as he had looked while talking to Alberu at that time.</p>
<p>‘I hope you can help us rescue the captured Wolf children. You know the most about Wolves among all of us.’</p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>Bluish silver fur was growing on Lock’s hands.</p>
<p>He was going berserk silently while being filled with anger.</p>
<p>Rosalyn looked at him and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Sculptures located.”</p>
<p>Once Raon turned toward Rosalyn…</p>
<p>“I'm shooting the signal flare.”</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>“We will immediately destroy the ceiling and infiltrate before stealing the sculptures and saving the Wolf children.”</p>
<p>Raon immediately channeled his black mana.</p>
<p>His shock was slowly being replaced with rage.</p>
<p>“I will destroy the ceiling!”</p>
<p>As the angry dark blue eyes looked down at the ground…</p>
<p>Raon could see Lock slowly starting to get up.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim, I will destroy it.”</p>
<p>Raon could feel a calm but violent emotion roaring inside Lock.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim, please protect the children.”</p>
<p>Lock’s finger pointed down.</p>
<p>“Please put a shield around the altar with the sculptures and the children so that the enemies cannot get to them.”</p>
<p>Raon happily agreed to do as Lock asked.</p>
<p>“Sure! Lock, we will do as you say!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn started to speak as soon as their conversation ended.</p>
<p>“Then I will shoot it now.”</p>
<p>Red mana gathered around both of Rosalyn’s hands.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>The Bear curled up in fear once again after seeing the red mana that looked as if it would explode.</p>
<p>“Ugh. Just what-”</p>
<p>“When did I lose consciousness?!”</p>
<p>The moment the enemies who had become conscious because of the roaring mana saw the dark red mana…</p>
<p>“Here I go.”</p>
<p>The large Wolf man’s fist slammed down on the ground.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p>
<p>A loud explosion that made them question if Lock had always been this strong echoed in the area.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>“The ground, the ground is breaking!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The enemies who had returned to their senses started to scream that enemies had appeared…</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The ceiling above them broke this time as a red flame shot up.</p>
<p>A fancy signal flare shot out of the white castle and into the sky.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The debris from the destroyed ceiling started to fall into the Grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>But they could not touch the altar with the sculptures and the children.</p>
<p>“My shield is the best!”</p>
<p>Raon's black shield was firmly covering the altar with the sculptures and the children.</p>
<p>“Shit! Everybody, prepare to attack!”</p>
<p>One of the enemies shouted as Rosalyn slowly descended.</p>
<p>She had stopped being invisible at some point. Her eyes focused on a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>He was Dorph, the Lion King.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse's allies are here as we expected. I presume you are the mage, Rosalyn?”</p>
<p>But there was someone who landed before Rosalyn and Raon.</p>
<p>He also stopped being invisible.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>The individual who landed with a noise that made it seem as if he was very heavy slowly stood his tall body up straight.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to look at my sister nor know her name.”</p>
<p>Lock hand landed in front of Raon's black shield.</p>
<p>“You will all die here today.”</p>
<p>He said that while looking at the Lion King and all of the enemies inside this large assembly hall.</p>
<p>He then reached his hand out.</p>
<p>A bracelet that looked similar to the white necklace on Raon's neck was around Lock's arm.</p>
<p>It was the present Lord Sheritt had given to her disciple who was going to a big battle and to save his race.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>They heard the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>Both of Lock's arms moved at the same time.</p>
<p>Something appeared in his two hands.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A large shield that suddenly appeared slammed down on the grand assembly hall's floor.</p>
<p>Lock and his shield…</p>
<p>They resembled a mountain.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is the end.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn elegantly landed next to Lock.</p>
<p>She smiled as she continued to speak quietly as if she was whispering.</p>
<p>“Our allies will come.”</p>
<p>One of the enemies who had raised his head started to shout.</p>
<p>“I, in the sky, there are s, skeletons-!”</p>
<p>In between night and day…</p>
<p>As the short period of dawn quickly passed by…</p>
<p>They could see through the destroyed ceiling that there were white things that were gathering around the red signal flare that was burning like the sun.</p>
<p>Bones.</p>
<p>They were skeletons.</p>
<p>There were also black threads connecting all of those skeleton monsters.</p>
<p>The enemies thought of a single person once they saw the threads.</p>
<p>“…Necromancer……!”</p>
<p>The skeleton monsters covered the sky.</p>
<p>There was a black skeleton wyvern with bright black eyes at the starting point of these threads.</p>
<p>The master of this skeleton monster army was on top of that skeleton wyvern’s back.</p>
<p>Mary.</p>
<p>She was here.</p>
<p>She was one of their allies who had come after seeing the signal flare.</p>
<p>There was a video communication device in Mary’s hand.</p>
<p>She looked down.</p>
<p>She could see the spear knight in black armor.</p>
<p>That spear knight raised his head and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Mary could tell that he was looking at her, although the helmet prevented her from seeing his face.</p>
<p>There should be a video communication device inside the spear knight’s armor as well.</p>
<p>The spear knight… Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>His voice traveled through the video communication device to the video communication device in Mary’s hand.</p>
<p>“Drag it up!”</p>
<p>Drag it up.</p>
<p>Alberu had to defend against the White Star’s sword as soon as he shouted that.</p>
<p>“These bastards!”</p>
<p>The White Star started to look anxious.</p>
<p>He seemed to have realized the purpose of this Flying Skeleton Brigade and the black threads.</p>
<p>Mary’s masterpiece looked like a large moving net.</p>
<p>The thing that this net would drag up…</p>
<p>There was only one thing.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up.</p>
<p>He shouted once more.</p>
<p>“We will grab Cale Henituse and fly away!”</p>
<p>They were not just stealing the sculptures.</p>
<p>The black orb with Cale…</p>
<p>They would take that with them too.</p>
<p>Whether the sealed god made it or not, wasn’t it just finders keepers?</p>
<p>Furthermore, why would they fight here in the enemy territory?</p>
<p>They would take away the important things and fight somewhere advantageous for their allies.</p>
<p>Mary started to speak.</p>
<p>“I understand. That sounds great.”</p>
<p>The black net headed toward the black orb with the Flying Skeleton Brigade at that moment. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 611: Even if it takes my last breath 11</p>
<p>“…That……”</p>
<p>Over half of the White Star's face was covered, but his expression was clearly visible.</p>
<p>“You’re going to lug that away…? Right now?”</p>
<p>He looked shocked and full of disbelief.</p>
<p>The tip of a white spear was pointed toward him.</p>
<p>The owner of the spear was smiling as he responded.</p>
<p>“Yes. Right now. Right in front of your eyes.”</p>
<p>“…Ha!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? I can’t do that?”</p>
<p>Although Alberu’s face was covered by the helmet as he tilted his head to the side…You said it very well so that it sounds annoying, sir.</p>
<p>It was as Taerang said.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu just snorted.</p>
<p>‘There’s no reason I can’t do that. Who cares if the black orb is the sealed god's? Will I face a god's rage if I steal it? So what?’</p>
<p>He just had to take care of that anger as well.</p>
<p>Why would he care about a god’s rage when he had every intention of smacking the back of a god's head?</p>
<p>‘It’s better than struggling to fight here while protecting Cale Henituse.’</p>
<p>They needed to protect this black orb for the whole day.</p>
<p>Why would they fight a difficult battle here in enemy territory while protecting the black orb?</p>
<p>‘What if someone gets hurt while we do that?’</p>
<p>Alberu found it difficult to fight against the White Star right now with both Cale and Choi Han not being here.</p>
<p>‘Although I came here not as the crown prince but as his sworn brother…’</p>
<p>It didn't change the fact that he was Alberu Crossman. He was the crown prince of the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>He was sure that one of the White Star’s subordinates had contacted the other kingdoms on the Eastern continent to inform them that the Roan Kingdom’s crown prince has invaded the Endable Kingdom the moment he appeared.</p>
<p>The kingdoms of the Eastern continent that have created an alliance were bound to show some kind of gesture as a result.</p>
<p>They would either send reinforcements to the Endable Kingdom or put pressure on the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>‘That is why this is a fight against time.’</p>
<p>Both sides were in a fight against time right now.</p>
<p>‘This battle will become more difficult for us the longer we stay here. On the other hand, the enemies will benefit the longer they keep us here.’</p>
<p>In that case, it was better to take it and run.</p>
<p>‘We will head back to the Roan Kingdom on the Western continent.’</p>
<p>That was a place where Alberu Crossman would have the upper hand over the White Star and be extremely strong even without fighting.</p>
<p>‘But to give that up and fight here? Why? Why make it difficult for ourselves? We need to head to a safe spot first if all of us are to survive.’</p>
<p>Cale had the same thoughts that Alberu was having.</p>
<p>‘My goodness. My dongsaeng and I have very similar thoughts in this regard.’</p>
<p>That was why he didn’t want to let Cale be a slacker in the future.</p>
<p>He wanted to keep Cale next to him as a Prime Minister or a Commander.</p>
<p>‘But I'll still make sure to let him be a slacker. That unlucky bastard. I can at least do that much for him.’</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang---!</p>
<p>Through the hole in the white castle created from the signal flare…</p>
<p>White light burst out of that hole and shot up into the air.</p>
<p>A black aura followed behind it.</p>
<p>‘Those are?!’</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown.</p>
<p>He was sure that they were the powers of light and darkness used by the Lion King and the Bear King.</p>
<p>The two of their powers were headed toward Mary’s Flying Skeleton Brigade and her black threads.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>But Alberu was still smiling.</p>
<p>As the light and darkness shot up…</p>
<p>“I've been expecting this.”</p>
<p>Mary’s robe started to flutter.</p>
<p>A thoroughly woven spider web that was not the net to grab the black orb appeared and crashed into the light and darkness as if it was a shield.</p>
<p>It was as if the dead mana net was falling down to suppress the light and darkness from above.</p>
<p>Alberu knew how strong this net that did not look very sturdy actually was.</p>
<p>‘He said that she was as strong as Choi Han.’</p>
<p>This necromancer was said to be able to defeat Choi Han five out of ten battles.</p>
<p>She was said to be the strongest warrior but just had not had the right conditions to fight properly.</p>
<p>‘That’s what Cale Henituse told me.’</p>
<p>Cale had said that they must bring Mary with them to the large-scale battle against the White Star on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>‘The necromancer wanted it as well.’</p>
<p>She had wanted to fight.</p>
<p>She had been preparing for three months to fight.</p>
<p>Of course, Mary was not strong enough to take on both the Lion King and the Bear King at the same time.</p>
<p>That was why that net shield would not be able to block both powers.</p>
<p>But Alberu knew what would happen.</p>
<p>He knew that another strong individual would finally start to unleash her power.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang---!</p>
<p>The net shield… The moment it crashed into the light and darkness…</p>
<p>Alberu could see a red strand of light shooting up from below.</p>
<p>It looked like fire. No, this light shot up like a radiant sun as it shot up to attack the light and the darkness.</p>
<p>‘…Rosalyn!’</p>
<p>It was Rosalyn’s power.</p>
<p>Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip-!</p>
<p>The black net shield started to rip.</p>
<p>The radiant red mana disappeared as well.</p>
<p>However, the light and darkness had disappeared after being suppressed from above and below at the same time.</p>
<p>“I am going back to grabbing it.”</p>
<p>Mary's Flying Skeleton Brigade and net quickly started to move toward the black orb again.</p>
<p>The Bear King was watching this from inside the white castle.</p>
<p>“My goodness. They planned quite an interesting show.”</p>
<p>Bear King Sayeru turned toward Rosalyn as he sarcastically said that.</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>The aftershock of the explosion removed Rosalyn's hood at that moment.</p>
<p>Flutter-</p>
<p>They could see a necklace once the hood was removed.</p>
<p>It was a large and funny looking necklace that looked as if a child had tied large pieces of candy together to play around.</p>
<p>But their expressions stiffened once they saw the necklace.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the black mages stationed inside the castle.</p>
<p>“H, holy shit-!”</p>
<p>“Magic stones-, how can she have highest-grade magic stones around her neck like that?!”</p>
<p>The funny-looking things on the necklace that resembled large pieces of candy were all highest-grade magic stones.</p>
<p>They were all the best of the best highest-grade magic stones at that.</p>
<p>Rosalyn had an elegant smile on her face.</p>
<p>Alberu had told her something yesterday.</p>
<p>‘That is what Cale told me. ‘What is the point of saving them? Are you going to eat them?’ …He’s such a disrespectful little punk.’</p>
<p>‘I guess it makes sense to use them rather than to eat them as he mentioned.’</p>
<p>This accessory of hers was something she liked more than anything else. She caressed the highest-grade magic stone necklace as she gracefully started to speak.</p>
<p>“I can fight without worrying about money because the Roan crown is supporting me like this.”</p>
<p>This was actually from Alberu’s personal fortune.</p>
<p>He had called it an emergency fund for potential situations that may arise.</p>
<p>Because of that…</p>
<p>“I should do it properly, right?”</p>
<p>A light shot toward her as she said that.</p>
<p>“I will make you shut that damn mouth of yours!”</p>
<p>It was Sayeru's light arrow.</p>
<p>But Rosalyn quickly saw someone’s shadow.</p>
<p>It was Lock.</p>
<p>“…No way.”</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>A large spear appeared in front of Rosalyn and blocked the light.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>There was white smoke coming from the large shield once the explosion settled, but it did not even have a scratch.</p>
<p>It deserved to be a magic shield created by Lord Sheritt for defense.</p>
<p>The Wolf holding that shield was now charging toward Bear King Sayeru.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>The ground shook every time he took a step.</p>
<p>It was to be expected as this already bulky body was holding a large spear as well.</p>
<p>“Move! I will take care of this bastard!”</p>
<p>Sayeru shouted and the enemy troops quickly stepped back.</p>
<p>“Ugh! His strength-”</p>
<p>“Step back! You can’t let him slam into you!”</p>
<p>Of course, there were already individuals who had been sent flying by the shield.</p>
<p>Lock's strength was close to being Herculean Strength.</p>
<p>But Lock didn’t care about anything else as he was focused strictly on Sayeru.</p>
<p>‘I am filled with strength right now.’</p>
<p>Of course, he had noticed that his body was oddly filled with a ton of strength right now.</p>
<p>Was it because of all of the training he had done with Lord Sheritt until now?</p>
<p>Was it from his anger about why it had to be the Wolf tribe that suffered such terrible misfortunes?</p>
<p>If it was neither of those, then was it because of his desperation to save everyone?</p>
<p>Lock didn’t know the answer and just focused on what Rosalyn had quietly whispered to him during that last short explosion.</p>
<p>‘We pretend to fight and then retreat. You remember, right?’</p>
<p>He knew.</p>
<p>‘The important thing right now is to save everyone.’</p>
<p>Of course he knew.</p>
<p>‘And smacking them from the back. You know what I mean, right?’</p>
<p>He knew very well and he liked it very much.</p>
<p>It was a plan that made it seem as if young master Cale was with them even though he wasn't.</p>
<p>Peek.</p>
<p>Lock could see brightly burning red mana heading toward the Lion King.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man… Dorph was stepping forward to take on Rosalyn.</p>
<p>Rosalyn saw him and stoically commented.</p>
<p>“I heard that you use a Darkness Elemental? Hmm. Well, I guess I’ll take it on.”</p>
<p>It was to be expected of his older sister.</p>
<p>Lock almost chuckled after hearing Rosalyn's calm voice.</p>
<p>But he could not laugh.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>They were each taking on the Bear King and the Lion King respectively, but there were many other strong individuals in here as well.</p>
<p>There were so many that he couldn't even count all of them.</p>
<p>“We must destroy the black shield! That is our number one priority!”</p>
<p>It was a knight on top of a black horse.</p>
<p>It was the Black Knight, Count Hubesha.</p>
<p>There was the old Dark Elf that had left to take over the black castle in the Forest of Darkness… This woman was the other Count other than Count Mock.</p>
<p>She continued to shout while pointing toward the black shield as numerous attacks were already heading toward it.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Lock started to frown.</p>
<p>Raon might be a Dragon but this was an endless volley of attacks.</p>
<p>‘Will Raon-nim be able to deal with this situation?’</p>
<p>The moment Lock had that question…Hey Rosalyn, Lock! Can you see it? I truly am a great and mighty Dragon! My shield is as strong as our human’s shield! Hehe! I’ll create a teleportation magic circle to transfer the children before stealing the sculptures!</p>
<p>Lock ended up chuckling after hearing Raon’s calm voice that resembled a certain someone.</p>
<p>And then he was certain.</p>
<p>‘Everybody will do a good job.’</p>
<p>Lock started to think about the others who should be fighting outside the palace.</p>
<p>As for one of those other allies…</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Alberu had a thick smile on his face as he watched the White Star rush past him.</p>
<p>The White Star was not attacking him.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re in a rush?”</p>
<p>“I have no more time to play around with you!”</p>
<p>The White Star started to frown after hearing Alberu’s mocking tone and kicked off the ground.</p>
<p>Crackle-</p>
<p>He then swung his fire sword once he was in the air.</p>
<p>Fire shot forward from the sword as if it was a boomerang.</p>
<p>It was naturally headed toward Mary.</p>
<p>“I will block it.”</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>A black wyvern’s tail smashed into the fire boomerang.</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack.</p>
<p>The majority of the tailbone crumbled and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>As the White Star started to smile in response…</p>
<p>Mary’s hand showed itself from underneath the robe. On her hand that looked as if black threads were creating a painting on it… Her thumb and index finger snapped together without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>Many things started to appear through the Endable Kingdom's sinkhole along with that quiet noise.</p>
<p>“I have many more.”</p>
<p>Black skeleton wyverns that had yet to fly up were looking down into the sinkhole ready to flap their wings at any moment.</p>
<p>They looked as if they were considering the White Star to be prey that they could hunt at any moment.</p>
<p>“All I need to do is destroy them.”</p>
<p>The smile on the White Star's face did not disappear.</p>
<p>The fire sword started to swing all around him.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>Numerous fire boomerangs appeared and started to charge toward the net from multiple directions.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Mary immediately sent the black skeleton wyverns flying to block the fire boomerangs.</p>
<p>“Keke.”</p>
<p>The White Star sneered at her before twisting his body mid-air and heading toward the black orb that was surrounded by Eruhaben's gold shield.</p>
<p>His eyes were quickly moving around to locate Eruhaben, whom he had not been able to locate since a few moments ago. His feet were quickly moving toward Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>‘It doesn’t matter where the ancient Dragon is located.’</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>His hand clenched tightly around his sword.</p>
<p>He was giving off the will to slash through that shield and black orb at any moment.</p>
<p>“It might make things a little more difficult, but even if it means we need to make some changes to our plans…”</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>“I will kill Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>“Says who?”</p>
<p>He heard Alberu Crossman's voice below him.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>The White Star responded while laughing.</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman could not defeat him if he used his full strength.</p>
<p>That was why he didn’t need to pay much attention to Alberu.</p>
<p>“Hmm. It’s not a good idea to ignore me.”</p>
<p>He heard Alberu’s voice again but just ignored it.</p>
<p>There was no need to listen to him as he was in a rush.</p>
<p>The White Star’s body headed toward the black orb without any hesitation.</p>
<p>He was only wary of a surprise attack from the ancient Dragon, Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Yes, that was what he had thought.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The White Star let out a grown.</p>
<p>His gaze headed down.</p>
<p>He looked toward his right foot.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-!</p>
<p>There was a white chain wrapped around his ankle.</p>
<p>It felt as if it was trying to squeeze his ankle until it exploded.</p>
<p>"Where-?!”</p>
<p>Where had such an attack come from?</p>
<p>‘I didn't even feel any mana nor anything!’</p>
<p>The White Star's eyes followed the chain until he saw a black helmet.</p>
<p>He could also see the white spear in the black armored person’s hand.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The white spear…</p>
<p>The head of the spear had split open and released the chain.You are finally using me, sir.</p>
<p>Taerang’s voice was still emotionless, but it sounded oddly happy.</p>
<p>Taerang continued to speak to Alberu.</p>
<p>The Unbreakable Spear. I will show you the perfect form of the ‘Omnipotent Weapon,’ the first of my three special abilities.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman-nim.</p>
<p>As long as you wish, any weapon in this world… No, please let me correct myself. You are able to use any weapon that exists on Earth 3.</p>
<p>Alberu pulled the spear.</p>
<p>That made the chain tighten around the White Star’s ankle, making him unable to move.Sir, as you already know… A human without any weaknesses will always win. This weapon that cannot be ranked… This EX-Grade Unbreakable Spear will turn you into a warrior without any weaknesses.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up more with everything Taerang said to him.</p>
<p>He pulled the White Star’s ankle as he nonchalantly commented.</p>
<p>“Like I would let you do as you please.”</p>
<p>There was no way he would let that happen.</p>
<p>If anything was going to happen…</p>
<p>“We have to do things as I please.”</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman had a smile on his face that Raon would call wicked if he saw it. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 612: Even if it takes my last breath 12</p>
<p>HIs actions did not just stop with a smile.</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>The White Star could see the chain pulling his ankle down.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>The White Star let out a short sigh.</p>
<p>It was because he saw Alberu pulling the chain.</p>
<p>“You want to battle against me with physical strength? …Did you really just say that?”</p>
<p>He raised his hand with a smile of disbelief.</p>
<p>His subordinates responded to his signal.</p>
<p>"Attack! Support our liege!”</p>
<p>The black mages gathered together used magic to lift some warriors and archers into the air.</p>
<p>The other warriors and Dark Elves set up a formation to protect the mages.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>“Protect the mages from the Molan Household and the Mercenary King!”</p>
<p>Beacrox and Bud…</p>
<p>The swordsman holding a greatsword and the swordsman with blue aura were rushing toward them.</p>
<p>“Be cautious of the assassin!”</p>
<p>There was also the assassin who was so stealthy that they had not even seen him once. Ron Molan was coming for their lives.</p>
<p>The black mages, who were now protected by the warriors, started to cast attack-type magic spells.</p>
<p>"Attack!”</p>
<p>One person shouted loudly and numerous attack spells shot up into the air.</p>
<p>“Our focus is the necromancer's monsters!”</p>
<p>Mary responded at that moment.</p>
<p>"That is an error in judgment.”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>Sniff.</p>
<p>The Mercenary King took a short sniff.</p>
<p>“Wow, so strong.”</p>
<p>As me quietly mumbled that…</p>
<p>Mary motioned to her skeleton wyverns.</p>
<p>“This level of attack is light.”</p>
<p>Black threads stretched out in the shape of music staves and her monsters started to move on top of them as if they were the notes.</p>
<p>They would be making up the introduction if this was actually a song.</p>
<p>“It is a completely error in judgment if you believe this is enough to defeat me.”</p>
<p>Three months.</p>
<p>Mary was used to waiting and pain, but… It had been a very long time.</p>
<p>It was because her heart had been hurting.</p>
<p>That was why she used that time very efficiently.</p>
<p>These past three months were enough for her to absorb all of the dead mana she had gathered while moving around with Cale and make it hers.</p>
<p>“I am strong.”</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>One of the white wyverns’ tail split an attack spell in half.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Another wyvern's sharp claws blocked an archer’s arrow and of course, killed the archer.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>One large wyvern’s body descended to the ground.</p>
<p>Its jaws that were made of bones opened to reveal its sharp fangs as Bud started to shout with joy.</p>
<p>"Sweep them away!”</p>
<p>It happened exactly as he had said.</p>
<p>The skeleton wyvern headed toward the enemies following the black thread, following the will of its master.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooar!”</p>
<p>"Dodge it! Protect the mages!”</p>
<p>“Fuck, there are more coming down!”</p>
<p>The White Star's subordinates looked up after hearing a shout.</p>
<p>The sky was getting brighter as night was ending and morning was coming.</p>
<p>It looked as if there were black stars falling to the ground.</p>
<p>There were not too many of them.</p>
<p>The problem was that they were not stars… They were ugly and fearsome skeleton monsters. In addition, they were all huge.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Once another monster descended on the ground…</p>
<p>“I'm going first.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Beacrox rushed past Bud and got on top of a wyvern.</p>
<p>His greatsword than started to swing nonstop on top of the skeleton wyvern that was causing a ruckus.</p>
<p>“Such a cool idea……!”</p>
<p>Bud gasped at seeing Beacrox’s hardcore actions before jumping on top of a skeleton wyvern as well, making it twice as chaotic.</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-!”</p>
<p>The White Star started to laugh while looking down at what was going on. He was laughing in disbelief.</p>
<p>He looked toward Mary and started to speak.</p>
<p>“You prepared quite a lot of skeleton monsters.”</p>
<p>Swish.</p>
<p>Mary turned her head toward the White Star and responded in a GPS-like voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to pay any attention to someone like you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>As the White Star started to frown…</p>
<p>“It’s because I'm here.”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-!</p>
<p>Alberu pulled the spear and the chain with both hands.</p>
<p>The White Star’s body staggered and he started to move downward.</p>
<p>“You wish to go up against me in a battle of physical strength?”</p>
<p>The White Star’s gaze changed.</p>
<p>“How laughable.”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p>The White Star grabbed the white chain around his ankle.</p>
<p>He then pulled.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes instantly opened wide at his opponent’s strength he could feel through the chain.</p>
<p>The chain was extremely taut and not moving in either direction.</p>
<p>Alberu looked out through his helmet and made eye contact with the White Star.</p>
<p>The White Star started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“I am removing the restriction.”</p>
<p>The White Star pulled on the chain once again after saying that.</p>
<p>“How-?!”</p>
<p>‘How could he be so strong?!’</p>
<p>The taut chain started to move toward the White Star as Alberu felt as if he was being swept by a large wave.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Alberu could feel his body being lifted up into the air.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t know there would be such a huge difference in strength!’</p>
<p>Alberu couldn't do anything once the White Star started to use his true strength.Oh my.</p>
<p>Taerang started to quietly speak as if it was mumbling.It seems as if using the chains to fight was a mistake, sir. Alberu Crossman-nim, you are weak.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>As Alberu started to frown…</p>
<p>The White Star started to swing the chain with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“I think you should get some air.”</p>
<p>The chain floated up into the air and made a large arc.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu's body followed the chain through the arc and the sinkhole’s wall was at the end of the arc.</p>
<p>Although it was called a wall, it was where the homes of the Endable Kingdom’s residents were located.</p>
<p>‘I'm going to crash into those buildings at this rate!’</p>
<p>It looked like an obvious conclusion for Alberu to crash into those buildings since he could not let go of his spear.</p>
<p>“Ugh, withdraw!”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The White Star could see the chain in his hands instantly get smaller and escape his grip as soon as Alberu shouted.</p>
<p>The White Star laughed and turned his head after seeing that.</p>
<p>“You’re next.”</p>
<p>He then started to head toward Mary.</p>
<p>The White Star was moving much quicker than earlier as he approached her.</p>
<p>Crackle-</p>
<p>The sword in his hand was crackling like magma, looking much more dangerous than earlier, as if it would destroy anything it touched.</p>
<p>“It’s much better now.”</p>
<p>The White Star said that before stabbing his sword toward Mary’s net.</p>
<p>Red fire shot out of the tip of the sword.</p>
<p>“…This.”</p>
<p>Mary’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>Her net would reach the black orb soon. A red arrow that was much stronger than the fire boomerang from earlier was headed toward her.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was too big to be considered an arrow.</p>
<p>It felt as if a large snake monster was approaching her.</p>
<p>“You’re finally stopping.”</p>
<p>The White Star smiled at the stiff Mary who had stopped moving.</p>
<p>But he then started to frown.</p>
<p>“You motherfucking old ass Dragon!”</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>In front of Mary…</p>
<p>Gold dust was starting to gather in front of Mary.</p>
<p>That gold light…</p>
<p>It symbolized the appearance of a Dragon.</p>
<p>“Yes. I am that motherfucking Dragon.”</p>
<p>A gold shield appeared in front of the fire arrow.</p>
<p>Baaaaang---!</p>
<p>The fire arrow exploded with a loud noise. The fire spread out around the gold shield and started to make it crack, but it could not get past the shield.</p>
<p>Eruhaben appeared once the shield disappeared.</p>
<p>“Wow, you’re attacking again immediately?”</p>
<p>He shook his head while looking at the White Star who was rushing through the explosion toward him.</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked as if he was fooling around, but his gaze was serious.</p>
<p>‘…I can't use my full strength.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben was not using his strength in case he needed it for an emergency.</p>
<p>Everybody, including Eruhaben, had to survive.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Gold dust was surrounding his body.</p>
<p>Smile. The White Star made a comment while charging toward Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“I guess you can't use your full strength right now.”</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>The tip of his fire sword pointed at Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s time for you to die?”</p>
<p>“I always wonder whether today or tomorrow might be my last.”</p>
<p>The two of them were lightly chatting with each other but the powers surrounding them were getting much stronger.</p>
<p>The White Star's fire sword was so strong now that just pointing forward was making the air around it fluctuate.</p>
<p>The White Star had a thick smile on his face as he raised his sword.</p>
<p>He would soon kill this old Dragon.</p>
<p>‘Good.’</p>
<p>He could use this bastard as a sacrifice as well.</p>
<p>Crackle-</p>
<p>The fire that was now turning from red to black shot up into the air.</p>
<p>That fire would soon head toward Eruhaben.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Tang-!</p>
<p>The White Star heard an unfamiliar sound behind his back.</p>
<p>It was a quiet sound.</p>
<p>He would normally ignore such a thing.</p>
<p>‘…I don’t feel any mana or aura!’</p>
<p>But the sound was too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>He could also hear something cutting through the wind.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>The White Star ended up turning around and swinging the sword toward the direction of the noise.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>Something slammed into the sword and exploded once it touched the fire.</p>
<p>The White Star lowered his sword.</p>
<p>He could see another black skeleton wyvern.</p>
<p>And on top of that wyvern…</p>
<p>“You need to watch an attack to its end.”</p>
<p>Alberu had said that while smiling.</p>
<p>And in his hand…</p>
<p>"What is that?”</p>
<p>Was a weapon that the White Star had never seen before.</p>
<p>Although it couldn’t create all of the weapons from this world, but if it was from the other side… The Unbreakable Spear could create any weapon from Earth 3.</p>
<p>Alberu didn't know about all of the different weapons on Earth 3.</p>
<p>However, there had been quite a lot of weapons he saw in Cale’s Earth as the Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>There was one weapon that was new to him that he liked quite a lot.</p>
<p>Click. Click.</p>
<p>The white spear looked different now.</p>
<p>It was much shorter and there was a hole where the spearhead should have been.</p>
<p>“You want to know what this is?”</p>
<p>Alberu asked before his position resembled a certain someone's.The Omnipotent Spear's ability is automatically correcting your position while using a weapon for the first time.</p>
<p>The corrected position is better than average but is not exceptional.</p>
<p>Alberu’s position automatically started to correct itself, resembling the person Alberu thought of in his mind.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>“Why would I tell you?”</p>
<p>Alberu pulled the trigger as he said that.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>He then pulled the trigger once more as Park Jin Tae had done.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>Two white bullets started to fly toward the White Star.</p>
<p>If the chains won't work…</p>
<p>He just had to use something else.</p>
<p>“I can also fight together with someone else as well.”</p>
<p>Alberu could see Eruhaben attacking the White Star at the same time he shot the bullets.</p>
<p>“…Shit!”</p>
<p>The White Star started to frown after being attacked from the front and back at once.</p>
<p>The two of their attacks?</p>
<p>He could easily block them using his water wall.</p>
<p>But that was not the issue.</p>
<p>The problem was what the necromancer would do while he was defending against these two bastards.</p>
<p>That was the issue.</p>
<p>That issue ended up turning into reality.</p>
<p>“I got it.”</p>
<p>As Mary quietly mumbled…</p>
<p>The net made of black threads and flying skeleton monsters reached the black orb and quickly started to surround it.</p>
<p>Alberu shouted as he watched.</p>
<p>“Drag it up!”</p>
<p>Mary’s net caught a big fish and quickly started to shoot up into the air.</p>
<p>It was moving away from the White Star…</p>
<p>Moving away from all attacks…</p>
<p>It was moving the big fish, Cale Henituse, to a safe spot.</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim!”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>The others who were still here would now do their best to make sure that no trash got into that net.</p>
<p>“We will hold you back.”</p>
<p>Alberu pointed the gun at the White Star again.</p>
<p>Crackle, crackle!</p>
<p>The tree trunks that were much wider than a person were crumbling left and right.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The ground started to split again.</p>
<p>A monster with blood in its eyes quickly entered the split ground to hide.</p>
<p>"The yellow monster is escaping!”</p>
<p>"…It looks like it is retreating for now!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk walked over to Choi Han after hearing the shouts around him.</p>
<p>“Is it retreating for now?”</p>
<p>“That seems to be the case.”</p>
<p>The yellow head had dug through the three trunks and escaped underground.</p>
<p>"But it will return soon. It will be back before the day is over.”</p>
<p>“I guess we will get a short break.”</p>
<p>Choi Han and Lee Soo Hyuk then followed Kim Min Ah to the top of a tree nearby.</p>
<p>Cale was standing there. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 613: Bye! 1</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah stopped walking as soon as she got to the watchtower on top of the tree.</p>
<p>Someone moved past her.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>It was Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>He used his wind to be the first to reach Cale.</p>
<p>But he too stopped walking as Kim Min Ah had done.</p>
<p>“I, in such a state-”</p>
<p>“…My goodness.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah could see Cale, whose entire face and body were covered in blood. They were at a loss for words after seeing Cale's pale face and limbs that were shaking from blood loss as he weakly leaned against a tree trunk.</p>
<p>They could clearly see the pitiful appearance that they had not been able to see from a distance.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung.”</p>
<p>They heard a calm voice at that moment.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum could see Choi Han calmly walk past them.</p>
<p>He looked quite used to this.</p>
<p>Choi Han crouched down next to Cale who was being supported by Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>“…Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, who was the next to arrive, quietly called out to Cale as if he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>“Motherfucker.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae who was right behind Lee Soo Hyuk turned his head after looking at Cale.</p>
<p>However, he could not get himself to leave.</p>
<p>Choi Han calmly started to speak again at that moment.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung, I don’t know if you saw it, but the yellow monster escaped underground once your trees stopped moving.”</p>
<p>Of course, it was injured in its eyes, poisonous fangs, and many other locations because of Choi Han, Lee Soo Hyuk, and the others’ attacks.</p>
<p>“I think it will probably come back to attack in a little bit.”</p>
<p>Cale raised his head at that moment.</p>
<p>They could clearly see his eyes through his parted hair.</p>
<p>“Hold on.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes again as he responded.</p>
<p>‘Hold on,’ he had said.</p>
<p>“Quiet.”</p>
<p>Inside his head…</p>
<p>The Super Rock was speaking right now.You want to smack the sealed god from behind?</p>
<p>The Rok Soo of this world responded.Yes. I want to smack it hard.</p>
<p>The Rok Soo from this world, the Super Rock, and Cale were currently chatting inside Cale's mind.</p>
<p>Mm. It is impossible to destroy a god.</p>
<p>…That…</p>
<p>The Super Rock commented once again while the Rok Soo of this world seemed to not like what he had just heard.</p>
<p>But the sealed god will probably be stuck for eternity if we can cast another seal that cannot be broken other than by the caster. Wouldn't that be the same as smacking him from the back?</p>
<p>…A seal that cannot be broken? Is there a seal that can prevent him from coming back out into the world ever again?</p>
<p>The Super Rock calmly responded.Yes. If it is a power that doesn't exist in our world… And if it is a power that will never be passed on to anybody else in our world…</p>
<p>The Super Rock addressed Cale.You have such a power.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>He did have such a power.</p>
<p>He had a peculiar power that did not exist in Cale Henituse's world.</p>
<p>It was a power that would never be passed down; a power that would lose the only caster who could break the seal once Cale was gone.Embrace.</p>
<p>It was the power that Lee Soo Hyuk had passed on to Cale.</p>
<p>Whether it was a tangible item or an intangible power. This ability allowed him to store anything that existed in this world in a set location.</p>
<p>It was a power with an ability that did not suit its name.</p>
<p>This was the Embrace ability.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had said something to Cale at one point.</p>
<p>‘That power is like dominance. It dominates the target and binds them into your hand.’</p>
<p>‘…Isn’t that too violent to call it Embrace?’</p>
<p>‘Whatever. Even such a power can be considered an Embrace if I use it for good. Isn’t that right? I only use it for good.’</p>
<p>But they could use that power on a god?He’s not just a god. He’s a sealed god. It should be possible while he is sealed.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale was laughing while his mouth was covered in dry blood.</p>
<p>‘Yes. I only use it for good too.’</p>
<p>Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>The bullets were only aiming for one bastard.Sir, these bullets are different from regular bullets. They use the caster’s skill capacity. Uhh, mm… I guess it is called the mana capacity in this world. It automatically changes your mana into power from Earth 3 to turn it into bullets. Isn’t it great that you don’t need to cast it over and over again?</p>
<p>Tang-!I will drag out your mana as needed. So please shoot to your heart's content!</p>
<p>Bang, bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The fire sword and white bullets were causing an endless array of explosions as they crashed against each other.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up.</p>
<p>“This is nice.”</p>
<p>Tang, tang--!</p>
<p>Alberu’s gun was aiming at the White Star.</p>
<p>Eyes… Ankles… Head…</p>
<p>He didn’t care where it was as long as it was on the White Star’s body.Your position will change automatically based on the target. Of course, all positions are above the basic level but below the extraordinary level.</p>
<p>‘Okay, let’s send his fucking head flying!’</p>
<p>“Keke.”</p>
<p>A smile that Raon would call a villain's smile was on Alberu’s face.</p>
<p>He had not been able to hit the White Star even once.</p>
<p>The fire sword blocked all of his bullets.</p>
<p>But Alberu was still excited.</p>
<p>“Damn it, these motherfucking things!”</p>
<p>The White Star’s fire sword slashed through another bullet.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>There was another explosion. Unfortunately, the White Star did not have any time to pay attention to the explosion.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to pay any attention to me?”</p>
<p>He heard an annoying voice.</p>
<p>He cast his water wall.</p>
<p>Chhhhh-</p>
<p>Gold dust slammed against the wall.</p>
<p>Bang, babababang-!</p>
<p>There was a round of chain explosions.</p>
<p>The White Star could not see around him because of the smoke from the explosions.</p>
<p>“If it continues like this-!”</p>
<p>He would not have time to kill the necromancer or destroy the black net if this continued.</p>
<p>Those weird pellet things would attack him when he focused on blocking the ancient Dragon's attacks.</p>
<p>They had a mysterious power he didn’t know about, which prevented him from leaving them alone.</p>
<p>He could feel mana through the smoke once those pellets exploded, but he had never seen this shape before.</p>
<p>That was why he had to pay attention to each of them.</p>
<p>But he didn't need to worry much about it.</p>
<p>‘The amount of power in each pebble is small.’</p>
<p>They were things he could ignore once or twice in such a battle.</p>
<p>The problem was that these small things came flying at him nonstop.</p>
<p>‘Of all places-!’</p>
<p>The other thing was that they were only aiming at critical locations.</p>
<p>Eyes, head, ankle, etc…</p>
<p>They were aiming at places he couldn't afford to get hit right now.</p>
<p>But he couldn't use his water wall to defend against them because of the ancient Dragon's attack that would come right after.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Even with these annoying bullets, there was something else that was frustrating the White Star the most.</p>
<p>‘Why don’t they fight properly?!’</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman, Eruhaben…</p>
<p>Even the necromancer and the skeleton monsters that were running away as quickly as possible…</p>
<p>None of them were fighting with everything they had.</p>
<p>The necromancer not doing so made sense as she needed to escape with Cale, but Alberu Crossman and the ancient Dragon were both using small amounts of powers.</p>
<p>It was too weak to be called their full powers.</p>
<p>But it was strong enough that he could not take care of both of them at once and chase after the necromancer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Alberu was using those white pebbles to ambush him.</p>
<p>The White Star had a serious frown on his face underneath the mask.</p>
<p>"These fly-like bastards!”</p>
<p>They were getting on his nerves quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben launched a spear made of gold dust as he gasped.</p>
<p>He then had a benign smile on his face.</p>
<p>“That’s correct. That is our formation for this battle. Annoying you.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben was openly saying that their goal was to annoy the White Star.</p>
<p>“You’re quite smart.”</p>
<p>He praised the White Star and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The White Star used the water wall to block the gold spear before using his sword to block the front of his neck.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>A white bullet caused a small explosion.</p>
<p>The White Star’s face turned cold at the same time. The anger on his face had disappeared.</p>
<p>Eruhaben stopped attacking for a moment and looked at the White Star after seeing this suddenly calm expression.</p>
<p>The White Star started to speak after seeing his gaze.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I don't have the power to suppress both of you when you are not fighting at full strength?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben crossed his arms and answered that question.</p>
<p>“You'll need to use enough strength to flip this whole place over in order to do that.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The White Star started to smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t care whether this place is destroyed or not. Do you really think that it is important to me?”</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>A large amount of power started to gather with the White Star at the center.</p>
<p>If that power condensed a few times before exploding, the Endable Kingdom would turn into rubble.</p>
<p>This power looked ready to take away the lives of all of the Endable Kingdom's residents who were hiding in their homes before they could see the morning sun.</p>
<p>Eruhaben's expression stiffened as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“You’re bluffing.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I saw the Chief Priest running away.”</p>
<p>The Chief Priest.</p>
<p>The White Star flinched after hearing that name.</p>
<p>“He escaped quite stealthily, but in a rush. That should mean that there is something here for the Chief Priest to protect.”</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey had escaped as soon as Mary appeared.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had seen him running away.</p>
<p>"But what? You’re going to destroy this place?”</p>
<p>“The Chief Priest-!”</p>
<p>The White Star was about to say something but stopped himself.</p>
<p>‘The ancient Dragon would not have been able to fight with me here if he tried to capture the Chief Priest.’</p>
<p>Who chased after the Chief Priest then?</p>
<p>The White Star started to look around.</p>
<p>He scanned the area under him.</p>
<p>Beacrox and Bud were causing a ruckus down below.</p>
<p>That was why he had not realized it.</p>
<p>“…The Molan patriarch!”</p>
<p>The Molan patriarch. He could not see Ron Molan.</p>
<p>He seemed to have been hiding in the shadows while attacking the White Star's subordinates until just a moment ago. But none of his subordinates were being attacked by him anymore.</p>
<p>That meant that Ron Molan was not here.</p>
<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>Through a different video communication device located inside Alberu’s armor…We are currently chasing him.</p>
<p>Glenn Poeff.</p>
<p>The Mercenary King’s close friend and a highest-grade mage.</p>
<p>He had snuck in when necromancer Mary had appeared and was currently stealthily moving while tracking someone.</p>
<p>As for the person who left those tracks…</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>It was actually not a person, but Hong who was on Ron's shoulder.</p>
<p>Ron was not the only one who had disappeared from the battlefield.</p>
<p>Ron Molan was extremely skilled in stealth.</p>
<p>Three months ago when Cale had just been imprisoned inside that black orb… The siblings had come to find him.</p>
<p>‘We want to learn more!’</p>
<p>‘Want to learn, nya!’</p>
<p>On had looked at him with clear eyes that resembled Cale’s eyes while Hong was next to her smiling as brightly as young Cale used to smile.</p>
<p>‘Learn what?’</p>
<p>When Ron asked that question…</p>
<p>‘Things we would be good at. Grandpa, you know what that is don't you?’</p>
<p>‘I'm sure you know, nya!’</p>
<p>On and Hong.</p>
<p>The two of them had decided to get stronger after seeing Raon practice and research even the most basic of magic spells over and over. That was why they went to find someone who could teach them properly.</p>
<p>They needed someone who knew the traits of the Cat tribe and had similar abilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it needed to be someone who was knowledgeable about other abilities as well as had a lot of first-hand experience.</p>
<p>In addition, they needed someone who would teach the still young Hong and the now growing On at their proper levels.</p>
<p>Finally, they needed someone who would accept them and their powers just as they are.</p>
<p>On had been looking for such a person.</p>
<p>After looking long and hard, she came back to the beginning. She realized that there was only one person.</p>
<p>This person had taught them every so often in the Henituse residence and at the Hope and Adventure Loving Inn.</p>
<p>‘You only taught us a little bit every time. We want to learn properly now, nya. Grandpa, please teach us like you teach people in the Molan household.’</p>
<p>Ron had looked at On and Hong for a long time.</p>
<p>The thoughts that had passed through his mind on the day Cale first brought these two home and he realized that they were Cats brushed through his mind again.</p>
<p>He had never expected for them to be together for so long at that time.</p>
<p>Ron had responded back.</p>
<p>‘You want to learn like the people in the Molan household… it will be difficult.’</p>
<p>‘That’s okay! We will do well, nya!’</p>
<p>‘That’s okay, nya!’</p>
<p>A cold smile had appeared on Ron's face.</p>
<p>He had nonchalantly responded back.</p>
<p>‘I’ll teach you everything except assassination. I have no thoughts whatsoever about teaching you guys assassination.’</p>
<p>On and Hong had smiled back at him.</p>
<p>‘We wanted to learn everything except that anyway, nya!’</p>
<p>‘That’s right, nya! I want to learn stealth techniques the most, nya!’</p>
<p>Three months had passed since then.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>On, who was even stealthier than before, was only making quiet noises that sounded like the wind blowing by as she chased after Ron while Hong was leaving tracks for Glenn to find.</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>A small cat paw print was placed on the wall.</p>
<p>It was covered in poison, so anybody other than Glenn who had taken the antidote… Anybody else who touched these stamps would fall asleep.</p>
<p>Finally, as for Ron… His gaze was focused on one person.</p>
<p>He was heading toward Chief Priest Gersey.</p>
<p>Gersey was quickly heading for somewhere.</p>
<p>It was at a level higher than the white castle.</p>
<p>He was heading to the district with the temples.</p>
<p>‘Is he heading to the Temple of the Demonic God?’</p>
<p>Ron recalled the layout of this place he had heard from Alberu and started to move toward where Gersey, and what he was looking for, was located.</p>
<p>And once he finds it…</p>
<p>‘I have to make it so that the White Star cannot use it properly.’</p>
<p>Ron was taking in the situation and forming a plan.</p>
<p>His feet would move faster as Gersey's feet moved faster.</p>
<p>He then started to think.</p>
<p>‘They should have realized that I am missing by now. Either that, or someone from our side would have informed him about it.’</p>
<p>That would make the White Star get even angrier.</p>
<p>Ron’s eyes viciously flashed.</p>
<p>The White Star did notice Ron’s absence as he was thinking.</p>
<p>“…Shit!”</p>
<p>The White Star’s body quickly headed toward Section 2 with the temples.</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey was strong. It should be easy for him to suppress and kill someone like Ron Molan.</p>
<p>However, that was not the problem.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>A bullet flew in front of the moving White Star to stop him.</p>
<p>His gaze quickly turned toward Alberu.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Alberu smiled.</p>
<p>Tang! Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>He then shot out a flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>“You need to play with me.”</p>
<p>The White Star blocked the bullets and sighed.</p>
<p>“Haaaaa.”</p>
<p>His gaze slowly looked around.</p>
<p>The ground was a mess and there were explosions by the castle as well.</p>
<p>Ron was chasing behind the Chief Priest.</p>
<p>“…And the net is all the way up there.”</p>
<p>The black orb was already out of the sinkhole.</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>He started to laugh in disbelief.</p>
<p>Alberu could see all sorts of emotions disappearing from the White Star's face at that moment.</p>
<p>He could tell that all that was left was fatigue.</p>
<p>“How did things end up like this? Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>He mumbled with a tired expression.</p>
<p>“But I can do anything over again. It doesn't matter how long it takes.”</p>
<p>His eyes started to move.</p>
<p>Alberu made eye contact with the White Star.</p>
<p>His eyes resembled minerals.</p>
<p>As Alberu got the chills looking into those eyes…</p>
<p>The White Star started to speak.</p>
<p>“You guys made a mistake. Unfortunately, you guys are unable to recover from your mistakes like I can.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.Hey, crown prince!</p>
<p>Alberu heard Raon’s urgent voice.I tried to steal the sculptures, but they won't move!</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown.Can I destroy them? Wouldn't it be bad if something happened while Raon was destroying them?</p>
<p>Alberu saw it at that moment.</p>
<p>He saw the White Star quickly starting to move.</p>
<p>He was not headed toward the black orb nor toward the Chief Priest.</p>
<p>The castle.</p>
<p>That was where he was heading.</p>
<p>Alberu's intuitions were telling him something.</p>
<p>‘This bastard. He’s going to get the sculptures, no, to summon the monsters!’</p>
<p>Whether he was going to take the sculptures, destroy the sculptures, or use the sculptures in a different manner…</p>
<p>Alberu had no way of knowing what the White Star would do.</p>
<p>But the ending was obvious.</p>
<p>The eight unranked monsters…</p>
<p>The White Star was trying to summon them here.</p>
<p>‘I can't let that happen!’</p>
<p>Forget the Endable Kingdom, that would cause a large disaster for the entire Eastern continent!Hey crown prince, will monsters pop out if I destroy them? This is a difficult decision!</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>"Raon-nim.”Yes, crown prince?</p>
<p>“You said the sculptures won't move?”Yeah! I feel like I’ll destroy them if I mess with them!</p>
<p>“Then let's just move it all!”…Huh?</p>
<p>Alberu could hear Raon flinching on the other side.</p>
<p>He didn’t care and started to chase after the quickly moving White Star and fired his gun.</p>
<p>Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>Eruhaben descended in front of the White Star to stop him as well.</p>
<p>But Alberu and Eruhaben could feel something in the White Star as he raised his sword this time.</p>
<p>They could tell that the White Star would not go all out to fight without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Raon-nim! Slash the entire altar holding the sculptures from the ground! We will take the entire altar!”…Oh.</p>
<p>Raon quietly responded.I understand now. That is a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Raon looked toward the slightly elevated altar with the eight sculptures and the Wolf children.</p>
<p>This circular altar was a couple of meters in length.</p>
<p>He decided that he would separate this whole altar from the ground and take it with him.</p>
<p>It didn't matter if it destroyed the floor of the grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>Of course, Alberu wasn’t talking about anything that drastic.</p>
<p>‘And if I can’t separate the altar, I can just take the whole castle with me! I truly am great and mighty!’</p>
<p>But Raon's determination was… On a different level.Hey, crown prince! Do not worry! I will do it like our human!</p>
<p>Raon was going all out in a different manner than the White Star. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 614: Bye! 2</p>
<p>Raon had said something while rolling around on Cale’s bed and eating a cookie in the past.</p>
<p>‘Human!’</p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p>‘I wish this cookie became bigger!’</p>
<p>Cale had answered without any hesitation while sitting on the couch.</p>
<p>‘Make a bigger one.’</p>
<p>‘Make it?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. Make it big enough to satisfy you. Do it if that is what you want to do.’</p>
<p>‘Oh. Is that okay?’</p>
<p>Cale had nonchalantly responded back.</p>
<p>‘Why wouldn’t it be?’</p>
<p>‘That’s right! There’s no reason I can't do it! Make it bigger! Big enough to satisfy me! As much as I want!’</p>
<p>Raon had made sure to remember what Cale told him since Cale had never said anything wrong other than talking about being a slacker, saying that he is going to rest, or denying the fact that he is a hero.</p>
<p>That was why Raon decided he would do it however he wants to do so right now and looked around.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Outside the black shield… There were explosions all around the shield as numerous attacks were trying to destroy it.</p>
<p>‘Mm!’</p>
<p>The chances of those attacks breaking the shield right away were close to zero.</p>
<p>However, the shield would end up breaking if the attacks continued.</p>
<p>‘I can’t leave Rosalyn and Lock like that! I need to hurry!’</p>
<p>Raon quickly moved toward the largest sculpture.</p>
<p>The Wolf children were still asleep.</p>
<p>They were still chained up, however… Raon had carefully destroyed only a few chains binding their bodies because he thought it would be even more difficult for the children if they woke up while he was destroying their chains and saw this chaos.</p>
<p>‘Mm!’</p>
<p>The sculptures were made of something that Raon could not figure out.</p>
<p>He had thought that they were made of stones at first, but he realized that they were not made of rocks as he tried to steal them.</p>
<p>His two chubby front paws each grabbed onto the leg of one of the sculptures and started to lift it up.</p>
<p>“Groan!”</p>
<p>It looked as if he would be able to lift it, however….</p>
<p>Pssssssssss-</p>
<p>Putting even a small amount of strength into it made some dust fly up and looked as if it would break.</p>
<p>Raon puffed up his cheeks as if he didn’t like that and started to pout.</p>
<p>“There’s still a way!”</p>
<p>‘I can move the entire altar!’</p>
<p>Raon moved his chubby front paws from the sculpture and placed his front paws on the altar.</p>
<p>He then started to channel his mana around the sculptures.</p>
<p>It was because he needed to figure out how much of the altar he needed to cut off.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Huh?!”</p>
<p>Raon removed his front paws in shock.</p>
<p>Raon then approached some other sculptures and channeled his mana near them.</p>
<p>“…What is this?!”</p>
<p>The black Dragon’s wings were curled up in shock.</p>
<p>It’s connected!”</p>
<p>The sculptures were connected to the bottom of the altar.</p>
<p>There was a small circular tube connected to the bottom of the sculpture.</p>
<p>“This is weird!”</p>
<p>Raon could feel a weird aura flowing inside the circular tube.</p>
<p>“It’s being injected!”</p>
<p>That weird aura was flowing through the circular tube and being injected into the sculpture.</p>
<p>‘…It's similar to dead mana!’</p>
<p>It was hard to tell exactly what the weird aura was, but it seemed quite similar to dead mana.</p>
<p>Raon quickly used his magic to try to find the starting point of these circular tubes.</p>
<p>Drip drip.</p>
<p>Raon was focusing so hard in this anxious situation that there were beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The enemies were still attacking the black shield while Rosalyn and Lock were still fighting them off as Raon did this.</p>
<p>“You had quite the entrance, but all you’re doing is defending?”</p>
<p>Lock swung his large shield and remained by Raon's shield despite Bear King Sayeru sneering at him.</p>
<p>Bang! Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>The light arrows that were endlessly shooting toward them from all directions were being blocked by his shield.</p>
<p>It was because Sayeru’s light arrows could impact Raon’s shield greatly compared to the other enemies’ weak attacks.</p>
<p>Sayeru had two perfect arms, contrary to their information that he had lost one arm. However, he seemed to have difficulties moving the arm that had been lost and could only shoot light arrows while standing there with a pale expression.</p>
<p>Lock quietly mumbled to himself.</p>
<p>“…I will not… Forget my goal……”</p>
<p>The reason he had picked up the shield.</p>
<p>The reason he chose defense.</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt, his master, claimed that the greatest defense was the best offense, however…</p>
<p>‘I'm different.’</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt had told him something.</p>
<p>‘You need to figure out the reason you fight and your goal for fighting.’</p>
<p>The reason and goal.</p>
<p>‘I fight to protect.’</p>
<p>The Wolf tribe.</p>
<p>They were part of the strong Beast people tribes along with the Bear tribe, Lion tribe, and the Whale tribe.</p>
<p>Of course, they were said to be weaker compared to the other strong Beast people.</p>
<p>But they were still strong.</p>
<p>The Wolf tribe was known for their temperament and was said to use quite primitive and destructive battle methods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they thoroughly cherished their family and their tribe.</p>
<p>‘I will control both things in my own way.’</p>
<p>Lock calmed the power inside him that wanted to explode.</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt, his master, had told him something.</p>
<p>‘When you need to fight… You need to learn to figure out that moment. Don't forget your goal.’</p>
<p>His current goal.</p>
<p>It was neither to kill this bastard nor to destroy this place.</p>
<p>‘Save the children and steal the sculptures.’</p>
<p>That was all he needed to do.</p>
<p>‘Next time, when the time is right…’</p>
<p>He could use this power that was running wild inside him at that time.</p>
<p>That opportunity would definitely come for a person who suppressed their powers and waited for the right opportunity.</p>
<p>Lock picked up his shield.</p>
<p>Ba, bang, baaaaang-!</p>
<p>The light arrows crashed into the shield and exploded.</p>
<p>He then peeked to the side.</p>
<p>He could see Rosalyn who was also fighting nearby the black shield.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Another highest-grade magic stone broke.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-</p>
<p>A large fire burst out of Rosalyn's hand at the same time and headed toward the enemy in front of her.</p>
<p>And that enemy…</p>
<p>“Mm, that’s annoying to handle.”</p>
<p>Was the Lion King.</p>
<p>“But it’s not that hard to do.”</p>
<p>The Lion King, who was in his berserk form, easily pierced through the fire. Black smoke surrounded him.</p>
<p>Rosalyn bit down on her lips after seeing her fire being pierced so easily.</p>
<p>‘I'm certain that that black smoke is the power of darkness from his darkness Elemental!’</p>
<p>She could not give him the opening to use that power properly.</p>
<p>A portion of her allies would not be able to use their powers properly if that darkness spread through the sky.</p>
<p>‘I can’t give him an opening.’</p>
<p>In that case…</p>
<p>‘I need to attack without stopping!’</p>
<p>Rosalyn was using a completely different method than Lock and launching everything she had toward her enemy.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Most of the loud explosions happening in this area were Rosalyn’s handiwork.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>That was why Lion King Dorph could not easily attack.</p>
<p>"Even if she is using magic stones, her mana control and her attack spells-”</p>
<p>Are both at the level of Dragons.</p>
<p>He did not say that part out loud.</p>
<p>It was because she was an enemy.</p>
<p>“Of course, she’ll just end up like a caged rat as soon as she uses up all of those magic stones.”</p>
<p>“Have you not considered the fact that you would die before that happens?”</p>
<p>Dorph shrugged his shoulders as Rosalyn smirked and asked that question.</p>
<p>“I don't think that will happen.”</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to move the sculptures.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn’s hand flinched as she was casting another spell.</p>
<p>But she quickly resumed her casting.</p>
<p>‘I already heard from Raon-nim. He said it looks like they’ll break if he tries to take the sculptures.’</p>
<p>That was why he was planning on taking the whole altar.</p>
<p>She heard Dorph's voice at that moment.</p>
<p>"What is it?”</p>
<p>He was smiling.</p>
<p>“Are you thinking of taking the whole altar instead?”</p>
<p>Rosalyn stopped attacking and looked toward Dorph this time.</p>
<p>“Wouldn't that be quite a headache for you guys?”</p>
<p>She heard Raon's voice in her mind at that moment.Rosalyn!</p>
<p>The young Dragon's voice sounded urgent.These sculptures are connected to some tubes underneath the altar!</p>
<p>Those tubes are delivering some weird auras to the sculptures!</p>
<p>‘Weird auras?’But that aura feels like it is supplying nutrients!</p>
<p>Rosalyn’s expression stiffened up.</p>
<p>Nutrients.</p>
<p>Did that mean that the sculptures were alive?</p>
<p>‘…What are those nutrients?’</p>
<p>She was certain that the nutrients were not nutrients that they would consider normal.</p>
<p>“Mm. I guess the Dragon figured it out by now?”</p>
<p>Lion King Dorph leisurely laughed.</p>
<p>Sayeru had stopped his attacks at some point as well and was laughing next to Dorph.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rosalyn’s expression was getting stiffer the more she heard.The connections! I think the sculptures will break if I cut these tubes off!</p>
<p>These tubes that were feeding something that seemed to be nutrients…</p>
<p>Raon had a feeling that destroying these tubes would impact the sculptures as well.I tried to find where the tubes came from, but I need more time since they are coming from quite far away! That’s why I'm letting you know about it first!</p>
<p>There were many tubes connected to the eight sculptures that were forming a weird shape underground.</p>
<p>Raon had used his mana to try and find the starting point of these tubes, but the tubes underground had headed toward the wall of the Endable Kingdom's sinkhole.</p>
<p>Then they flowed up the wall.</p>
<p>That was why Raon needed more time to investigate.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Beeeeeeep- Beeeeeeeep-</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Raon's video communication devices both gave off emergency signals.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>The shock made Raon even stop his investigation as he quickly took out a video communication device.</p>
<p>This signal meant that someone was quickly retreating.</p>
<p>‘It means that someone is running away as quickly as they can!’</p>
<p>Raon’s heart started to beat wildly.</p>
<p>‘The human isn't here!’</p>
<p>For some reason, thinking about the fact that the human was not here made Raon feel as if this signal was even more urgent.Huff, huff!</p>
<p>He heard some heavy breathing through the video communication device.</p>
<p>The screen was shaking so much that he could not tell what was going on.</p>
<p>It looked as if they had the video communication device in their pocket as they urgently sent out the signal.</p>
<p>“This is bad!”</p>
<p>Raon even stopped having his two front paws on the ground because he was so shocked.</p>
<p>The person who had sent a signal to Raon, Rosalyn, Alberu, Eruhaben, and the others…Huff, we are currently heading toward Section 2 where all of the temples are gathered together!</p>
<p>Glenn Poeff.</p>
<p>He was the Mercenary King's close friend and where he was right now…I am urgently running away with Ron Molan-! Huff!</p>
<p>Ron, On, and Hong were with him.</p>
<p>Ron of all people was urgently running away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was when On and Hong were with him.</p>
<p>Raon's eyes were open wide when he heard a calm voice outside his shield.</p>
<p>“Let’s just go.”</p>
<p>It was Rosalyn.</p>
<p>The shocked Raon slowly calmed down after seeing Rosalyn’s calm gaze.</p>
<p>“The sculptures are not the issue, Raon-nim.”</p>
<p>Their number one goal.</p>
<p>Everyone's survival.</p>
<p>Raon heard a different person's voice through the video communication device.I will head to Section 2.</p>
<p>Alberu would head to Ron.</p>
<p>Raon clenched his two paws after seeing Lock nodding his head as well.</p>
<p>His mind was becoming clear.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“You may have taken Cale Henituse away… But did you think we would let you take these too?”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A person slammed down from the air.</p>
<p>The White Star.</p>
<p>Rosalyn urgently cast a spell after seeing his appearance.</p>
<p>Ooooooong ooooooo-</p>
<p>Before her fire could even spread…</p>
<p>The White Star jumped over Rosalyn and Lock.</p>
<p>He then landed on top of the black shield and started to punch.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The black shield started to crack with a loud noise.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>The White Star could see the black Dragon blinking his round eyes from the other side of the cracking shield.</p>
<p>The White Star calmly started to speak again with a tired expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the end.”</p>
<p>Raon looked into those tired eyes.</p>
<p>Blink, blink.</p>
<p>His eyes curled up like crescent moons after he blinked twice.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>The corners of Raon’s mouth curled up.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go to the end! You idiot!”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Clang-!</p>
<p>The black shield was destroyed.</p>
<p>“It’s fine as long as we saved the human!”</p>
<p>Raon channeled his mana at that moment.</p>
<p>Crack, crack.</p>
<p>The black mana destroyed the chains, and as some of the children flinched and were about to wake up…</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Raon’s magic created a circular nest and coddled the children.</p>
<p>His magic just brushed past the sculptures and left them alone.</p>
<p>“I'm leaving!”</p>
<p>The nest quickly started to shoot up into the air.</p>
<p>“We'll come back to steal, no, to destroy things next time!”</p>
<p>“Do you really think I would let you-”</p>
<p>The White Star started to move toward Raon who was inside the nest shooting up above him.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He was slammed to the side after a strong power suddenly hit him.</p>
<p>The White Star started to frown.</p>
<p>“…This damn ancient Dragon! You’re finally using your powers!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben's gold mana suddenly appeared and slammed the White Star.</p>
<p>It was much stronger than when they had fought with him earlier.</p>
<p>“…Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben hid his slightly shaking hand and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Lock used that opening to quickly get on the nest.</p>
<p>“Goldie gramps!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben chuckled at the round eyes that were looking at him for the first time in a long while and shot up alongside the nest.</p>
<p>The White Star and some others shot up in the air as well to chase after them.</p>
<p>“I will block it.”</p>
<p>However, the person responsible for taking the black orb away, Mary, still had some things remaining here.</p>
<p>White bones.</p>
<p>Numerous skeleton monsters appeared and got in between the enemies and the nest.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>These skeleton monsters were just weak and annoying for the White Star.</p>
<p>However, the Flying Skeleton Brigade was enough to buy time for Raon’s nest to get away.</p>
<p>The White Star heard a bright voice.</p>
<p>“Hey, White Star! Byeeee! See you soon!”</p>
<p>A chubby front paw popped out of the nest and waved left and right for the White Star.</p>
<p>And at the same time…</p>
<p>“…Fuck!”</p>
<p>Alberu was controlling one of Mary’s skeleton wyverns as he quickly headed to Section 2 where all of the temples were located.</p>
<p>The black thread in his hand made it possible to control the monster. Of course, the wyvern couldn’t act as if it was alive like when Mary was controlling it.</p>
<p>But he had no choice but to use this method as this was an urgent situation.</p>
<p>Alberu bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>‘For Ron Molan to send an emergency signal…!’</p>
<p>He became concerned.</p>
<p>‘Chief Priest Gersey. That bastard is strong too.’</p>
<p>Gersey fought while using a fan.</p>
<p>Even without the title of Chief Priest, that bastard would be considered strong.</p>
<p>‘He was only supposed to follow him… did he get caught by the Chief Priest?’</p>
<p>He could not understand the situation at all.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Alberu turned his head after feeling a gust of wind behind him.</p>
<p>Beacrox was also on one of Mary's skeleton wyverns following him.</p>
<p>Alberu started to move faster as he understood what Beacrox must be feeling.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-!</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“The signal flare!”</p>
<p>He could see Glenn's magic signal flare.</p>
<p>It was near the northern part of Section 2.</p>
<p>Alberu quickly headed toward it.</p>
<p>He then saw it.</p>
<p>He saw Glenn running as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>He then saw Ron, On, and Hong.</p>
<p>Ron looked quite odd running away.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…What is that?”</p>
<p>Alberu flinched for a moment.</p>
<p>“…Isn’t that the Chief Priest?”</p>
<p>Ron was holding onto a leg of the fainted Chief Priest Gersey.</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey was being dragged on the ground while unconscious.</p>
<p>His clothes were a mess because of that.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t important right now.</p>
<p>“…Poison?”</p>
<p>The Chief Priest seemed to have been poisoned as his face was oddly purple.</p>
<p>“A bloody nose?”</p>
<p>He had blood flowing out of both nostrils.</p>
<p>One of his purple cheeks had a cat’s paw print that resembled a bruise.</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>The two kittens were excitedly running next to Ron who was running away while dragging Gersey.</p>
<p>They seemed to be laughing.</p>
<p>Alberu subconsciously made a comment.</p>
<p>“…Scary.”</p>
<p>The old man and the children…</p>
<p>He didn't know what had happened, but they truly were amazing experts. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 615: Bye! 3</p>
<p>“Get them!”</p>
<p>"We must save the Chief Priest-nim! Shoot the arrows!”</p>
<p>“Call for reinforcements!”</p>
<p>There were people chasing the escaping Ron, Glenn, On, and Hong.</p>
<p>They were the priests serving the Demonic race as well as others.</p>
<p>“Put dead mana on the arrows and fire!”</p>
<p>“Go on top of the buildings! Pour dead mana on those bastards’ heads!”</p>
<p>‘…Shit.’</p>
<p>Alberu realized why Ron had sent such an urgent request.</p>
<p>The enemies were trying to attack using dead mana from who knows where.</p>
<p>Dead mana was extremely deadly for anyone except people like black mages, necromancers, and Dark Elves with the darkness attribute.</p>
<p>‘It makes sense that he is escaping.’</p>
<p>Alberu quickly lowered the altitude and headed toward Ron.</p>
<p>He made eye contact with Ron at that moment.</p>
<p>Flick.</p>
<p>Ron leisurely greeted him even in such a situation.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know whether that’s him being respectful or just casual.’</p>
<p>Either way, this guy was definitely not normal.</p>
<p>“Meeeeeeeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>The Cat children greeting him weren't normal either.</p>
<p>“Huff! Huff! Please save us!”</p>
<p>Glenn, who was shouting with a desperate look on his face, was showing a normal reaction. This reaction was fitting for Mercenary King Bud's close friend.</p>
<p>“I will take Ron Molan and the children.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Alberu took out the Unbreakable Spear after hearing Beacrox's short response.</p>
<p>It was still in the shape of the beautiful white gun.</p>
<p>Tang! Tang!</p>
<p>“Ugh! That weapon--!”</p>
<p>“It’s exploding! Dodge!”</p>
<p>They did not have enough fighting force unlike when they were in Section 1 because there were so many priests.</p>
<p>Alberu used the opening created from the enemies becoming confused and quickly got closer to Ron.</p>
<p>“Get on.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Ron dragged Gersey as he got on the skeleton wyvern’s back.</p>
<p>Alberu reached out one hand.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>On and Hong quickly climbed up his hand and arm and jumped onto his chest.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff! Me too-”</p>
<p>As for Glenn…</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>“Please be quiet.”</p>
<p>Beacrox grabbed him by the back of his clothes and safely dropped him on the back of the skeleton wyvern.</p>
<p>“Let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward Mary’s skeleton monsters blocking the White Star and quickly started to move.</p>
<p>“It looks like they realized that we have abducted the Chief Priest.”</p>
<p>He saw that the White Star was looking at him with an extremely angry gaze and increased his speed.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang, crackle!</p>
<p>“You rat-like bastards-!”</p>
<p>Multiple skeleton monsters started to crumble with a single slash from the White Star's sword.</p>
<p>But there were too many skeleton monsters.</p>
<p>Rumble, ruuuuuuuuumble-</p>
<p>The sky started to roar.</p>
<p>Alberu could see that the White Star’s sky-attribute ancient power was making the sky roar.</p>
<p>“Even if you use the sky power now… Pffft.”</p>
<p>He just ignored it.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>The moment they got out of the sinkhole…</p>
<p>“Hurry up and get on the airship!”</p>
<p>Alberu saw a large airship appear as he heard Eruhaben's shout.</p>
<p>It was the airship they had hidden in the forest nearby.</p>
<p>In the past…</p>
<p>Within the southern area of the Western continent… This airship that once belonged to the Mogoru Empire had tried to attack the Jungle's capital.</p>
<p>It had ended up in Rosalyn and Eruhaben’s hands and the airship that had played a big role in the Mogoru Empire had reappeared today.</p>
<p>Of course, this airship was much more advanced than the one led by Bear King Sayeru that Cale had destroyed.</p>
<p>“…She said that she was going to station this next to the Magic Tower-”</p>
<p>He recalled something Rosalyn had said in the past before stepping onto the airship.</p>
<p>His allies…</p>
<p>The black orb with Cale inside…</p>
<p>The Wolf children…</p>
<p>Even Deputy Chief Priest Cotton and the others who had snuck out from the God of War’s resting place while they were rescuing Cale…</p>
<p>Everybody got on.</p>
<p>Alberu and the others beside the Mercenary King and Glenn who had already been in the Eastern continent had come here on this airship.</p>
<p>Of course, they had used teleportation magic.</p>
<p>Glenn shouted in shock.</p>
<p>“A, a teleportation magic circle to transport this large airship whole-?!”</p>
<p>This highest-grade mage could not hide his shock.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>This airship that was currently reacting to the mana and shaking was a large moving vehicle.</p>
<p>As for the captain of this vehicle…</p>
<p>“Mr. Glenn, please help me.”</p>
<p>It was Rosalyn.</p>
<p>“Y, yes, of course!”</p>
<p>Glenn quickly headed to the center of the magic circle.</p>
<p>Raon and Rosalyn's mana were twisted together and glowing dark red.</p>
<p>Glenn supported them with his mana from the side.</p>
<p>All three of their magic levels were highest-grade, making them able to do something like this without practicing in advance.</p>
<p>‘My goodness.’</p>
<p>But Glenn was shocked at this situation.</p>
<p>‘How much money did they spend?’</p>
<p>He had never seen this airship before because he had been on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>That was why he could only gulp after seeing that the entire ship had highest-grade magic stones every so often and was made of expensive materials.</p>
<p>‘…Most importantly-’</p>
<p>Something else had shocked him.</p>
<p>‘A couple hundred people can fit on this.’</p>
<p>This large teleportation magic circle that could transport hundreds of people at once…</p>
<p>This many people was pretty much an army.</p>
<p>And since the person controlling this teleportation magic circle was Rosalyn…</p>
<p>‘If she fills this airship with mages in the future-?!’</p>
<p>That would be the birth of an unbelievable mage brigade.</p>
<p>She was the future master of the to-be-created Magic Tower after all. She will have troops equivalent to the troops of a kingdom even though she would not be a Queen.</p>
<p>‘…I'm glad she’s on our side.’</p>
<p>Glenn truly felt that way as he channeled his mana.</p>
<p>Rosalyn opened her eyes at that moment.</p>
<p>The sun was all the way out in the sky and the wind fluttered her hair.</p>
<p>That wind was caused by their casting of this large spell.</p>
<p>She was the one who had caused it.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>As the largest highest-grade magic stone at the center of the magic circle cracked and then exploded…</p>
<p>“First destination. We are moving to the Mercenaries Guild.”</p>
<p>She gave a short explanation before the airship started to teleport.</p>
<p>“You bastards-!”</p>
<p>They could see the White Star, who seemed to have made it past the skeleton monsters, in the distance.</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben, who was not within the teleportation magic circle, let out a short sigh.</p>
<p>“My goodness, he’s so persistent.”</p>
<p>He then launched tens of gold arrows toward the White Star.</p>
<p>“He’s so annoying.”</p>
<p>As his attack made the White Star hesitate…</p>
<p>On and Hong who were in Alberu’s arms peeked their faces over Alberu’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Bye~”</p>
<p>“Bye nya!”</p>
<p>They then waved their paws to say goodbye to the White Star.</p>
<p>“See you next time.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben gave the final goodbye as they all disappeared.</p>
<p>Now that they were gone…</p>
<p>It looked as if the airship had never been in the Endable Kingdom in the first place.</p>
<p>As for where it appeared…</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived at our first destination.”</p>
<p>They were inside a forest.</p>
<p>“This is the right place?”</p>
<p>“This is the exact location!”</p>
<p>Bud smiled brightly and nodded his head after hearing Rosalyn’s question.</p>
<p>“The Mercenaries Guild's shelter is around here, so we can get off now.”</p>
<p>Bud and Glenn.</p>
<p>The Mercenaries Guild's leader and his close friend who was just as strong had attacked the White Star today.</p>
<p>That was why the chief executives of the Mercenaries Guild all around the Eastern continent would go and hide in their respective shelters starting today.</p>
<p>“Please take care of me.”</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Priest Cotton. Cotton, the priestess of the God of War, was planning on staying here with Bud.</p>
<p>“No worries. Our Mercenaries Guild members were able to survive thanks to you, Deputy Chief Priest-nim.”</p>
<p>There had been some Mercenaries Guild members who not been able to make it out of the Endable Kingdom and had stayed in the God of War’s resting place with Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Cotton waved her hand as if it was nothing.</p>
<p>“I just did what was expected of me.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t expected of you.”</p>
<p>Bud smiled like a reliable leader as he shook Cotton's hand.</p>
<p>“Bye Mercenary King!”</p>
<p>Bud then responded to Raon's goodbye with a mischievous smile before being the last to get off the airship.</p>
<p>"We are now moving to our second destination.”</p>
<p>Their second destination was also their final destination.</p>
<p>Alberu closed his eyes as he heard Rosalyn’s statement.</p>
<p>He could feel his body slowly starting to teleport.</p>
<p>Paaaaat-!</p>
<p>Alberu opened his eyes after feeling a bright light.</p>
<p>“You’re here?”</p>
<p>Lord Sheritt.</p>
<p>She was out here to greet the airship.</p>
<p>Screech- screech-</p>
<p>They were in one of the Forbidden Regions on the Western continent.</p>
<p>They were in the Forest of Darkness within the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>Flying monsters screeched and shot up into the air as if they were scared by the sudden appearance of the airship.</p>
<p>Grrrrrr!</p>
<p>Kaaaaaaaa, kaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>They could also hear the cries of mutant monsters that were difficult to find anywhere else in the Western continent if they carefully listened.</p>
<p>At the center of that forest…</p>
<p>A black castle was profoundly giving off its black glimmer even while under the radiant sun.</p>
<p>They were met by Lord Sheritt, whose attribute was defense.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up.</p>
<p>“I knew I liked this place.”</p>
<p>If they were to look for a place where Cale Henituse would be the safest and a place that would be ideal to fight against their enemies…</p>
<p>There was no better place than this.</p>
<p>He alighted from the airship and looked around.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>He then flinched.</p>
<p>“Goldie gramps! I'm going to be first!”</p>
<p>“Whatever then, little kid. I'm after you.”</p>
<p>Raon and Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“I'll do it too. I created a new magic circle and it was quite effective.”</p>
<p>“I'll go last then.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn. And then Lord Sheritt.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Then we can add the power of incantation as well.”</p>
<p>Even Gashan.</p>
<p>They were all looking at Cale who was inside the half-transparent black orb.</p>
<p>The five of them surrounded the black orb and started to cast all sorts of spells and incantations as soon as that orb was lowered down to the black castle.</p>
<p>“…Oh my.”</p>
<p>They were all strong spells and most of them were for protecting the orb.</p>
<p>“I'm going to cast an attack spell as well! I won’t leave them alone if they try to harm our human!”</p>
<p>“I already did that.”</p>
<p>They added all sorts of attack spells as well.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to think.</p>
<p>“…I guess I don't need to worry about Cale Henituse's safety.”</p>
<p>He said that while sighing before turning away from the three Dragons, one mage, and one shaman.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>He was then shocked.</p>
<p>Clang. Clang.</p>
<p>Beacrox was grinding his sword.</p>
<p>Next to him were numerous daggers that had already been restored to the point that they were shining.</p>
<p>Beacrox was just grinding his swords while looking at the unconscious Chief Priest Gersey.</p>
<p>‘Mm.’</p>
<p>Alberu held back his sigh after seeing that.</p>
<p>He pretended not to see the three layers of black gloves that were on Beacrox’s hands.</p>
<p>“Your highness, you’re here?”</p>
<p>Alberu got the chills after seeing Ron’s gentle smile and quickly turned toward On and Hong.</p>
<p>“Please create some fog around the castle and the forest.”</p>
<p>“I understand! That’s easy, nya!”</p>
<p>“I'm going to put out a weak poison too, nya!”</p>
<p>On and Hong nodded their heads with happy expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>Alberu started to smile because they looked so cute.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>However, his expression soon stiffened up.</p>
<p>“Then we'll be back soon, nya!”</p>
<p>“We’ll be back soon, nya!”</p>
<p>Before On and Hong said goodbye to the adults nearby and headed toward the forest that was pretty much their front yard now…</p>
<p>They picked up one of their paws and…</p>
<p>Slap!</p>
<p>Slap!</p>
<p>Each slapped one of the unconscious Gersey’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“Oo…ooooooooo. Grooooooan……”</p>
<p>Gersey groaned, but On and Hong had already left toward the forest with feather-like movements.</p>
<p>‘…I've felt this before, but…’</p>
<p>Alberu had a thought after watching all of this.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse has picked some peculiar people to be his friends.’</p>
<p>Alberu was thinking that he did not fall under the same category.</p>
<p>That was why he checked that everybody was busy before starting to speak to Ron in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>"Ron Molan. Why were you running away?”</p>
<p>Ron turned toward Alberu.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>He could see Alberu’s blonde hair and blue eyes once he removed his helmet.</p>
<p>He could see that those eyes were sparkling with an odd gaze.</p>
<p>"What did you see?”</p>
<p>He could hear Alberu calmly asking in a cold voice.</p>
<p>“I hope you can tell me right away.”</p>
<p>He looked as radiant as the sun above him.</p>
<p>Ron started to speak.</p>
<p>“I saw them transforming dead mana. That seemed to be the nutrients being injected into the sculptures that Raon-nim mentioned.”</p>
<p>“…Transforming dead mana?”</p>
<p>Alberu's eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>Cale could hear the Super Rock's voice.Cale, isn’t it a bit better now?</p>
<p>‘It is. I feel much better.’</p>
<p>About half of the pain in his body had disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Did they rescue me on the other side?’</p>
<p>Cale realized that Alberu and the others must have done something and tried to stand up with a bright expression on his face.</p>
<p>He made an attempt.</p>
<p>However, there was someone who gently pushed down on his shoulders and made it so that he could not stand up.</p>
<p>“Commander, you will lie down. That will be the reward for my faith.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik, whose clothes were quite raggedy from doing who knows what, was looking down at Cale with his eyes opened wide and a vicious expression on his face.</p>
<p>His eyes were open so wide that…</p>
<p>‘It’s a bit scary.’</p>
<p>As Cale had that thought…</p>
<p>“Please lay still. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Wait-”</p>
<p>“I have faith that you will do that, Commander-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale closed his mouth and looked around after hearing Joo Ho-Shik's calm but oddly vicious tone.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>But what he saw was…</p>
<p>“We’ll be inside the shelter soon. Just lie there. Got it? Okay, Rok Soo?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk with a stoic expression that seemed even more vicious than Joo Ho-Shik and a silent Choi Han. He also saw the stiff expressions on the faces of the others.</p>
<p>"The Commander-nim is here!”</p>
<p>Someone shouted at that moment.</p>
<p>Screeeech-!</p>
<p>The gate to the shelter opened.</p>
<p>Cale slowly turned away after seeing many pairs of eyes staring at him.</p>
<p>He then started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Where did you all get a movable bed like this?”</p>
<p>Nobody responded to him.</p>
<p>Clunk. Clunk.</p>
<p>Choi Han just quietly pushed the head of the movable bed as Cale lied on it.</p>
<p>The moment when the yellow head ran away…</p>
<p>During that short lull in the battle…</p>
<p>‘Move!’</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik had shouted loudly as if he was screaming before jumping over the castle wall and running toward Cale with the movable bed.</p>
<p>He had then said the following.</p>
<p>‘Let’s lay him down.’</p>
<p>It was the moment when Cale had realized that he could use ‘Embrace’ to seal the sealed god with the stronger seal and was happy that he had found a way to smack the sealed god from the back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cale could only quietly lie on the bed after Joo Ho-Shik’s appearance.</p>
<p>He was being moved into the shelter while lying on the bed.</p>
<p>“I'm okay. Wouldn’t it be better to use this for someone who is in a worse condition?”</p>
<p>Cale quietly mumbled.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim! Please don’t shake my faith. Please?”</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Hey! You, you really!”</p>
<p>“…Rok Soo hyung! Please!”</p>
<p>He heard multiple people's voices.</p>
<p>Finally, once he heard even Choi Han say, ‘Please!’</p>
<p>Cale. I think it is better to just be quiet.</p>
<p>Seems that way. Let’s just go like this.</p>
<p>Cale agreed with the Super Rock and the Kim Rok Soo of this world before quietly closing his eyes and letting the bed support his body.</p>
<p>He was carried into the shelter with everybody's eyes focused on him. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 616: Bye! 4</p>
<p>Cale had his eyes closed but felt as if something was prickling his face.</p>
<p>It made him want to open his eyes.</p>
<p>‘I think we are moving past the shelter gate.’</p>
<p>Where this movable bed was right now and where it was headed…</p>
<p>He wanted to open his eyes and see what was going on.</p>
<p>But he could not do that.</p>
<p>“…My goodness.”</p>
<p>“Looking like this-”</p>
<p>It was because he could hear people gasping and being unable to finish their sentences all around him.</p>
<p>‘I have a bad feeling about this.’</p>
<p>Cale felt that this was oddly familiar, and that gave him quite the ominous feeling.</p>
<p>“Sob.”</p>
<p>“Mmph.”</p>
<p>But once he heard someone weeping…</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’</p>
<p>Cale couldn't help but open his eyes.</p>
<p>And then he saw it.</p>
<p>He saw the gazes in the eyes of the people looking at him.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of emotions in their gazes as they looked toward Cale who was covered in blood and in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Most of their eyes were shaking or tearing up.</p>
<p>‘…Ah.’</p>
<p>Cale felt as if he was experiencing something he had faced many times in the Roan Kingdom, in the Western continent, in that other world.</p>
<p>The way he was laying on the bed right now and only had his eyes open reminded him of when he had woken up with the World Tree’s wreath in the Ten Finger Mountains’ Elf Village.</p>
<p>His spine felt very cold for some reason.Cale, everybody looks as if they have been moved by you.</p>
<p>Cale started to frown after hearing the Super Rock say that in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah became concerned and asked Cale a question, which made him quickly stop frowning and slightly smile in order to show that he was okay.</p>
<p>It was a gentle smile in his opinion, but Raon would have said it reminded him of a crushed apple pie and probably told him to smile as he does when he scams people instead.</p>
<p>“Yes, I'm okay. I'm all better now.”</p>
<p>“…Ha… Really… you……”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah let out a deep sigh before turning away.</p>
<p>‘What’s up with her?’</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Kim Min Ah in confusion when Bae Puh Rum started to speak over Kim Min Ah's shoulder.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes closed if it’s hard to keep them open! There’s no need to keep them open if it is difficult to do so.”</p>
<p>“…I said I was okay. Plus, I need to keep my eyes open to be able to understand what has happened.”</p>
<p>“Raaaaah!”</p>
<p>It was rare to see Bae Puh Rum get angry like this as he shouted before turning away as well.</p>
<p>‘What's wrong with both of them?’</p>
<p>This world’s Kim Rok Soo thought it was weird as well.I know, right? Why are they acting like this?</p>
<p>The Super Rock nonchalantly responded to both of them.I don’t know whether the two of you are feigning ignorance even though you know what is going on, but…</p>
<p>He was speaking as if it was nothing.It looks like you’ve become a hero.</p>
<p>-…….</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Cale just closed his eyes.</p>
<p>As for this movable bed…</p>
<p>‘Well, it’ll end up somewhere.’</p>
<p>He just decided not to think about anything right now.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“None of you are hurt, right?”</p>
<p>He said that as he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence before he heard Park Jin Tae and Lee Soo Hyuk's voices.</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. We're not hurt.”</p>
<p>Cale ignored Park Jin Tae's swearing and smiled with satisfaction at what Lee Soo Hyuk had said.</p>
<p>Just like this…</p>
<p>Everybody could safely get through this day if they continued just like this.</p>
<p>Whether it was an unranked monster or the sealed god…</p>
<p>They should be able to take care of all of them.</p>
<p>Cale quickly started to organize his thoughts now that most of the pain was gone and his mind felt refreshed.</p>
<p>His allies just quietly looked down at him.</p>
<p>Among them, Choi Jung Soo…</p>
<p>The man who was pushing against the pillar at the foot of the bed unlike Choi Han who was up at the head looked away from Cale and observed the area around him.</p>
<p>Nobody had died.</p>
<p>As for the unranked monster, it had lost its eyes and poisonous fangs before it had escaped with numerous injuries on its body.</p>
<p>He had no idea as to what would happen from here on, but this situation should have been enough for some cheering or joy in the shelter.</p>
<p>But even the people who had been happy quickly lost their smiles after seeing Commander Kim Rok Soo's condition.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could understand how they were feeling.</p>
<p>‘They can't smile after seeing him looking so terrible.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo must have been telling the truth about being in less pain as his body wasn’t shaking as much and he was no longer coughing up blood.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo was relieved at that. He was relieved that it seemed as if Cale would not die, but…</p>
<p>“…My goodness.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo quickly realized that Cale’s condition that made him feel relief was still an extremely critical condition based on the astonished gasps of the people around him.</p>
<p>Peek.</p>
<p>He peeked toward Choi Han for a moment.</p>
<p>Choi Han was extremely calm right now such that it seemed as if the person who had taken away the yellow-headed monster’s eyes and poisonous fangs was a different person.</p>
<p>Although he looked calm, Choi Jung Soo could see that Choi Han’s eyes were full of fire.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo presumed that those were fires of anger.</p>
<p>But there was something he did not know.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s eyes were alertly observing the nearby area after having checked on Cale.</p>
<p>Choi Han was extremely alert right now, more than anybody else.</p>
<p>He still had to fulfill the orders he had received.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo just clenched the pillar of the bed tighter.</p>
<p>‘I couldn't do anything.’</p>
<p>All he could do was stand by Kim Rok Soo. He could not fight properly like the others.</p>
<p>That fact was weighing heavily on Choi Jung Soo's mind.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jung Soo.”</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk's voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Thank you for being by Rok Soo's side.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo made eye contact with Lee Soo Hyuk. After looking into his eyes, he could tell that Lee Soo Hyuk said that because he had realized what he was thinking.</p>
<p>Although Choi Jung Soo had not chatted much with Lee Soo Hyuk before this, he oddly felt that Lee Soo Hyuk’s unexpected consoling was not foreign and he was thankful for it.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled back after seeing the faint smile on Choi Jung Soo’s face and slowly looked away.</p>
<p>All sorts of emotions seeped inside him through the chaotic silence inside the shelter.</p>
<p>The question that had been on his mind until not too long ago…</p>
<p>What would change because he kept fighting like this?</p>
<p>It had been a question that arose from the sorrows of fatigue.</p>
<p>But that question had disappeared after seeing his Commander's battle today.</p>
<p>No, he had forgotten about the question after seeing the people of this shelter fight with desperation today.</p>
<p>‘I was full of desperation as well.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had just fought while forgetting about his questions and concerns. He recalled how he had gone up against that monster in order to survive and to save others.</p>
<p>He then made up his mind.</p>
<p>‘Keep doing this.’</p>
<p>He would continue to fight, move forward, and run wild in this world that had become a mess because of these annoying monsters.</p>
<p>‘Then I’m sure I’ll grow stronger.’</p>
<p>He would keep moving forward while getting stronger.</p>
<p>The others would be by his side as well.</p>
<p>It would be just like how he and the numerous people filling up this shelter right now had fought today.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see Heo Sook Ja who had climbed down from the shelter walls and was walking over to them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the meeting room.”</p>
<p>She continued to speak with a stiff expression on her face.</p>
<p>“And let’s move the Commander-nim to the treatment room-”</p>
<p>“I'm okay.”</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes and sat up.</p>
<p>“I need to go to the meeting room as well.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum opened their mouths in shock, but Cale raised his hand to stop the others from speaking.</p>
<p>He then continued in a calm voice.</p>
<p>"The monster is not dead yet. The Commander can’t be resting in such a situation.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja was thinking that Cale had quite an outrageous sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>“…I understand. Let’s go to the meeting room.”</p>
<p>However, she was also the leader of a shelter right now.</p>
<p>That was why she could presume the numerous emotions that were underneath that sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>“Please gather all of the squad leaders.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja immediately started working on Cale’s request.</p>
<p>Cale organized his thoughts as the bed moved toward the grand assembly hall.</p>
<p>The unexpected smack in the back from the sealed god…</p>
<p>The conversation with the God of Death…</p>
<p>The intense pain that should not come again…</p>
<p>The connection to his ancient powers…</p>
<p>Furthermore, the appearance of the original Kim Rok Soo of this body.</p>
<p>Cale’s mind was quite the mess because of everything that had happened all at once.</p>
<p>‘But things are getting resolved one by one now.’</p>
<p>He had found a way to smack the sealed god in the back.</p>
<p>His pain had decreased significantly.</p>
<p>The yellow head could no longer see and did not have its poisonous fangs anymore.</p>
<p>‘All that is left is to finish things.’</p>
<p>Tick. Tock.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock were moving toward four in the morning.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman would come once the day ended on the other side.</p>
<p>Cale was waiting for morning to arrive.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Alberu elegantly placed a teacup on top of the table.</p>
<p>He tasted the tea in his mouth before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“Transforming dead mana…”</p>
<p>He recalled the conversation he had with Ron just now.</p>
<p>‘I followed Chief Priest Gersey and saw him enter the Temple of the Demonic God.’</p>
<p>The Temple of the Demonic God was in the Section 2 temple district.</p>
<p>‘I also saw the White Star's sculpture you mentioned before in there, your highness.’</p>
<p>It was the temple that revered the existence called Barrow.</p>
<p>That Barrow was presumed to be the White Star.</p>
<p>‘There were eight large circular glass coffins with that sculpture at the center and the priests were continuously pouring some type of fluid into the coffins.’</p>
<p>Ron had searched the nearby area after seeing that.</p>
<p>‘Priests were standing around the dead mana and doing something to it which transformed it into that other liquid.’</p>
<p>After his investigation…</p>
<p>‘After that, I snuck up behind Chief Priest Gersey who was leaving, knocked him unconscious, and immediately ran away.’</p>
<p>‘Did he leave alone?’</p>
<p>‘No. He had a large number of priests with him. But I couldn’t help it since that bastard looked as if he was about to summon something.’</p>
<p>‘You somehow managed to openly abduct him.’</p>
<p>Ron had a benign smile on his face.</p>
<p>‘It was quite difficult. It would have been easier to kill him.’</p>
<p>Alberu felt that his voice was vicious right now.</p>
<p>Ron had made the right decision.</p>
<p>Alberu raised his hand and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Pour.”</p>
<p>Beacrox silently emptied the container of water in his hand.</p>
<p>Splash-</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The unconscious Chief Priest Gersey’s body started to twitch and his eyelids started to shake.</p>
<p>Inside a room in the black castle…</p>
<p>At a spot that was far away from the others…</p>
<p>In this room where the windows were covered and the only source of light were the candles inside…</p>
<p>Alberu… Ron and Beacrox…</p>
<p>Only the three of them were here with the Chief Priest.</p>
<p>Alberu opened his mouth and started to speak in a stoic voice.</p>
<p>“I know you’re conscious already, so is there a need to keep your eyes closed?”</p>
<p>Slash. Slash.</p>
<p>The sound of Beacrox grinding his knives echoed in the room as well.</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey's body flinched.</p>
<p>He heard Alberu’s gentle voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Everything you are imagining will become a reality if you don’t open your eyes right now. What do you think?”</p>
<p>A gentle smile was on Alberu's face.</p>
<p>“Should I turn your imaginations into reality?”</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey opened his eyes at that moment.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>He then flailed around as best as he could while being completely tied up and glared at Alberu.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Alberu just quietly looked down at Gersey.</p>
<p>‘I don’t have any plans on torturing him, but…’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he and Beacrox were just putting up an act right now.</p>
<p>This place was said to be Raon’s castle.</p>
<p>Even if Raon was a Dragon, they couldn’t do such terrible deeds inside the place of a child.</p>
<p>‘But it looks like he's been fooled by our ruse.’</p>
<p>Alberu could read the fear in Gersey's eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Beacrox grinding his knives had fooled him.</p>
<p>But there was something Alberu did not know.</p>
<p>Gersey was feeling even warier from Alberu’s stoic gaze that made it feel as if Alberu was looking down as he observed him than from Beacrox grinding his knives.</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey's shoulders flinched after seeing Alberu get up from the couch and start to walk over to him.</p>
<p>Alberu came right up to Gersey and reached his hand out.</p>
<p>“Gersey. What is inside your head?”</p>
<p>Alberu’s hand slowly raised Gersey's head.</p>
<p>Gersey saw it.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>He saw one of the Endable Kingdom's Counts.</p>
<p>He saw the person who had left to invade the Black Castle in the Forest of Darkness with young master Naru.</p>
<p>He saw that the Dark Elf, Count Mock, was inside something that looked like a coffin with an extremely pale complexion.</p>
<p>Of course, they had just knocked him unconscious and put him there; that Dark Elf was completely fine and even had all of his injuries healed.</p>
<p>Sadly, Gersey did not know that.</p>
<p>All he could see was Count Mock lying there as if he was dead.</p>
<p>He heard Alberu’s laugh-filled voice by his ears at that moment.</p>
<p>“It’s best to tell us everything you know if you wish to live.”</p>
<p>Gersey saw Ron standing by the coffin with Count Mock at that moment.</p>
<p>He could see the intentions in Ron's eyes.</p>
<p>‘I'm going to kill you.’</p>
<p>He could see the murderous intentions in Ron's eyes.</p>
<p>Alberu removed his hand from Gersey’s face once Gersey quieted down and stopped flailing.</p>
<p>He then looked toward Ron.</p>
<p>Ron made eye contact with Alberu with a benign expression as if he had never looked at Gersey with a vicious gaze.</p>
<p>“Free this man’s mouth.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness.”</p>
<p>Ron removed the gag in Gersey’s mouth and moved behind Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak again.</p>
<p>“The sealed god.”</p>
<p>Gersey did not show any reaction after hearing that.</p>
<p>Alberu continued to speak.</p>
<p>“The White Star, no… Cale Barrow. Why does that bastard follow the sealed god?”</p>
<p>Alberu recalled something Cale had written on his body.</p>
<p>[ There is something I find weird. ]</p>
<p>[ If the White Star is someone who serves the sealed god, shouldn’t he have put the sealed god's sculpture in the Temple of the Demonic God? ]</p>
<p>[ Why did that bastard put a sculpture of himself? ]</p>
<p>The sculpture in the temple was a sculpture of the White Star that they called Barrow, his last name.</p>
<p>[ It was as if he was the god. ]</p>
<p>That last phrase had been etched deep inside Alberu's mind.</p>
<p>It was because of what Cale had written after that.</p>
<p>[ This is someone who endlessly reincarnates after paying the terrible cost of killing all of his family members. That bastard is someone who cannot have anything that is precious to him because of a curse. ]</p>
<p>The White Star had been cursed to lose anything he found precious.</p>
<p>He had not faltered because of that and continued to gather forces as he pushed forward toward his goal.</p>
<p>[ But a bastard like that serving a god? ]</p>
<p>[ Do you think his intentions are true? ]</p>
<p>‘Absolutely not.’</p>
<p>Alberu was certain that the White Star’s intentions were not true.</p>
<p>That was why he nonchalantly asked Gersey, who was just looking at him without much reaction.</p>
<p>"What does the White Star desire from the sealed god?”</p>
<p>It was as if he had thrown a rock into a lake.</p>
<p>Alberu’s question made Gersey’s pupils shake violently.</p>
<p>Cale had written more things on Alberu’s back.</p>
<p>[ The truth about the White Star and his relationship with the sealed god. Hyung-nim, please, you must figure out that part of the puzzle. ]</p>
<p>[ And once I return… ]</p>
<p>[ Let’s have the final battle. ] </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 617: Bye! 5</p>
<p>The final battle.</p>
<p>The peace that would come afterward.</p>
<p>Just thinking about that put a smile on Alberu’s face.</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey got the chills after seeing a gentle and calm smile appear on Alberu’s face.</p>
<p>The White Star.</p>
<p>No matter how talented he was and regardless of how he could reincarnate over and over through this curse that couldn't be considered a curse… He was still human.</p>
<p>But Alberu was asking what a human wanted from a god while smiling?</p>
<p>‘…He’s not normal.’</p>
<p>Gersey was thinking that something was twisted with this bastard as well.</p>
<p>Something was twisted with Alberu, similar to his liege.</p>
<p>Alberu walked a circle around Gersey as he started to speak.</p>
<p>"The ancient White Star gathered ancient powers with the five different attributes of nature. He is said to have been worshipped by his followers and became a god.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of his efforts had turned into nothing when he lost the battle against the other ancient power users.</p>
<p>“Cale Barrow.”</p>
<p>Alberu was thinking that, although there were two individuals named Cale, this Cale was extremely annoying to even think about as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“That person carried on the name of the White Star.”</p>
<p>That meant that he was carrying on the will of the ancient White Star and showed that he wanted to achieve what the ancient White Star had failed to do.</p>
<p>“He wishes to become a god.”</p>
<p>The sculpture of Barrow in the Temple of the Demonic God was proof of it.</p>
<p>But it seemed as if he didn't want to just be a regular god.</p>
<p>“He also desires the power of the Demonic race.”</p>
<p>Cale had said the following to Alberu.</p>
<p>[ Hyung-nim, wouldn't someone like that be greedy for the powers of a god as well? ]</p>
<p>“Wouldn't someone like that be greedy for the powers of a god as well?”</p>
<p>Greedy for the powers of a god.</p>
<p>That greed was something that was quite difficult, almost impossible, to achieve.</p>
<p>But was the White Star the kind of bastard who would give up because something seemed impossible?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>“The White Star has the tenacity to reincarnate tens and even hundreds of times. Wouldn’t he dream of becoming a perfect existence?”</p>
<p>Someone with the determination to give up his family and numerous cherished individuals for power should want something at least at that level.</p>
<p>"That bastard took everything that the ancient White Star, the person who was claimed to be the strongest human ever, once possessed.”</p>
<p>In addition.</p>
<p>“He also gained the power of the Demonic race.”</p>
<p>Furthermore.</p>
<p>“He’s also greedy for the powers of a god.”</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>“He’s probably dreaming of becoming an existence that has everything.”</p>
<p>The White Star was probably greedy for something greater than a god.</p>
<p>[ Hyung-nim. Do you think the other gods sent us all sorts of signals in order to simply get in the sealed god’s way? ]</p>
<p>[ Gods are unable to meddle with things happening down below without a good reason. That is the law. ]</p>
<p>Alberu started to think about the gods that they had even the slightest of interactions with until now.</p>
<p>The God of Death, the Sun God, the God of War.</p>
<p>Something that three gods would get involved with…</p>
<p>‘If the White Star gathers everything he wants one by one as he planned…’</p>
<p>It made sense for the gods to be concerned.</p>
<p>“Chief Priest Gersey, as you probably know already, the powers of a god are not something that can be obtained just because someone wants it.”</p>
<p>Alberu moved away from Gersey and sat down on the couch again.</p>
<p>“Which god would be willing to share their powers?”</p>
<p>Gods were not benevolent beings that were willing to share everything in Alberu’s opinion.</p>
<p>They were beings who could curse humans and even their bloodline.</p>
<p>‘Well, it is possible that a god would let someone borrow a portion of their powers.’</p>
<p>However, the god involved in this situation…</p>
<p>The sealed god was not someone who would do that. It was obvious based on what he was doing to Cale.</p>
<p>“The sealed god sharing his powers with the White Star?”</p>
<p>Alberu started to chuckle as if even he knew what he had just said was ridiculous.</p>
<p>He looked down at Gersey.</p>
<p>[ Your highness. ]</p>
<p>Cale had said the following.</p>
<p>[ Do you think he is planning on taking it away by force and stealing it? ]</p>
<p>“He’s trying to steal it, isn't he?”</p>
<p>Chief Priest Gersey's eyes were shaking, but not because his mind was chaotic.</p>
<p>Alberu had asked a question.</p>
<p>He wanted to know if the White Star was trying to steal the sealed god’s powers.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Am I right?”</p>
<p>Unlike Cale who had just had a hypothesis, Alberu was quite certain that was the case.</p>
<p>Power and influence.</p>
<p>Those were things that he wanted to a degree as well, the things that he had desired as he grew up.</p>
<p>“I'm right.”</p>
<p>That was why he got the answer he needed just by looking at Gersey’s expression.</p>
<p>“Chief Priest. Do you know what kind of expression you have right now?”</p>
<p>Flinch.</p>
<p>Gersey lowered his head as he had no idea what expression was on his face right now.</p>
<p>He could hear Alberu's voice coming from above as he continued to keep his head down.</p>
<p>“It’s the same expression the bastard nobles in my kingdom have as they shake in fear that I might take their power away. I know the minds of those kinds of bastards very well.”</p>
<p>“…What bullshit!”</p>
<p>The Chief Priest started to frown and raised his voice.</p>
<p>How dare Alberu compare him to a mere noble that wants power?!</p>
<p>Someone like him who dreamt of a great world was different than some noble bastards.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? It looks similar to me.”</p>
<p>Regardless of what Gersey thought, the expressions looked almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>“I!”</p>
<p>Gersey glared at Alberu as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I will not tell you anything! That, that-”</p>
<p>He then turned toward Beacrox.</p>
<p>“No matter what cruel things you do to me with those daggers, I am someone who dreams of achieving greatness! I will never say anything!”</p>
<p>“I don't need it.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Alberu stood up, looked down at Gersey, and nonchalantly commented.</p>
<p>“I don't need it. I don’t need you to say anything.”</p>
<p>“…There’s no way-”</p>
<p>Alberu stoically looked down at Gersey who was at a loss for words at this unexpected situation.</p>
<p>‘Let’s not rush things.’</p>
<p>Alberu wanted to drag all of the information out of this bastard.</p>
<p>However, the more urgent something was, the more he couldn't rush things.</p>
<p>‘The most important thing today is Cale Henituse and everyone’s survival.</p>
<p>He would complete that task first before taking care of other things one by one.</p>
<p>‘Plus, I need this bastard to get anxious.’</p>
<p>Alberu turned away from Gersey.</p>
<p>He then walked out of the room.</p>
<p>He heard a flustered Gersey's voice behind him.</p>
<p>“D, don't you want to know how he is planning on stealing a god’s power?”</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Alberu was curious.</p>
<p>It was impossible to destroy a god.</p>
<p>But he could not let Gersey take away his upper hand.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness.”</p>
<p>Ron calmly asked him a question.</p>
<p>“Should I bury that coffin?”</p>
<p>He was speaking about the sleeping Count Mock who looked as if he was dead.</p>
<p>Ron had a benign smile on his face as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to leave something useless around to annoy us, is there?”</p>
<p>He was clearly talking about the coffin. However, his eyes were looking at Gersey.</p>
<p>Gersey, who had been adamant that he would persist through even torture, could do nothing as his pupils started to shake again.</p>
<p>‘I guess he is afraid of death.’</p>
<p>Alberu chuckled and responded back.</p>
<p>“You take care of things.”</p>
<p>He then nonchalantly added on as he grabbed the doorknob.</p>
<p>“Both that and this.”</p>
<p>Gersey realized that the ‘this’ was talking about him.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>It was because he saw the cold smiles on the faces of the Molan bastards.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody other than Gersey knew that everything that they were saying were just threats that they had no intentions of carrying out.</p>
<p>‘The two of them will dry Gersey out on their own.’</p>
<p>Alberu was thinking that things had become a bit easier for him.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Beeeeeeeeep- Beeeeeeeeeeeep-</p>
<p>He heard a sharp alarm.</p>
<p>‘The video communication device……!’</p>
<p>Alberu took the video communication device out of his pocket.</p>
<p>It was an emergency warning signal.</p>
<p>‘The person sending it is… Duke Fredo!’</p>
<p>Duke Fredo, the leader of the Vampires who was back in the Endable Kingdom was contacting him.</p>
<p>It seemed to be an emergency.</p>
<p>‘I need to pick this up!’</p>
<p>He needed to get rid of Gersey and Mock in order to do that.</p>
<p>Alberu urgently raised his head.</p>
<p>“I will get rid of them.”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh!”</p>
<p>Shhhhhhh- shhhhhhh-</p>
<p>A person grabbed the large coffin Count Mock was in with one hand while grabbing Gersey by the back of his clothes with his other hand.</p>
<p>He then started to drag both of them away.</p>
<p>“Please feel free to take care of business.”</p>
<p>That man was Beacrox.</p>
<p>Beacrox then calmly walked out the door.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak after seeing the door close.</p>
<p>“Ron, your son truly is a sharp man.”</p>
<p>“You're right, your highness. He’s quite intelligent.”</p>
<p>Ron pretended as if he wasn’t happy before slipping in praise for Beacrox, but Alberu couldn't say anything as he was busy connecting the video communication device right away.</p>
<p>"Duke Fredo!”</p>
<p>Alberu then started to frown.</p>
<p>-Ch-Chhhhhhhhh, w, we, chhhhhh--</p>
<p>The other side's video communication was quite unstable.</p>
<p>The sound was terrible and the video screen was full of static that they couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>That meant that his mana was being disturbed or that the nearby area was quite unstable.</p>
<p>Gersey.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was the reason Alberu didn’t have to rush Gersey’s questioning, but this situation made Alberu anxious.</p>
<p>“What is going on?”</p>
<p>-Chhhhhh--, escape, chh---</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>‘We? Escape?’</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown even more.</p>
<p>“Duke Fredo, are you okay?”</p>
<p>He could barely make out Duke Fredo's voice through the static.The White Star-, chhhhhh, Endable Kingdom, hunters to bring in sacrifices, chhh---</p>
<p>‘Sacrifices?’The Wolf tribe, chhhhh! Sky, m, mountain--</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>The call suddenly ended.</p>
<p>“Your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu heard Ron's voice next to him while he channeled his dead mana again.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong-</p>
<p>The video communication device reacted and attempted to connect something.</p>
<p>“Damn it. It’s not working!”</p>
<p>He could not connect with Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>Alberu tried a few times before starting to swear.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>He then changed the target of his call.Your highness?</p>
<p>Mercenary King Bud was the one to pick up.</p>
<p>“Mercenary King.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>The Wolf tribe and Sky Mountain.</p>
<p>“Please figure out the situation in the Eastern continent right away. Also, is there a place called Sky Mountain on the Eastern continent?”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Yes, there is! There is a Sky Mountain! But why-”</p>
<p>“Please take care of what I just told you first.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Then he hung up the call.</p>
<p>He then started to speak to Ron who was standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Go bring Lock over right away.”</p>
<p>Sky Mountain.</p>
<p>“The Wolves that Duke Fredo managed to hide away should be on Sky Mountain.”</p>
<p>He then immediately contacted the Roan Kingdom’s palace.Your highness! How did the task-</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>The person Alberu contacted stopped smiling after seeing Alberu’s stiff expression and low voice.</p>
<p>Alberu then gave him an order.</p>
<p>“Immediately contact all kingdoms on the Eastern and Western continent!”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said the following.</p>
<p>‘The White Star-, chhhhhh, Endable Kingdom, hunters to bring in sacrifices, chhh---’</p>
<p>That was enough for Alberu to have an idea as to what was going on.</p>
<p>The White Star was planning on using the residents of the Endable Kingdom as hunters to bring in sacrifices.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what the sacrifices were.</p>
<p>“The Endable Kingdom’s warriors might invade and abduct people!”</p>
<p>He needed to prepare for the worst.Your highness, what are you saying all of a sudden?!</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we are placing the entire Roan Kingdom on emergency status! Do it now!”Your highness!</p>
<p>Alberu’s voice calmed down and became even lower.</p>
<p>“Do it immediately. Do as I say. I will explain it to you later.”…Yes, sir!</p>
<p>He heard his subordinate’s response before hanging up the call and looking toward Ron before starting to speak again.</p>
<p>The Forest of Darkness. There were some people he needed to call now that he had Cale staying here.</p>
<p>“Go bring Duke Henituse and Duchess Violan over.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Chhh-</p>
<p>His video communication device shook unstably again.</p>
<p>‘Duke Fredo!’</p>
<p>Alberu quickly connected the call again.</p>
<p>-Chhhhhh--, chhhhhh--</p>
<p>However, the quality was even worse than before.</p>
<p>The screen was black and he couldn’t hear most of what Fredo was saying.</p>
<p>"Duke Fredo!”</p>
<p>As Alberu raised his voice in frustration…</p>
<p>The call ended after Alberu managed to hear just two words.Location, chhhh, Puzzle, chhh!</p>
<p>He had clearly heard Duke Fredo say those two words.</p>
<p>Only silence filled the room after that.</p>
<p>Alberu slowly started to speak in the quiet room.</p>
<p>‘Puzzle.’</p>
<p>“…Puzzle City?”</p>
<p>Alberu turned toward Ron. Ron slowly started to speak as well.</p>
<p>“It's a city famous for its rock towers and for supposedly falling out of grace with a god.”</p>
<p>Puzzle City.</p>
<p>A city famous for its rock towers and for the Rock Tower festival. It was the city that was the center of the transportation of goods in the northeast region of the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>That place had a myth related to being a city that has fallen out of grace with a god.</p>
<p>It was also the city that Cale had earned his second ancient power, the ‘Vitality of the Heart.’</p>
<p>Alberu opened his mouth and started to mumble.</p>
<p>“…Location… Puzzle… And sacrifices… gathering them-”</p>
<p>What would happen after gathering sacrifices?</p>
<p>“…Summoning.”</p>
<p>That should mean that when Fredo said location…</p>
<p>He was probably talking about where the summoning would happen.</p>
<p>And that place was…</p>
<p>“Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes lit up in anger.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>He started to smile in disbelief.</p>
<p>“He’s going to come to the Roan Kingdom?”</p>
<p>Silence filled the room again.</p>
<p>But Alberu was the one to break the silence again.</p>
<p>“I guess he wants to die.”</p>
<p>He looked out the window.</p>
<p>The sun was setting and the red sky was visible along with the dark blue night sky.</p>
<p>6 pm.</p>
<p>The day would end in six hours.</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes that he had closed once he got on the watchtower and started to speak.</p>
<p>“…One hour.”</p>
<p>It would be 8 am in just one hour.</p>
<p>That would mean that Cale Henituse on the other side would have safely lived past the day.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. What do you mean by one hour?”</p>
<p>Cale turned his head after hearing a voice behind him.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk walked up to the watchtower.</p>
<p>Only the two of them were here right now.</p>
<p>“Hey, Rok Soo. Did you have something to say to me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale had asked the other Kim Rok Soo inside his body.</p>
<p>The other Kim Rok Soo had had a lot of influence on this decision.</p>
<p>Cale and Kim Rok Soo had come to a conclusion after discussing this issue with each other for a long time.</p>
<p>‘I'm going to do it now.’You need to think about my situation once you leave.</p>
<p>The Kim Rok Soo from this world responded without any hesitation.</p>
<p>‘Is it really okay to tell him?’Tell him. It’s okay to tell Soo Hyuk hyung. I want to tell him.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head after hearing that Kim Rok Soo wanted to do so.</p>
<p>It was time to tell Lee Soo Hyuk the truth. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 618: Our human is here! 1</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, is your body feeling okay?”</p>
<p>Cale started to think after hearing what Lee Soo Hyuk said to him as soon as he came up.</p>
<p>‘Is this the right time to tell him?’</p>
<p>The Kim Rok Soo of this world responded to him.You're probably thinking about telling him after taking care of the monster. But who knows when you will go back?</p>
<p>‘That is true. But what if his mind is a chaotic mess during the battle because I tell him the truth right now?’Soo Hyuk hyung already knows that you are different from before, doesn’t he?</p>
<p>Cale recalled what Lee Soo Hyuk had told him earlier in the night before they started the battle.</p>
<p>‘Kim Rok Soo, I know that you are hiding something.’</p>
<p>‘You are the same Kim Rok Soo I know from the past, but I know that something has changed.’</p>
<p>The Kim Rok Soo of this world calmly continued to speak.I understand why you are hesitating.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously chuckled.</p>
<p>Although the Kim Rok Soo of this world was only twenty years old, Cale thought that the only one who could truly understand him was himself.</p>
<p>‘It is beneficial to tell him.’Yes. Plus, Soo Hyuk hyung isn’t the type to carry a chaotic mindset into battle.</p>
<p>‘That’s true.’</p>
<p>It was beneficial to tell him.</p>
<p>However, Cale couldn’t help but think about the Lee Soo Hyuk of his world who had left his side a long time ago.</p>
<p>‘I also need to think about your situation once I leave.’Yes.</p>
<p>The situation once Cale left this body.</p>
<p>It was possible that the Kim Rok Soo of this world would take over the body right away, but it was also possible that he might faint or something and take some time before he woke up in his body again.</p>
<p>It would be great to have at least one helper in case something like that happened.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale made up his mind.</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung?”</p>
<p>“Your body?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head after hearing the question again.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt relieved seeing Cale smiling and nodding his head unlike how he had been earlier.</p>
<p>Cale's condition was much better than earlier now.</p>
<p>‘Objectively speaking, it’s still not good though.’</p>
<p>He was still pale.</p>
<p>But the fact that he was no longer convulsing or coughing up blood was a relief.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“My body is still not in a good condition.”</p>
<p>Flinch.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>‘…I thought he had been okay since our meeting in the grand assembly hall earlier.’</p>
<p>Had all of that been an act?</p>
<p>Had he pretended to be okay because he was concerned that the others would be worried?</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's face completely stiffened after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“Soo Hyuk hyung, to be honest with you, my body's condition has been terrible since before I met up with you here.”</p>
<p>Step step.</p>
<p>Cale slowly walked to the railing of the watchtower. He then looked far out in the distance.</p>
<p>It was morning.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse’s day would end in that world soon.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Cale could feel Lee Soo Hyuk moving over and standing next to him even without looking at him.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with your body?”</p>
<p>“There are many issues.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had a rare frown on his face.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Kim Rok Soo. Lee Soo Hyuk brushed his hair back and started to speak again since only the two of them were up here right now.</p>
<p>“Okay, what kind-”</p>
<p>“I guess one obvious reason for it would be the fact that it is not Kim Rok Soo in this body.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk blanked out for a moment.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>He heard a nonchalant voice respond to him.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk, I'm saying that the Kim Rok Soo you know is not the one possessing this body.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk placed his hand on his scabbard.</p>
<p>Cale quietly looked at him while Lee Soo Hyuk silently removed his scabbard from his hip. He then placed it on one side of the watchtower.</p>
<p>He then looked back toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Explain.”</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed Lee Soo Hyuk, who unarmed himself to make the gesture that he would listen to what Cale had to say.</p>
<p>“I.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“I am a Kim Rok Soo you don’t know.”</p>
<p>Similar to how the Kim Rok Soo of this world was still young, the Lee Soo Hyuk here was much younger than the final memory Cale had of Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“I am thirty-six years old. No. I guess I'm thirty-eight now. Anyway, I'm older than you. Pffft.”</p>
<p>Cale chuckled.</p>
<p>“I'm actually the hyung here.”</p>
<p>Cale casually looked away from Lee Soo Hyuk whose eyebrows had slightly lifted up.</p>
<p>It was now early November.</p>
<p>The cold morning breeze brushed past his cheeks.</p>
<p>Cale started to share his story.</p>
<p>“In my world, once I turned thirty-six years old…”</p>
<p>Silence filled the area for a moment.</p>
<p>Cale soon started to speak again.</p>
<p>“There is no longer a team leader Lee Soo Hyuk.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk let out a small gasp.</p>
<p>“Choi Jung Soo, Grandma Kim. The Lee siblings, Park Jin Tae, none of you are there.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped talking again.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk just quietly stared at Cale.</p>
<p>He finally realized what the difference he had felt from Kim Rok Soo had been.</p>
<p>He had originally thought it was because Kim Rok Soo had used very odd abilities to be considered as having foresight.</p>
<p>He had also thought that it was because Kim Rok Soo had seemed sharper than before and had a way of drawing people to him unlike in the past.</p>
<p>But they were both wrong.</p>
<p>‘Those eyes.’</p>
<p>Those eyes that were preparing for the future and the enemy that might show up at any moment were extremely deep.</p>
<p>They were too deep to say that they were the eyes of a twenty-year-old, even if they had become deeper because he knew some things about the future.</p>
<p>They were too deep to say that it was just because he knew a lot of things.</p>
<p>‘There were a lot of emotions in them.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was someone who had dreamt of becoming an action movie actor.</p>
<p>That was why he could tell that there were numerous emotions behind Kim Rok Soo's eyes.</p>
<p>They were always there.</p>
<p>He finally realized it.</p>
<p>Cale finally started to speak again.</p>
<p>"And I am the only one who survived.”</p>
<p>Everybody had died.</p>
<p>But I am still alive.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk thought Cale looked extremely tired as he said that.</p>
<p>But Cale quickly pushed that fatigue out of his eyes. A firm yet stoic gaze was directed at Lee Soo Hyuk once again.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk felt this Kim Rok Soo's true age for the first time.</p>
<p>‘He’s an adult. He’s much older than I am.’</p>
<p>Cale didn’t know what Lee Soo Hyuk was thinking and just focused on explaining things to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>There was no need to share the pieces of emotions that remained in his mind with Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“I woke up one day and I ended up in this world's Kim Rok Soo's body. I had thought that I had returned to the past, however…”</p>
<p>This place was not the past.</p>
<p>“It was not the past but a different world.”</p>
<p>“…A parallel universe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I realized that it was a parallel universe. This is a different Earth. It is different from the place I know.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was thinking that Cale's voice was quite calm.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I started to do everything I could do since I realized that fact.”</p>
<p>That sentence…</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could sense the heavy weight of everything through that single sentence.</p>
<p>It was because he had seen, heard, or experienced everything Kim Rok Soo had done since then.</p>
<p>‘Anyway.’</p>
<p>That word could not explain the time that had passed.</p>
<p>‘Everything I could do.’</p>
<p>These words were too trivial to explain everything he had done.</p>
<p>“And once we defeat this first unranked monster… I think that I will probably return to my own world after that.”</p>
<p>Cale pointed toward his heart.</p>
<p>“By the way, the real Rok Soo is in here. He’ll return later. He’s also seeing and hearing this conversation as well as everything that is going on.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk stopped frowning.</p>
<p>Cale thought that this was very much like Lee Soo Hyuk as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk, telling you about all of this was something that both of us decided together.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped there and quietly observed Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>He was also looking right at Cale as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>All he got back was that short response.</p>
<p>“You don't question whether I am lying?”</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk walked over to Cale.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>He then placed his hand on Cale's shoulder.</p>
<p>His expression was quite serious.</p>
<p>“Lee Soo Hyuk was your hyung in that world too, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>He was his hyung, team leader, role model, and family.</p>
<p>“And I am this world's Rok Soo's hyung.”</p>
<p>A picturesque smile appeared on Lee Soo Hyuk's face.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, call me hyung. It’s rude to call your hyung, ‘you.’ Don't you agree?”</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Cale let out a short laugh.…As expected of Soo Hyuk hyung.</p>
<p>‘I know, right?’</p>
<p>Cale agreed with this world’s Kim Rok Soo's assessment.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk continued to speak as if he said nothing weird.</p>
<p>"All sorts of things are happening in this world. Something like this is nothing.”</p>
<p>He then picked his sword back up.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, I've seen how much you’ve struggled. Not just me, everybody saw it. How could we suspect you after all of that?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had seen the despair in Cale’s eyes.</p>
<p>That was not something anybody could fake.</p>
<p>Such a person…</p>
<p>“You think I would question someone who tried to save not just me but everybody else here?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk shook his head.</p>
<p>“I can't do that.”</p>
<p>“That’s how you are, hyung.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk nodded his head with satisfaction after seeing that Cale had returned to speaking respectfully to him.</p>
<p>He then nonchalantly made a comment.</p>
<p>“How did I die in the other world?”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded back.</p>
<p>“Saving my life.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>“You were saving our team members and other people as well. You saved people left and right before leaving the world before I did.”</p>
<p>“Sounds exactly like you.”</p>
<p>“…Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s exactly how you look right now. You look like you would even get yourself killed to save the person next to you.”</p>
<p>‘So take care of yourself too.’</p>
<p>That was the meaning behind Lee Soo Hyuk’s statement.</p>
<p>But Cale shook his head.</p>
<p>“Hyung, you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see Cale’s firm gaze.</p>
<p>“I will survive no matter what.”</p>
<p>Cale’s confident voice had more conviction than ever before.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk then realized this.</p>
<p>“So hyung, please survive no matter what as well. You must survive no matter what happens.”</p>
<p>‘This punk wants me and himself… He wants everybody to survive.’</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could feel a deep sense of commitment that he couldn’t even fathom.</p>
<p>That was why he responded like this.</p>
<p>“I plan on surviving.”</p>
<p>He added on without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“All of us together.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was also being serious and Cale, as well as the Kim Rok Soo of this world, could feel it.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>A slightly warmer than before but still cold breeze brushed past them.</p>
<p>Cale felt as if that breeze was washing away a lot of different feelings inside him.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk calmly asked a question at that moment.</p>
<p>“What are you like in your original world?”</p>
<p>“Mm, I'm not sure.”</p>
<p>Cale wondered if it was okay to have such a peaceful conversation like this with the Lee Soo Hyuk of this world but decided to respond for now.</p>
<p>“I just lived a so-so life until a few years ago. I just worked my ass off at work.”</p>
<p>But after that…</p>
<p>He had opened his eyes in a new body named Cale Henituse and had lived about two years in that body.</p>
<p>There weren’t many ways to express what had happened during those past two years.</p>
<p>If he had to pick something…</p>
<p>“Now though… These days, it is easier to push forward.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>Cale closed his eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>The memories of the past few years brushed through his mind.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of things I need to do.”</p>
<p>Numerous things that were not fighting monsters came up and prevented him from having his slacker life.</p>
<p>“There are many people waiting for me as well.”</p>
<p>Forget rolling around and lazing at home, there were too many people he had to meet with.</p>
<p>In addition.</p>
<p>“…There are many people I wish to see as well.”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>Beeeeeeeeeeep-- Beeeeeeeeep--</p>
<p>Cale looked toward a section of the watchtower.</p>
<p>He saw the clock strike 8 am as the alarm continued to ring.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Hehe, hehahahaha-”</p>
<p>That chuckle then turned into loud laughter.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, why are you suddenly laughing?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk found this random laughter to be odd but he could see that Cale’s laughter was quite refreshing.</p>
<p>Cale continued to laugh as he responded to the question.</p>
<p>‘Why am I laughing?’</p>
<p>“I can do as I please now.”</p>
<p>8 am.</p>
<p>The moment the minute hand passed away from 8 am…</p>
<p>At that exact moment…</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>He could hear the ground rumbling.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng!”</p>
<p>He also heard a familiar voice shouting for him.</p>
<p>Cale immediately looked down from the watchtower. Lee Soo Hyuk looked down as well.</p>
<p>They saw a monster with a large body.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman, the Dark Tiger, was down below.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see the smile appearing on the Dark Tiger's face.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger started to shout.</p>
<p>“Let’s take care of things and go!”</p>
<p>“That sounds great, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>The moment Cale responded…</p>
<p>Beeeeeep- Beeeeeeep--</p>
<p>They heard an emergency alarm.</p>
<p>It was an alarm that would only go off for one reason.</p>
<p>“It came at a good time.”</p>
<p>The yellow head had shown itself once again.</p>
<p>They would finally put an end to this disgusting monster bastard.</p>
<p>Cale turned his head and looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Let’s go fight, hyung.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, let's go. Let’s go, my dongsaeng Rok Soo.” </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 619: Our human is here! 2</p>
<p>Cale started to walk down the stairs of the watchtower.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was Choi Han waiting for him.</p>
<p>Pat.</p>
<p>Cale put his hand on Choi Han’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung, are you done with your chat?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Choi Han's gaze headed over Cale’s shoulder toward Lee Soo Hyuk who had walked down as well.</p>
<p>“I'm sure there is a reason our Han is so courteous to Rok Soo as well.”</p>
<p>Choi Han showed a level of politeness that could not be simply explained through a hyung-dongsaeng relationship.</p>
<p>He could sense a deep bond between the two.</p>
<p>Choi Han nodded his head at Lee Soo Hyuk's statement.</p>
<p>“I am Choi Jung Soo’s paternal cousin once removed.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk blankly asked back while Cale calmly added on.</p>
<p>“He’s a senior. A total senior. He’s even older than Grandma Kim, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was silent for a moment before he started to speak.</p>
<p>"This is the most shocking thing I've heard.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Taaaaap- taaaaaap-</p>
<p>They heard some footsteps and saw Kim Min Joon running toward them with walkie-talkies.</p>
<p>"Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>The monster has appeared.</p>
<p>He was about to shout that before stopping himself. It was because he realized that Cale must have already seen everything from the watchtower.</p>
<p>Instead, he just handed a walkie-talkie into Cale’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>"Are you okay, sir?”</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon cautiously asked.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>He could see the corners of Cale’s lips moving up.</p>
<p>The Commander walked past Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>“Let's go.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon quickly turned around and looked at his commander's back.</p>
<p>His back was not shaking.</p>
<p>It was small, but it felt as if it was the largest and strongest back.</p>
<p>‘This time!’</p>
<p>We can finally see the end of that monster this time.</p>
<p>His instincts were telling him that that would be the case.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon followed behind Cale, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Choi Han and walked along the shelter wall.</p>
<p>Cale was walking toward his destination without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Commander!”</p>
<p>"Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>Many people greeted him as he walked along the wall.</p>
<p>The monster had appeared again.</p>
<p>The yellow head was charging toward them through the fog that was covering the sun.</p>
<p>Could they win?</p>
<p>The people were half-filled with fear and half-filled with worry, but they all clenched their weapons after seeing the calm and peaceful demeanor of the person in charge.</p>
<p>“…Commander.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja was guarding the shelter gate.</p>
<p>She made eye contact with the approaching commander.</p>
<p>“Please open the gate.”</p>
<p>Heo Sook Ja did not say anything back to Cale.</p>
<p>She just gave the signal.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The gate opened and wind gathered around Cale's ankles.</p>
<p>He then jumped over the ledge and fell down.</p>
<p>Swiiiiiiiish- Swiiiiiiiish-</p>
<p>The wind carried him down before he landed on a fluffy back.</p>
<p>“What day is it on the other side?”</p>
<p>The owner of the fluffy back responded to Cale's question.</p>
<p>“I fell asleep one minute into November 9th.”</p>
<p>Cale picked up the walkie-talkie and started to speak after he heard Alberu's response.</p>
<p>“All units, to your positions.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger's radiant black mane was fluttering as it rushed forward.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsss!”</p>
<p>He could see the yellow head in front of him.</p>
<p>It was no longer bleeding, but there were large scars where its eyes should have been. The poisonous fangs were no longer present either.</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack.</p>
<p>However, the currents surrounding its body…</p>
<p>Chhhhh-</p>
<p>The water…</p>
<p>And finally…</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack.</p>
<p>The dirt pillars shooting up through the ground as if to protect the yellow head were all present.</p>
<p>The dirt pillars were spinning like whirlwinds as if to prevent the enemies from approaching.</p>
<p>‘It also has its sound ability and its scales.’</p>
<p>But those things weren't very difficult for Cale to handle now.</p>
<p>He spoke into the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>"We will proceed as planned.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae shouted from on top of the shelter wall as soon as he said that.</p>
<p>“Blast it!”</p>
<p>He then pulled the trigger of his gun.</p>
<p>The bullet shot out into the air.</p>
<p>It then exploded.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>That was the beginning.</p>
<p>People all around the shelter walls were launching long-distance attacks into the air.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The explosions were continuing without stopping.</p>
<p>It made their ears go numb.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The yellow head started to frown.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>"All you can hear are explosions from every direction, right?”</p>
<p>If they made a blind monster unable to listen to anything either…</p>
<p>"Then what will you be able to do, you little bastard?”</p>
<p>If it could not see and if it could not hear…</p>
<p>“Is all that you have left your sense of touch?”</p>
<p>In that case…</p>
<p>“Then we just have to tie that down as well.”</p>
<p>The preparations had been completed a long time ago.</p>
<p>“We will destroy the dirt pillars around the monster first.”</p>
<p>His message reached Kim Min Joon and was directed to a different group.Yes, hyung-nim.</p>
<p>Choi Han.Got it.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>I understand, sir!</p>
<p>Yes, sir! I understand!</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.This walkie-talkie is too small for my hands.</p>
<p>The final individual was the large White Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, and his hands that were too big for the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>While the yellow head had been away…</p>
<p>Everybody at the shelter had not just been relaxing as they waited.</p>
<p>They had hunted most of the monsters around the Seomyeon central shelter.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, there were much fewer monsters to run wild along with the appearance of the unranked monster such that Mr. Rabbit was able to participate in this battle as well.</p>
<p>"We will move after them!”</p>
<p>The other attack squads would follow behind this group in the front.</p>
<p>And in the sky…</p>
<p>“My little dongsaeng! I brought this crazy bastard!”</p>
<p>The Steel Feather Hawk opened her wings out to the side.</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik who was on her back clasped his hands together and started to shout.</p>
<p>“I have faith!”</p>
<p>A wide-area buff surrounded the attackers in the front.</p>
<p>“I never expected to be so happy to hear him say that crazy shit!”</p>
<p>“My words exactly!”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's spear shot out toward a large dirt pillar in front of her.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum supported her with his wind.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>One of the dirt pillars crumbled after being pierced by the spear.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah's Herculean Strength had become even more amplified because of Joo Ho-Shik's faith ability.</p>
<p>But she looked around and shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>“My goodness.”</p>
<p>Slash.</p>
<p>A sword slashed through the hair with a quiet noise.</p>
<p>A few moments later…</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion as a dirt pillar was cut in half.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk moved past the crumbling dirt pillar with a stoic expression before slashing toward the next dirt pillar.</p>
<p>He was fast.</p>
<p>But there was someone who was even faster.</p>
<p>Baaang, baaaang, baaang!</p>
<p>Dirt pillars were falling down nonstop.</p>
<p>Dirt pillars were crumbling without any resistance every time a black light shot out from Choi Han's sword.</p>
<p>"Wow, he's no joke.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum was shaking as if he was scared.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Han seemed amazing to him.</p>
<p>“…Bae Puh Rum.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Let’s increase our speed.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I'm overflowing with energy right now.”</p>
<p>Clench.</p>
<p>Veins were popping out of Kim Min Ah's hand that was clenching the spear.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum quickly nodded his head after seeing her smiling as if this was fun.</p>
<p>“Okay! I'm suddenly full of energy too!”</p>
<p>The two of them proceeded to silently destroy dirt pillar after dirt pillar.</p>
<p>But they stopped moving after seeing someone who was destroying them even faster than Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Hoo hoo. How easy.”</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>He jumped up.</p>
<p>“I just.”</p>
<p>A large pair of white ears moved in a diagonal line.</p>
<p>“I just need to slap it with my damn ears.”</p>
<p>Boooooooom-</p>
<p>The dirt pillar in the way of the ears crumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>The White Rabbit then gently landed on the ground.</p>
<p>“Hmm. I suppose it is not bad to learn about them since they are enemies I will need to face in the future.”</p>
<p>His red eyes looked toward the unranked monster.</p>
<p>Now that he had made up his mind to build a home in Korea… Unranked monsters were enemies that Mr. Rabbit had to fight, regardless of the fact that they were stronger than him.</p>
<p>“Until later then, cute children-nims.”</p>
<p>He gave a gentle goodbye before moving past Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.</p>
<p>He then jumped up looking as light as a flower petal before swinging his 'damn ears’ toward another dirt pillar.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Dirt pillars were crumbling all around them.</p>
<p>There was a Dark Tiger that was continuously charging forward through the crumbling pillars.</p>
<p>“Do I just need to keep charging forward?”</p>
<p>He asked Cale who was on his back and Cale grabbed the mane tightly as he calmly responded.</p>
<p>“Yes. Hyung-nim, I will destroy anything that gets in your way.”</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>Alberu laughed at that response.</p>
<p>He then mischievously asked back.</p>
<p>"And I just carry my dongsaeng to that monster?”</p>
<p>"That’s right.”</p>
<p>It was a very easy job.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak as he continued to charge toward the yellow-headed monster.</p>
<p>"Cale, there’s something you need to know.”</p>
<p>“What is it, your highness?”</p>
<p>Cale lowered his head to look at Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu responded in a calm voice.</p>
<p>"We failed to destroy the sculptures.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Cale also responded in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“Yes. They were transforming dead mana into something before feeding it to the sculptures as nutrients.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? From where, no, who did they kill to get dead mana this time?”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head and continued to speak as if he had come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“What a crazy bastard.”</p>
<p>“He sure is. Oh, also.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s voice was still calm.</p>
<p>“I don't know whether it will be the sealed god or the sculptures, but… It looks like the White Star is planning on barging into Puzzle City to cast some kind of summoning ritual.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak immediately.</p>
<p>“That crazy trash-like son of a bitch. I guess he wants to get fucked up.”</p>
<p>“I couldn't have said it better myself.”</p>
<p>Clench.</p>
<p>Cale clenched Alberu’s mane.</p>
<p>Puzzle City.</p>
<p>That was a part of the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>It was extremely close to the Henituse territory in the Roan Kingdom's northeastern region.</p>
<p>Cale started to recall the memories associated with that location.</p>
<p>The city of rock towers disowned by the gods.</p>
<p>A city that made rock towers not for the gods but for themselves.</p>
<p>The place where Cale got his Vitality of the Heart ancient power and first met Taylor and Cage.</p>
<p>The White Star was planning on barging into that place?</p>
<p>He would need more details to understand all of what was going on, however…</p>
<p>For now…</p>
<p>“Let’s take care of this quickly.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>Alberu started to move even faster.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>There were explosions still blasting all around them.</p>
<p>That, plus the sounds of the dirt pillars breaking, made it difficult for the yellow head to move.</p>
<p>Cale was the person who was moving closest to the yellow head.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness?”</p>
<p>Alberu and Cale were casually chatting even though they were charging forward and getting close to the enemy.</p>
<p>“I might wake up in the middle. I told priestess Cage to wake me up if there was an emergency.”</p>
<p>“How did she say she would wake you up?”</p>
<p>“…She said she wouldn’t make me bleed.”</p>
<p>“Then it should be fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Both of their gazes were cold, unlike their peaceful conversation.</p>
<p>"Ah, Cale. We also informed the Henituse Duchy.”</p>
<p>“…What did you tell them?”</p>
<p>“I just told them an appropriate amount.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>Alberu would have known what was appropriate to tell them.</p>
<p>Cale trusted Alberu.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that the Henituse Duchy was placed in a state of emergency with Duchess Violan at the center after hearing Alberu’s message…</p>
<p>And the fact that Duke Deruth Henituse was busy summoning the nobles for a meeting to rally them together…</p>
<p>Cale had no idea about anything.</p>
<p>“Ah. I also informed our allied kingdoms with a short but thorough explanation of the situation because the White Star might be coming to the Western continent.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>That was something they had to do.</p>
<p>Having even one more person helping them out would be beneficial.</p>
<p>“I left Miss Rosalyn to take care of the details since I didn't have time to plan before coming here. I thought Miss Rosalyn would do a great job of explaining things to them.”</p>
<p>“Miss Rosalyn would indeed do a great job.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn was perfect for the job to deal with the representatives of each kingdom since she was originally a princess and would become the future Tower Master of the Magic Tower.</p>
<p>It also helped that Rosalyn knew the situations in each Kingdom very well.</p>
<p>“That's right. Eruhaben-nim and Sheritt-nim are by her side as well. They will help Miss Rosalyn with whatever she needs.”</p>
<p>“That’s an even more reliable group.”</p>
<p>Alberu and Cale both smiled.</p>
<p>It was because they were thinking about their trustworthy friends.</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>Rosalyn was quietly looking at the representatives of each kingdom who were visible through multiple video communication devices in front of her.</p>
<p>Most of their allied kingdoms other than the Mogoru Kingdom that was busy with other issues were participating in this video call.</p>
<p>Eruhaben and Sheritt were standing behind her covered in robes while looking like mages who were guarding her.…That-</p>
<p>On one of the video screens… Litana, the Queen of the Jungle, was speaking as if she couldn't believe what she had heard.That, is that true about young master Cale?</p>
<p>Rosalyn slowly nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Yes, your majesty. It is the truth.”Ho.</p>
<p>Crown prince Valentino was shaking his head in disbelief.Hahahaha! My friend, my friend is truly! Amazing!</p>
<p>Commander Toonka of the Whipper Kingdom was banging on his desk and laughing out loud. But he was frowning at the same time.</p>
<p>It looked as if he was having a hard time holding in his anger.</p>
<p>They heard quiet laughter at that moment.</p>
<p>Rosalyn turned toward the screen with the person who had laughed.</p>
<p>It was a man with white hair and green eyes.</p>
<p>Guardian Knight Clopeh who was here as the representative of the Northern Kingdoms on the Western continent was smiling as he continued to speak.As expected of Commander Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>His hands that were clasped together were slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Clopeh's eyes were sparkling quite a bit as well.It’s wonderful enough that he rejected the opportunity given by the sealed god unlike the White Star and is currently dealing with a god’s test to bring peace to this land, but… He was almost ruthlessly killed by the White Star?</p>
<p>Queen Litana held back a groan and clenched her eyes shut.</p>
<p>She had heard bits and pieces about Cale’s condition while working with the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>But to hear that he had almost been killed while he was defenseless and that his friends had rushed over to save him…</p>
<p>‘…Something like this……’</p>
<p>Litana could not say what was on her mind.</p>
<p>He would have died a terrible death all alone if they had not managed to save him.</p>
<p>All of the representatives heard Clopeh’s voice.He would not have been in such danger if he just went along with the will of the sealed god. There is no way for me to not admire his great conviction.</p>
<p>His voice was calm but full of vigor.The North will participate in the Roan Kingdom's battle, no, the war for the peace of this land no matter what.</p>
<p>Litana raised her head as if to respond to his fervent aura.</p>
<p>We will be with you as well.</p>
<p>We will do whatever we can to help.</p>
<p>My friend saved us! It is our turn to save him!</p>
<p>Rosalyn nodded her head after hearing the comments from all of the representatives.</p>
<p>Alberu decided to push aside the thoughts about what he asked Rosalyn to do for now. He then looked forward and asked Cale a question.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng. What are you going to do about the currents and the water?”</p>
<p>Crackle, crackle.</p>
<p>The yellow head was spreading currents all around it.</p>
<p>There was also water surrounding it as if waves were all around it.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Electric currents and water.</p>
<p>Those two things made it difficult to fight the monster.</p>
<p>“Tie it down of course.”</p>
<p>“You're going to charge forward?”</p>
<p>Alberu was confused but continued to move forward.</p>
<p>“Your highness, I was able to use one of my ancient powers at full power while you were gone.”</p>
<p>Cale calmly responded while explaining what had happened while Alberu was gone.</p>
<p>“That bastard’s ability is not strong enough to defeat my ancient power at full power.”</p>
<p>He knew that that was the case because his trees had been able to tie the yellow head down even when he had been in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>That power was the Indestructible Shield.</p>
<p>Paaaaat-</p>
<p>Silver half-transparent wings surrounded Alberu and Cale.</p>
<p>The silver shield appeared in front of Alberu.</p>
<p>“That bastard’s powers are not strong enough to break through my shield.”</p>
<p>“I guess I just need to keep charging forward then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. And…”</p>
<p>Cale calmly continued to speak.</p>
<p>Charge forward. And after that…</p>
<p>"We just need to take its life.” </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 620: Our human is here! 3</p>
<p>Alberu quietly mumbled.</p>
<p>“To take its life.”</p>
<p>He chuckled before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“Haven’t we struggled until now because that is so hard to do?”</p>
<p>“You're right, your highness.”</p>
<p>Cale had no problem accepting that was the case.</p>
<p>It had been difficult until now and he had thought hard about what they could do.</p>
<p>“That is not the case anymore.”</p>
<p>One time.</p>
<p>Someone who has experienced something just once will realize something, no matter how small it may be, and absorb that knowledge.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of people who had experienced that here.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people fought head on with this unranked monster just one time, but they had survived.</p>
<p>Cale trusted those behind him.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon, who was on top of the shelter wall, started to speak as if he was responding to Cale’s trust.</p>
<p>“Please get ready. It will use its ability soon.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae grabbed his gun with his right hand after hearing that.</p>
<p>"Will things go according to plan?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae heard someone's concerned question.</p>
<p>“The Commander-nim said the following. He said that we will take things away one by one.”</p>
<p>During the few hours of peace…</p>
<p>At the strategy meeting inside the grand assembly hall…</p>
<p>‘We have currently taken away its poisonous fangs and its sight. We will also make the rest of its abilities useless as well.’</p>
<p>‘All of you will need to do it similar to how we took away the other two things.’</p>
<p>Someone else added on.</p>
<p>“Do you think we can do it?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Shut the hell up.”</p>
<p>The concerned person closed his mouth after hearing Park Jin Tae’s annoyed voice.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae's arm that was holding the gun was moving around as if it was flowing water.</p>
<p>“I can't focus. Go to the rear if you want to run your mouth.”</p>
<p>He then pointed the barrel at something.</p>
<p>It was aimed only at a single moving target.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon, who was standing next to Park Jin Tae, quickly opened his mouth to speak.It’s time.</p>
<p>It was because he heard Cale’s order.</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon started to shout.</p>
<p>“Stop the long-distance attacks!”</p>
<p>There were numerous attacks being launched from the shelter wall into the air.</p>
<p>All of those attacks instantly stopped.</p>
<p>“Chhhssssssschhh!”</p>
<p>As for the yellow head that had not been able to do anything as the crumbling dirt pillars and the numerous explosions took away its sense of hearing and direction…</p>
<p>It could not miss this opening when the noises had stopped.</p>
<p>It needed to make these humans who were bothering it and causing it chaos to stop for a moment.</p>
<p>It needed to calm this situation down.</p>
<p>It would need to make all of these humans unable to move in order to do that.</p>
<p>The yellow head had a wide-area attack to do just the thing.</p>
<p>The yellow head's mouth slowly started to open.</p>
<p>The sound attack.</p>
<p>It should be able to take down most, if not all of the humans, with this attack.</p>
<p>“Scree---”</p>
<p>As it opened its mouth and was about to launch the attack…</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Park Jin Tae’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>“I was waiting for this.”</p>
<p>He pulled the trigger as he said that.</p>
<p>Tang-!</p>
<p>The sound of the bullet was the only noise in this moment of silence.</p>
<p>Crackle. Crack!</p>
<p>There were still the currents coming out from all over the yellow headed monster.</p>
<p>The small bullets dodged those currents and someone else started to move.</p>
<p>“Bae Puh Rum.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum's wind was added to the bullet.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The wind created a small hole in the water surrounding the yellow head.</p>
<p>The bullet used the power of the wind to fly past the hole.</p>
<p>It was even faster now.</p>
<p>It was even stronger now.</p>
<p>The bullet continued to fly toward its target.</p>
<p>"It worked.”</p>
<p>It then arrived at its target.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae lowered his gun.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang---!</p>
<p>“Scree----kek!”</p>
<p>Inside the open mouth… The bullet that had aimed for a spot inside the smooth mouth that was not covered in scales pushed into the smooth skin and then exploded.</p>
<p>“Rooooar, rooo, roooooar!”</p>
<p>The yellow head rolled on the ground and roared as if it was trying to throw something up.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Park Jin Tae’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>“Looks like I took one of the things away.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon looked toward Park Jin Tae with a sharp gaze as he started to speak.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you hit the target?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae did not respond to that question. He put his gun away before turning to someone else instead of Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>It was one of the people who had been concerned earlier.</p>
<p>“I could see well thanks to you.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Ah, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“An ability to increase a person's sight is quite helpful too.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae's sight was currently fortified with a different ability user's ability.</p>
<p>It was only a temporary fortification.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae then looked away from the ability user who looked embarrassed at his praise and started to speak to Kim Min Joon who was looking at him.</p>
<p>“The moment it was about to use its sound ability…”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had seen it.</p>
<p>“There was a light in one part of its open mouth.”</p>
<p>There was a faint blue gold colored light that had appeared in its now poisonous fang-less mouth.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had aimed for that spot.</p>
<p>“Rooar, roo, shhh- shhhhh, rooooar!”</p>
<p>The monster could not make many sounds anymore.</p>
<p>This sight fortification ability was an ability that could be used once a day to temporarily amplify someone else’s sight for one hour.</p>
<p>The person with that ability looked toward the monster before opening his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ha, haha. I guess my ability has its uses as well.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that all abilities have their uses.”</p>
<p>He then made eye contact with Lee Jin Joo who was next to Kim Min Joon.</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other with odd gazes.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae. When he had been the leader of one of the original shelters… He had split the group into ability users and regular people, as well as ability users with useful abilities and those with useless abilities.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had considered Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won to be ability users with useless abilities.</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo started to speak.</p>
<p>“Everybody has their roles. They just might not know what it is yet.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae looked away from Lee Jin Joo.</p>
<p>He looked toward someone who was constantly looking around and moving his hand to record something instead of responding to Lee Jin Joo.</p>
<p>The person writing something on a piece of paper was Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae made eye contact with the person with the Recording ability.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to record it?”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won snorted at Park Jin Tae’s question and turned away.</p>
<p>He then started to speak.</p>
<p>“The dirt pillars were easily destroyed and the monster’s ability to handle dirt has become useless. That was followed by Park Jin Tae's attack which took care of the sound ability.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won stopped for a moment before continuing in a voice that was full of confidence.</p>
<p>“Our allies’ abilities have gotten stronger than the battle last night.”</p>
<p>It was the truth.</p>
<p>He could see it.</p>
<p>“I believe that this is the result of each ability user’s ability growing stronger, as well as the fact that they were able to figure out where their abilities would be most effective after facing off against this monster once last night.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won looked down at the paper where he had written down the things he had seen and felt before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>"Everybody is staying in position and doing the tasks they were assigned to do.”</p>
<p>Everybody was busy.</p>
<p>“The people with battle-type abilities are on the shelter walls and outside, using their abilities in their respective locations.”</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>“The non-battle-type ability users are either supporting the battle-type ability users or using their abilities in different locations most suited for them.”</p>
<p>In addition.</p>
<p>“Those without abilities are helping to take care of those with minor injuries, defending the damaged parts of the shelter walls, cooking, etc to support everyone.”</p>
<p>Lee Seung Won's voice sounded firm as he continued to record.</p>
<p>“Using this as the background, the next step of the operation is…”</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>He turned his gaze somewhere.</p>
<p>He could see someone's back in the distance.</p>
<p>“Next is… In order for the Commander to get closer…”</p>
<p>Their commander had coughed up blood and shivered in pain but had suppressed it all to tie down the monster last time.</p>
<p>“This time, we will be the ones to tie down the monster’s body.”</p>
<p>Things were reversed this time and it was their turn to do what their commander had done last time.</p>
<p>Their commander had said the following.</p>
<p>‘Just a few seconds. You just need to hold it down for a few seconds.’</p>
<p>‘Then the others and I will take care of it.’</p>
<p>Outside the shelter wall… There were multiple people quickly approaching the yellow monster that could no longer make any noises.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jae Ha-Jung!”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh, the spider web fisherwoman. The woman who had her blue hair up in a ponytail shouted while looking at Jae Ha-Jung.</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am!”</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung responded and scattered his seeds.</p>
<p>“Water!”</p>
<p>“I'm on it!”</p>
<p>Someone else poured water where he had scattered the seeds.</p>
<p>It was a pretty ineffective horticulture ability.</p>
<p>This ability looked as if it would have no uses on the battlefield.</p>
<p>However, when this ability was used with Jae Ha-Jung…</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>Although it wasn’t as strong as Cale's ability, trees quickly started to grow.</p>
<p>Actually, it was only tree roots that were growing.</p>
<p>The roots traveled underground.</p>
<p>They were traveling underground to avoid the yellow monster’s currents and water.</p>
<p>"Squad Leader-nim!”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh's hair turned white and her long hair quickly started to stretch out and move.</p>
<p>One person descended from the air and landed behind her.</p>
<p>“I have faith.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik.</p>
<p>“I will focus all of my faith on Miss Jo Min Yeh and Mr. Jae Ha-Jung.”</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-!</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung's tree roots shot up out of the ground.</p>
<p>They were pretty close to the yellow head.</p>
<p>They were within the area around the yellow head without the currents and water.</p>
<p>“I got it!”</p>
<p>Once Jae Ha-Jung shouted…</p>
<p>Crack, crack-</p>
<p>The tree roots started to crumble one by one.</p>
<p>“Shaaaaaaaa- shhhhhh----------!”</p>
<p>The yellow monster suddenly felt something!</p>
<p>It started to flail after being shocked by the tree roots.</p>
<p>It was because the roots reminded it of a person.</p>
<p>“Kekeke, I'm not the Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>The roots had reminded it of Cale’s power.</p>
<p>This mistake was only possible because it could not see.</p>
<p>‘Mr. Jae Ha-Jung. Make the monster fall into a delusion. Make it think that I am going to tie it down again.’</p>
<p>Jae Ha-Jung was mimicking Cale’s ability.</p>
<p>The plan worked.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The yellow head urgently started to move.</p>
<p>Once the currents and water were not as strong because of it…</p>
<p>“It’s my turn.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk raised his sword.</p>
<p>“I'll slash it.”</p>
<p>His sword slashed through the air.</p>
<p>Slash.</p>
<p>The currents and water were slashed.</p>
<p>The width of Lee Soo Hyuk’s slash was much greater than the last time he had used it.</p>
<p>That was why he could only use it once.</p>
<p>Although he could only use it once…</p>
<p>That one time was enough.</p>
<p>Jo Min Yeh was behind him.</p>
<p>“Grab it!”</p>
<p>She shouted and her white spider webs started to bind the yellow monster.</p>
<p>Numerous people grabbed onto the spider web to prevent the monster from escaping.</p>
<p>“Saaaaaaaaaaa--- saaaaaa! Roar!”</p>
<p>The monster started to flail.</p>
<p>The currents and water started to appear around it again, probably because its movement was now restricted.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to speak after seeing the gap that he had slashed slowly starting to mend itself.</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng, go.”</p>
<p>Through the still open gap…</p>
<p>A large black tiger surrounded by a silver shield and wings jumped through the gap.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo looked at Lee Soo Hyuk as he moved past.</p>
<p>‘Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Of course, Choi Han, Lee Soo Hyuk, Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum were behind Cale.</p>
<p>But Cale, no, the Dark Tiger, was already on top of the monster that was bound down by the spider web and the tree roots.</p>
<p>“To the top!”</p>
<p>“I know!”</p>
<p>Alberu responded to Cale before quickly traveling up toward the top of the monster’s body.</p>
<p>The monster was flailing underneath the spider web.</p>
<p>Rip. Rip.</p>
<p>The spider web ripped a bit with each of its movements.</p>
<p>The spider web would be completely ripped soon enough.</p>
<p>“It doesn't matter.”</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up.</p>
<p>Alberu was already where he needed to be.</p>
<p>Cale had said the following as they charged over.</p>
<p>‘Your highness, I need your grip strength.’</p>
<p>‘Me? Are you talking about the Dark Tiger?’</p>
<p>‘Yes sir. You're the strongest here, your highness.’</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger was big and the strongest being here.</p>
<p>‘So?’</p>
<p>‘I need to force its mouth open.’</p>
<p>Alberu could feel Cale jumping off his back.</p>
<p>That was the signal.</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger's two large paws with sharp claws moved toward the flailing yellow head.</p>
<p>“Shaaaaaa- shhhhh, shhhhhh!”</p>
<p>They then opened the monster’s mouth.</p>
<p>It was the weakest part of the monster’s body as it did not have any scales.</p>
<p>Cale was floating in the air using the Sound of the Wind as he reached his hand out toward that spot.You're going to burn it to death?</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction snickered and started to talk to him for the first time in a long while.Kahahaha! Let’s completely cook the inside! Kahahaha!</p>
<p>It had been a while since Cale had heard this crazy laughter.</p>
<p>But Cale couldn't help but smile as well.</p>
<p>Crack. Crackle.</p>
<p>Rose gold thunderbolts were shining in both of Cale’s hands.</p>
<p>It would soon end.</p>
<p>Cale felt as if time had stopped for a moment as he had that thought.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale heard the voice of someone other than the ancient powers in his mind.</p>
<p>It was the voice of the sealed god.You somehow managed to make it here.</p>
<p>The god continued to whisper.Do you think that this is the end of the test?</p>
<p>His gentle whisper sounded quite sweet.</p>
<p>But the contents were not sweet at all.Do you really think this moment is the end of despair?</p>
<p>Cale looked down at the rose gold lights burning in his hands.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>‘Is this moment the end of despair?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.’</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning of the despair in this world.”</p>
<p>It was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Despair would reveal itself in many different forms in this world from now on.</p>
<p>“But people have hope now.”</p>
<p>After about a year since the world had turned into a mess…</p>
<p>The people who had always lost, struggled, and barely managed to survive will be victorious for the first time.</p>
<p>They would destroy this despair known as an unranked monster.</p>
<p>The sealed god who had been silent for a moment asked as if he was sneering at Cale.Do you have hope as well?</p>
<p>It seemed to be saying that Cale was someone who could not have hope.</p>
<p>That was how it sounded to Cale.</p>
<p>Cale slowly shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He did not have hope.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“I have certainty.”</p>
<p>Cale needed something more certain than hope. Finally, he had gotten it.</p>
<p>“This place will draw a different future than my past. I'm certain of it.”</p>
<p>He was certain that more people will survive than in his past.</p>
<p>He was certain that they would have better lives.</p>
<p>That was not a speculation. Although it was a future that was yet to come, Cale believed it to be the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, Cale wanted to be the one to finish the first step toward that certainty.</p>
<p>The burning rose gold thunderbolts moved away from Cale's hands.</p>
<p>He started to speak again.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I'm saying this to a god.”</p>
<p>Toward the silent sealed god…</p>
<p>To the god who had tried to give him despair…</p>
<p>Cale said the following.</p>
<p>"Thanks.”</p>
<p>He really meant it.</p>
<p>“My memories didn’t end in despair thanks to you.”</p>
<p>The moment the rose gold thunderbolts landed inside the monster’s mouth…</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-</p>
<p>There was a large explosion as Cale and the others moved away from the monster.</p>
<p>And finally… The large monster’s body slowly fell and the moment it completely stopped moving…</p>
<p>There was a bright smile on Cale's face.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Now that he had thanked the sealed god…</p>
<p>That was the thing that had finished Cale's complete victory. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 621: Our human is here! 4</p>
<p>It was everyone's victory.</p>
<p>The moment this victory was finally achieved was silent.</p>
<p>Nobody could dare to open their mouths. They could only look at the yellow monster that had burnt to death.</p>
<p>The people who had been running across the shelter walls…</p>
<p>The people who had been swinging their swords and spears outside the shelter walls…</p>
<p>The people who had been preparing to cast more long-distance attacks…</p>
<p>Everybody was looking at the battlefield without making a sound.</p>
<p>The last few days flew through their minds as if they were watching a movie.</p>
<p>The memories weren’t just a blur; their hearts were beating wildly the more they thought about everything that had happened.</p>
<p>And as their emotions were stirring up so much that they were about to shout…</p>
<p>One person quickly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Finally, the unranked monster has fallen and we…”</p>
<p>It was Lee Seung Won.</p>
<p>He remembered the Commander’s orders to record everything and barely managed to speak.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>We.</p>
<p>“The humans have won.”</p>
<p>The moment those words were recorded…</p>
<p>People could finally release everything they had pent up inside at this victory that could have been their first victory in a long while or their first victory at all in this post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>Woooooooooooooooo--</p>
<p>Waaaaaaaaah---!</p>
<p>Some were shouting with joy while others were crying.</p>
<p>They were all showing emotions in different ways.</p>
<p>“…The fog is disappearing.”</p>
<p>“…It’s the sun.”</p>
<p>The fog started to disappear and the sun slowly became visible, as if it was congratulating them for their victory as well.</p>
<p>It was a cold November day but it was slowly getting warmer with the sun.</p>
<p>That warmth was letting them realize even more that this was real.</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo started to speak.</p>
<p>Her Amplification ability echoed throughout the area around the Seomyeon shelter.</p>
<p>{We have won.}</p>
<p>The joyful news was spread everywhere.</p>
<p>{The unranked monster is dea-}</p>
<p>But she suddenly had to stop.</p>
<p>{Rok-!}</p>
<p>She quickly covered her mouth.</p>
<p>She barely managed to stop herself from shouting out the name as she even forgot that her voice was being amplified for a moment.</p>
<p>“Hyung!”</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>Kim Min Joon and Lee Seung Won stood up in shock.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was holding onto the railing without being able to say anything.</p>
<p>They were all looking at the same spot.</p>
<p>They were looking at the person who was standing in front of the large yellow monster.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>He was slowly starting to fall.</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo barely managed to open her mouth.</p>
<p>She needed to inform the people who were waiting for her to deliver the news.</p>
<p>{The unranked monster is dead.}</p>
<p>But she did not tell them about their commander who was starting to fall.</p>
<p>The cheering on the battlefield had disappeared.</p>
<p>Lee Jin Joo could see someone grabbing their commander who was about to fall.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo!”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk urgently called out to Cale who was weakly falling over. He then raised his head and looked at the person supporting Cale before starting to speak again.</p>
<p>“Han.”</p>
<p>Choi Han was supporting Cale and quietly looking at his pale face as Cale closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He then raised his head.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum, Jo Min Yeh, Jae Ha-Jung and some other people were running toward them.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to say something to Lee Soo Hyuk before they arrived.</p>
<p>“It looks like our time to head back to our world is coming up.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze sunk down.</p>
<p>He could see Kim Rok Soo who was extremely pale and looked like a mess as well as Choi Han who looked just as terrible.</p>
<p>These two punks had worked the hardest in this fight.</p>
<p>“Let’s go somewhere quiet.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Choi Han tried to carry Cale.</p>
<p>“I will move him.”</p>
<p>The Dark Tiger who walked up next to them offered his back.</p>
<p>Choi Han put Cale on Alberu’s back and entered the shelter with Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Alberu and Choi Han made eye contact.</p>
<p>The two of them could tell what was going on.</p>
<p>They knew that Cale was finally at the end of this test.</p>
<p>“I guess it's back to this place.”</p>
<p>Cale slowly looked around the dark area.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn't see anything through the darkness.</p>
<p>He then looked forward.I guess I underestimated you.</p>
<p>A set of red eyes appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>It was the sealed god.There are absolute laws in matters between gods and humans.</p>
<p>Cale quietly listened to the sealed god.</p>
<p>But he flinched after hearing this next part.Did you not hear about it from the God of Death, the Sun God or the God of War?</p>
<p>The sealed god snorted after seeing Cale flinch.Did you really think I wouldn’t know about the gods roaming around you?</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“You can’t change the contents or methods for a test you’ve already created. You're talking about that, right?”</p>
<p>Choi Han had delivered the message from the God of Death regarding that matter.</p>
<p>‘One of the absolute rules for the God of Death is to make a vow of death. Similarly, this sealed god can create tests per his absolute rule, but he cannot mess with the contents of that test.’</p>
<p>The sealed god could not mess with the content of the test.</p>
<p>The contents of a test naturally included the conditions for passing or failing the test.</p>
<p>That was the reason the sealed god, who couldn't do anything about Cale’s test on this side, tried to move the White Star to shake Cale from the other side.</p>
<p>That attempt had failed thanks to Cale's friends.There is something I can't understand.</p>
<p>The sealed god truly sounded confused.Why are you rejecting an opportunity from a god?</p>
<p>Why are you rejecting a chance to gain power and get stronger?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cale Henituse. You truly look like you need my power.</p>
<p>The sealed god had watched Cale throughout the test.Aren’t you tired?</p>
<p>Cale, who had become the twenty-years-old Kim Rok Soo, could not even sleep properly.Wasn’t it difficult?</p>
<p>He couldn't even eat three times a day and he had to live with the weight of numerous people's lives on his back.Wasn’t it painful?</p>
<p>He had used the White Star to cause Cale Henituse pain.</p>
<p>That pain would have been something Cale had never felt before as it was pain directly at the soul.</p>
<p>Even he could not imagine the amount of pain that would have caused and he was a god.</p>
<p>But Cale persisted through it.</p>
<p>The sealed god was truly curious.</p>
<p>Why?It would have been so much easier if you just asked me to take care of it.</p>
<p>Why didn't you do it?</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Cale let out a laugh.</p>
<p>“It’s my life not yours.”</p>
<p>He shook his head from side to side.</p>
<p>“I’m only happy if I live doing what I want to do.”</p>
<p>In addition.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you to take control of my life? Who says that you are even qualified to do that?”</p>
<p>What saved him was not the bastard who gave him this test of despair but the people in his memories and the people by his side.</p>
<p>He had saved himself as well.</p>
<p>The God of Death had said the following.</p>
<p>He had said that Cale’s fate and the laws of nature had changed.Qualifications?</p>
<p>The sealed god scoffed in disbelief.It’s quite laughable that you are asking a god about qualifications.</p>
<p>Aren't you tired of living a life working so hard to achieve things?</p>
<p>Cale sighed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Have you thought about why I've been tired recently? Huh?”</p>
<p>If the test was over couldn't this guy just tell him the results? Why the hell did he need to babble on like this?</p>
<p>‘I'm a busy person who has a lot to do.”</p>
<p>“Hey you.”</p>
<p>Cale had an expression on his face that Alberu, no, Raon would have said was beyond disrespectful to the point of being closer to that of a delinquent.</p>
<p>“Damn, you're still a god. I was trying to speak respectfully to you, but you just had to ruin it. Hey moron, you were the one who forced me into this damn test and made me clean up after your mess.”</p>
<p>Cale took large steps toward the red eyes.</p>
<p>He stood right in front of it and pointed right at the middle of the two eyes.</p>
<p>“You were the cause of it. Are you going to keep acting like an idiot?”</p>
<p>Cale was extremely annoyed.</p>
<p>‘Working so hard?</p>
<p>Who the fuck does he think he is to say shit like that?’</p>
<p>This god truly was a motherfucker.</p>
<p>‘And he wants to talk about it being difficult? It being tiring?’</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>It was difficult and tiring.</p>
<p>But not every moment had been tiring and difficult.</p>
<p>It was tiring after achieving victory at the end of a fierce battle.</p>
<p>But peace also comes at that moment.</p>
<p>The peace could be short or long, however… That peace was one of the driving forces that pushes him forward.</p>
<p>There were times he had lost, was defeated, and lost things extremely important to him.</p>
<p>His memories were enough to remind him that the people and things of the past could not come back.</p>
<p>But those were not the only moments in his memories.</p>
<p>While recording everything did mean that sorrow, frustration, defeat, and despair remained on his mind, it also meant that he could etch the small joys, short durations of peace, and even the minuscule moments of happiness in his mind as well.</p>
<p>“Hey you.”… How disrespectful. It truly makes me sad.</p>
<p>Cale didn't care about the sealed god’s bullshit.</p>
<p>"Just tell me the results.”</p>
<p>The red eyes furrowed toward Cale who was standing there with his arms cross and leaning on one foot.I don’t really want to tell you.</p>
<p>“How petty.”… You truly are a disrespectful bastard.</p>
<p>‘This son of a bitch of a god.’</p>
<p>Cale started to frown and opened his mouth to give a piece of his mind to this god who was dilly-dallying.</p>
<p>But he ended up flinching.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>The area he was in was starting to crack.Human, you have won.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>This was the expected results.</p>
<p>It was the results of everybody working hard.It is not because you defeated the unranked monster.</p>
<p>It is also not because the results were different than the past you remember.</p>
<p>‘…What?’</p>
<p>Cale’s eyebrows slightly rose up.</p>
<p>‘That wasn't the contents of the test?</p>
<p>Then what did I do to win?</p>
<p>How did I complete the test?’</p>
<p>He heard the sealed god's voice at that moment.You did not oppose the despair that is to come.</p>
<p>At that final moment…</p>
<p>What had Cale said to the sealed god?</p>
<p>‘This is just the beginning of the despair in this world.’You were anxious because you thought that trials and despair would head their way.</p>
<p>‘This place will draw a different future than my past. I'm certain of it.’But you had faith that it would be better than it was now. No, you were certain of it.</p>
<p>The sealed god continued to speak.It was your heart that defeated me.</p>
<p>You have overcome this test.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaaaack, craaaaaack!</p>
<p>The darkness in the area started to crack even faster.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>The true end of this test was headed his way.</p>
<p>“…It’s over.”</p>
<p>Cale calmly said out loud.</p>
<p>The red eyes quietly observed him for a moment before starting to speak again.Let me show you some good will.</p>
<p>‘Good will?’</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>It was his way of saying that he didn’t need anything like that and that he didn’t want it.There's no need to frown like that.</p>
<p>The sealed god's eyes curled up as if he was amused.</p>
<p>He then continued to speak in a gentle voice.It will still be November 8th when you open your eyes. You will still be in the twenty-years-old Kim Rok Soo's world.</p>
<p>Cale's shoulders slightly flinched.</p>
<p>‘It’ll still be Kim Rok Soo's world?</p>
<p>I'm not going back as Cale Henituse?’You will return to your original world at 0:00 am on November 9th.</p>
<p>That should give you enough time to say your goodbyes.</p>
<p>The red eyes noticed Cale's expression and continued to speak as if he understood what Cale was thinking.You're wondering why I am showing such good will?</p>
<p>Craaaaaaaaack, craaaaaack-</p>
<p>The area was quickly crumbling down. From within this darkness…</p>
<p>The red eyes were still shining bright and clear.Do not think that my test ended with this.</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Cale started to frown even more.I will always be watching you.</p>
<p>The red eyes curled up before a low laughter filled the area.</p>
<p>It was the type of laughter that gave Cale the chills.</p>
<p>The sealed god quietly whispered through the laughter.In the moment of despair that is to come…</p>
<p>It was as if he was talking about the future.The moment your mind is swayed or changed.</p>
<p>He sounded certain that this moment would happen.I will come and find you.</p>
<p>This chilling statement, no, forewarning, gave Cale chills all over his body.</p>
<p>Cale slowly raised his hand and brushed his face.</p>
<p>As the red eyes laughed at his action…</p>
<p>“Haaaaa.”</p>
<p>Through the crumbling darkness… Cale let out a sigh.</p>
<p>He then commented with an extremely annoyed expression.</p>
<p>“Will you let me be a slacker?”…What?</p>
<p>He could hear the shock in the sealed god’s voice but Cale continued to say what was on his mind.</p>
<p>“My dream, no, my goal is to be a slacker who can relax in peace and eat all I want.”</p>
<p>It was truly a stellar dream and goal.</p>
<p>Oh right, he would also do just the slightest amount of farming in there.</p>
<p>Cale shared his wishes out loud.</p>
<p>“If I choose your power, will I be able to roll around on my bed all day and still be in my bedroom no matter how much I walk? Will I be able to eat three square meals a day, take a nap, wake up, eat some snacks and relax like that until I die?”</p>
<p>Silence filled the area for a moment.</p>
<p>Only the sound of the area crumbling continued to be heard.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>The sealed god scoffed.You are trying to confuse me with such nonsense.</p>
<p>How cute. It sure was interesting. Human, I will see you in the future.</p>
<p>Cale started to think.</p>
<p>‘I really mean that.’</p>
<p>It was not nonsense.</p>
<p>He wanted to open his mouth and say that.</p>
<p>But he could not do that.</p>
<p>Clang-!</p>
<p>The darkness that had been slowly cracking made the noise of a window breaking as it shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>A bright light swept over Cale and he clenched his eyes shut.</p>
<p>He then slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Both the darkness…</p>
<p>And the red eyes were no longer visible.</p>
<p>“…Rok Soo hyung.”</p>
<p>He heard Choi Han's voice.</p>
<p>Blink, blink.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes slowly focused.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>He could also hear Lee Soo Hyuk's voice.</p>
<p>Cale's eyes slowly headed toward the wall of what seemed to be a bedroom.</p>
<p>He could see the clock.</p>
<p>The sealed god had said that he would give Cale some time to say his goodbyes.</p>
<p>Tick tock.</p>
<p>The room was so quiet that he could hear the ticking of the clock.</p>
<p>Cale focused on where the hands of the clock were pointed at right now.</p>
<p>November 8th, 11:50pm.</p>
<p>There were ten minutes left until November 9th.</p>
<p>“You motherfucking bastard.”</p>
<p>The sealed god had given him soooooo much time… not. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 622: Our human is here! 5</p>
<p>Cale looked around to see who was in the room after noticing he only had ten minutes.</p>
<p>Choi Han and Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>Only the two of them were there.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, Alberu-nim has already returned.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and started to speak after seeing the anticipation and concern on Choi Han's face.</p>
<p>“I have ten minutes late. Come back before midnight.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly gasp.</p>
<p>10 minutes.</p>
<p>He needed to go back if Cale went back as well.</p>
<p>There were ten minutes left until they went home.</p>
<p>It was obvious why Cale was telling him the time that was left.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo.</p>
<p>Choi Han immediately headed toward the door. He heard Cale's voice behind him.</p>
<p>"Call the other people here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>The other people.</p>
<p>Cale didn't need to specify who he meant by that.</p>
<p>He was talking about his allies who had been waiting for him to wake up and Choi Han immediately understood without needing an explanation.</p>
<p>“It’ll be quick because they are in the next room.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s movements seemed oddly urgent.</p>
<p>Cale looked at Choi Han leave before turning his gaze to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>There was a gentle smile on Lee Soo Hyuk’s face.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, the yellow head is completely dead.”</p>
<p>“I am aware.”</p>
<p>“And that bastard’s scales were left in pretty good condition, so I'm thinking about using it to create some weapons.”</p>
<p>“That is a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Right? There was also a cintamani-like orb that came out from its body.”</p>
<p>“Really? I guess it really was like an imugi.”</p>
<p>Their conversation was peaceful.</p>
<p>“I guess you didn’t know about the cintamani?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know. My past has no records of such a thing.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Really? Anyway, we’re thinking about researching that along with the scales. It’ll probably help in some way.”</p>
<p>“That is a good idea. Please ask Lee Seung Won to record everything you find out.”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk definitely heard that there was only ten minutes left and Cale knew that as well, however…</p>
<p>The two of them were acting the same as usual right now.</p>
<p>Of course, things were much more peaceful and quiet than before with no present danger in sight.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>"Are you not hurting anymore?”</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung. I am not hurting.”</p>
<p>“I'm relieved.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk nodded his head and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>“Should I say that I'm relieved you didn't immediately head back?”</p>
<p>Smile. Lee Soo Hyuk smiled again.</p>
<p>“I am not going to tell you the long story again.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked at the clock.</p>
<p>It had already been a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Han is a bit slow even though they are just next door.”</p>
<p>“I'm sure they’ll be here soon.”</p>
<p>The two of them enjoyed this short duration of peaceful silence.</p>
<p>Choi Han entered the next room and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo hyung. He has woken up.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Ah! I'm so relieved, so so relieved.”</p>
<p>“…Sigh.”</p>
<p>Everybody looked relieved even if they responded in very different ways.</p>
<p>“He asked everyone to come over.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Bae Puh Rum, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s go, Min Ah.”</p>
<p>Choi Han slowly observed every person who left through the door he was holding open.</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum were the first to leave.</p>
<p>Then it was Lee Seung Won and Lee Jin Joo. After them was Grandma Kim, Doctor Kang, Joo Ho-Shik, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of people walked past Choi Han.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people not here right now as well.</p>
<p>For example, Heo Sook Ja and Kim Woo were currently busy keeping the Seomyeon shelter safe.</p>
<p>Some of the ability users from other areas had quickly left saying they needed to go back to their shelters.</p>
<p>Others had stayed saying they would help the Seomyeon shelter return to normal first.</p>
<p>Finally, there were people who were resting because they were completely drained.</p>
<p>Choi Han thought about the people who had been together with Cale and him.</p>
<p>Everybody was probably waiting for Cale to wake up.</p>
<p>He looked at the person who was now walking past him.</p>
<p>It was Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>“…Do you have something to say to me?”</p>
<p>Choi Han asked Park Jin Tae who had stopped next to him.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae had not said a thing while waiting in this room since the battle had ended.</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>He was looking at Choi Han's appearance.</p>
<p>“…Kim Rok Soo is up now. Why don't you take care of yourself as well?”</p>
<p>Choi Han's eyes opened slightly wider.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae avoided Choi Han's gaze and resumed walking.</p>
<p>“…The punk who struggled the most after Kim Rok Soo should take care of himself too.”</p>
<p>Choi Han subconsciously stared at the awkwardly mumbling Park Jin Tae before letting out a chuckle.</p>
<p>However, that quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>The last person was about to leave the room.</p>
<p>Choi Han closed the door even though he saw that person starting to walk to the door.</p>
<p>Screeeeech- click.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at the person who was left with him and started to speak.</p>
<p>"Shall we talk for a bit?”</p>
<p>The remaining person, Choi Jung Soo, slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at the clock.</p>
<p>11:53.</p>
<p>There were only seven minutes left now.</p>
<p>This was the same for Cale.</p>
<p>That was why he slowly sat up while looking at the people coming into his room.</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum rushed over and helped him up.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, are you feeling okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Grandma.”</p>
<p>Grandma Kim smiled after hearing Cale’s response.</p>
<p>His complexion and voice sounded normal.</p>
<p>The Commander. No, when Kim Rok Soo had collapsed… She had been so shocked.</p>
<p>That was the moment everybody thought the back that they had thought was so big was quite small.</p>
<p>They realized once again that Cale’s back had always been that small.</p>
<p>They realized that their collapsed commander was a child who had just become an adult but was carrying the lives of so many people on his back.</p>
<p>"Are you really okay?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Kim Min Ah’s concerned question.</p>
<p>He then slowly looked at each of the people who had entered the room.</p>
<p>There were some people who had been alive until the moment he became Cale.</p>
<p>There were some who had died before that day.</p>
<p>There were some people with whom he did not have much connection with in the past.</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously started to smile after seeing all these people gathered in one room.</p>
<p>Tick. Tick.</p>
<p>He could hear the sound of the second’s hand continuing to move.</p>
<p>He smiled as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I have lost most of my abilities.”</p>
<p>“Gasp.”</p>
<p>Bae Puh Rum subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>"…What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Cale heard Park Jin Tae's low voice.</p>
<p>His pupils were violently shaking.</p>
<p>Abilities disappearing.</p>
<p>Was that possible?</p>
<p>It was something none of them had ever seen in the past year.</p>
<p>But nobody could say anything to say that was impossible.</p>
<p>Too many things had happened in the past year and they knew many new things would happen from here on as well. They thought that an ability disappearing was something that was quite possible to happen.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae made eye contact with Kim Rok Soo who was looking at him.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo seemed calm.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling you the truth.”</p>
<p>And for some odd reason…</p>
<p>He looked very calm.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak again once the others probably realized this as well.</p>
<p>“I lost most of my abilities. However…”</p>
<p>He then looked out the window.</p>
<p>It was night time.</p>
<p>The night was silent and beautiful as if there had never been a battle at all.</p>
<p>“But I am still alive.”</p>
<p>His voice was calm and firm but there was a faint trace of happiness within it.</p>
<p>They could hear the confidence behind it.</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Lee Soo Hyuk and asked a question.</p>
<p>“Did anybody die?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>0 people dead.</p>
<p>This was like a miracle.</p>
<p>No, it was indeed a miracle.</p>
<p>It was a miracle that they had created together.</p>
<p>Cale slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“…It’s peaceful.”</p>
<p>The end of a fierce war.</p>
<p>This moment of peace that they finally managed to achieve.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes back.</p>
<p>“Good. Very good.”</p>
<p>The eyes of the people who had been looking at him opened wide.</p>
<p>“…I guess he knows how to smile like this.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik subconsciously mumbled quietly.</p>
<p>Brightly.</p>
<p>Their Commander was smiling brightly with a relaxed expression on his face.</p>
<p>That was why Joo Ho-Shik and the others couldn't say anything to him even though he had just told them that he had lost the majority of his abilities.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“I'm tired.”</p>
<p>That short statement changed the atmosphere in the room.</p>
<p>His complexion was better and his voice was peaceful, but he was still someone who had just woken up after fainting.</p>
<p>How had he been until the moment he fainted?</p>
<p>Everybody couldn't help but become tense after thinking about that moment.</p>
<p>Cale quietly looked at them before starting to speak again.</p>
<p>“I'm going to get some rest now. I will tell you all the rest after I get some rest.”</p>
<p>Cale laid down on the bed again and the others quickly agreed with him.</p>
<p>“Yes. That sounds good.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! Hyung, please rest well, rest very well.”</p>
<p>“See you later. Let me know when your condition gets better. I'll rush over right away.”</p>
<p>They all headed back out without any complaints even though they had only been here for a short time.</p>
<p>They heard Cale's voice behind them as they were leaving.</p>
<p>"By the way, have you all eaten?”</p>
<p>They walked out of the room and some of them turned their heads back and others turned around once they were in the hallway. They could see the nonchalant look on their commander’s face.</p>
<p>“You must make sure to never skip a meal.”</p>
<p>Their commander was talking to them with the most serious expression they had ever seen.</p>
<p>“You must eat before you work. Oh, and all of you look even worse than me. Please go get some rest. Eat well, sleep well, and rest well. Those three things are very important. Eating is especially important among the three. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Joo Ho-Shik chuckled before responding back.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim, you should make sure that you don't miss a meal. We take good care of ourselves.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We are taking good care of ourselves.”</p>
<p>Kim Min Ah mischievously smiled before agreeing with Joo Ho-Shik.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae, who had been the last to leave, made a comment as well.</p>
<p>“You make sure to eat.”</p>
<p>He then said the following as he closed the door.</p>
<p>“Get some rest.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>The door closed again.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, make sure to keep Jin Tae's words to heart.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Lee Soo Hyuk, who was the only person to not leave.</p>
<p>“I will make sure to eat.”</p>
<p>Cale suddenly started to think about apple pies.</p>
<p>He was actually thinking about the moment that the tear-soaked apple pies had been shoved in to his mouth.</p>
<p>He was also thinking about the lemon teas that Ron had handed him in the past.</p>
<p>‘Wow, I'm even thinking about that dreadful lemon tea.’</p>
<p>Cale wondered why he was thinking about that but closed his eyes for a moment after seeing Ron’s face appear along with the tea.</p>
<p>“There are two minutes left.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>“You’re here?”</p>
<p>Cale could see Choi Han who was walking in with a calm expression as well as Choi Jung Soo who was standing outside the door without being able to come in.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo’s expression looked terrible.</p>
<p>No, it looked as if his mind was a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>At the same time, it looked oddly calm.</p>
<p>He seemed relieved about something.</p>
<p>Cale did not ask Choi Han and Choi Jung Soo about their chat.</p>
<p>It was because although Choi Han's face was calm, his eyes were red. It didn’t look as if he had cried but there were numerous emotions floating in Choi Han’s eyes right now.</p>
<p>“Choi Jung Soo. Come in or stay out but make up your mind.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo flinched before walking into the room and Lee Soo Hyuk closed the door.</p>
<p>“Choi Jung Soo.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Make sure you eat properly and rest well.”</p>
<p>“You, you-”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo could not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>He then looked at Choi Han before turning back toward Cale and starting to speak again.</p>
<p>“Okay. Make sure you eat properly and rest well too.”</p>
<p>He then opened and closed his mouth over and over for a moment.</p>
<p>"And, and-”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Choi Han. He then heard Choi Jung Soo's voice.</p>
<p>"And see you again.”</p>
<p>“Haaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed the ‘haaa’ coming out of Choi Han’s mouth that he couldn't tell whether it was a sigh or a laugh before closing his eyes.</p>
<p>‘It seems Choi Han pretty much told him everything.’</p>
<p>Choi Han seemed to have made up his mind after hearing him tell Lee Soo Hyuk quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk’s voice.</p>
<p>“There is something I want to tell you.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk hesitated for a moment before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“…You've been through a lot.”</p>
<p>Cale clenched his eyes shut.</p>
<p>He never expected to hear such words from Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>He heard Lee Soo Hyuk’s voice again at that moment.</p>
<p>"And see you again.”</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes and looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>He wanted to say that that would be hard to do. He wanted to tell him not to have such unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>However, Lee Soo Hyuk was a bit faster.</p>
<p>"Just like you did it. Maybe one day, I, or any one of us, might be able to go help you out.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk started to smile.</p>
<p>"See you again someday.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile as well.</p>
<p>But he could not respond back.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>He called out to Choi Han instead.</p>
<p>There was less than one minute left.</p>
<p>“What do you need to do to go back?”</p>
<p>How was Choi Han supposed to go back?</p>
<p>Unlike Cale, Choi Han had entered Cale’s test thanks to the God of Death.</p>
<p>“Hyung, you just have to say something to me.”</p>
<p>‘What do I need to say?’</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Choi Han who was smiling without telling him what to say and started to frown.</p>
<p>But he soon started to speak.</p>
<p>The thing he needed to tell Choi Han…</p>
<p>There was only one thing to say right now.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home.”</p>
<p>Going back.</p>
<p>Going to the place where people were waiting for them.</p>
<p>That was the only thing to say.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo gasped.</p>
<p>Crack, crack-</p>
<p>Choi Han’s body was slowly breaking and turning into dust.</p>
<p>“I’ll be heading back first.”</p>
<p>Choi Han said that and motioned to Choi Jung Soo with his eyes before closing them.</p>
<p>His body quickly disappeared from this world.There’s less than 30 seconds left.</p>
<p>Cale said goodbye to the Kim Rok Soo of this world last.Dealing with things will be easier thanks to you.</p>
<p>‘Are you talking about how I told them I lost my abilities?’Yes. It’s not like I can keep using your ancient powers.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s voice was calm but sounded disappointed as well.</p>
<p>Cale, the other Kim Rok Soo, knew this was the case.Don’t worry. I might not be able to use the ancient powers but I will quickly figure out the other abilities you used.</p>
<p>‘I'm not worried. You’ll do a good job.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo could not respond to Cale before barely managing to say something.Goodbye.</p>
<p>‘Bye.’</p>
<p>5 seconds. 4 seconds.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, travel safely.”</p>
<p>3 seconds.</p>
<p>Cale opened his eyes and looked at the two remaining people.</p>
<p>The two people who had died in his place.</p>
<p>“Please live well.”</p>
<p>2 seconds.</p>
<p>Cale slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He should be in the other world once he opened his eyes now.</p>
<p>1 second.</p>
<p>It was time to leave.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Blood started to drip out of Cale’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Rok Soo!”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>Cale could see the anxious look on Lee Soo Hyuk and Choi Jung Soo's faces.</p>
<p>But Cale was clutching on the bed sheet while continuing to cough up blood.</p>
<p>“Cough, cough!”What is going on?’</p>
<p>He could hear Kim Rok Soo’s anxious voice in his mind as well.</p>
<p>The Super Rock awkwardly mumbled at that moment.It looks like he is in pain while his soul is trying to break the connection with this body to head back.</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>‘T, this, cough.”</p>
<p>“Rok Soo, Kim Rok Soo!”</p>
<p>“Hey, w, why are you in so much pain unlike my paternal cousin once removed?”</p>
<p>‘My thoughts exactly!’</p>
<p>Cale was flabbergasted that only he had to deal with such pain as Choi Jung Soo mentioned.</p>
<p>‘Couldn’t he have sent me off looking cool?!’</p>
<p>“Ugh, cough, sealed god, y, you motherfucking son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>The Super Rock and Kim Rok Soo mumbled in pity.</p>
<p>…S, stay strong. Cale. I’ll wait for you on the other side.</p>
<p>My goodness, you just suffer all the time.</p>
<p>I knew that sealed god is a son of a bitch we can’t thank.</p>
<p>‘He’s sending me back like this?!</p>
<p>Couldn’t he let my goodbye be cool?!’</p>
<p>The world slowly turned black.</p>
<p>Cale saw the world turn completely dark as pain shot throughout his body.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He let out a short groan before falling back.</p>
<p>Then he blacked out.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes closed on their own in the darkness.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.You managed to overcome the sealed god’s test in the end.</p>
<p>He could faintly hear the God of Death’s voice.</p>
<p>His voice was oddly warm.Human. Do not think that this is the end.</p>
<p>That voice slowly became quieter and quieter.You never know when you might be reconnected with people you know.</p>
<p>Fate is something even the laws of the world cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Cale listened to the God of Death’s words and started to think.</p>
<p>‘What bullshit is he saying now?’</p>
<p>That thought subconsciously came out loud.</p>
<p>“…What kind of bullshit is that?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Human!”</p>
<p>Cale flinched after hearing a familiar voice.</p>
<p>‘Did I come back?’</p>
<p>Cale debated whether he should open his eyes or not.</p>
<p>He heard a voice he was happy to hear once again.</p>
<p>“Our human said something just now! He said, ‘what kind of bullshit is that?’! He was speaking curtly as usual!”</p>
<p>Flutter flutter.</p>
<p>He could hear the sound of wings fluttering.</p>
<p>"Everybody, come here!”</p>
<p>He then heard bright voices that sounded both happy and full of tears.</p>
<p>“Our human is here!”</p>
<p>“He’s awake, nya!”</p>
<p>“He’s up, nya!”</p>
<p>Cale stopped hesitating and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Everything started to light up.</p>
<p>He saw a background of many colors before seeing Raon, On, and Hong who were both smiling brightly and crying while looking at him.</p>
<p>Home… He was back home. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 623: Will never be seen in the world again 1</p>
<p>“Choi Han is here too! He came as if he had teleported!”</p>
<p>“He suddenly showed up, nya!”</p>
<p>Raon was laughing out loud as he moved his wings as strongly as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was still just a flutter.</p>
<p>Hong was jumping up and down in joy next to him.</p>
<p>“Everything go smoothly?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>Choi Han, who was standing there looking the same and wearing the same clothes he had been wearing in the other world, smiled gently back.</p>
<p>He had suddenly appeared looking completely the same.</p>
<p>Cale wondered what Choi Han and the God of Death might have chatted about but didn't ask after seeing Choi Han just smiling and not saying anything.</p>
<p>Instead, Cale started to look around to see where he was right now.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>He was lying on a grassy field.</p>
<p>‘A grass bed?’</p>
<p>The grass he was on was much taller than the rest of the grass, tall enough to reach an adult's knee.</p>
<p>“Human! Do you like the grass bed? I don't like altars so I put the black orb on top of a grass bed!”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I don’t see the black orb.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! We just saw what happened! The black orb suddenly disappeared and left you behind! You looked terrible!”</p>
<p>“The black orb disappeared without a trace, nya!”</p>
<p>“It’s gone so we can't see it nya!”</p>
<p>Cale ignored the ramblings of the children averaging nine-years-old and looked around.</p>
<p>The black orb was gone, however…</p>
<p>"What is this?”</p>
<p>He could see numerous half-transparent barriers surrounding him instead.</p>
<p>Black, white, gold, and red.</p>
<p>Four different colors were mixed together to surround Cale.</p>
<p>“No wonder everything looked weird.”</p>
<p>Raon, On, and Hong were outside those half-transparent barriers and Raon was rubbing his chubby steamed bun-like cheeks on the barrier.</p>
<p>Hong was moving in circles around Choi Han while smiling.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“I want to know if you are okay, nya.”</p>
<p>Cale lowered his head after hearing a quiet and calm voice.</p>
<p>On was looking at him from just outside the barrier.</p>
<p>Cale answered her cautious question without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“I'm always okay.”</p>
<p>On’s ears twitched and Raon started to shout with vigor.</p>
<p>“I knew you would say that human! Did you completely crush that test or whatever?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>His calm response made the children averaging nine-years-old look at him with admiration.</p>
<p>“As expected of our human!”</p>
<p>“He’s good at crushing things, nya!”</p>
<p>On quietly nodded her head with a satisfied expression on her face.</p>
<p>Cale chuckled while looking at Hong and Raon being excited at his response and On moving to join them, before turning toward the direction of footsteps.</p>
<p>Ron, Beacrox, Eruhaben, Lord Sheritt, Rosalyn, Lock, Mary, etc.</p>
<p>His friends were all quickly approaching with happy expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly commented while looking at them.</p>
<p>“It really is home.”</p>
<p>He was getting emotional.</p>
<p>That was why he got up from the grass bed and started to walk toward the barrier.</p>
<p>He wanted to greet his friends too.</p>
<p>Cale took a few small steps toward the barrier.</p>
<p>“Young master Cale!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn called out to him louder than ever before.</p>
<p>As a gentle smile was about to appear on Cale’s face…</p>
<p>Rosalyn shouted even louder.</p>
<p>“STOP!”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>As Cale flinched…</p>
<p>“You’ll die if you touch the barrier!”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben urgently shouted as well.</p>
<p>“Cale! Stop moving! Stop moving if you don’t want to die!”</p>
<p>‘…What the hell?’</p>
<p>Cale stopped and looked at the large dome barriers surrounding the grass bed.</p>
<p>He subconsciously made a comment.</p>
<p>"What the hell did you guys do?”</p>
<p>Raon and Hong excitedly responded back.</p>
<p>“The black barrier is the work of the great and mighty Raon Miru! If you touch it in the wrong way, hundreds of black arrows will attack you!”</p>
<p>“The white one is Sheritt-nim's, nya! You'll be squished to death by a shield if you touch Sheritt-nim’s nya!”</p>
<p>Cale flinched.</p>
<p>On calmly continued to explain.</p>
<p>"The gold one is Eruhaben-nim’s, nya, you’ll probably turn to dust if you touch that one, nya. The red one is big sis Rosalyn's masterpiece and you will mm, leave this world by being melted by lava if you touch that one nya.”</p>
<p>On then added on.</p>
<p>“They’re the attack spells they placed to protect you and to attack any enemies who tried to touch the black orb, nya.”</p>
<p>“Of course, it shouldn't harm you at all since you are inside the barrier, human! The gentle Rosalyn probably told you to stop just in case something goes wrong! You can just walk out!”</p>
<p>Cale stood firmly without moving.</p>
<p>He had no intentions of moving.</p>
<p>“Young master Cale, we’ll undo them right away.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn walked over and got rid of her red barrier.</p>
<p>Eruhaben and Sheritt then removed their barriers.</p>
<p>“You unlucky bastard. It must have been hard on you.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay? I'm sure the test of a god would not have been easy. Good job.”</p>
<p>They then saw Cale’s eyes moving toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Ron had a benign smile on his face but his gaze was vicious as he looked over Choi Han's condition from head to toe.</p>
<p>He then started to speak.</p>
<p>“Looks like you returned alive without getting hurt.”</p>
<p>Choi Han made eye contact with Ron without saying anything.</p>
<p>Ron patting Choi Han on the shoulder once before walking past him toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Get some rest since you're back home now.”</p>
<p>Of course, Choi Han started to smile after hearing those words from Ron.</p>
<p>But that smile quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Beacrox clicked his tongue as soon as he saw Choi Han.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>"What is it?”</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Beacrox clicked his tongue once more before taking out a completely white handkerchief without a single blemish out of his pocket and tossing it to Choi Han.</p>
<p>“At least wipe your face.”</p>
<p>Beacrox then walked past Choi Han as well. Choi Han started to speak.</p>
<p>“I'm hungry.”</p>
<p>“…There are things for you to eat.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to smile. He looked a bit more relaxed as Lock and Rosalyn then walked up.</p>
<p>Actually, Choi Han and Cale… Their friends were surrounding both of them as they took turns sharing their happiness.</p>
<p>“You have returned. I am happy.”</p>
<p>“Mary. I heard you were the one who stole me from the White Star.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir. You are correct. I grabbed you and flew away.”</p>
<p>Cale didn't recognize the stiff tone in Mary's voice and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“You’re the best. Totally amazing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I am the best. I am amazing.”</p>
<p>Cale looked around after his short conversation with Mary. He then walked over to Choi Han.</p>
<p>Once everybody's gazes were focused on them… He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>"We made it back safely.”</p>
<p>Cale’s heart slightly stirred with emotion as he said that.</p>
<p>It wasn't a bad feeling, in fact, the warm feeling made Cale smile as he looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right, Choi Han?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ca-”</p>
<p>As Choi Han smiled and tried to respond…</p>
<p>“That doesn't seem to be true, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>They heard Ron’s extremely benign and gentle voice.</p>
<p>Cale flinched as Ron's voice became scarier the more benign it was.</p>
<p>He then looked into Ron’s eyes.</p>
<p>‘Mm!’</p>
<p>Cale curled up internally after seeing Ron’s firm gaze.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>"Both of you are extremely skinny.”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?</p>
<p>Choi Han and me?’</p>
<p>Eruhaben nodded his head with a serious expression as Cale looked back and forth at Choi Han and himself.</p>
<p>“Yes. The unlucky bastard must have received nutrients inside the black orb somehow since he is still alive after a few months but he doesn’t look good at all. Choi Han must have been through a lot during the test as well since he is much skinnier.”</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Choi Han and asked.</p>
<p>“…Did you not eat properly?”</p>
<p>Choi Han answered without any hesitation after seeing the serious expression on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“My weight has not changed.”</p>
<p>Cale looked down at his wrist as well.</p>
<p>“…It’s the same as before.”</p>
<p>It didn’t look any different.</p>
<p>But none of the others were listening to the two of them.</p>
<p>"I’ll be heading back first.”</p>
<p>Beacrox took out a pair of white gloves from his pocket and returned to the black castle looking ready to battle.</p>
<p>The others followed behind him as well.</p>
<p>Ron walked up to Cale as he blankly watched them leave.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, his highness has asked for a video call.”</p>
<p>Alberu had headed back while Cale was unconscious after killing the yellow head.</p>
<p>He had no choice as he was busy and he had headed toward the Roan Kingdom’s palace as soon as he returned.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak after seeing Alberu’s face appear on top of the video communication device’s screen.</p>
<p>“Your highness, it’s been a while since I've seen your face.”You-</p>
<p>Alberu hesitated with a tired expression on his face before he started to speak again.You're eating very well as soon as you got back.</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness. It is delicious.</p>
<p>A piece of the Beacrox special steak went into Cale’s mouth.</p>
<p>Alberu smiled brightly while looking at Cale who was sitting with a feast in front of him.You never change.</p>
<p>“That is my forte. Your highness, how are things going?”</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>A piece of apple pie was placed on top of Cale’s steak plate as he asked.</p>
<p>Naturally it was from Raon.</p>
<p>He then started to build a cookie tower on top of Choi Han’s plate of cookies he brought out from his spatial dimension.</p>
<p>Alberu observed all of this and picked up a file without taking a second glance.We’ve sent a special brigade of mages and searchers to Puzzle City.</p>
<p>Puzzle City, the discarded city.</p>
<p>The place that was famous for building rock towers and breaking them down.We’ve also stationed three 1000-men brigades at the outskirts of Puzzle City.</p>
<p>These forces would instantly enter Puzzle City if the special brigade noticed anything weird.</p>
<p>"What about the residents?”Of course we created a manual for the residents in case they need to escape. We have stealthily been moving the residents who have difficulty moving to other cities.</p>
<p>"So that the White Star doesn’t notice?”That's right.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>Alberu slammed the file down.We will chat about the details once you come to the palace.</p>
<p>Clack.</p>
<p>Cale put the fork down and started to speak.</p>
<p>“The palace?”</p>
<p>‘Do I really need to go there?’</p>
<p>Cale's lack of interest was visible on his face.</p>
<p>‘Can’t we just do it over a video call?’</p>
<p>Cale, who had planned on stopping by the Henituse Duchy before heading toward Puzzle City or the Eastern continent to scope out what the White Star was planning, wondered if he really had to go.</p>
<p>His thoughts were clearly visible on his face.</p>
<p>Alberu just looked toward Rosalyn who was eating with a relaxed smile on her face. Rosalyn smiled at him after noticing his gaze.</p>
<p>Alberu hesitated for a moment before starting to speak again.The representatives of different kingdoms are planning on having a grand assembly at the Roan Palace regarding a plan for peace throughout the continent.</p>
<p>‘A grand assembly?’</p>
<p>Cale started to think about people such as Litana and Toonka who would show up as the representatives of the Western continent.</p>
<p>All of them were gathering at the Roan Palace?</p>
<p>It must be related to the White Star and Puzzle City.</p>
<p>Cale casually commented.</p>
<p>“What about it, your highness?”Are you really going to act like it's someone else's business?</p>
<p>“…I guess I must be there?”Isn’t that obvious?</p>
<p>Alberu gently added on.Work hard a little longer and then get as much rest as you want.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the crown prince.I'll let you be a slacker. Don’t worry.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“I have faith.”</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu chuckled as he was reminded of Joo Ho-Shik.</p>
<p>‘I guess he had a decent farewell.’</p>
<p>He was slightly relieved after seeing the expressions on Cale and Choi Han’s faces.</p>
<p>Even he was disappointed to leave and he had just a short meeting with all of them. How bad would it be for those two?</p>
<p>He watched the two of them eat well with satisfaction.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness.”</p>
<p>He then heard Cale’s voice.</p>
<p>“Then I will head to the palace right away after stopping by the Duke’s Estate. I should be there by tomorrow morning.”…You’re visiting the Henituse family?</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness. It is only fitting.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Alberu after saying that.Uhh… mm.</p>
<p>Alberu's reaction was a bit odd.</p>
<p>"What is it, your highness?”…Mm.</p>
<p>A bright smile appeared on Alberu’s face.</p>
<p>It was an extremely radiant smile that reminded Cale of the radiant sun, but it seemed quite forced.Just go there first.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Then he hung up the call.</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’</p>
<p>Cale got the chills for some reason.</p>
<p>However, he finished up a few things at the black castle and immediately headed for the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>“Ron.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale was at the city walls not too far away from the forest where he had just come from. He quietly looked at the city walls protecting Rain City, the capital of the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>“Were the walls of our territory always this thick and threatening?”</p>
<p>Ron smiled and answered him.</p>
<p>“They were recently upgraded. In addition, we are currently installing magic devices throughout the Henituse territory and the most magic devices are going in Rain City as the Lord’s Castle and the Duke's Estate are both here.”</p>
<p>He continued to speak with a satisfied expression on his face.</p>
<p>“That is the reason the flow of mana is unstable right now, which is why you had to teleport outside the city walls instead of directly into the castle, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>“I did hear about that part.”</p>
<p>Cale pointed at the large number of soldiers walking into the city.</p>
<p>“Uhh… Mm…. What is that army?”</p>
<p>“They are here to protect the Henituse Duchy.”</p>
<p>Ron benignly answered back.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“This much is to be expected for a Duchy.”</p>
<p>Beacrox seemed oddly proud.</p>
<p>Cale suddenly remembered Alberu’s overly radiant smile.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, shall we go? Everybody is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and pushed the hood of his robe down.</p>
<p>The Duke couple and his two younger siblings.</p>
<p>They were enough reasons to start walking.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in quietly.”</p>
<p>He didn't like loud and chaotic situations.</p>
<p>He planned on quietly getting past the city gates and heading toward the Duke’s Estate.</p>
<p>Cale stood in line behind the people trying to enter the city and waited for his turn. It was finally his turn and he walked up to a soldier standing outside the gate.</p>
<p>He stepped forward leaving Ron and Beacrox behind him.</p>
<p>‘It should be enough if I show him my face.’</p>
<p>It would be quick, very quick.</p>
<p>The soldier should let him through as soon as he showed his face.</p>
<p>“Please show your Proof of Toll. What is your name and where did you-”</p>
<p>Cale slightly lowered his hood so that only the soldier, who had been repeating the same thing like a robot, could see his face.</p>
<p>The soldier’s eyes opened wide and he stopped talking.</p>
<p>Cale put on a gentle conversational smile as it looked as if the soldier had recognized him right now.</p>
<p>“I want to quietly vis-”</p>
<p>Cale was trying to tell the soldier what he was planning on doing.</p>
<p>He wanted to be let in quietly as he was secretly visiting.</p>
<p>However, he could not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>The soldier dropped the pen and papers he was holding.</p>
<p>“Y, y-”</p>
<p>He then stuttered for a bit before barely managing to speak.</p>
<p>“Y, y-”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>As Cale asked back in confusion…</p>
<p>The soldier didn’t even pick up the pen and papers before lifting up both arms and starting to cheer.</p>
<p>“Y, young master-nim! My goodness, the young master-nim is back alive!”</p>
<p>Cale became anxious at this extremely intense reaction.</p>
<p>‘What the hell?</p>
<p>Why is he acting like this?!</p>
<p>I was just trying to enter quietly!’</p>
<p>Cale's shock made him subconsciously let go of the hood he was holding back to show the soldier his face.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew over at that moment and pushed against the hood that it came off before Cale could do anything.</p>
<p>His sunset red hair became visible for everyone.</p>
<p>Everybody focused on the red hair that stood out.</p>
<p>As Cale flinched after seeing all of the gazes being focused on him…</p>
<p>Once silence filled the area for a moment…</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>The knight in charge of the city gate dropped the large spear in his hand to break the silence.</p>
<p>Numerous voices filled the area outside the city gate at that moment.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim! My goodness, our young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“Oh, lord! Thank you for returning our hero to our side! Thank you looooord!”</p>
<p>“The young master-nim, the shield young master-nim is back!”</p>
<p>The knight who had dropped his spear started to shout to the soldier next to him.</p>
<p>“Immediately head over to Interim Territory Lord Violan-nim!”</p>
<p>His face was full of admiration; his voice was full of joy and pride as he gave the order in a vigorous voice.</p>
<p>“The pride of our home, the hero of the continent has returned! Inform Violan-nim right away!”</p>
<p>‘What?</p>
<p>The hero of what?’</p>
<p>Cale heard the invisible Raon's voice in his head while his pupils were shaking in shock.Human! They all seem so happy to see you return! Hehe!</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>On and Hong meowed with joy in Beacrox’s arms.</p>
<p>A chill that Cale did not get even when he was face to face with the sealed god swept over him. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 624: Will never be seen in the world again 2</p>
<p>Cale had no time to focus on the chills on his back.Human! It's a carriage!</p>
<p>Cale's pupils started to shake.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim! Please get on!”</p>
<p>A knight and a group of warriors came over with a carriage.</p>
<p>It was a carriage with the Henituse family crest, but…</p>
<p>‘…It’s too fancy.’</p>
<p>It was an extremely, no, extravagantly fancy carriage.</p>
<p>Why was a carriage like this by the city walls?</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously looked toward the knight who answered as if it was nothing.</p>
<p>“Lord Deruth had this carriage built for when he was to go to the capital, however, Lady Violan insisted on building a carriage that showed the Duchy’s wealth off even more so this carriage was left by the city walls as a spare.”</p>
<p>That meant that they had created an even more extravagant carriage than this already too luxurious carriage. That carriage was currently at the capital with Duke Deruth.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Anybody who takes a look at this carriage would say that Lord Deruth is extremely wealthy.”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha! Isn’t that the truth, young master-nim? We are an extremely wealthy territory and the family has been saving money for multiple generations!”</p>
<p>The knight responded as if it was normal.</p>
<p>He then opened the door of the carriage.</p>
<p>“I will escort you right away! Please get on, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>Blink blink.</p>
<p>Cale blinked twice. He heard Choi Han’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>Choi Han, Ron, Beacrox, and the children averaging nine-years-old were currently with Cale.</p>
<p>“Cale-nim. Over there-”</p>
<p>Choi Han stopped talking.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward where Choi Han was pointing.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago… There had been some soldiers who had entered the city not too long before Cale. They had turned around and were walking in formation toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Mm. Hilsman.”</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>Cale noticed that the knight leading the soldiers was Hilsman.</p>
<p>Vice Captain Hilsman had been with Cale when he first went to the capital and knew all about Cale and his friends.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim! Sob!”</p>
<p>Hilsman started to cry as soon as he saw Cale.</p>
<p>‘What the hell? Why is he like this?’</p>
<p>Cale anxiously took a step backward.</p>
<p>Hilsman didn't care as he got off his horse and ran over to him.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim! You look so terrible, shabby, no, I am so sad to see you looking like this! Sooooooooooob!”</p>
<p>Cale thought Hilsman looked extremely sad right now.</p>
<p>“I'm so glad that you returned safe and alive, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>He was holding back his tears now but Hilsman’s eyes were red as he clenched his fists and continued to speak in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>“I knew that you would even overcome a god’s test, young master-nim! You're always…. For our territory… for the kingdom… No, you're always on the move to protect both the Eastern and Western continent.”</p>
<p>Cale was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Hilsman thought he could see the pain and suffering in Cale's eyes that were still stoic despite his pale complexion.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just his own thinking.</p>
<p>“I, Hilsman, know about it all even though I have not been able to be by your side! Young master-nim, I know how hard your days have been as you try to achieve your noble goal!”</p>
<p>‘…Is being a slacker a noble goal?’</p>
<p>Cale couldn't help but have that thought.</p>
<p>He then made up his mind.</p>
<p>‘Let’s tell him.’</p>
<p>He wanted to tell Hilsman that his goal was to be a slacker.</p>
<p>Maybe this atmosphere would change a bit if he said that.</p>
<p>But Hilsman didn't give him the chance to do that.</p>
<p>“I!”</p>
<p>Hilsman pounded on his armor.</p>
<p>“No, our soldiers!”</p>
<p>He then extended his arms and pointed behind him. There were numerous soldiers standing in formation with expressions full of admiration.</p>
<p>“No, the citizens of our territory! We will all escort you to the Duke’s Estate, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>"Wooooooooooo-!”</p>
<p>“Waaaaaaaaaaaah-!”</p>
<p>The soldiers shouted and the citizens cheered.</p>
<p>They all looked toward Cale and admired his unshakable dignified look on his face.</p>
<p>The truth was that Cale was so anxious that he had frozen in spot.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>He felt chills once more after hearing Ron's low voice before slowly walking toward the carriage.</p>
<p>The others got on the carriage behind him.</p>
<p>“…Fuck-”</p>
<p>He covered his face with both hands.</p>
<p>“My goodness, you always get so shy, young master-nim. Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>Hilsman laughed out loud before closing the carriage door and got on his horse before escorting Cale's carriage with the soldiers.</p>
<p>Clunk. Clunk.</p>
<p>The ride was smooth as the carriage headed toward the Duke’s Estate.</p>
<p>The cheering outside only got louder.</p>
<p>Cale peeked out to see that there were some citizens throwing what looked like flower petals from baskets.</p>
<p>He had no idea where they got such things in November.Hehe! Everybody seems to be happy that you’re here, human! I'm happy too!</p>
<p>“Meeeeeeeeeeow! It feels like a festival, nya!”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeeeow. This is fun, nya!”</p>
<p>‘…Haaaaa.’</p>
<p>Cale held back a sigh.</p>
<p>Cale saw Duchess Violan as soon as he got off the carriage at the Duke’s Estate.</p>
<p>“Mother, I'm home.”</p>
<p>Violan calmly watched him as he greeted her and slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Yes. Welcome back.”</p>
<p>She then turned around and headed inside. Cale watched her head in when he heard her voice.</p>
<p>“How long will you be here?”</p>
<p>“I plan on spending the night if nothing changes. I feel as if we need to quickly put an end to this White Star issue.”</p>
<p>Both of their voices sounded stoic.</p>
<p>Violan stopped moving and asked a question.</p>
<p>“And after that?”</p>
<p>“Of course I would come back home.”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I plan on moving back and forth between here and the villa.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll be staying within the Henituse territory.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Cale could see Duchess Violan’s back and her hair that had been twisted up.</p>
<p>Her hair was still perfectly made with not a single hair sticking out.</p>
<p>Cale looked at it for quite a while.</p>
<p>He then heard Violan’s voice again.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>Cale walked up next to her as she answered.</p>
<p>They then started to walk toward the door together.</p>
<p>He nonchalantly made a comment.</p>
<p>“Please make sure to watch your health as you work. Please eat well and sleep well. Those are very important issues.”</p>
<p>“I wish to tell you the same thing.”</p>
<p>“There's no need to overwork yourself.”</p>
<p>“That is what I wish to say to you.”</p>
<p>Cale hesitated for a moment before starting to speak again.</p>
<p>“Where are Basen and Lily?”</p>
<p>"Basen is handling some documents while Lily is training with the soldiers outside the city walls. Basen should have already heard that you are here while Lily is probably hearing about it now.”</p>
<p>"What is father doing at the capital?”</p>
<p>“What you usually do.”</p>
<p>“What I usually do?”</p>
<p>“Flipping the palace over.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Duchess Violan at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Smile. Violan started to smile.</p>
<p>She continued to walk while looking forward.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother?”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>The door to the estate slowly opened.</p>
<p>She looked at the opening door and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“You know, those things called gods or Roan or whatever… Ignore them all if they are harmful to you. You don’t need those things.”</p>
<p>Smile. Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>She still did not look at Cale and simply continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>Screeech- Bang!</p>
<p>And through the open door…</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>Basen was rushing out.</p>
<p>“Basen. You escort Cale to his room. I need to go back to work.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? Ah, yes, of course!”</p>
<p>Duchess Violan turned toward the Lord’s Castle instead of the Estate.</p>
<p>Cale realized that she had walked back to the house with him just to greet him.</p>
<p>Violan finally turned back toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Make sure to rest properly.”</p>
<p>Her voice was calm and she had no smile on her face but Cale slightly bowed toward her after looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>Eyes often told more than things that could not be expressed through words.</p>
<p>“I'm leaving now.”</p>
<p>Violan also did not say anything and walked away from them.</p>
<p>Cale slowly turned his gaze.</p>
<p>Basen had been constantly looking at him without saying anything.</p>
<p>“Basen. I don’t need an escort to my own room.”</p>
<p>This was also his house and it wasn’t like they had built a new home. He didn't need an escort.</p>
<p>“I'll still come with you.”</p>
<p>“Well, whatever then.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly nodded his head and stepped into the house.</p>
<p>“It's the same as usual.”</p>
<p>Basen quietly smile after hearing Cale’s remarks.</p>
<p>He looked much calmer now.</p>
<p>“There were no reasons for it to change, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>“I guess that is true.”</p>
<p>Ron, Choi Han, and Beacrox entered the house in that order and all started to move in different directions. Their movements were very natural.</p>
<p>They each had their respective places in this house.</p>
<p>The people inside the estate greeted Cale as usual unlike the citizens outside.</p>
<p>They were as calm as if they were looking at the young master of the house who had just gone out to play.</p>
<p>Cale liked their attitude and it made him really feel right at home.</p>
<p>He liked this peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Violan probably made it this way knowing Cale's personality.</p>
<p>Cale started to walk toward his room with Basen as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“It doesn't look like you’ve been well.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Cale had already looked over Basen from head to toe by the time Basen flinched his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Make sure to take care of your health as you work. Getting a good rest is a necessity. Making sure to eat is even more of a necessity.”</p>
<p>Basen noticed that Cale’s gaze was focused on the tips of his sleeve and quickly moved both hands back.</p>
<p>Basen’s sleeves were dirty and covered in ink.</p>
<p>They looked as if his sleeves had gotten dirty because he had been writing something for a while.</p>
<p>That was indeed what had happened.</p>
<p>"Are you busy because of me?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all!”</p>
<p>Cale did not ask anything else after hearing Basen’s energetic response.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the type to answer just because Cale asked him anyway.</p>
<p>Instead, Cale asked Basen, whose appearance made it very clear that he had been working hard.</p>
<p>“I know you’ve been doing work for the territory for a while now; it’s not too hard I hope?”</p>
<p>Yes, hyung-nim. It’s not hard!”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Basen responded without getting flustered this time.</p>
<p>“It’s fun! It’s not too bad.”</p>
<p>“I guess working for the territory suits you?”</p>
<p>“I think so. I think the territory's internal affairs area suits me best. That’s why it is not hard.”</p>
<p>There was something Basen wanted to say.</p>
<p>He wanted to say that he was not having a hard time because of his brother and that he was working hard because he liked what he was doing.</p>
<p>He wanted to say that he enjoyed doing his part to help out the territory.</p>
<p>This was the truth.</p>
<p>Basen’s goal since a long time ago was to work for this territory.</p>
<p>He wanted to work here with his brother Cale and sister Lily.</p>
<p>Cale noticed that Basen was telling the truth when he said it was fun.</p>
<p>That was why he stopped walking for a moment and looked around.</p>
<p>Nobody else was around them except the children averaging nine-years-old.</p>
<p>It was probably to be considerate of Cale.</p>
<p>‘This is good.’</p>
<p>Cale had been thinking that he needed to set things straight at least once before it was too late.</p>
<p>He decided it was the best time to bring it up since they were talking about related issues anyway.</p>
<p>“…Hyung-nim?”</p>
<p>Basen looked toward Cale, who had suddenly stopped walking, with confusion.</p>
<p>He could see that Cale’s extremely calm gaze looked more serious than ever before.</p>
<p>Anybody would be tell that Cale was about to speak the truth.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Basen.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, hyung-nim?”</p>
<p>“You be the territory lord.”</p>
<p>Cale then observed Basen’s response.</p>
<p>But Basen was weird.</p>
<p>“…Hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Basen’s voice was shaking.</p>
<p>Cale felt something was off and looked at Basen’s face. Basen's pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p>Basen couldn't help but act like this.</p>
<p>His father and mother had both told him about it.</p>
<p>They couldn’t tell Lily but they had stealthily told Basen since he would eventually find out while handling the internal affairs of the territory.</p>
<p>They told him that there might be a great battle that has not happened in hundreds of years starting in Puzzle City soon.</p>
<p>The Henituse household’s number one priority during that battle was-</p>
<p>‘To make sure that Cale survives.’</p>
<p>His father and mother’s voices echoed in his mind.</p>
<p>His father had also said the following.</p>
<p>‘Our Henituse household’s goal is to live peacefully and happily.’</p>
<p>There was no need to be recorded in history.</p>
<p>There was no need for fame.</p>
<p>All they wanted was to live their life well.</p>
<p>‘That is my number one priority as the patriarch of this family.’</p>
<p>Basen’s heart sank after hearing Cale telling him to be the territory lord because of what his parents had told him.</p>
<p>The great battle that could happen in Puzzle City…</p>
<p>They told him that there was no way to know how many people will get hurt or die.</p>
<p>His hyung-nim was the person who was most likely to stand in front of everybody else in that battle.</p>
<p>That same hyung-nim was seriously telling him to be the territory lord.</p>
<p>It sounded as if he was saying he wouldn't be there to take that position.</p>
<p>That sounded like-</p>
<p>‘H, he thinks that he might di-’</p>
<p>Basen did not dare to finish that thought.</p>
<p>Cale dying at the end of the battle and he becoming the territory lord?</p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p>Basen’s lips were shaking as he started to speak.</p>
<p>He clenched his eyes shut and shouted out.</p>
<p>“I really hope that you return alive, hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>“Have you not gotten much sleep because of work?”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Basen flinched and asked back after hearing Cale’s immediate response.</p>
<p>"Why are you saying something so obvious?”</p>
<p>Cale chuckled and nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>“Of course I'll come back alive.”</p>
<p>“Then… Why are you talking like someone who is leaving-”</p>
<p>Basen could see Cale's eyes open wide after hearing that statement.</p>
<p>Cale urgently started to speak.</p>
<p>“Why would I leave?!”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the blankly asking Basen and waved his arm around as if to tell Basen never to say something like that ever again.</p>
<p>‘Leave?!</p>
<p>Why is he saying such sad things?!</p>
<p>Why would I leave this rich family behind and go elsewhere?!</p>
<p>I have a lot of money but having even more money is better!’</p>
<p>Cale sternly shook his head.</p>
<p>“I just want to stay near Harris Village and the Forest of Darkness and get some rest. I will frequently visit home as well.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale shared his plans with Basen.</p>
<p>“I also don’t plan on leaving the territory once things involving that White Star bastard are resolved.”</p>
<p>He might have to help the children averaging nine-years-old travel the world.</p>
<p>But that would just be traveling for fun and should not have any issues.</p>
<p>“My goal is to live peacefully and quietly.”</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes indeed.’</p>
<p>Cale, who nodded his head as if he was agreeing with his own statement, flinched after seeing Basen’s face.</p>
<p>Basen was smiling brightly.</p>
<p>He was full of emotion after hearing Cale share the goal of the Henituse household.</p>
<p>“Yes. Hyung-nim, that is a very good goal!”</p>
<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>“For sure!”</p>
<p>Cale smiled with joy, thinking that Basen smiling again meant that his desires had been properly delivered.</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>Hong walked around the two smiling people.Both of you look happy! I'm really happy too!</p>
<p>Raon was spinning in air while invisible.</p>
<p>Only On…</p>
<p>On was the only one taking a close look at Cale and Basen's expressions as she recalled their conversation.</p>
<p>She then started to shake her head side to side.</p>
<p>On then mumbled so quietly that nobody else could hear her.</p>
<p>“…I think a slacker life will be hard, nya.”</p>
<p>On went over and patted Cale’s foot as if she pitied him.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim, it is only one day but please rest well tonight.”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan.”</p>
<p>“We will make sure they prepare a feast.”</p>
<p>“Very good.”</p>
<p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
<p>The two of them looked very happy as they started to walk again.</p>
<p>However, at that moment…</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>Cale’s expression stiffened up.</p>
<p>There was a sharp sound echoing through the house, the Lord’s Castle, and the entire Rain City.</p>
<p>This was an alarm for when enemies were invading.</p>
<p>It was a Special-Grade warning.</p>
<p>Cale’s first battle…</p>
<p>This alarm had been heard during that battle at the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>“…What the hell?”</p>
<p>‘Is it the White Star? Who could it be?</p>
<p>What son of a bitch is trying to mess with our territory again?’</p>
<p>Cale's face looked cold with anger.</p>
<p>“Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>Choi Han was rushing toward him.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>Cale immediately turned away from the direction of his room.</p>
<p>He then started to walk out. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 625: Will never be seen in the world again 3</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>Cale's steps were so quick that Basen had to rush after calling out to him.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>Deputy Butler Hans came from the other side and started to walk right next to Cale. They didn't greet each other even after not having seen each other for a while.</p>
<p>“Hans, is that the alarm I think it is?”</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim!”</p>
<p>Basen walked up as well and started to speak before Hans.</p>
<p>“We are currently installing magic devices throughout the territory.”</p>
<p>Cale had heard about it from Ron earlier.</p>
<p>“Although the alarms were only used by scouts or knights who noticed enemies invading, it is different now. Some of the magic devices we have installed react when special powers such as magic or aura are detected to be acting abnormally.”</p>
<p>Magic, aura… Or similar types of power.</p>
<p>“It would naturally be difficult to detect if a highest-grade mage or sword master hides their powers but it will detect it from anybody under those levels. Of course, anybody releasing their strength will be immediately discovered.”</p>
<p>Hans nodded his head at Basen's explanation.</p>
<p>“That’s right! They are quite the sensitive magic devices as the little young master-nim mentioned.</p>
<p>Hans was breathing heavily after having quickly walked over but thoroughly answered Cale’s question.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the alarm level is dependent on the level of strength that was discovered!”</p>
<p>“Then is this the highest level?”</p>
<p>Hans gulped after seeing the cold gaze on Cale's face.</p>
<p>“Yes sir! Young master-nim! This is the highest level alarm!”</p>
<p>‘…Who the hell is trying to invade our territory?’</p>
<p>Cale's eyes looked as if they were on fire.</p>
<p>‘Is it the White Star?</p>
<p>Or maybe it is his subordinate bastards?</p>
<p>Who could it be?</p>
<p>Who is here because they want their lives to be over?’</p>
<p>Cale did not share those thoughts out loud and calmly asked another question.</p>
<p>“The magic devices are that sensitive now?”</p>
<p>They had no idea when someone might try to attack the Henituse territory. This device was quite useful for that.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, did you forget where this is?”</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>Cale brusquely responded back, making Hans start to smile.</p>
<p>“This is the current strongest kingdom when it comes to magic. This is the Roan Kingdom.”</p>
<p>With the new Magic Tower not yet built… Rosalyn and the other skilled mages were all staying in the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>There was also kingdom-wide support for magic with the crown prince at the center of it.</p>
<p>“Magic devices are becoming more advanced by the minute. Rosalyn-nim’s influence is especially big.”</p>
<p>The moment Hans mentioned Rosalyn, Cale thought about some individuals that Hans and Basen did not know.</p>
<p>There were three friends and mentors helping her.</p>
<p>Raon, Eruhaben, and Sheritt.</p>
<p>The three of them were most likely helping with her research.</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips twisted up.</p>
<p>“…No wonder his highness didn't seem to be complaining.”</p>
<p>There were chances that the White Star might come to Puzzle City at any moment.</p>
<p>Alberu would not have only believed in Cale.</p>
<p>He would have believed in the Roan Kingdom as well. He would have had faith that they had the foundations set to fight against the White Star.</p>
<p>"Does that mean that this alarm only reacts to special powers?”</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>The alarm echoed throughout the building.</p>
<p>“Yes! Hyung-nim! There are a total of five places with the devices completely installed so someone from the Lord’s Castle will soon let us know where the alarm originally from!”</p>
<p>They would know from which direction the intruder was coming.</p>
<p>It was quite useful.</p>
<p>Hans looked extremely proud.</p>
<p>“This is something that is only possible in a territory with as much wealth as the Henituse territory! These magic devices cost so much that someone would need a mountain of gold to pay for it!”</p>
<p>‘A mountain?</p>
<p>A mountain of gold?’</p>
<p>Cale flinched after hearing about a ton of money despite the urgent nature while Basen calmly mumbled as he stepped in front of Cale.</p>
<p>“It is only one mountain and not five mountains of gold, it's not very expensive.”</p>
<p>This made Cale think that the Henituse household had enough wealth to form five mountains of gold but looked forward after hearing Basen shout a command.</p>
<p>They were in front of the door.</p>
<p>“Open the door!”</p>
<p>Their staff quickly opened the door.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff!”</p>
<p>They could see a soldier running toward them.</p>
<p>Hans pointed toward the soldier.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, that person is the messenger- eek! Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“I'm going first.”</p>
<p>Cale quickly rushed past him.</p>
<p>Hans could see how Cale, who was wearing than him, was able to move so quickly.</p>
<p>There were whirlwinds surrounding both of his feet.</p>
<p>“I as well.”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”I'm going first too!</p>
<p>Choi Han and the children averaging nine-years-old followed behind Cale.</p>
<p>Basen’s footsteps slowed down after seeing all of them darting forward.</p>
<p>“Little young master-nim! Shouldn’t we move quicker as well?”</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>Basen oddly felt calm even after seeing Cale’s urgent expression.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim will take care of things better than I can. We will focus on the internal defenses rather than the external intruder.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir! I will go escort the Interim Lord-nim over!”</p>
<p>“Also contact the Lord-nim in the capital.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>Basen trusted Cale.</p>
<p>He was the most reliable shield.</p>
<p>That was why he was planning on being a sturdy pillar for the shield to do as it pleases.</p>
<p>This was Basen’s method after choosing his pen over a sword.</p>
<p>However, there was something he did not know.</p>
<p>Cale's shield was used to strike first every so often.</p>
<p>“Huff! Huff!”</p>
<p>The messenger shouted with urgency as soon as he saw Cale.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“Where are the intruders?”</p>
<p>“Huff, huff! To the west, sir! The alarm came from the Western city walls of Rain City!”</p>
<p>‘The west…’</p>
<p>Cale quickly turned toward the west.</p>
<p>He heard the messenger’s desperate shout behind him.</p>
<p>“Lily-nim is currently outside the western walls!”</p>
<p>"…What did you say?”</p>
<p>“That is where the soldiers train so I heard that she was heading toward the Western gate to come see you, young master-nim! The alarm went off soon after that-!”</p>
<p>‘Damn it.’</p>
<p>Cale’s body shot forward as quickly as the wind.</p>
<p>The current alarm had come from the western city walls.</p>
<p>‘I'm sure of it!’</p>
<p>He was sure that Lily would have headed for the city as quickly as possible as soon as she heard that Cale was home.</p>
<p>Even Cale knew that Lily listened to him very well. He was sharp enough to notice that.</p>
<p>‘She's also weak.’</p>
<p>Lily had a lot of potential but was still quite lacking compared to Cale and the others.</p>
<p>“Everybody get ready.”</p>
<p>He gave the order without even looking back.</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>Fog and poison slowly started to rise from On and Hong’s bodies.We shouldn't use magic because they are installing more magic devices but I'll keep them prepared since it is an urgent situation!</p>
<p>Black mana started to gather in the air right above Cale.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Black aura that looked as if it could destroy anything shot out of Choi Han's sword.</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>“Close the gate!”</p>
<p>“Hide! Evacuate underground!”</p>
<p>“Move to the shelter!”</p>
<p>The citizens of the territory were scared but quickly moving as they continued to hear this alarm that would not stop.</p>
<p>They seemed to have trained for this many times.</p>
<p>“Huh?! Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“As expected, right away-!”</p>
<p>They stopped moving for a moment to look at Cale and the others.</p>
<p>They were moving too quickly to see clearly but they did see the red hair and the shining black aura.</p>
<p>Those two things were enough to make the citizens stop worrying.</p>
<p>“He’s stepping into help even though he just got back from a difficult test……!”</p>
<p>“Our young master-nim… He truly is different from the others. If the gods descended down to the world, they would probably be as good as our young master-nim.”</p>
<p>“Sob. As long as the young master-nim is here, our territory, our shield! Will not break!”</p>
<p>The citizens were saying things that would make Cale faint in shock if he heard them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Cale could not hear them.</p>
<p>His body was already by the western wall.</p>
<p>As some of the soldiers recognized him and were about to speak…</p>
<p>“Young miss!”</p>
<p>“Young lady-nim!”</p>
<p>The knight who looked to be in charge was shouting to someone from the ledge of the wall.</p>
<p>"…Cale-nim, I smell blood.”</p>
<p>The wind blowing form the west delivered a thick scent of blood to Cale.</p>
<p>Lily. Blood.</p>
<p>Shouts coming from outside the city walls.</p>
<p>“Please! Please save him!”</p>
<p>It wasn't Lily.</p>
<p>However, Cale’s body could not help but respond on its own.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Hold on! The blood!”</p>
<p>It was because he heard Lily's groan and urgent voice next.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>‘Who could it be?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Just who-’</p>
<p>“Who the hell-”</p>
<p>His voice was calm but sounded extremely sharp as he instantly shot up into the air.</p>
<p>A bright rose gold light surrounded him and looked ready to cast rose gold thunderbolts toward the enemies at any moment.</p>
<p>“Ah! Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“The young master-nim is here!”</p>
<p>The rest of the soldiers and knights finally spotted him.</p>
<p>However, Cale wasn’t paying attention to them as he was looking toward the direction of Lily's voice.Human!</p>
<p>Raon was naturally with him as well.</p>
<p>Cale then saw the situation and the enemy who had set off the alarm.…Huh?</p>
<p>Raon tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Cale also tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>He could see the battlefield.</p>
<p>Yes, he could see it.</p>
<p>The old knight next to Lily started to shout.</p>
<p>“The Cats are stealthy assassins! Don't let down your guard!”</p>
<p>“Yes master!”</p>
<p>The greatsword in Lily's hands released a large gust of wind.</p>
<p>The greatsword that was larger than the one Lily had been using last time was extremely large compared to her small hands.</p>
<p>Actually, the greatsword that was as tall as most average adult men would have been huge even without the comparison.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The gust of wind from the greatsword slammed against a man wearing a black assassin outfit who was trying to run away.…Oh. She’s strong.</p>
<p>Raon gasped in admiration but Cale could see a faint light coming from Lily's greatsword.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as clear as Choi Han’s aura.</p>
<p>However, he could faintly see aura smoke rising from the sword.</p>
<p>That meant that she was almost at the high-grade knight level.</p>
<p>“…Hasn’t she only been using the sword for like two years?”</p>
<p>‘What am I seeing right now?’</p>
<p>Cale's mind turned into a chaotic mess for a moment.It’s possible in two years! I am great and mighty even though I am only six years old!</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The man wearing an assassin’s outfit, who was presumed to be the enemy, fell down after being attacked by the large greatsword again.It’s the Cat tribe!</p>
<p>There were approximately ten of them.</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze started to sink.</p>
<p>Cat tribe assassins. They were fighting against Lily's side right now.</p>
<p>Lily was standing in the front with the old knight next to her and some knights surrounding her to support her.</p>
<p>Cale started to mumble.</p>
<p>“There’s no way the alarm would sound for some Cats like them.”</p>
<p>It was not a regular alarm but an alarm that would go off if the entire territory was in danger.</p>
<p>The corners of his lips slowly drew an arc and went up.</p>
<p>"Cale Henituse!”</p>
<p>One of the Cats noticed him.</p>
<p>“Huh?!”</p>
<p>Lily turned her head and her eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Unlike Basen who was getting lighter by the day like Cale, the healthy Lily who had bronze skin subconsciously lowered her greatsword.</p>
<p>“Lily! I told you never to put your guard down!”</p>
<p>The old knight jumped toward Lily.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>One of the Cats had used stealthy movements to arrive right in front of Lily.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He was then sent flying.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Lily's master, the old knight, gulped.</p>
<p>Here was an idol of the knights.</p>
<p>The black aura of their esteemed sword master had instantly sent the Cat flying.</p>
<p>Choi Han, who had arrived at some point, stood in front of Lily.</p>
<p>He then pointed toward the Cats.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>On and Hong then jumped down from Choi Han’s shoulders.</p>
<p>"Those mutants!”</p>
<p>“How dare those trashes!”</p>
<p>Two of the Cats pointed their blades at On and Hong.”</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>On snorted at them.</p>
<p>Hong was smiling like Cale.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you freaking cowards got the courage to get here but you're all just rats in a cage now, nya!”</p>
<p>“Hong. Freaking cowards is not nice to say nya.”</p>
<p>“That much is okay, nya!”</p>
<p>On and Hong were casually chatting with each other.</p>
<p>“Ugh! How did things end up like this?!”</p>
<p>The one who seemed to be the leader of the Cats started to frown.</p>
<p>He tried to stealthily look around to find an escape route.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>However, an old man’s eyes flashed from the shadows of the forest opposite the city walls and stared at him.</p>
<p>It was Ron.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his assassins started to appear from different shadows all around the forest and prevented the Cats’ escape path.</p>
<p>They were some of the people of the Molan household who had followed Ron to the Western continent.They won't be able to escape! We will get them all now that Ron is here! I can use magic since I'm outside the city walls!</p>
<p>“Fuck! When the hell?!”</p>
<p>Hundreds of black arrows appeared and were pointed at the Cats.</p>
<p>The intruders felt as if their bodies would be pierced into pieces from these hundreds of sharp arrows.</p>
<p>However, they all then looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse, who was covered in rose gold light, descended to the ground with his hair fluttering.</p>
<p>He then walked toward Lily.</p>
<p>He did not pay any attention to the Cats.</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>The alarm was still going.</p>
<p>“Long time no see.”</p>
<p>He walked over to Lily, who was standing with a blank expression, and nonchalantly rubbed her hair. Her now-short hair looked quite cute like a chestnut.</p>
<p>Lily could not say anything and just looked up at Cale.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve been working hard. We’ll go home and eat in a moment.”</p>
<p>Lily vigorously nodded her head as she started to tear up.</p>
<p>Cale patted Lily's head once more and started to walk to the spot behind Lily and the knights.</p>
<p>The reason Lily and the knights were standing up front…</p>
<p>It was to protect someone.</p>
<p>‘Ugh! Hold on! The blood-!’</p>
<p>Lily had shouted those things while looking at someone.</p>
<p>Cale's eyes looked toward the person who was covered in blood and barely breathing.</p>
<p>The person who was carrying that bloody person was barely speaking as she had a gasp across her neck.</p>
<p>Cale had not noticed her voice because her neck had been injured.</p>
<p>“P, please save him, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>This woman who was calling him young master-nim…</p>
<p>He would have normally recognized her voice.</p>
<p>Cale knelt down next to the woman who was kneeling on one knee without falling down.</p>
<p>He then made eye contact with the man who was on her back.</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>This magic device that reacted to special powers such as aura and mana…</p>
<p>It had sounded the highest-level alarm because it had detected a dangerous power.</p>
<p>The magic device had reacted to this man's power.</p>
<p>The man who was barely breathing was still releasing his power as much as possible.</p>
<p>The reason was obvious.</p>
<p>Realize that I am here.</p>
<p>This man would not have known about the magic device in the territory.</p>
<p>He must have done this hoping for Raon or Eruhaben to notice.</p>
<p>Cale slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Duke Fredo.”</p>
<p>The leader of the Vampires.</p>
<p>The man who was always elegant as if he wanted to show the demeanor of a true noble looked like a mess right now.</p>
<p>He was barely alive and had been carried here by his loyal subordinate.</p>
<p>Alberu said he had lost contact with Duke Fredo after that last static video call.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had stayed behind at the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>“…Duke Fredo, what the hell happened to you?” </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 626: Will never be seen in the world again 4</p>
<p>He asked Duke Fredo who was in no condition to respond.</p>
<p>“…Haaaa…haa……”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was barely breathing as he looked toward Cale with dim eyes and faintly smiled before releasing his aura that he had been forcing out until now.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>His hand limply fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, please-!”</p>
<p>Solena, who was carrying Fredo, was still begging Cale for help in a raspy voice as if something was wrong with her vocal cords.</p>
<p>“Choi Han!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>“Bring them inside right away!”</p>
<p>“I’m on it!”</p>
<p>Choi Han moved toward Solena as soon as he heard Cale’s order.</p>
<p>“I will escort Duke Fredo.”</p>
<p>Choi Han could feel his body getting wet as soon as he carried Fredo.</p>
<p>It was blood.</p>
<p>The problem was that there was so much blood and dust on Fredo to tell where he was bleeding.</p>
<p>Fredo was in an extremely dangerous condition.</p>
<p>“Lily.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>“Over here. Please take care of Solena.”</p>
<p>“I will!”</p>
<p>Lily headed over to Solena without asking any questions after hearing Cale’s request.</p>
<p>A knight by her side moved with her and helped her support Solena.</p>
<p>“…Y…young master-nim-”</p>
<p>During the time Cale was working with Duke Fredo in the Endable Kingdom… Solena had been the one to help him by his side while he was transformed into young master Naru.</p>
<p>That might be why she was calling Cale young master-nim right now.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what is going on but I'm guessing you guys came here hoping that we could help.”</p>
<p>It was a hope for survival.</p>
<p>“You can rest now. You survived.”</p>
<p>Solena sighed in relief and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Her body grew weak and limped over.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim! She seems to have lost consciousness!”</p>
<p>“Orabuni! Shall I call a priest over?”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head after hearing the knight and Lily's comments.</p>
<p>“I will take care of the treatment stuff so just move her.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak into the air after seeing that the two Vampires were moved.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>-What is it, Human?</p>
<p>Vampires.</p>
<p>They were beings that Cale could not just openly show to priests or healers.</p>
<p>Potions might end up being poison for them.</p>
<p>“Please call Mary over. Oh, call Eruhaben-nim as well. Also contact Tasha.”It’s for their treatment isn't it? Do not worry! I will take care of it all!</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>Now that he had brought the two Vampires in and contacted the people who could heal them…</p>
<p>Now that he took care of the pressing issues…</p>
<p>“Ron.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim?”</p>
<p>“Get them.”</p>
<p>“I understand, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>The only thing left now were these Cat tribe bastards.</p>
<p>They were gathered together with the Cat who seemed to be the leader at the center.</p>
<p>“Boss, what do we do?”</p>
<p>“What else? We have to run.”</p>
<p>“Ugh. We lost a chance to kill a traitor……!”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“…Sorry sir.”</p>
<p>They could see a red fog surrounding them at that moment.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The boss Cat scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>One of the Cats by his side started to shout.</p>
<p>He was glaring at the two kittens who had caused this red fog.</p>
<p>“You dare to crawl over to the Cat tribe's enemies while the blood of the Cats flows inside you? This is why you bastards are mutants and weak- ugh!”</p>
<p>He could not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>The Cat urgently twisted his body.</p>
<p>A sharp dagger brushed past his neck.</p>
<p>It would have pierced through his neck if he had not moved.</p>
<p>The Cat who barely dodged the attack looked toward the fog. He could see a cold set of eyes.</p>
<p>“The blood of the Cats? How dare you. These children have the blood of the Molan household.”</p>
<p>A silent anger could be felt through the old man’s eyes.</p>
<p>“What fucking bullshit!”</p>
<p>Ron smiled benignly at the Cat who swore in disbelief.</p>
<p>“They have the blood of the Molan household since they have carried on the Molan techniques.”</p>
<p>A small smile appeared on On and Hong’s faces as they continued to create the red fog.</p>
<p>The Molan techniques.</p>
<p>Ron had taught them the Molan household’s foundational techniques other than assassination.</p>
<p>On started to speak.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>On and Hong disappeared into the red fog.</p>
<p>Their stealth technique was much more developed than in the past and that was the beginning.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The Cat who had been shouting that On and Hong were mutants ended up having his neck pierced in the end.</p>
<p>Ron and the members of the Molan household continued their attacks.</p>
<p>There were about 10 Cats including the injured but the Molan household had more and had On and Hong on their side.</p>
<p>It was a complete disadvantage for the Cats.</p>
<p>‘Fuck!’</p>
<p>The boss Cat could feel it in his skin and started to frown every time he heard the small groans of his subordinates around him.</p>
<p>If he fought with them…</p>
<p>‘I could escape with a few of them.’</p>
<p>But that was not the problem right now.</p>
<p>They were here to kill Duke Fredo. There was a simple reason they had let him reach the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>‘We let him come here so that we could find Cale Henituse inside the black orb.’</p>
<p>But there was a problem now.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse is awake now?’</p>
<p>That could only mean one thing.</p>
<p>It meant that Cale Henituse had successful completed the god’s test.</p>
<p>The human who had looked as if he was dead until not too long ago still looked weak but he was fine.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was not the issue anymore.</p>
<p>‘I need to inform the liege about Cale Henituse's status!’</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>He subconsciously gulped.</p>
<p>It was because he could not fathom what Cale Henituse would have gained and how much stronger he would have gotten by completing the god’s test.</p>
<p>‘…He said that it would be impossible for Cale Henituse to be here if he did not pass the test.’</p>
<p>That was what his liege, the White Star, had told him.</p>
<p>‘That test is something you can only wake from if you pass. You have no choice but to accept him.’</p>
<p>‘If that happens, only Cale Henituse and I would be qualified to battle each other to rule the world.’</p>
<p>That was why he needed to inform the White Star about this situation.</p>
<p>The boss Cat started to move extremely carefully and stealthily like he had never done before. He increased all of his senses to the max.</p>
<p>He could hear his subordinates being injured and getting caught, he could even faintly feel the enemy assassins’ movements.</p>
<p>He would use this as the foundation to escape.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>A silver-haired child with a nonchalant expression appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>“On.”</p>
<p>He then heard an old man's benign voice behind him.</p>
<p>“You must capture him before you ask questions.”</p>
<p>“I understand, grandfather.”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>The boss Cat felt a hand strike the back of his neck before his whole body went limp.</p>
<p>‘N, no-!’</p>
<p>He couldn’t lose his consciousness like this!</p>
<p>‘I need to let him know!’</p>
<p>The boss Cat had a lot of things he wanted to say but only managed to say one thing before he fainted.</p>
<p>“…I must inform the liege that Cale Henituse has woken up-”</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>Hong left a paw print stamp on the fallen boss Cat’s cheek.</p>
<p>It was a green paw print stamp with sleeping poison on it.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim. It seems that he wanted to escape to inform the White Star.”</p>
<p>Ron carried the boss Cat over by the collar and reported to Cale who started to frown.</p>
<p>Ron continued to speak in a benign voice after seeing his reaction.</p>
<p>“It would have been useless anyway. The citizens of our territory have seen your return so the information would quickly spread throughout the Western continent anyway, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Ron was right.</p>
<p>The White Star would learn of Cale's return whether this Cat ran away to report it or not.</p>
<p>Cale was upset but started to walk toward the gate without saying anything because he knew Ron was right.</p>
<p>“Throw all of the Cats into the underground prison. Figure out what happened.”</p>
<p>“I understand, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale left the rest to Ron and carried On and Hong as he walked toward the Duke's Estate.Human! Mary and Goldie gramps will be here soon! I contacted Tasha and she said she would look into it before calling me back!</p>
<p>Cale stopped for a moment and looked up at where he presumed Raon to be.</p>
<p>“Ron.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the thick city walls and stealthily gave an order.</p>
<p>“Find out if there are any more rats in the city.”</p>
<p>He had a feeling the Cats would not be the only ones.</p>
<p>“Yes. Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale started to walk toward the Duke's Estate again.</p>
<p>“We have taken care of the basic treatments. They should regain consciousness soon.”</p>
<p>“Good job, Mary.”</p>
<p>Mary shook her head.</p>
<p>“I am familiar with dead mana but I did not dare to proceed with thorough treatment because they are Vampires so I only did the basics.”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Duke Fredo who was lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Mary continued to speak.</p>
<p>“It is just that Duke Fredo's restoration ability is quite strong that he should quickly heal if we do some basic treatments and support him. The problem is Miss Solena.”</p>
<p>“…Is it serious?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben started to speak instead.</p>
<p>He could not treat Duke Fredo because of dead mana but he was helping Mary and imparting his wisdom to her.</p>
<p>“She has fewer injuries than Duke Fredo, but she is lacking in immunity and restoration ability. She also seems to have used up a lot of stamina to carry Duke Fredo here.”</p>
<p>“She is in danger for multiple reasons.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and looked down at the back of his hand.</p>
<p>He could see his veins.</p>
<p>He thought about his blood that should be flowing through those veins.</p>
<p>‘Looks like this bastard Fredo won’t need it but it might be needed depending on Solena’s development.’</p>
<p>He asked Mary to take care of her.</p>
<p>“Please take care of Solena. Let me know if she wakes up or if she’s in danger.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand.”</p>
<p>Solena was not in this guest bedroom but the other guest bedroom next to this one.</p>
<p>“…What a headache.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the room changed after Eruhaben quietly mumbled.</p>
<p>Only Eruhaben, Choi Han and Cale were now left in the room.</p>
<p>Cale had send the children averaging nine-years-old to Beacrox to eat as it was dinner time.</p>
<p>Children needed to eat properly.</p>
<p>"Cale-nim, do you think the White Star found out about Duke Fredo?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben said something as well after hearing Choi Han’s question.</p>
<p>“If it is Duke Fredo, he would have planned a few different escape routes in case the White Star found out. That is probably why he chose to stay behind at the Endable Kingdom. The fact that he ended up this injured and barely managed to escape is a big deal.”</p>
<p>He was certain.</p>
<p>“It was something unexpected. Something unexpected must have happened. It must have been something Duke Fredo could have never even imagined.”</p>
<p>Choi Han’s eyes sank down after hearing Eruhaben’s statements.</p>
<p>They already had a headache with the issues regarding Puzzle City and now their concerns were worse seeing the strong Duke Fredo looking like this.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Knock knock knock.</p>
<p>They heard someone knocking on the door.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>Choi Han walked to the door.</p>
<p>“It's me.”</p>
<p>It was Duchess Violan’s voice.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and Choi Han opened the door.</p>
<p>Eruhaben disguised himself as a knight and moved behind Cale.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>Violan had not come alone.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“Orabuni.”</p>
<p>Basen and Lily were looking at Cale while standing behind Violan.</p>
<p>Violan let out a short sigh before pointing to the two children.</p>
<p>“They were so adamant that they come with me. That is why we all came together. Can we come in?”</p>
<p>“Of course. You are in charge of everything right now, mother.”</p>
<p>Duke Deruth was at the capital right now.</p>
<p>That was why Duchess Violan was in charge of the Henituse territory and the Duke's Estate, and it was only natural for her to know about the Cats and these unfamiliar visitors.</p>
<p>“I heard that you threw the Cats into the dungeon. Ron said that they are the White Star’s subordinates.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct. As for this person and the person next door-”</p>
<p>Cale flinched and turned his head while trying to explain about Fredo and Solena.</p>
<p>“Oo…ooooooooo…….”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had let out a quiet groan.</p>
<p>The way he was frowning made it seem as if he would wake up soon.</p>
<p>Eruhaben immediately looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Choi Han, go call Mary!”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>Choi Han started to move past Violan and the children to head out.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo's eyelids slowly lifted and revealed his eyes.</p>
<p>“You're awake?”</p>
<p>Cale asked while making eye contact with Fredo.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo's mouth slowly opened.</p>
<p>“Lo……”</p>
<p>He was having trouble speaking but sounded as if he was very happy to see Cale.</p>
<p>Long time… no see… my son.”</p>
<p>It was a joke.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was showing his joy by bringing up the time Cale had spent as young master Naru.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>Basen and Lily heard him though.</p>
<p>“…Son?”</p>
<p>“…Son?”</p>
<p>The two of them repeated the same thing over and over and what they were thinking was clearly visible on their faces.</p>
<p>“What bullshit is that?”</p>
<p>"Who the fuck is this guy?”</p>
<p>Cale flinched and turned toward his siblings after hearing them using such words for the first time.</p>
<p>That was why he did not manage to look at Violan.</p>
<p>Choi Han, who had been walking past Violan, subconsciously stopped walking after seeing her hand.</p>
<p>Violan’s hand was slightly shaking.</p>
<p>Choi Han raised his head to look at her face.</p>
<p>Her eyes were so focused on Cale and Duke Fredo as if she didn't even notice Choi Han looking at her.</p>
<p>‘…Why does she have such an expression-’</p>
<p>It looked as if tens of years were instantly passing through Violan’s face.</p>
<p>It was an impossible to explain type of expression.</p>
<p>Choi Han found this to be weird because Violan was always flawless with her expressions.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“You must be fine since you can speak such bullshit.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo chuckled at Cale's comment.</p>
<p>“My son, how can you say that your father is speaking bullshit?”</p>
<p>“Your son my ass. Just sleep if you're only going to keep bullshitting.”</p>
<p>Cale completely ignored Duke Fredo’s statement and looked toward his two stiff siblings.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to pay any attention to this bastard’s bullshit.”</p>
<p>Basen smiled and nodded his head after hearing Cale clearly call Fredo a bastard.</p>
<p>“Yes. I knew that it was complete nonsense. It was just so unexpected that I wondered if he was someone you treated like a father, hyung-nim. Hahahaha-”</p>
<p>Lily removed her hand from her in-house sword she carried around instead of her greatsword and quietly mumbled.</p>
<p>“…I thought a weird enemy had infiltrated our house……”</p>
<p>Choi Han could see Violan’s mouth starting to open.</p>
<p>“…Ah. Of course. What delusion-”</p>
<p>She let out a short but deep sigh.</p>
<p>She seemed to have been shocked by what she just said and flinched before turning her head to look around.</p>
<p>Choi Han noticed before she moved and quickly looked away from her as if he didn't see anything and headed toward Mary.</p>
<p>“Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>He heard Violan sigh again behind him.</p>
<p>Choi Han stealthily peeked back. Violan looked normal again.</p>
<p>Violan was looking at Cale's bright red hair that had grown quite long.</p>
<p>There was a lot of affection in her stoic gaze.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Soon.”</p>
<p>Fredo looked as if he was in pain.</p>
<p>He barely managed to calm himself down and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“The sacrifices will be moved to Puzzle City soon.”</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>Everybody in the room was looking at Fredo.</p>
<p>“There will be two different summoning rituals.”</p>
<p>Fredo continued to speak looking as if he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>“Why are you here in the middle of the night after saying you’ll be here tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Alberu nonchalantly commented as if he could not believe that Cale was here.</p>
<p>“You truly are disrespectful.”</p>
<p>“Nice to see you again, your highness.”</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Alberu was shaking his head side to side.</p>
<p>“You and my instructor are the only ones who visit the crown prince's bedroom through the window.”</p>
<p>He looked toward Cale and Choi Han who were entering through the window with disbelief.</p>
<p>Cale smiled brightly and started to speak with an extremely well-oiled glib tongue.</p>
<p>“Your highness, you are as radiant as the sun in the middle of the day despite being in your pajamas.”</p>
<p>“…Sigh.”</p>
<p>Alberu could only sigh, wondering what Cale had done now. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 627: Will never be seen in the world again 5</p>
<p>The three unexpected guests came into the room without caring about the fact that Alberu was sighing.Hey crown prince! I'm here too! Give me some cookies if you have any! I'll pay you for them! The human gave me a ton of allowance! He gave me everything he owed while he was unconscious!</p>
<p>All three of them had come through the window.</p>
<p>“… Aigoo, my head.”</p>
<p>Alberu clutched his head.</p>
<p>Click. Choi Han closed the window and Raon revealed himself.</p>
<p>“Hey crown prince, why does your head hurt? You can’t get sick! Oh, you must be looking shabbier than usual because you are sick!”</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips twitched.</p>
<p>Cale sat down on the couch with a calm expression on his face. He was acting as if it was his own house.</p>
<p>“Raon. Everybody looks like that if they're suddenly woken up while sleeping. His highness must have been extremely busy as the sun of our Roan Kingdom. He must have barely found some time to take a quick nap so it's normal to look a bit scattered.”</p>
<p>He then smiled brightly toward Alberu.</p>
<p>“Of course, even your shabby appearance is extremely radiant, your highness. Isn't that right, Choi Han?”</p>
<p>Choi Han just slowly avoided Alberu’s gaze instead of responding.</p>
<p>It was because of Alberu’s gaze.</p>
<p>‘Choi Han. At least you would give me a normal response, right?’</p>
<p>That was what Alberu’s gaze was saying.</p>
<p>Alberu sighed at Choi Han avoiding his gaze and got up from the bed and walked over to the couch.</p>
<p>“I had them put some here just in case but I didn’t expect it to actually be needed.”</p>
<p>He placed a box of cookies onto the table.</p>
<p>“You really barged into my bedroom.”</p>
<p>“You seem oddly shocked about it, your highness.”</p>
<p>“Hey crown prince, here’s 1 silver! This is mine! Hehe!”</p>
<p>Crunch crunch.</p>
<p>The sound of Raon crunching on cookies filled the bedroom.</p>
<p>Cale crossed his legs and calmly started to speak.</p>
<p>“Raon said that the palace’s barrier is quite strong.”</p>
<p>“It needed to be when considering that our enemy is the White Star.”</p>
<p>Alberu brushed back his disheveled hair.</p>
<p>“…We made it so that the barrier would not activate for certain people.”</p>
<p>Those people were trustworthy allies such as Cale.</p>
<p>It would be a problem if their allies could not reach the throne room in times of emergency because of the barrier.</p>
<p>“Anyway, why are you here? What happened now?”</p>
<p>Alberu's gaze had turned serious.</p>
<p>“I recall you telling me that you would come to the capital tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>Yet Cale had barged in during the middle of the night.</p>
<p>It must be something big.</p>
<p>“Your highness. Duke Fredo arrived at our territory in critical condition.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Alberu held back a groan.</p>
<p>Cale's face was stiff as well.</p>
<p>"According to Duke Fredo, the White Star is planning on conducting two summoning rituals.”</p>
<p>“Two?”</p>
<p>Alberu realized the reason very quickly.</p>
<p>"The eight sculptures. The first summoning ritual must be to call forth the unranked monsters. As for the other one…”</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown as if he didn't even want to think about it before he added on.</p>
<p>“…lt is probably the sealed god.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. He wants to release the seal.”</p>
<p>Alberu touched his head as if it was giving him a headache.</p>
<p>The sealed god.</p>
<p>That god was called the evil god or the God of Despair.</p>
<p>The god’s attribute itself wasn’t that big of an issue.</p>
<p>There were bound to be evil since there was good. Similar to the Sun God who had cast away all races with the darkness attribute, those supposed ‘good’ gods weren't necessary god either.</p>
<p>‘The issue is that he is sealed because he broke a rule. He’s also deeply associated with the White Star.’</p>
<p>Alberu didn't like the sealed god based on the test he gave Cale.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Alberu didn't like anything that could harm his Roan Kingdom, whether it was a monster or a god.</p>
<p>“Both summoning rituals will take place in Puzzle City?”</p>
<p>He was also extremely annoyed that all of these things would happen on the Roan Kingdom's territory.</p>
<p>"Duke Fredo was unable to figure that out. The only information he got was that the White Star’s side is planning on coming to Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Alberu suddenly had a confused expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness.”</p>
<p>"Why did Duke Fredo show up in critical condition?”</p>
<p>He saw Choi Han's face stiffen up.</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>Raon stopped chomping on a cookie as well.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness. You said that the Wolf children were the sacrifices?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>Why was Cale suddenly bringing up the Wolves?</p>
<p>The Wolf tribe was known for being disowned by the gods.</p>
<p>The Wolf children were going to be used as the sacrifices to summon the 8 sculptures.</p>
<p>‘No way!’</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward Cale after a thought suddenly popped up in his mind.</p>
<p>There was a bitter smile on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“Your highness. Do you think the White Star truly cared about the Endable Kingdom?”</p>
<p>That bastard was cursed so that anything he cared about would be lost.</p>
<p>Everybody here knew about that.</p>
<p>“…I'm sure he didn’t.”</p>
<p>Everything the White Star did was a calculated plan so that he could gain power and become a king or god or whatever he wanted to be.</p>
<p>Alberu had expected this as well.</p>
<p>However, his hypothesis had seemed to vastly underestimate the White Star.</p>
<p>Alberu slowly started to frown.</p>
<p>“Your highness. This is what Duke Fredo told me.”</p>
<p>Cale repeated the things Fredo had told him earlier.</p>
<p>“We were substitutes prepared for any unexpected situations.”</p>
<p>Alberu closed his eyes and started to speak.</p>
<p>“They were substitutes to replace the Wolves?”</p>
<p>Existences accepted by nature but disowned by the gods.</p>
<p>The Wolves were not the only ones like that.</p>
<p>“I believe that is the case.”</p>
<p>“You believe? Fredo didn't tell you everything?”</p>
<p>“Duke Fredo fainted again after telling me a few things.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had an extremely high fever and had not been able to wake up again. Mary and Eruhaben were working together to nurse him after this sudden change but they had no idea when he might regain consciousness.</p>
<p>That was why Cale had rushed over to the capital instead of waiting for him to wake up.</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders while Alberu clenched the armrest of the couch.</p>
<p>Tap tap tap.</p>
<p>Alberu's index finger tapped on the armrest.</p>
<p>Alberu’s mind was a complicated mess.</p>
<p>The Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>The freedom and liberation he had felt there was still vivid on Alberu’s mind.</p>
<p>“What happened to the other Vampires? What about the Dark Elves? Did you not hear anything about them?”</p>
<p>The Vampires and Dark Elves.</p>
<p>They were races that absorbed dead mana unlike the Wolves but they were also accepted by nature but shunned by the gods, making them unable to use potions from the temples.</p>
<p>The sacrifices would be these two races.</p>
<p>It would be the regular civilians who had been peacefully living in the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak after receiving Alberu’s gaze.</p>
<p>“They are not dead.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense. The summoning ritual has not happened yet.”</p>
<p>Cale took a few documents out of his pocket and placed them on the table.</p>
<p>“I recorded everything I heard from Duke Fredo.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll reference these to set the direction of the meeting.”</p>
<p>The list of things for Alberu to do kept growing.</p>
<p>However, Alberu could not complain about that.</p>
<p>Only thorough preparation would guarantee peace.</p>
<p>“That sounds great, your highness. That is why I came over now. I thought I should give this to you as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>“Good. I'm glad you came. We would not have had enough time if you came in the morning since the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow during the day.”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Alberu looked up from the documents after hearing Cale’s confused voice.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“…There’s a meeting tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s expression seemed to be asking what was wrong.</p>
<p>“It is a grand assembly with the representatives of the different kingdoms for the peace of the Eastern and Western continents. The meeting is planned for noon tomorrow.”</p>
<p>It was a grand assembly with quite the ambitious name.</p>
<p>“…Your highness. Didn’t you say that we would have a meeting ‘soon’ during our call?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I said soon. Tomorrow at noon. Ah, it's past midnight. So then, today at noon.”</p>
<p>“…Is that soon?”</p>
<p>Alberu shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“It’s quite the urgent issue and everybody is busy. They all agreed to meet at noon once I told them you were coming in the morning.”</p>
<p>Raon raised his front paw.</p>
<p>It was a gesture to show that he had a question.</p>
<p>“Hey crown prince! Will the human have to go to the meeting without eating if it is at noon? Gentle Beacrox told me to make sure the human eats his meals on time!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t worry, Raon-nim. I will have food ready for Cale Henituse at around 11am.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Okay! I will drag the human here by 11!”</p>
<p>Choi Han had a smile of satisfaction while hearing their conversation.</p>
<p>Only Cale didn't look happy.</p>
<p>“Your highness. No, hyung-nim.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I think I should go to the Eastern continent to scope out the current situation. Can I skip out of the meeting?”</p>
<p>“Ah. Don’t worry about that. I'll let the Mercenary King know about the information Duke Fredo brought over. The Molan patriarch should be able to gather a lot of information if you ask him as well. You have a tendency to making things bigger wherever you go, so it's probably better to ask the two of them to gather information.”</p>
<p>“Since when do I-”</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to complain but his voice was drowned out by Raon and Choi Han’s voices.</p>
<p>Raon and Choi Han were nodding their heads in agreement.</p>
<p>“The crown prince is right! If we need to make a hole on a cliff, the human being there will make it so that we have to destroy the entire cliff!”</p>
<p>“You truly are wise, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head at the two of them before starting to frown after seeing Cale’s expression.</p>
<p>"Why do you have such a delinquent expression on your face?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing, your highness.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’ll be a quiet meeting so you don’t need to worry about unnecessary attention. We got rid of all of the burdensome procedures due to the current situation.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Cale stood up from his seat.</p>
<p>“Then… I'll be here by 11am.”</p>
<p>“Good. Are you heading to Duke Henituse's Estate in the capital?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir. We told them in advance that we would head over.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Cale flinched and turned toward Alberu after hearing his reaction.</p>
<p>It sounded oddly ominous.</p>
<p>“…Is there a problem, your highness?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Alberu thought about something for a moment before putting on a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Duke Deruth seemed quite skilled. He’s very similar to you.”</p>
<p>“Hey crown prince, doesn’t that mean that Duke Deruth would turn a task where we need to make a hole the size of a needle on a cliff to one where we need to destroy the cliff?”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha- Raon-nim, you say such funny things.”</p>
<p>Alberu was laughing.</p>
<p>However, he did not say that Raon was wrong.</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’</p>
<p>Cale slowly started to get worried.</p>
<p>This ominous feeling was as bad as the one he got when the soldier dropped his pen and documents the moment he saw Cale at the Henituse Lord’s Castle.</p>
<p>“Goodbye. Rest well and see you in the morning. Ah, Mayor Obante and the Dark Elves are currently looking into finding information on other Dragons so they should contact us soon.”</p>
<p>The other Dragons might become extremely strong allies in their battle against the White Star.</p>
<p>The Dark Elves and Elves had some information about Dragons. They were putting the information they had together along with Eruhaben's information to search out the other Dragons.</p>
<p>“Yes sir. Please let me know whenever you hear something.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Be safe.”</p>
<p>Alberu walked up to the window to say goodbye to them.</p>
<p>That was why Cale had even more of an ominous feeling but chose to head over to the Duke's Estate for now.</p>
<p>Once he arrived at the Duke's Estate…</p>
<p>The building looked the same as the Count’s Estate he had stayed at on his last trip to the capital.</p>
<p>It did not become fancier because it was now a Duke’s Estate.We are at our house at the capital!</p>
<p>The transparent Raon shouted with joy.It’s exactly the same!</p>
<p>The house that had not changed at all gave off a sense of familiarity and peace.</p>
<p>“…My goodness.”</p>
<p>However, Cale stopped walking and started to blink.Human! Duke Deruth heard you were coming and came out to welcome you!</p>
<p>It was currently the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Although the residence looked the same, there were magic lamps all around that were keeping it quite bright.</p>
<p>It looked as if it was the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Cale could see a smiling Duke Deruth walking toward him. His seemed full of emotions as his footsteps continued to get faster.</p>
<p>He was almost running as he reached Cale now.</p>
<p>But Cale was just standing there as stiff as a statue.</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s confused voice at that moment.Human, is Duke Deruth going to war or something? Is he going to take over a neighboring kingdom?</p>
<p>“…I know, right?”</p>
<p>Behind the running Duke Deruth…</p>
<p>He could see a group of people gathered at the brightly lit building entrance.</p>
<p>They were not soldiers.</p>
<p>That was the problem.</p>
<p>They all seemed to be strong swordsmen and mages.</p>
<p>They were not extremely strong like Rosalyn and Choi Han but they all seemed above average.</p>
<p>‘Where the hell did he get all these strong people?’</p>
<p>Those people were stationed all around the building.</p>
<p>Cale looked around.</p>
<p>This was the area with homes for nobles.</p>
<p>The other residences had lights on as well, although none of them were as brightly lit as the Henituse Estate.</p>
<p>Click. Click.</p>
<p>People opened their windows and looked out toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale had a strong feeling that he would not be able to quietly enter his house.</p>
<p>“…Cale!”</p>
<p>“Father.”</p>
<p>Duke Deruth stood in front of Cale.</p>
<p>He could only look at the still alive Cale with tears in his eyes, so full of emotion that he couldn't even hug him.</p>
<p>“…I’m so relieved, really-”</p>
<p>Unlike Deruth who could not speak properly, Cale had something he wanted to know.</p>
<p>He pointed behind Deruth.</p>
<p>"Father, who are they?”</p>
<p>Cale noticed the look in Deruth's eyes change the moment he asked that question.</p>
<p>His gaze was full of anger and steadfast determination.</p>
<p>"Cale. Nobody will be able to touch the Henituse household or the citizens of our territory.”</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Cale asked again after feeling an unknown sense of nervousness.</p>
<p>“…So, who are they? They seem quite strong.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They are strong people. Most of them are free and do not have a kingdom they serve.”</p>
<p>“How did you gather such people?”</p>
<p>“Ah! You wanted to know how I gathered them here.”</p>
<p>Deruth’s firm gaze had disappeared and he was now smiling.</p>
<p>“How else? I hired them! They all came once I told them I would pay then 10 times the basic pay and that the contract was only for 6 months! Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>“…Ten times?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Cale, just trust your father! I will gather any and all strong individuals throughout the Western continent! Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>‘…How much money does he really have?’</p>
<p>Cale wanted to ask but could not get himself to do so.</p>
<p>There was a simple reason for that.Human, human!</p>
<p>Raon urgently reached out to Cale.There’s a Dragon over there!</p>
<p>‘What?’Human, inside your house! There's a Dragon among those people!</p>
<p>There was a Dragon among the people Duke Deruth had hired.The Dragon is pretending to be weak!</p>
<p>‘What?’He has a delinquent-like smile while looking at us!</p>
<p>A Dragon had come to find them on their own. Previous Chapter </p>

<p>Chapter 628 – Will never be seen in the world again 6</p>
<p>After seeing the message on Wuxiaworld regarding TCF being dropped, we have chosen to pick up the translation. We have worked hard to quickly bring you this chapter and hope to have a chapter posted every few days. Hope you enjoy! International fans deserve to know what happens with this novel!</p>
<p>‘There’s a Dragon among the people my father hired?</p>
<p>And it’s a Dragon pretending to be weak?</p>
<p>He has a delinquent-like smile while looking at us?’</p>
<p>“…I suddenly got the chills.”</p>
<p>Dragons were highly likely to be their allies.</p>
<p>But Cale felt chills on his back for some reason. It felt as if he would have to carry on some extra baggage.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Cale, did you say something?”</p>
<p>“N, no, it was nothing.”</p>
<p>“You must be tired. Let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>“Yes, father.”</p>
<p>Cale looked as if he was grumbling as he walked behind Duke Deruth who was walking with his shoulders opened wide and each step full of his steadfast conviction.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth started to frown after seeing the way his son was walking.</p>
<p>‘…There’s no strength in his step. It makes sense, he must be really tired.’</p>
<p>Deruth made up his mind to quickly erase that terrible bastard called the White Star from this world as Violan and he discussed.</p>
<p>He needed even more strong individuals to do that.</p>
<p>‘Hmm. Would it be difficult to hire the Whale tribe?’</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p>‘Are there any Dragons anywhere? I can give them as much money as they want.’</p>
<p>As Deruth was thinking hard about it…</p>
<p>“Father, are you certain about the identities of the people you’ve hired?”</p>
<p>He quickly stopped concentrating and happily responded to Cale’s question.</p>
<p>“Of course! I used every information network our Duchy has available to select only those with verified identities! Don’t worry! We at least know where they were born and how they grew up! We were so thorough that we would even find out if there were any Dragons!”</p>
<p>‘…It doesn’t seem that way. Father, there’s a Dragon here.’</p>
<p>Cale put on an awkward smile because he could not tell his father the truth while Deruth looked sad after looking at Cale’s smile.</p>
<p>‘How tired must he be to force a smile like that?’</p>
<p>Duke Deruth was so upset that he wanted to choke the White Star and shake him around. He suppressed his sorrow at his son’s condition and walked past the garden to the estate.</p>
<p>Cale observed the strong individuals in the garden as he walked past.</p>
<p>He wanted to know which of them was the Dragon. He could not ask Raon who the Dragon was because there were so many people there.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>‘…All of their gazes look a bit odd.’</p>
<p>The numerous strong individuals’ gazes were odd as they looked at Cale and Choi Han behind him. Cale then made eye contact with an old knight.</p>
<p>The knight who seemed to be in his eighties walked over to Cale and reached out his hand.</p>
<p>“Young master Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>The old man looked full of admiration as he kept his arm out.</p>
<p>“May I please shake your hand?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“This is Sir Babala from the Breck Kingdom. He’s been a central figure in the Breck Kingdom’s monster clearing plan since about fifty years ago.”</p>
<p>‘Why is such an amazing person here?’</p>
<p>Cale wanted to ask that question.</p>
<p>“This esteemed knight is here not for the money but to help you.”</p>
<p>Deruth had a satisfied smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Many of the others are here for the same reason.”</p>
<p>A lot of people did come because of the money as well.</p>
<p>But there were many others who were also here because wanted to work for Cale or help him out.</p>
<p>Sir Babala nodded his head.</p>
<p>“The Duke-nim is correct. I wanted to do what I could do to help the hero on his difficult path.”</p>
<p>Cale’s expression stiffened up.</p>
<p>He got the chills.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. I am not a hero.”</p>
<p>Cale sternly shook his head and looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“I am not much. If anybody is a hero, it would be my friends. My friends are the ones who truly deserve the honor.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Sir Babala gasped.</p>
<p>‘How could someone be so modest?!’</p>
<p>Cale’s face when he said that he was not a hero was serious.</p>
<p>‘He also didn’t forget about his friends and is trying to make sure they share a part of the spotlight!’</p>
<p>This old knight had not seen many people who truly wanted to push their friends and subordinates into the spotlight throughout his eighty plus years of life.</p>
<p>The ones who had truly meant it like this had all ended up great individuals who would go down in history.</p>
<p>“I just wish to live a quiet life. I am thankful that you still came to assist such a simpleton.”</p>
<p>Cale gave a short remark before letting go of Sir Babala’s hand.</p>
<p>He then slightly bowed toward the other hired individuals.</p>
<p>Cale started to think.</p>
<p>‘Choi Han should get more of the attention now, right? I told them that I want to live a quiet life.’</p>
<p>Cale was quite satisfied with himself for what he considered to be an appropriate response.</p>
<p>“…Young master-nim, you truly-”</p>
<p>Sir Babala could not finish his sentence. He stopped himself and looked at Cale with a calm expression before saying something else.</p>
<p>“Please get some rest young master-nim, I’m sure that you are tired.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Sir Babala.”</p>
<p>‘I guess it worked.’</p>
<p>Cale thought that Sir Babala letting him go immediately like this meant that he had chosen the correct course of action.</p>
<p>He did not manage to see Sir Babala’s fists that were clenched tightly with resolve.</p>
<p>‘This is going to be the biggest battle of my entire life. I will put my everything on the line.’</p>
<p>The words of the young hero had sparked a giant flame in the heart of the old knight.</p>
<p>He was not the only one.</p>
<p>‘Yes. If I’m going to fight, it is most meaningful to do it in this historic battlefield.’</p>
<p>‘How could anyone be so good?! Haaaa. Heroes truly are different.’</p>
<p>‘He looks so pale that I can’t even be jealous of him because I’m too busy pitying him. Just how hard is he pushing himself?’</p>
<p>“He truly is a hero worthy of my respect!’</p>
<p>Cale didn’t know but the sparks inside all these individuals was heating up the air around the garden.</p>
<p>Cale flinched after hearing Raon say something.</p>
<p>_ Human, the Dragon is smiling even more like a delinquent and snorting the more you talk.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?</p>
<p>He’s smiling the more I talk?’</p>
<p>– He’s standing at your nine o’clock direction! He has pink hair! Can you see him?</p>
<p>‘Pink hair?’</p>
<p>Cale turned to his nine o’clock direction.</p>
<p>It was the middle of the night but the Henituse Estate was well lit.</p>
<p>Cale was easily able to spot the pink hair.</p>
<p>Raon was right.</p>
<p>He could see a person with pink curly hair truly smiling like a delinquent.</p>
<p>‘…Cotton candy? Poodle?’</p>
<p>The curly hair that wasn’t even moving with the wind was an afro.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon was slightly taller than Rosalyn and had a bow as tall as him on his back.</p>
<p>The area underneath his eyes was covered with a bandana and his forehead was covered by his curly hair that only his eyes were visible. His eyes that were closer to light purple unlike his light pink hair were looking at Cale.</p>
<p>– It’s a pink Dragon! I wonder what his attribute is!</p>
<p>Cale heard a different voice than Raon’s voice.</p>
<p>– You’re finally looking at me?</p>
<p>It was an extremely neutral voice.</p>
<p>It was a low voice that also seemed high.</p>
<p>Cale started to feel nervous as he felt the majestic and overbearing nature of that voice.</p>
<p>‘How did that Dragon know to come find me?’</p>
<p>Mayor Obante, the Dark Elves, and Elves were all looking for Dragons. Did rumors get out because of that?</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>They were moving stealthily that no such rumors should have leaked.</p>
<p>If that was the case, how did this Dragon know about him and why did an egotistical Dragon personally make his way here?</p>
<p>Dragons truly were difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously felt his shoulders stiffen up.</p>
<p>He heard the curly-haired Dragon’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>– Nice to meet you. I am the noble, beautiful, great and mighty and most importantly, extremely cool Dodori.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale suddenly felt as if this Dragon was like a neighborhood kid.</p>
<p>What was going on?</p>
<p>Cale suddenly thought of Raon for some reason.</p>
<p>– I will come to your room soon. Leave the door open.</p>
<p>Cale slightly nodded his head.</p>
<p>He just felt as if this Dragon was not scary for some reason.</p>
<p>– Hmm. You have a Dragon by your side contrary to what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>‘Contrary to what I’ve learned?’</p>
<p>Cale focused on those words.</p>
<p>‘Did he hear about me from somewhere?’</p>
<p>Cale became anxious once again.</p>
<p>The curly-haired Dragon continued in a meaningful voice.</p>
<p>– As expected of Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale felt odd after hearing that but he turned away from the Dragon and walked into the house for now.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Cale, Choi Han, and Raon.</p>
<p>Only the three of them were left in the bedroom.</p>
<p>“I will open the door now.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Choi Han opened the terrace window.</p>
<p>“Human, the breeze is chilly! Are your knees cold?”</p>
<p>The no longer invisible Raon brought a blanket and wrapped it all around Cale. He then flinched.</p>
<p>“He’s here!”</p>
<p>“I guess being a Dragon he knew right away.”</p>
<p>Tap, tap.</p>
<p>They could see the curly-haired Dragon landing on the terrace.</p>
<p>The curly-haired Dragon who looked the same as earlier calmly walked past the terrace and into the bedroom.</p>
<p>He then stood in front of Cale.</p>
<p>‘I probably should get up.’</p>
<p>Cale was about to get up from the couch to greet him.</p>
<p>However, Dodori, the pink Dragon, was not looking at Cale right now.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The pink Dragon crossed his arms while looking at Raon.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>Raon answered brightly as if he was happy to meet a new Dragon.</p>
<p>“It’s Raon Miru! The human gave me the name! It has the magnificent meaning of telling me to be a joyful Dragon!”</p>
<p>“…Is that so? How old are you?”</p>
<p>I am the great and mighty age of six years this year!”</p>
<p>Dodori’s stiff expression loosened and he started to smile.</p>
<p>“Hmph. So young.”</p>
<p>He then snorted and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Raon was tilting his head in confusion while the pink Dragon looked down at Raon with a serious gaze that seemed to be saying that he would teach Raon as the ‘adult’ here.</p>
<p>“You’re too young to know the world.”</p>
<p>The low voice that also seemed high still carried a lot of weight, making the others have to think about those words.</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed Dodori.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth had everybody he had gathered was an adult.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon Dodori had his unique hairstyle and seemed to be Cale’s age based on his appearance.</p>
<p>Dodori must not have felt Cale’s observing gaze as he slightly raised his head and looked down at Raon.</p>
<p>He had a somewhat haughty gaze as Raon asked with a bright expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Pink Dragon! I am great and mighty so I know a lot about the world! But how many years do you think I need to be to know the world like you do?”</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>Dodori snorted once more before opening his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>His gaze seemed to be saying he would make a special exception and teach Raon something.</p>
<p>Cale was waiting for his response.</p>
<p>This response would allow him to make a guess about Dodori’s age.</p>
<p>The age Dodori thought was necessary to know the world…</p>
<p>“I realized it after 14 years of my Dragon life. You need to be at least 14 years old to know a good amount of the world.”</p>
<p>‘…14 years old?’</p>
<p>Cale suddenly thought about Basen, Lily, Lock and the Wolf children.</p>
<p>Dodori didn’t seem to notice as he sternly continued to speak to Raon.</p>
<p>“Treat me as your sunbae. You are my hoobae Dragon.”</p>
<p>Raon dropped his jaw and blankly stared at him but Dodori ignored him and turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>His eyes were sparkling Cale couldn’t help but think of this pink Dragon as a kid next door.</p>
<p>“Ahem. Ahem. Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>Dodori peeked toward Choi Han and Raon before continuing with his fake coughs.</p>
<p>Cale found this to be odd.</p>
<p>‘…He’s embarrassed?’</p>
<p>Dodori was embarrassed right now.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon continued to let out his fake coughs at Cale’s confused expression.</p>
<p>“Ahem. Your biography was ahem. Truly. Ahem.”</p>
<p>The curly-haired Dragon’s cheeks turned a bit flush.</p>
<p>“Ahem. It was truly inspirational! Ahem.”</p>
<p>‘…Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale didn’t really understand what he had just heard.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon seemed to have gained courage after speaking once and his voice became a bit louder.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Dodori moved right in front of Cale and pounded his chest.</p>
<p>“That was why I personally came to see you, Cale Henituse! I didn’t know that there was already a Dragon by your side, but ahem. Anyway, anyway!”</p>
<p>‘…It’s actually three Dragons and not one Dragon. No. It’s four if you count the half-Dragon.’</p>
<p>Cale wanted to fix Dodori’s mistake.</p>
<p>However, Dodori didn’t give Cale any time to speak.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon suddenly opened up his arms.</p>
<p>He then clenched Cale’s shoulders that were wrapped up in the blanket.</p>
<p>A majestic voice full of resolve came flowing out of Dodori’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Just trust me! I will turn you into the greatest hero in human history!”</p>
<p>‘…What the hell, who is this crazy Dragon?’</p>
<p>Cale truly wanted to cover this nonsense spitting curly-haired Dragon’s mouth for a moment.</p>
<p>– …Human.</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s shocked voice in his mind.</p>
<p>Raon couldn’t help but be shocked.</p>
<p>His human was already the greatest hero in Raon’s mind.</p>
<p>There was no need to turn him into it.</p>
<p>– That pink curly-haired Dragon is weird. Do we really need to work with him?</p>
<p>‘I know, right?’</p>
<p>Cale barely managed to say that out loud and said something else.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, how did you hear about me to come all the way here?”</p>
<p>Dodori let go of Cale’s shoulders and asked back in a slightly confused expression.</p>
<p>“Hmm? You don’t know?”</p>
<p>His gaze seemed to be asking how Cale didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>Cale started to go back through his memories to see if he had met Dodori somewhere or heard about Dodori from anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no records of a pink Dragon in his memories.</p>
<p>‘The Dragon Mayor Obante saw was a different color.’</p>
<p>Cale gave a short response back.</p>
<p>“Yes sir. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Mm. I guess that’s understandable.”</p>
<p>Dodori nodded his head as if he understood before taking a book out of his pocket.</p>
<p>He was extremely careful as if he cherished this book a lot.</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze automatically headed to the book and Dodori started to speak in a voice full of admiration.</p>
<p>“This is a book about your story. It was the most touching book of all books I have read in my life.”</p>
<p>He must have read it quite a bit as the book was getting worn.</p>
<p>Cale questioned his eyes after looking at the cover.</p>
<p>The book’s title was [ Young Master Silver Shield Cale Henituse, A Kind of Hero Who Will Never Be Seen in the World Again ].</p>
<p>Dodori started to speak quickly.</p>
<p>“There are hundreds of books in numerous versions throughout the Western continent that describe your story as well. The only disappointing thing is that there is no book published by the Roan Kingdom or the Henituse Duchy. The books are mainly records of bards and storytellers who have heard your story.”</p>
<p>Dodori was empathetic but disappointed at this situation.</p>
<p>The pink Dragon shared his disappointment out loud.</p>
<p>“I’m sure all of these books are being printed for the numerous citizens of the continent who are curious about your story despite your lack of consent. However, based on my analysis, each book has a lot of inaccurate stories! They are not accurate at all! Your exploits are not properly described!”</p>
<p>Cale suddenly had a thought.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean he read all of those hundreds of books? He even analyzed them? Why? Why would this Dragon analyze my story?’</p>
<p>Dodori was shaking his head as if he didn’t like it.</p>
<p>“I hope that a proper biography approved by you will come out soon! Has anybody approached you about compiling your stories for a biography? I can find you some famous history scholars! They will create a 10 volume minimum series with a high-quality hard cover, substantial content and realistic illustrations! The first edition can be a limited edition with a video recording device that has an interview with you! There’s also the distribution route throughout the entire Eastern and Western continents! I can prepare all of that for you!”</p>
<p>Dodori’s eyes were sparkling as he looked at Cale.</p>
<p>– …Human. His gaze is really weird.</p>
<p>“Aigoo, my head.”</p>
<p>Cale had no choice but to clench his head with both hands. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 629 – Not a chaotic field 1</p>
<p>Dodori tilted his head to one side. His curly hair wiggled as his head moved.</p>
<p>“Why are you clutching your head? Is my offer too thrilling?”</p>
<p>– …Human. Unlike him, I think I know why you are clutching your head.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Raon who was talking to him in his mind.</p>
<p>Raon was looking back and forth between Cale and Dodori with a pitying gaze.</p>
<p>Cale felt it at that moment.</p>
<p>‘He’s grown.’</p>
<p>He felt that Raon, who had already figured out why he was clutching his head, had grown a lot and started to caress Raon’s back.</p>
<p>– Human! It’s because you don’t have any faith in the history scholars that pink Dragon will bring, isn’t it? How can you leave the distribution of your biography to a Dragon you just met?! Don’t worry, I have recorded almost all of your exploits on my video recording device! Mary, the crazy Clopeh, and I will write your biography for you! Do not worry!</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>– I feel sorry for the pink Dragon. He’s so excited about something you’re not going to ask him to do. Let’s just include him briefly at the end!</p>
<p>‘Hmm? What the hell are both of these Dragons saying right now?’</p>
<p>Cale looked at Raon with disbelief before turning toward his last pillar of hope. Yes, he looked toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Please drink some tea as you chat.”</p>
<p>Choi Han had an innocent expression on his face as he put three cups of tea on the table (one for himself), along with juice for Raon.</p>
<p>He had a friendly smile toward Dodori.</p>
<p>Cale felt betrayed for some reason.</p>
<p>Dodori clasped his hands together while looking at Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Ah! Are you Choi Han of the Black Blade, Cale Henituse’s guardian knight and his first-ever party member?”</p>
<p>‘What the hell is up with those dazzling and useless titles?’</p>
<p>Cale started to frown but Choi Han had an embarrassed smile as he waved his hand.</p>
<p>“I have not done much at all.”</p>
<p>“No! You can’t say that! The party member of a hero who will never be seen in this world ever again is also a hero! Rosalyn of the Red flame, the ruler of mana! Future King Alberu, the Spear Knight of the Radiant Sun! Mary, the Commander of the Dead! I know about all of the others as well!”</p>
<p>‘Wow. All of their titles are no joke.’</p>
<p>Cale just blankly nodded his head.</p>
<p>Dodori’s sparkling eyes headed toward Cale at that moment.</p>
<p>“I watched numerous heroes being born this time!”</p>
<p>Cale made a comment with an expression that was changing from blank to delinquent.</p>
<p>“…Through the books?”</p>
<p>“That’s right! I saw it through the books! Do you think I saw it all in person? That’s a funny joke! Hahaha!”</p>
<p>Dodori pounded his chest again.</p>
<p>“That is why I personally came here to give the perfect happy ending to your hero’s journey!”</p>
<p>‘Reality and stories are different, Mister Dragon.’</p>
<p>Ironically, this was the comment made by someone who actually ended up in a story and was living that life as his new reality. Cale Henituse had a lot of things he wanted to say, but asked the question he needed to ask first.</p>
<p>“…Could you please explain in detail how you ended up here?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Dodori plopped down on the couch opposite Cale and leisurely picked up his teacup.</p>
<p>He then brought it directly to his mouth.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth after seeing this action. Dodori jumped up at the same time.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>…His bandana was drenched in tea.</p>
<p>‘Is he really a Dragon?’</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t help but wonder after seeing Dodori’s extremely clumsy nature. Dodori just took off the bandana and acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>‘Mm.’</p>
<p>Cale was wowed by the Dragon’s beauty.</p>
<p>Features that suddenly made the curly hair look like an artistic masterpiece appeared once the bandana was off. He wasn’t as beautiful as Eruhaben, but it was still quite mesmerizing.</p>
<p>He looked as androgynous as his voice.</p>
<p>He started to shout.</p>
<p>“Ow, hot hot hot hot! Why is the tea so hot?!”</p>
<p>“…Tea is usually hot.”</p>
<p>Cale’s voice was becoming more delinquent, but Dodori did not notice at all. This Dragon didn’t seem interested in that at all.</p>
<p>“Ahem, anyway, I will share my story for a moment.”</p>
<p>Dodori looked up at the air with a fleeting gaze.</p>
<p>“I, Dodori, have wandered far and wide because I could not trust anything in the world at one point. I guess you could say that I was searching for the meaning of life.”</p>
<p>‘…What the hell?’</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak because he could sense that the story was going to take a weird turn. However, Dodori was faster. The pink Dragon looked toward Raon.</p>
<p>“I was quite rebellious when I was about six years old. You’re going through puberty right now, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Pink Dragon! You truly are peculiar!”</p>
<p>The pink Dragon just ignored Raon’s retort.</p>
<p>“But on the day that this Dragon turned seven years old… I read a book as if I was fated to read it.”</p>
<p>Dodori’s heart was beating quickly thinking about that time.</p>
<p>“It was the story of the hero, the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain.”</p>
<p>– Hmm?</p>
<p>The Super Rock suddenly reacted.</p>
<p>Cale flinched as well. The Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain. That title felt extremely familiar.</p>
<p>– …Is he talking about me?</p>
<p>The Super Rock mumbled as a passionate voice reached Cale’s ears.</p>
<p>“I, the noble Dodori, could not stop myself from admiring the hero’s honorable mindset! I am extremely selfish in nature and only care for myself! However, I couldn’t help but approve of his noble mindset to sacrifice himself!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Dodori slammed the teacup down on the table, breaking it into pieces and only leaving the handle dangling in his hand.</p>
<p>“I chose to trust in the world at that point! It was because the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain was someone who truly did exist during ancient times! It is not a lie, but a true tale of sacrifice! A hero truly existed! My heart is beating wildly right now just thinking about it! Huuuuu.”</p>
<p>Dodori took a deep breath to calm himself down. He then continued to speak in an upset voice.</p>
<p>“However, I have not been able to find another hero who makes my heart beat wildly since then. That is why, I, personally! I decided to find my hero on my own!”</p>
<p>Dodori quickly turned passionate again as if he had never sounded upset at all.</p>
<p>“Hero novels always have positions for party members! Isn’t it too obvious for a Dragon to be a mage? That is why I picked up the bow! The archer! Doesn’t that sound cool?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“…It’s cool… I guess you’re good at using the bow.”</p>
<p>“Of course! My mom taught me how to use it!”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes clouded over at that moment.</p>
<p>“You have a mother, Dodori-nim?”</p>
<p>Dodori did not notice the look in Cale’s eyes that seemed as if he had found his prey and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Of course! My mom congratulated me for overcoming my wandering nature and finding my own path! This is what my mother told me. ‘Dodori, you won’t listen to anything I say, so just live however you want.’ Hahahaha! My mom accepted me for who I am!”</p>
<p>‘…It doesn’t seem like she accepted you…’</p>
<p>Cale had a lot of things he wanted to say, but he was satisfied with gaining a new piece of information.</p>
<p>‘There is at least one more Dragon.’</p>
<p>If he added these two Dragons to the Dragon that Mayor Obante and the Dark Elves were looking for, then there were a good number of Dragons by their side.</p>
<p>“And then, one day…”</p>
<p>Dodori looked at Cale with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>“I heard the story of a young master Silver Shield.”</p>
<p>He then snorted.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t interested. Why?”</p>
<p>Dodori looked toward Cale with a haughty expression.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t as cool as my first hero, the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain.”</p>
<p>– Mm.</p>
<p>The Super Rock groaned as if he was getting a headache.</p>
<p>However, the corners of Cale’s lips were slowly going up.</p>
<p>– Human, are you planning a scam?</p>
<p>Cale naturally ignored Raon’s comment.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse!”</p>
<p>Dodori suddenly moved his head very close to Cale.</p>
<p>“Then one day, I learned that you used the power of boulder at the Gorge of Death. Boulder! You were the first person who has used the power of boulder since the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain!”</p>
<p>Dodori looked as if he didn’t know how to act because he was so ecstatic.</p>
<p>“That is why I deemed you as a second generation hero and came to meet you! Do you know why?”</p>
<p>The Dragon’s purple eyes that had seemed extremely light sank very deep.</p>
<p>They became so deep that it reminded Cale of the deep ocean. The eyes looked toward Cale full of numerous emotions.</p>
<p>“Our noble hero, the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain, did not have a good ending. He lost all of his friends before dying a terrible death.”</p>
<p>The Super Rock was silent.</p>
<p>“His sacrificial mindset was amazing, but there is no need to really sacrifice yourself like that. That is how I feel, although that might be because I am a self-centered Dragon.”</p>
<p>A majestic, heavy, and mysterious voice filled the bedroom.</p>
<p>Dodori continued to speak to Cale.</p>
<p>“Your history is currently in progress. Nobody knows how it will end.”</p>
<p>A gentle smile appeared on Dodori’s face.</p>
<p>“I like happy endings.”</p>
<p>Dodori, who had started with the records of the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain and had looked into the histories of many other heroes as well, realized that not many of them had happy endings.</p>
<p>The world might have ended up with a happy ending, but the hero themselves rarely ended with happy endings.</p>
<p>That was why the pink Dragon had come to Cale.</p>
<p>“I will turn you into a happy ending.” (TL: …The pun is too strong with this one)</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed the pink Dragon.</p>
<p>– My goodness, I’m very thankful to this Dragon. The future I hoped for was one where nobody has to sacrifice themselves and people don’t miss the ones who had to sacrifice themselves. It is impossible to achieve, but I’m glad to find someone with the same goal that I had. This is a trustworthy Dragon.</p>
<p>The Super Rock praised the pink Dragon with a voice full of admiration.</p>
<p>Cale felt as if he could trust this Dragon for a moment as well.</p>
<p>“Definitely.”</p>
<p>Dodori continued to speak as if he was confirming it to himself.</p>
<p>“No matter what! Happy ending all the way! That way!”</p>
<p>Jump!</p>
<p>Dodori suddenly jumped up.</p>
<p>“That way, small Dragons like my hoobae over there! Dragons that are still growing!”</p>
<p>He pointed to Raon.</p>
<p>“These small Dragons can read the stories and become a magnificent Dragon like me without wandering!”</p>
<p>“I am already magnificent, great, and mighty, pink Dragon!”</p>
<p>“My hoobae Dragon! Just trust me!”</p>
<p>“I won’t trust you, pink Dragon!”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha! Are you already in your wandering phase?!”</p>
<p>“…Human, he’s weird!”</p>
<p>That short moment of admiration that Cale had felt for the pink Dragon disappeared after hearing his conversation with Raon.</p>
<p>Choi Han cautiously started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, why did you like the Guardian Knight-nim of Boulder Mountain of all heroes?”</p>
<p>Cale had been curious about this as well.</p>
<p>Why was it the Super Rock of all people?</p>
<p>He turned toward Dodori as well.</p>
<p>“He was the obvious choice!”</p>
<p>Dodori confidently responded as if such a question was not necessary at all.</p>
<p>“My specialty is boulders!”</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale’s shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>Dodori looked down at his hands with an emotional gaze.</p>
<p>“I ended up wandering because I thought that my attribute was useless. Boulder! My mom did tell me about an extremely strong and arrogant thug of a Dragon who took down Dragon after Dragon with his dust attribute, but still! I, I… the only thing I can do is creating boulders……”</p>
<p>– Human! Isn’t that dust attribute Dragon he’s talking about Goldie gramps? But Goldie gramps is no thug! He is a very good Dragon!</p>
<p>Dodori lowered his head.</p>
<p>His curly hair started to shake.</p>
<p>“…I thought I was amazing because I realized my attribute pretty quickly for Dragons, but I lost my way because my attribute was useless… Yes, I was drifting without a cause… However!”</p>
<p>Dodori suddenly raised his head and his eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p>“I am no longer useless!”</p>
<p>Dodori grabbed both of Cale’s hands.</p>
<p>“Join me and let’s destroy everything with boulders!”</p>
<p>“…I thought you were going to be an archer, Dodori-nim?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to do that too!”</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>Cale slowly pulled his hands away.</p>
<p>He then crossed his arms and his legs.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Cale’s nonchalant gaze headed toward Dodori.</p>
<p>Dodori subconsciously became a bit tense after noticing that Cale did not seem scared of him at all despite the fact that he was a Dragon.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, do you know about Puzzle City?”</p>
<p>Dodori immediately responded back confidently without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Not at all!”</p>
<p>“I see. It is understandable that you don’t know about it.”</p>
<p>Cale’s voice slowly became quiet.</p>
<p>“Puzzle City is a city where they stack quite a lot of rock towers. There are a lot of rocks there. Even though the Roan Kingdom is known for having a lot of rocks… That city has quite a lot of rocks even compared to the rest of the Roan Kingdom, the home kingdom of the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain.”</p>
<p>“Hooooo. Is that so?”</p>
<p>Dodori seemed quite interested after hearing about rocks.</p>
<p>Cale threw bait once he had Dodori’s full attention.</p>
<p>“The White Star is planning on charging into Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you talking about that terrible villain bastard who deserves to die?!”</p>
<p>Cale calmed the pink Dragon down before he became too excited again.</p>
<p>“Please calm down.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I became too angry for a moment.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I understand, but Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“You see…”</p>
<p>Cale prolonged saying what he wanted to say and looked at Dodori dead in the eyes before quietly whispering to him.</p>
<p>“The White Star has ancient powers of numerous attributes, all except the earth attribute! He does not have that at all.”</p>
<p>Dodori’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>He looked right at the casual look on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“I took his too and have two earth-attribute ancient powers.”</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“But he wants to fight in a place with a lot of rocks?”</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Dodori imagined the battlefield using the information Cale just gave him as the foundation. He couldn’t help but gulp multiple times.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale’s mouth looked quite villainous for a supposed hero, but Dodori waited to hear what he had to say next.</p>
<p>“Did you know?”</p>
<p>He threw another bait.</p>
<p>“I am the successor to the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain. That esteemed hero’s power, the power that the esteemed hero left to protect this world… I have carried on its legacy.”</p>
<p>“Ohhhhhh, my goodness. My hypothesis was correct! Unbelievable! Mommy, I think I’m going to become a hero!”</p>
<p>Dodori was blurting things out subconsciously because he could not calm his wildly beating heart.</p>
<p>Cale calmly continued to speak to the excited pink Dragon.</p>
<p>“In Puzzle City, a city full of rocks. Fighting against the White Star who has no earth-attribute ancient powers at all. Oh my! On the other hand, I have the power of the Guardian Knight of Boulder Mountain.”</p>
<p>Gulp gulp.</p>
<p>Dodori’s eyes were burning up with anticipation.</p>
<p>“And if Dodori-nim is there with me? A magnificent Dragon with the power to create boulders just happened to appear in front of me?”</p>
<p>Cale reached his hand out.</p>
<p>“Will you fight by my side?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Absolutely, totally, yes, yes, yes!”</p>
<p>Dodori tightly grabbed Cale’s hand with both hands. Cale smiled warmly toward the Dragon.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Then please go bring your mother.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Dodori flinched. Cale continued to speak as if he was not phrased.</p>
<p>“Our Henituse Duchy has a rule where we only hire adults. However, just for you, Dodori-nim, we will make an exception and accept you if we meet with your guardian and she agrees to accompany you. This is a special exception. Just. For. You.”</p>
<p>Having a 1+1 Dragon was great.</p>
<p>It would be really nice to drag in an extra Dragon if he could do so. Cale tightly grabbed Dodori’s hands that were going weak.</p>
<p>– Wow. Human, I haven’t seen you smiling like a scammer for a long time. You’re acting so elegantly that the crown prince would be shocked enough to give you a cookie!</p>
<p>Dodori flinched at the weak hands holding onto him and started to speak.</p>
<p>“…You need my mom to come?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She must be here.”</p>
<p>Dodori turned toward Raon for a moment.</p>
<p>Cale immediately started to speak.</p>
<p>“Ah, I am Raon’s guardian. Raon’s mother has also approved of it. We have some other children as well, there are some Cats and Wolves, but I am all of their guardian. I am pretty much their parent. That is why they are allowed to accompany me.”</p>
<p>– Hehe. We’re all one big family!</p>
<p>Raon seemed happy about something and fluttered his wings.</p>
<p>But Cale was more focused on the two jackpots that might come his way.</p>
<p>“…Do you really need me to come with my mom?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If it is difficult for your guardian to accompany you, we must at least have a meeting with your guardian.”</p>
<p>The curly-haired Dragon was rolling his eyes as he thought about something before nodding his head.</p>
<p>“Okay! I’ll be back with my mom tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“Of course. That is a wise decision, Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes indeed. How many allied Dragons is that now?’</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 630 – Not a chaotic field 2</p>
<p>“Then I’m going to hurry over to my mom! I must hurry!”</p>
<p>Dodori seemed to be in a rush as he ran toward the terrace.</p>
<p>– …Human! Are you scamming the pink Dragon? Are you going to smack him from behind? Why else would you be smiling like that? Grandpa Ron told me to let him know if you do anything weird! This is a difficult decision!</p>
<p>Cale still had a gentle smile on his face as he warmly continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, there’s no need to be in such a rush.”</p>
<p>“No, no! My mom might not open the door to the farm for me! I stole a box of fruit from the orchard to pay for stuff when I ran away from home! Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>‘Hmm? A farm? An orchard?’</p>
<p>– Human! He said a farm! It’s a Dragon that runs an orchard! I can’t believe there’s a Dragon that grows food! What a truly magnificent Dragon!</p>
<p>Cale turned to the side after oddly feeling a heated gaze from next to him.</p>
<p>He could see Choi Han standing there.</p>
<p>Choi Han had his usual innocent looking face but his eyes were burning up. Cale thought about Choi Jung Soo and Lee Soo Hyuk’s little hope for him.</p>
<p>Choi Han was looking at Dodori with a somewhat sad gaze. Cale suddenly got the chills. He felt as if he should quickly send Dodori on his way.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, please have a safe trip!”</p>
<p>Dodori was now standing on the terrace railing. He smiled brightly and waved toward the two humans and one young Dragon who were there to say goodbye.</p>
<p>“Bye! I’ll make sure not to die from my mom’s beating and come back alive!”</p>
<p>Paaaaat!</p>
<p>Dodori left those scary words behind as he disappeared.</p>
<p>Raon flew back inside and made a short comment about the meeting they just had.</p>
<p>“Human! The pink Dragon seems about fifty percent similar to the crazy Clopeh! I really want to go visit the farm and orchard!”</p>
<p>“I truly wish to go visit it as well.”</p>
<p>Cale brushed aside Choi Han’s determined comment. He was quite happy right now.</p>
<p>The crown prince had been stealthily searching for Dragons for a while with the help of the Dark Elves and Elves. Eruhaben and Sheritt were helping him as well, but they had had no results until now.</p>
<p>‘It’s impossible to find all of the Dragons.’</p>
<p>Now that the White Star might attack Puzzle City or somewhere else in the near future, it was better to gather the forces they had right now.</p>
<p>That was why Cale was focusing on other issues over finding the Dragons.</p>
<p>‘But a Dragon walked in on his own! And there are two of them!’</p>
<p>He started to think about Dodori’s mom.</p>
<p>‘Eruhaben-nim is the most ancient Dragon. The fact that she could call Eruhaben-nim an arrogant Dragon must mean that she is younger than Eruhaben-nim but still about the same age.’</p>
<p>He had no idea as to how strong she would be.</p>
<p>The smile on Cale’s face only continued to grow bigger.</p>
<p>– Human! Your smile looks fishy!</p>
<p>That was why he ignored Raon’s comment and prepared to sleep.</p>
<p>“Then I will see you tomorrow, Cale-nim. Please don’t forget about the orchard.”</p>
<p>Choi Han left as well and Cale laid down on his bed. He could only curl up on the side because Raon had already taken the center of the bed.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Deruth had a lot of strong individuals gathered here by using his money. There were also two Dragons.</p>
<p>He didn’t do much to gather all of these extra pieces, but Cale was very happy about the increase in their forces.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>He continued to chuckle as he fell asleep.</p>
<p>He had not slept so well in a long time.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>10 am. It was still pretty warm for being in the middle of November.</p>
<p>“…What is that?”</p>
<p>Cale had woken up from his first good sleep in a long time and was now sitting on the couch looking outside.</p>
<p>He could see outside the high fence of the house because his bedroom was on the third floor.</p>
<p>“…Why are people gathered there throwing flower petals and shiny powder?”</p>
<p>They were in the capital, but this was the noble district so it was generally quiet.</p>
<p>Most of the houses here were generally empty because they all stayed within their own territories unless they worked in the capital.</p>
<p>This area was usually much quieter compared to the market or plaza where all residents traversed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be a quiet place……”</p>
<p>That’s how it had always been.</p>
<p>However, the area in front of the Henituse Estate and the nearby area felt as if it was the middle of a festival.</p>
<p>There were close to two or three hundred people out there.</p>
<p>“Human! Can I go see what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Alright! I’ll be back in 30 minutes! We need to go to the palace together to eat!”</p>
<p>Raon turned invisible and quickly flew out while Choi Han brought him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale flinched for a moment.</p>
<p>“Beacrox told me to make sure you got your tea. He said that this lemon tea was made with newly preserved lemons.”</p>
<p>“…Uh… Sure.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and here is an apple pie. Raon took some out for you.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Sure.”</p>
<p>The large pile of apple pies made Cale’s pupils start to shake.</p>
<p>However, Cale drank the lemon tea first, feeling a sense of longing and joy.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>– Human! All of them! All of them!</p>
<p>He suddenly heard Raon’s urgent voice.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Cale jumped up after hearing Raon’s pressing tone.</p>
<p>The lemon tea almost spilled from the cup.</p>
<p>– Human!</p>
<p>Raon continued to shout.</p>
<p>– Everybody is saying that you are great and mighty! They are saying that the hero who will never be seen in this world ever again has returned! That’s why they’ve all run out onto the streets with joy!</p>
<p>Last night…</p>
<p>Cale had noticed the numerous open windows when he had arrived.</p>
<p>Cale didn’t know it, but the hired help and nobles of each residence were looking through the window and had immediately informed the people they knew about Cale Henituse’s return.</p>
<p>Those people then informed other people and pretty much everybody in the capital knew of his arrival by 10 am this morning.</p>
<p>Cale was the only one who didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>– Human, they said that they are cheering for you because that is all they can do for you! That is why they are throwing the red flower petals around!</p>
<p>Cale then noticed that, while the area outside the Henituse Estate was full of people, everywhere else looked quite desolate.</p>
<p>– Gasp!</p>
<p>Raon gasped and Cale got such chills that he felt as if someone was rubbing his back with ice.</p>
<p>– They’re saying there is a group gathering here! Over half of them are members of a group called YHW!</p>
<p>‘…What? …A group gathering?’</p>
<p>Cale’s fingers were slightly shaking as he held the teacup.</p>
<p>He felt as if he heard an acronym he shouldn’t know.</p>
<p>YHW.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to find out what it stood for.</p>
<p>However, Raon was feeding Cale information nonstop.</p>
<p>– It is a gathering of people who are cheering for and wishing to help Young Master Silver Shield, a hero who will never be seen in this world ever again! (TL Note: Korean uses the first ‘word’ for world never seen again and shield so it is Young master silver shield a Hero who will never be seen in the World again so YHW. there was no English equivalent based on structure of the language) They also said they won’t tolerate people who are envious and speak badly of you! Oh, my goodness! Human! I want to join this group too! Oh, but I have an odd feeling that we shouldn’t let Clopeh find out about this group!</p>
<p>Cale started to think.</p>
<p>‘Does this make any sense?’</p>
<p>The common folks generally could not easily approach the nobles.</p>
<p>In addition, there was bound to be envy if someone achieves something big and becomes very successful.</p>
<p>That was why numerous heroes throughout history ended up losing their power and fame.</p>
<p>‘But there is a group cheering for me, a noble, and there are more than 100 members in that group?’</p>
<p>Forget being shocked, Cale was thinking that this was unrealistic.</p>
<p>But there was something he did not know.</p>
<p>The bestselling books in bookstores throughout the Roan Kingdom were all books related to Cale and his group.</p>
<p>These people were seeing war throughout the Western continent for the first time in a long time, just as they were getting used to the peace that has been here for tens of years.</p>
<p>This was extremely difficult for people to handle and they needed someone or something to help them remain calm.</p>
<p>People would naturally seek out heroes even if nobody forced it on them.</p>
<p>The people at the capital responded more sensitively to information about Cale Henituse the hero than Cale would expect.</p>
<p>Why were they not envious of him?</p>
<p>Over half of the members of this group were people who survived Arm’s Plaza Bombing terrorist incident in the past.</p>
<p>They were the people who had been saved when Cale first used his Indestructible Shield.</p>
<p>How could people who were saved by Cale during that incident or through his other exploits during the war with the Indomitable Alliance be jealous of him?</p>
<p>Cale Henituse did not personally gain anything for everything that he did.</p>
<p>The Henituse household did become a Duchy, but aside from that, Cale had not personally benefited from everything he had done for the Roan Kingdom and the Western continent.</p>
<p>They all knew that his Commander title was only a temporary title and that he had not even gotten a territory nor a title, something most people who had achieved far less than he had done would have received a long time ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he seemed to be living a quiet life other than when he was protecting everyone and fighting for their safety.</p>
<p>He was someone who seemed to not care about fame nor power at all.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse’s public image made it so that people couldn’t help but respect and follow him.</p>
<p>It was just like how numerous strong individuals had come to work for the Henituse Duchy, with others currently on their way to do so.</p>
<p>– Oh! There’s also a fan group for Choi Han, Rosalyn, and Mary! Ohhhhhhhh! Human! I want to join all of these groups!</p>
<p>“Aigoo, my head.”</p>
<p>Cale, who had no idea about any of this and just wanted to be a rich slacker in the future, could only sigh in disbelief.</p>
<p>He was at a loss for words as he stuffed apple pies and lemon tea into his mouth out of habit. He had no idea that Choi Han was looking at him with a satisfied expression on his face.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Alberu had a confused look on his face as he put his fork and knife down.</p>
<p>“…My little dongsaeng. Why are you barely eating anything?”</p>
<p>A light meal instead of a feast was on the circular table. However, this supposed light meal was full of extremely luxurious and beautiful looking dishes.</p>
<p>“…Your highness.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Alberu started to frown after seeing Cale barely eating anything and not speaking as if he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>“…I’m full.”</p>
<p>“Ho.”</p>
<p>Alberu was shaking his head side to side.</p>
<p>He could only click his tongue after seeing Cale say that he was full after eating only two bites of steak.</p>
<p>He turned his gaze and looked toward Choi Han and Raon.</p>
<p>He had sent his servant away and only the four of them were here.</p>
<p>“Hey, crown prince! The palace chef cooks as well as Beacrox! It’s delicious!”</p>
<p>Raon looked very cute with sauce all over his mouth while Choi Han was smiling and eating nonstop.</p>
<p>Alberu turned back toward Cale with a suspicious gaze.</p>
<p>“Our palace chef made his best dishes after hearing that my dongsaeng was coming. Why don’t you eat some more? It can’t taste that bad, can it?”</p>
<p>He then looked at Cale’s feeble body.</p>
<p>“…Your highness.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what I saw on my way to the palace?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of gazes I saw once I entered the palace?”</p>
<p>Alberu quietly gasped after seeing the look in Cale’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale had come to see Alberu through normal means this time. That was why numerous servants, maids, and administrators in the palace saw him enter. Alberu couldn’t help but think about what was probably going on right now.</p>
<p>“Your highness. Have you heard of a group called the YHW?”</p>
<p>“…No. What is that?”</p>
<p>Alberu feigned ignorance for now.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale let out a deep sigh before looking at Alberu with a sparkle in his eyes. His eyes seemed to be on fire.</p>
<p>“Your highness! You MUST let me be a slacker in the future!”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course. I’ll let you be a rich slacker. A slacker who doesn’t have to worry about anything.”</p>
<p>“You truly are the radiant and magnificent sun of the Roan Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying something so obvious? Just eat.”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head after hearing Alberu telling him to eat.</p>
<p>“No, I really am full. I ate some apple pie and drank some lemon tea earlier.”</p>
<p>He probably ate three full apple pies.</p>
<p>He might have drunk 1 liter of lemon tea along with it.</p>
<p>“…Haaaa.”</p>
<p>It was now Alberu’s turn to sigh and shake his head.</p>
<p>‘He’s saying he’s full after having a cup of tea and one slice of pie.’</p>
<p>Those were probably small snacks they gave him in the morning.</p>
<p>Alberu felt as if he knew the reason behind Cale’s feeble nature.</p>
<p>‘…Pitiful bastard.’</p>
<p>Cale suddenly got upset after seeing Alberu look at him with a pitying gaze, however, he started to snicker since this future king said that he would be allowed to be a slacker.</p>
<p>Alberu looked at him with an even more of a pitying gaze and Cale was about to get even more upset when…</p>
<p>Knock knock knock!</p>
<p>They heard some urgent knocks on the door.</p>
<p>“Your highness!”</p>
<p>They heard the Chief of Staff’s pressing voice.</p>
<p>“Commander Toonka of the Whipper Kingdom and Queen Litana of the Jungle have arrived!”</p>
<p>There was still a lot of time until the meeting.</p>
<p>However, these two key players had arrived much earlier than expected.</p>
<p>“Mm. Come on in.”</p>
<p>Alberu slowly got up from his chair.</p>
<p>Raon urgently turned invisible while Choi Han reached for his sword he had placed beside him.</p>
<p>‘Did something urgent happen?’</p>
<p>‘Maybe. This is weird.’</p>
<p>Alberu and Cale exchanged glances and stiffened up.</p>
<p>Litana and Toonka. Both of them were very busy people, and based on the Chief of Staff’s voice, they must have rushed here for a reason.</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff opened the door and came in as he shouted.</p>
<p>“They are both looking for young master Cale Henituse-nim!”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>‘Who? They’re looking for me?’</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously looked past the Chief of Staff’s shoulder into the hallway.</p>
<p>Toonka was charging over as if he was a wild boar that was looking for food in the middle of the winter.</p>
<p>“My friend! My one and only close friend! My buddy! Where are you?!”</p>
<p>He was crying as well.</p>
<p>He looked… quite scary.</p>
<p>“Mm. Commander Toonka. You might come off disrespectful. Although it is probably more proper to wait according to the Roan Kingdom’s etiquette, I will follow you to stop you if you insist on going.”</p>
<p>Litana was following behind him with an awkward smile on her face. Her large black panther was naturally by her side.</p>
<p>The two of them looked as if they were embarrassed but tagging along to stop Toonka.</p>
<p>“Grrrrrr.”</p>
<p>However, their eyes were sparkling as if they were looking for prey they must hunt in order to survive in the jungle.</p>
<p>“…Should I run away-”</p>
<p>Alberu and Choi Han avoided his gaze after hearing Cale mumble.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>– Human! In the sky above the palace!</p>
<p>Cale heard Raon’s shocked voice.</p>
<p>A majestic voice filled his head at that moment as well.</p>
<p>– Hmm. Are you Cale Henituse?</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar voice.</p>
<p>– I am Dodori’s mother.</p>
<p>As Cale slowly started to open his mouth…</p>
<p>– Human! There seems to be a Dragon in the sky outside the barrier protecting the palace!</p>
<p>There was a dome-shaped magic barrier above the Roan palace.</p>
<p>Just outside that barrier… There was a Dragon in the sky.</p>
<p>Cale did not expect Dodori to come back so soon.</p>
<p>Dodori and Dodori’s mom were both up there.</p>
<p>– But there are three of them!</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>– One more seems to have suddenly appeared!</p>
<p>He heard Dodori’s mom’s voice.</p>
<p>– …Oh, are there others you invited aside from my son and me?</p>
<p>‘No, there aren’t.’</p>
<p>Cale wanted to respond.</p>
<p>However, he could not do so.</p>
<p>He suddenly heard a sloth-like voice in his head.</p>
<p>– Wow~ there’s all sorts of weirdos gathered here. Hoooo, there are three Dragons as well. I’ve never seen this before. You were looking for me?</p>
<p>The slightly thuggish voice added on.</p>
<p>– Didn’t you send the Dark Elves to look for me? They’ve been so damn loud. Do you want to die?</p>
<p>The Dragon that Mayor Obante had seen in the past.</p>
<p>– How dare you make it so loud that I wake up from my slumber? How dare a mere human do that? Do you want me to fuck you up?</p>
<p>Toonka, Litana, and her black panther entered the room Cale was in at that moment.</p>
<p>“Oh, my dearest friend!”</p>
<p>“Young master Cale!”</p>
<p>“Grrrrrr!”</p>
<p>They then saw it.</p>
<p>“H, hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>They saw Cale laughing out loud.</p>
<p>‘Dragons just keep coming! This is not a chaotic field but a field of Dragons!’</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t help but laugh, not because of joy but because he couldn’t believe what was going on. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 631 – Not a chaotic field 3</p>
<p>– How dare you not run out barefoot after hearing my voice?</p>
<p>A thuggish voice echoed in Cale’s mind.</p>
<p>– Wait right there. You need to be punished for waking this great and mighty Dragon’s slumber. Human. I will personally walk over to you, so you better wait right there.</p>
<p>‘Wow, he wants me to wait. He’s going to come find me.’</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t help but laugh louder and louder.</p>
<p>– Mm. I don’t know what is going on, but I will just watch what happens for now.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at Dodori’s mom’s majestic voice.</p>
<p>He was still laughing.</p>
<p>“W, why is he laughing like that?”</p>
<p>Toonka hesitated and stepped back after looking at the loudly laughing Cale as if he was looking at some alien life form. It was completely different from the energy with which he had walked in.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse is laughing so brightly?! He’s laughing like that in such a terrible situation?!’</p>
<p>Toonka had heard that Cale had just overcome a god’s test.</p>
<p>Although he probably needed a break after that, Cale Henituse had no time to rest because there was still a danger to the peace on the continent.</p>
<p>Toonka remembered what the Chief had told him.</p>
<p>‘Commander, a person who laughs while he is struggling is a true hero.’</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Toonka subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>‘My close friend truly is a hero……!’</p>
<p>Toonka had no interest whatsoever in books, but his subordinates had done everything they could with the hopes that this complete idiot of a Commander would want to read.</p>
<p>Most of their plans had failed.</p>
<p>That changed when the Chief had nonchalantly handed Toonka a book.</p>
<p>[ The world will see two beautiful wings when you see a silver light in front of your eyes. ]</p>
<p>The book didn’t look like anything Toonka would be interested in. However, Toonka stayed up all night reading that book.</p>
<p>The book his Chief handed him was about Cale Henituse’s magnificent exploits in the Whipper Kingdom; it was written as a heroic tale of how he had saved the Whipper Kingdom.</p>
<p>Toonka started to walk toward Cale, who was laughing out loud in front of danger.</p>
<p>“I knew it! My close friend truly is amazing! Hahahaha!!”</p>
<p>He started to laugh out loud as well.</p>
<p>However, Queen Litana who was standing behind him could not see the laughing Cale the same way.</p>
<p>‘He’s become much paler since the first time I met him.’</p>
<p>Litana recalled when she first met young master Cale inside the cave in the foggy Oorim forest. He had not looked healthy at that point either, but he looked much healthier than he did now.</p>
<p>‘He’s laughing so happily because we are here even though he looks like that.’</p>
<p>Litana felt so upset about it that she almost teared up.</p>
<p>‘Why is it that young master Cale is trying to carry the heavy burden of achieving world peace?’</p>
<p>She was in charge of the Jungle.</p>
<p>That was hard enough for her, but this pale hero was trying to save the whole world.</p>
<p>Litana could not wipe the bitter smile off her face.</p>
<p>She felt as if she could only frown while looking at Cale if this bitter smile disappeared.</p>
<p>Alberu walked over to Toonka and Litana at that moment.</p>
<p>“You both got here very early.”</p>
<p>“Your highness! Your hiiiiiiighneeeeeeeeeess!”</p>
<p>Alberu suddenly heard his Chief of Staff’s urgent voice.</p>
<p>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing- Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing-</p>
<p>All of them in the room could hear the alarm going off around them.</p>
<p>‘…Intruders?’</p>
<p>This alarm was the alarm for when someone not allowed was trying to force their way in past the barrier.</p>
<p>“Your highness!”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?!”</p>
<p>Alberu urgently asked his Chief of Staff for details.</p>
<p>Litana and Toonka stiffened up as well. They were thinking about what it could be.</p>
<p>The different representatives of the Western continent were supposed to gather here soon.</p>
<p>The representatives of the Jungle and the Whipper Kingdom were already here.</p>
<p>Someone was trying to invade at such a time?</p>
<p>‘We must not let that happen!’</p>
<p>Alberu had kept today’s meeting a secret from most people on purpose. That was something they had to do.</p>
<p>Safety was the most important.</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff peeked toward Toonka and Litana before trying to whisper to Alberu.</p>
<p>“Just say it.”</p>
<p>He quickly started to speak after Alberu told him to do so.</p>
<p>“Your highness! A man is trying to barge in through the barrier in the northern sky right now!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>‘Is it the White Star?’</p>
<p>The different representatives all had the same thought.</p>
<p>Someone grabbed Alberu’s arm at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness.”</p>
<p>It was Cale.</p>
<p>Alberu looked at Cale’s face that was completely stiff as if he had not been laughing at all just a few moments ago and flinched.</p>
<p>‘…Hmm?’</p>
<p>This stiff face…</p>
<p>He did not seem anxious nor angry.</p>
<p>‘…He looks annoyed?’</p>
<p>It was the look a person would have when something was annoying them.</p>
<p>‘…The corners of his lips are twitching as well?’</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips were twitching even though he was tightly keeping his mouth shut to prevent himself from laughing.</p>
<p>He seemed to want to laugh because this annoying thing was still a good thing.</p>
<p>As for his smile…</p>
<p>This was the type of smile he had when Alberu gave him a golden plaque or when he made a ton of money.</p>
<p>‘This is weird.’</p>
<p>Cale whispered by his ear as Alberu thought that something was odd.</p>
<p>“There are three of THEM.”</p>
<p>‘Hmm? Three of them?’</p>
<p>Alberu wondered what Cale was suddenly saying.</p>
<p>“The individuals that we were looking for.”</p>
<p>‘Individuals we were looking for?’</p>
<p>Alberu thought about who that could be. He then thought about how Cale had emphasized ‘THEM’ and looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>Cale had shocked Alberu so many times since they first met.</p>
<p>But it was a bit different this time.</p>
<p>‘There are three of them? Three of the individuals we were looking for? Is he talking about the Dragons? He’s saying three Dragons showed up on their own?’</p>
<p>Alberu was asking numerous questions to Cale through his gaze.</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness. It is exactly what you are thinking about.”</p>
<p>Cale smiled brightly and nodded his head toward Alberu.</p>
<p>Twitch.</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips were twitching the same way Cale’s had just been doing. He was trying so hard to stop himself from laughing.</p>
<p>“Your highness. I will take care of it. You need to greet our guests.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head at Cale’s comment.</p>
<p>“Chief. My sworn brother will take care of it, so go with him.”</p>
<p>“Ah, of course, your highness!”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff felt relaxed even as the urgent alarm continued on now that Cale Henituse, the man who was becoming a greater hero every time he saw him, was stepping in.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, please let me show you the way!”</p>
<p>“Of course. Shall we go then, Mr. Chief of Staff?”</p>
<p>Cale walked out behind the Chief of Staff and briefly greeted the two representatives who had come to find him.</p>
<p>“I will be back soon. Unfortunately, I am not sure whether I can participate in the meeting.”</p>
<p>He greeted Litana first, and she smiled while shaking her head.</p>
<p>“The meeting is not important. Young master Cale, you must be safe. You really must be safe. You know that, right? Take care of yourself first.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I make sure to take very good care of my body. I always make it out okay, don’t I?”</p>
<p>Cale found it odd that Litana was telling him to be careful but honestly answered after seeing the emotional gaze in her eyes.</p>
<p>He then turned toward Toonka because he was in a rush.</p>
<p>That was why he could not see the frown on Litana’s face.</p>
<p>“Long time no see.”</p>
<p>“…My close friend. I will come with you!”</p>
<p>“Why would you do that? You came here for important business. Take care of that first.”</p>
<p>“What you are doing is important too!”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I need to do it. I’m fine on my own for this.”</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes indeed. It’s dragging three Dragons to be our allies at once. Who else but me could do this?’</p>
<p>Well, he wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>There were Raon and lots of other people who would help him.</p>
<p>Even the bulldozer-like Toonka was staring at him at a loss for words, but Cale did not notice this as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“See you later. I’m in a rush.”</p>
<p>“……I see. Okay! I hope that your silver light can spread throughout the whole world!”</p>
<p>‘What is he talking about?’</p>
<p>Cale completely ignored Toonka’s incomprehensible nonsense.</p>
<p>He then walked out of the room with the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Litana and Toonka were watching his back with pitying gazes on their faces.</p>
<p>Only Alberu was shaking his head while looking at Cale.</p>
<p>“Now then.”</p>
<p>He then used the situation to his advantage.</p>
<p>“As young master Cale mentioned, we should do our jobs too, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>Litana and Toonka turned toward Alberu after hearing that.</p>
<p>Although his official title was crown prince, he was someone who had even more influence on the Western continent than the king.</p>
<p>“I must ask a question before we get into the details.”</p>
<p>Alberu reached out his hand.</p>
<p>“Will you join us?”</p>
<p>Litana immediately grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Toonka also put his hand out and spoke with a valiant face fitting of a Commander.</p>
<p>“We will do everything in our power to help.”</p>
<p>The two representatives naturally chose to do everything they could do to help as they could feel danger approaching.</p>
<p>They were doing it for the Western continent as well as for their precious friend who had stepped up to help their respective territories in the past.</p>
<p>Alberu gestured with a bright smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Shall we head over to the meeting room?”</p>
<p>He then peeked toward Cale who was getting farther and farther away and started to think.</p>
<p>‘He’s probably happy that he gets to miss the meeting.’</p>
<p>He was absolutely right.</p>
<p>‘This is great.’</p>
<p>Cale’s steps were quite light.</p>
<p>‘I guess I don’t need to join the meeting.’</p>
<p>It was obvious that they would call him a hero or whatever another terrible thing like that at the meeting.</p>
<p>Cale had learned something while looking at the large group of people gathered outside the Henituse Estate this morning.</p>
<p>He started to speak to the person behind him.</p>
<p>“Choi Han. You remember what to do?”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>
<p>Choi Han immediately started to walk in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>– Human! I’ll be back soon too!</p>
<p>Raon was moving in a different direction as well.</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff peeked toward Choi Han, who was walking away. He was feeling anxious because the strongest swordsman was heading in a different direction when an enemy was trying to break through the barrier.</p>
<p>“Please don’t worry, I sent Choi Han away because there is something he needs to do.”</p>
<p>“Ah, young master-nim-”</p>
<p>“I am not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff became emotional at Cale saying that to console him.</p>
<p>He had heard about everything Cale had done, probably before anybody else, because he worked in the palace.</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff’s steps became more confident as he looked at Cale quickly walking forward.</p>
<p>His anxiety lessened with each step.</p>
<p>‘Yes! Who would dare to attack the Roan Kingdom when young master Cale-nim is here?! The intruders won’t be a problem at all!’</p>
<p>There was something the Chief of Staff did not know.</p>
<p>Cale’s quick footsteps were only quick and light because he didn’t need to attend the meeting and because Dragons were rolling over to him by the handful.</p>
<p>“Chief!”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff finally arrived at the location of the problematic intruder.</p>
<p>He looked as confident as a tiger.</p>
<p>“Chief! Huh? Behind you?!”</p>
<p>“…Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>The knights and soldiers who had quickly gathered to fend off the intruder all relaxed a bit after seeing someone.</p>
<p>‘The young master-nim is here! He was in the palace!’</p>
<p>‘We can relax now!’</p>
<p>Cale was walking with an extremely relaxed expression on his face.</p>
<p>The Roan Kingdom’s knights knew about this expression.</p>
<p>They knew how many times he had saved the Roan Kingdom and the Western continent with that relaxed expression on his face. The ones who had been with Cale in some of the Roan Kingdom’s battles lit up with joy.</p>
<p>However, Cale’s face quickly stiffened.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>“…I am no longer a commander.”</p>
<p>“Once a Commander, always a Commander. That person is the intruder!”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain of the 1st Knights Brigade pointed up at the sky.</p>
<p>Cale had already been looking there.</p>
<p>‘…Is he crazy?’</p>
<p>Cale had wondered how the Dragon would come to find him.</p>
<p>‘Wait right there. You need to be punished for waking this great and mighty Dragon’s slumber. Human. I will personally walk over to you, so you better wait right there.’</p>
<p>That was what the Dragon had said.</p>
<p>“…He really is walking over to me.”</p>
<p>The Dragon was walking in the air as if there was a carpet in front of it. The man was taking large steps as he stomped forward.</p>
<p>“He easily destroyed the magic barrier!”</p>
<p>‘Yes. He’s stomping over here after breaking it.’</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at the Vice Knight Captain’s words.</p>
<p>“We believe he is extremely skilled. He is at least a highest-grade mage, so the mages are heading here as well! But although he is extremely skilled, he-”</p>
<p>The Vice Knight Captain could not say what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Cale finished his sentence for him.</p>
<p>“He seems like a crazy bastard.”</p>
<p>“…Ah… that-”</p>
<p>The Vice Knight Captain could not disagree.</p>
<p>Cale started to think.</p>
<p>‘Why is everybody I meet lately like this?’</p>
<p>He could hear the voice of the Dragon as it glared at him.</p>
<p>– Hmph! You showed up! How dare you wake me up?</p>
<p>‘It does seem that way. He really seemed to have been sleeping.’</p>
<p>The Dragon had walked over.</p>
<p>He was barefoot.</p>
<p>He was also wearing pajamas.</p>
<p>On his side was a long and comfortable looking pillow.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the pajama-clad Dragon whose feet finally touched the ground.</p>
<p>He had a buzz cut.</p>
<p>However, there were some patterns that looked like scratches on both sides of his head.</p>
<p>There were some patterns in his eyebrows as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the pajamas had a really cute design on it.</p>
<p>‘… Was [ The Birth of a Hero ] wrong?’</p>
<p>Cale had recently been thinking that the Birth of a Hero had been wrong about Dragons.</p>
<p>“I finally see the face of the bastard who dared to disturb my slumber!”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon with a gangster-like voice was brusquely walking forward with his bare feet.</p>
<p>“P, protect the Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>Cale raised his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. He is someone I know.”</p>
<p>Everybody instantly stopped being chaotic.</p>
<p>“Sir, he’s someone you know?”</p>
<p>Cale quietly observed the buzz cut Dragon after hearing the Chief of Staff’s question.</p>
<p>The eyes glaring at him seemed extremely annoyed.</p>
<p>Cale found it oddly welcoming to finally see someone look at him as if he was annoying.</p>
<p>It was because this Dragon was a giant piece of gold that had rolled in on its own.</p>
<p>“Who knows? I may or may not know him.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon scoffed in disbelief at Cale’s response before stopping right in front of Cale and glaring at him.</p>
<p>His long vertical pupils were glaring at Cale so hard as if they wanted to pierce right through him.</p>
<p>“You are a very unique human.”</p>
<p>The human in front of him had so many things inside his body that the Dragon could not figure him out so easily.</p>
<p>“However, you still need to be punished for the crime of waking me up from my sweet, sweet slumber!”</p>
<p>The Vice Knight Captain looked at this shouting pajamas-clad Dragon as if he wanted to swear at him. The Vice Knight Captain had no idea that such a crazy bastard would be a Dragon.</p>
<p>“However! You seem somewhat entertaining.”</p>
<p>The Dragon started to smile.</p>
<p>“I think I understand why the other two outside were observing you.”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon recalled the two Dragons who seemed to be family. The older of the two Dragons had been quietly observing this human in front of him right now.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of the buzz cut Dragon’s lips were fully curled up.</p>
<p>“I will give you special treatment and forgive you after just breaking your arms and legs!”</p>
<p>He thought that it might be fun attacking this interesting bastard on different parts of the body to force him to use the different powers inside him.</p>
<p>“How can he say such ludicrous statements……?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, loooooooord!”</p>
<p>The Dragon’s comments made the soldiers and palace staff shout in astonishment. The knights were only staying in place with their mouths shut because Cale had not given them any orders. Their hands were shaking in anger.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>However, Cale looked calm.</p>
<p>He slightly tilted his head and looked toward the pajamas-clad Dragon.</p>
<p>“Sir, did you not hear why I was looking for you?”</p>
<p>That question made the Dragon frown even more.</p>
<p>“Why would I care about that? Those damn Elementals were so loud looking for me that they woke me up. I then heard that you were the one looking for me, you little bastard. That was enough for me. Why the hell would I care that a mere human like you was looking for me? Hmph!”</p>
<p>He snorted and channeled his mana.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Grey mana started to gather around him.</p>
<p>Clang, clang!</p>
<p>The knights around Cale all drew their swords.</p>
<p>They had forgotten about how Cale had told them to stay put and pulled their swords out of reflex. That was how destructive this mana seemed to be.</p>
<p>“You’re going to punish me?”</p>
<p>Cale tilted his head a little more.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m going to punish you, human.”</p>
<p>“Mm. You’re going to regret it.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Regret?! Did a punk like you just tell me I’m going to regret it?”</p>
<p>Cale started to think while looking at this Dragon who truly seemed baffled.</p>
<p>‘There was a reason Mayor Obante was so scared of seeing a Dragon.’</p>
<p>How scared must he have been after seeing a Dragon like this?</p>
<p>Cale understood Obante’s feelings as he calmly responded to the mana-channeling Dragon.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. You’re going to regret it.”</p>
<p>“…How dare you tell my esteemed self that I’m going to regret-”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon suddenly flinched mid-sentence and quickly turned his head.</p>
<p>Something was coming.</p>
<p>Something was coming from the direction that this human named Cale Henituse had come from.</p>
<p>Someone who was extremely strong was getting closer.</p>
<p>‘It’s a Dragon.’</p>
<p>He was certain it was a Dragon.</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon heard a calm voice in his mind at that moment.</p>
<p>– It looks like it is already too late for regrets.</p>
<p>It was the old Dragon he saw outside the barrier.</p>
<p>That Dragon was strong, but its power seemed to be on the gentler side.</p>
<p>However, the Dragon approaching him was different.</p>
<p>It had an extremely ferocious power like he did.</p>
<p>He could see the white-gold hair.</p>
<p>It was a swordsman with a slightly peculiar aura. The white-gold haired knight was following behind the young man with black hair who was quite strong for a human.</p>
<p>Going back to last night…</p>
<p>Cale had asked Raon to get Eruhaben to come after his meeting with Dodori.</p>
<p>He had a feeling that Dodori’s mom and Eruhaben might know each other.</p>
<p>Raon had urgently contacted Eruhaben again earlier as things had changed and Choi Han had gone to escort Eruhaben over.</p>
<p>Eruhaben, who was dressed like a knight, swept his white-gold hair back and looked toward the buzz cut Dragon.</p>
<p>– It sounds like you are the one who wants to be beaten to a pulp.</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon got the chills for the first time in a long while, no, for quite possibly the first time in his life after hearing Eruhaben’s cold warning.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>‘Mm!’</p>
<p>He felt the aura of a Dragon from a different direction.</p>
<p>This was definitely the power he had felt next to Cale Henituse earlier.</p>
<p>– I will destroy everything if you put even a finger on our human!</p>
<p>The voice was a young voice, but the power it was gathering was quite fierce.</p>
<p>Then there was a third.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>The Dragon raised his head.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>Someone who descended from the sky pointed his arrow at him.</p>
<p>“I won’t let you harm our young master Silver Shield-nim!”</p>
<p>The pink curly-haired Dragon that had been with the other Dragon earlier was huffing as he glared at the buzz cut Dragon.</p>
<p>This was the third Dragon.</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon’s anger was slowly subsiding as he thought about how there were too many Dragons here.</p>
<p>He had never seen so many Dragons in one place throughout his life.</p>
<p>…It also looked as if all three Dragons were taking a human’s side.</p>
<p>That was something he had never seen nor heard about throughout his entire life either.</p>
<p>The Dragon heard the white-gold haired knight’s voice again.</p>
<p>– Do you want to die? Do you want me to beat you down until you turn to dust? Hmm? Should I turn you into dust? It’s been a while since I beat someone up until I felt refreshed. It’s a gloomy day, so you’ll probably need to be beaten for quite a while if I want it to cause some dust.</p>
<p>The human standing in front of the buzz cut Dragon walked up to him and whispered.</p>
<p>“The Lord is looking for you.”</p>
<p>‘…Lord? …Dragon Lord? There was a Dragon Lord? I’m sure there wasn’t. What’s going on? It doesn’t look like he’s lying.’</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon was sweating bullets now that he was completely awake and his anger had subsided.</p>
<p>He looked at the human in front of him.</p>
<p>“Are you regretting it yet?”</p>
<p>Cale asked as he gently smiled at the Dragon in front of him.</p>
<p>—</p>

<p>Three Dragons walk through a barrier…hohoho. Cale truly turning into Lance, the Dragon Master of the Pokemon Elite Four! </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 632 – Not a chaotic field 3</p>
<p>‘Do I regret it?’</p>
<p>The pajama-clad buzz cut Dragon did not like this human who was speaking to him disrespectfully despite the gentle smile on his face.</p>
<p>However, the situation was not good enough for him to complain about that.</p>
<p>– Seeing an arrogant little Dragon like you reminds me of when I was young.</p>
<p>The white gold haired Dragon was focusing the entirety of his vicious aura on him.</p>
<p>– I will destroy everything if you touch our human! I will destroy the entire world!</p>
<p>“The darkness boiling inside me will haunt you forever!”</p>
<p>There were two extremely young Dragons spewing some nonsense at him as well.</p>
<p>– How about you stop?</p>
<p>There was also the aura that was not as strong as the white gold haired Dragon’s aura, a gentle yet strong aura that was focused on him. That aura had been revealed once the pink curly-haired kid appeared.</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon did not dare to attack after four Dragons were showing him their hostility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had heard this human talk about the ‘Dragon Lord,’ someone who should not exist anymore.</p>
<p>Cale reached his hand out and gently patted the pajama-clad Dragon’s shoulder as he started to speak again.</p>
<p>“We have a lot to discuss.”</p>
<p>“…You bastard, how dare you speak so informally to this great Dragon-”</p>
<p>– Look at this young bastard acting so pompous. You look like you haven’t even lived half as long as I have lived. You’re the one who should come over and greet me, you little punk.</p>
<p>– I’ll make you pay if you try to harm our human!</p>
<p>“Do you know how great of a hero our Young Master Silver Shield is?! Shut up if you don’t! Go to the bookstore and learn to read! You damn idiot!”</p>
<p>…He could not even finish his sentence.</p>
<p>The grey mana around the pajama-clad Dragon slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>He seemed to have lost all desire to be angry nor to fight.</p>
<p>He was just tired.</p>
<p>Cale didn’t care as he calmly motioned to Dodori.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Dodori quickly put his bow down and walked over to Cale.</p>
<p>The people of the palace were watching what was going on.</p>
<p>Cale’s people had suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The enemy’s demeanor had calmed down at that point, and Cale was even smiling while speaking in a friendly tone with the intruder.</p>
<p>The situation seemed to be quickly settling down.</p>
<p>They didn’t really understand what was going on, but there was one thing they could tell.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain of the Knights Brigade mumbled.</p>
<p>“…The palace barrier can handle up to highest-grade magic spells.”</p>
<p>But that barrier had been pierced by this pajama-clad enemy and the pink-haired archer.</p>
<p>Had the barrier weakened? Or was it just that these individuals were especially strong?</p>
<p>Regardless of the answer, the Roan Kingdom’s Mage Brigade was bound to be working overtime starting today.</p>
<p>“Why did you call me over?”</p>
<p>Dodori stood right next to Cale and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Cale smiled and pointed toward the pajama-clad Dragon.</p>
<p>“Let’s drag this sir over.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sure!”</p>
<p>Dodori nodded his head without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Do you really think an esteemed Dragon like me would be dragged by such a youngster?!”</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon flinched after seeing the look in Dodori’s eyes.</p>
<p>Dodori was looking at the Dragon from head to toe with an odd gaze.</p>
<p>“…I finally get to see a scene from the hero’s tale with my own eyes. Reality is different from the novel, but… A true hero definitely needs to have a rude and arrogant Dragon by his side. That Dragon will end up being affected by the human and become a wise and gentle Dragon. Hehe.”</p>
<p>‘…What’s wrong with him?’</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon started to sweat after looking into those crazed eyes.</p>
<p>However, he could not respond again.</p>
<p>“I will do it.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben walked over with Choi Han and stood next to the pajama-clad Dragon.</p>
<p>Dodori gulped after looking at Eruhaben.</p>
<p>This Dragon was giving off an extremely imposing presence.</p>
<p>– Pink Dragon! This is our Goldie gramps! He is a very nice and friendly grandpa!</p>
<p>Dodori heard Raon’s bright voice but hesitated about what to do. Eruhaben, the Dragon in front of him, seemed difficult to handle.</p>
<p>Eruhaben gently smiled toward Dodori in a way that was completely different from the way he was treating the pajama-clad Dragon.</p>
<p>“Little child, I will do it so step back. Oh, and there is no need to be nervous.”</p>
<p>“…As I expected.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben paid closer attention to Dodori’s voice after hearing him mumble. He then managed to hear what Dodori was mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>“…I knew that a hero like this who will never be matched in the world would have a strong supporter behind him. I got another piece of information today. I knew I made the right choice to come here. I, Dodori, seem to be great at making decisions.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben turned stoic and turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>– You unlucky bastard.</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders after hearing Eruhaben’s voice in his mind. He looked confused as to why he was unlucky.</p>
<p>Eruhaben felt even more pity for Cale after seeing that gaze.</p>
<p>‘Raon was right. He truly turns a small task of putting a hole in a cliff into a big one by getting rid of the whole cliff. No wonder he has all these things happen to him.’</p>
<p>He raised his head to look at the sky.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we leave the children out of it and the two of us drag him together?”</p>
<p>He was looking at the Dragon who was the strongest of the Dragons here after him.</p>
<p>This was not a Dragon he had met in the past.</p>
<p>However, this Dragon should be the reason Cale had asked for him to come here last night.</p>
<p>He called the imposing Dragon, who was much stronger than this arrogant Dragon that was talking about ripping Cale’s limbs off, down to the ground.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale gulped while looking at someone descending from the sky.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly gasped. Cale got the chills for some reason after seeing the sparkle in Choi Han’s eyes.</p>
<p>– Human! It’s the farmer Dragon!</p>
<p>Dodori’s mom, who had braided her beige-colored hair, was wearing an outfit covered in dirt.</p>
<p>She was also wearing boots that had dried mud on them.</p>
<p>And most importantly…</p>
<p>– Human! It’s a scythe!</p>
<p>She had a small scythe in her hand.</p>
<p>She seemed to have come directly here while getting some work done in the morning. It was obvious that Dodori had urgently dragged her over.</p>
<p>Dodori’s bronze-skinned mom quickly walked over to Cale once she landed on the ground.</p>
<p>“My name is Mila. I would like to chat with you in a quiet spot.”</p>
<p>Her voice was warm and majestic.</p>
<p>“Madam, I’ve wished to chat with you as well.”</p>
<p>Cale treated this rational Dragon with the respect she deserved.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon scoffed in disbelief after seeing him acting so respectfully, but nobody cared about him.</p>
<p>Dodori’s mom Mila stood to the right side of the pajama-clad Dragon. Eruhaben was on the left side.</p>
<p>Mila made eye contact with Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben’s eyes opened wide after hearing what Mila said.</p>
<p>She was not someone Eruhaben had met in the past.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go somewhere quiet first?”</p>
<p>He did not ask anything because Cale had started to move.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was following behind Cale before he looked back.</p>
<p>“Are you not coming?”</p>
<p>He looked at the pajama-clad Dragon with an extremely annoyed gaze.</p>
<p>Eruhaben and Mila… The two Dragons were both simply walking and did not actually drag the pajama-clad Dragon.</p>
<p>“…Haaa.”</p>
<p>However, the pajama-clad Dragon sighed and started to walk next to them. He didn’t have the balls to run away from these two Dragons.</p>
<p>That would lead to his death.</p>
<p>Walking between Eruhaben and Mila…</p>
<p>That was enough to bind him down, even without any physical restraints.</p>
<p>‘…But this beige Dragon seems a bit weak.’</p>
<p>Although she seemed to have more years of experience than he did, her aura seemed very gentle. His attribute was probably stronger than hers, which meant that he should be able to overcome the difference in their strength with his extremely ferocious offensive power.</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon was waiting for a chance to escape.</p>
<p>He had no intention of suffering under this terrible treatment.</p>
<p>‘…I will definitely pay them back for this shame!’</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon’s fiery gaze was focused on Cale’s back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was something he did not know.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that four Dragons and Choi Han were all quietly watching him stare at Cale.</p>
<p>Cale was the only one who didn’t know about this vicious moment.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The door opened and they walked into a room.</p>
<p>‘You should be able to chat here, young master Cale.”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff led Cale and the others to the closest room that was quiet enough to chat.</p>
<p>“There is soundproof barrier magic in this room, so nobody outside will be able to hear your discussion.”</p>
<p>The smart Chief of Staff had given Cale the type of room he was looking for.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff’s eyes were glowing because he had just seen Cale suppress this crazy bastard who had barged in barefoot and wearing pajamas with just a few words.</p>
<p>“Please let me know if you need anything at all. I will leave a few servants stationed outside.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Will you please inform his highness that I am here?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Then I’ll be heading out now. Please have a nice chat.”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff smiled brightly before walking out and closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>Screeeeech- click!</p>
<p>The inside was now completely separated from the outside world.</p>
<p>Eruhaben immediately turned toward Mila at that moment.</p>
<p>“Do you know me?”</p>
<p>Cale watched with a curious gaze.</p>
<p>Mila seemed to know Eruhaben quite well, but Eruhaben did not seem to know her.</p>
<p>Mila started to speak.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we send the children out first?”</p>
<p>Cale frowned.</p>
<p>Her wanting to send the children out must mean that the things she was about to say contained heavy topics.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Choi Han walked over to Raon who was no longer invisible and Dodori who was standing next to him.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim, why don’t we eat some cookies in the next room? Raon-”</p>
<p>“Alright! I’m going to eat cookies!”</p>
<p>“…This is very, very disappointing. However, I, Dodori, cannot go against my mother’s orders.”</p>
<p>An excited Raon and a disappointed Dodori followed Choi Han to the next room. The servant outside would take care of them.</p>
<p>“Only the adults are left now.”</p>
<p>Cale said that as he sat down on the couch.</p>
<p>Eruhaben and Mila each sat down on a different couch as well.</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon also started to move toward a couch.</p>
<p>“Don’t sit.”</p>
<p>However, the pajama-clad Dragon had to stop moving after a single comment from Eruhaben. The pajama-clad Dragon’s scratched eyebrows looked ready to explode at any moment when Mila started to speak.</p>
<p>“…It was a day with a typhoon. I saw a 2 on 1 fight.”</p>
<p>“…Ah……”</p>
<p>Eruhaben let out a deep sigh. Cale could see the ancient Dragon start to frown.</p>
<p>“I was very young at that time.”</p>
<p>Mila recalled a memory from a long time ago.</p>
<p>However, it was so clear that she still remembered it as if it had happened yesterday.</p>
<p>That day with the typhoon…</p>
<p>Everything around her looked as if it would be swept away by the wind and rain.</p>
<p>At that moment… Two Dragons were fighting against one Dragon.</p>
<p>“I was around 100 years old at that time, so you were probably about 300. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben covered his face with both hands.</p>
<p>Mila continued to speak in a gentle voice.</p>
<p>“That was the first time I learned that someone could be beaten up so much that dust would fly even during a typhoon.”</p>
<p>“Ahem. Hmm!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben avoided Cale’s gaze.</p>
<p>“You were beating them up so badly. You didn’t even use your mana; you just beat them to a pulp with your hands and feet.”</p>
<p>“…I… I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>Mila shook her head after hearing what Eruhaben barely managed to say.</p>
<p>“There’s no way that is the case. I even remember what you said before you left those bloody messes behind.”</p>
<p>Mila repeated what Eruhaben had said that day, word for word.</p>
<p>“ ‘You bitches, if you run those damn mouths of your one more time, the great Eruhaben will fuc-’ ”</p>
<p>“S, stop!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben stopped Mila from saying the rest.</p>
<p>“You are that young Dragon from that day?”</p>
<p>Mila calmly nodded her head.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I was hiding in the bushes and watching you. You just beat them up without even caring about the fact that I was there. You knew I was there, but you didn’t care.”</p>
<p>“You hiding there had nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben finally remembered where he had seen Mila.</p>
<p>It was during the time he had been on his adventure (?) to beat up the bastards who looked down on his dust attribute.</p>
<p>He tried to recall that moment.</p>
<p>“Mm. Those two bastards deserved being beaten to a pulp.”</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon flinched.</p>
<p>Eruhaben didn’t care as he asked Mila a question.</p>
<p>“Mila. Why were you there on that day? The weather was terrible. You seemed to have been hiding there for a while.”</p>
<p>Mila calmly responded.</p>
<p>“I was there to assassinate those two bastards.”</p>
<p>Cale’s shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon’s pupils slightly shook.</p>
<p>Eruhaben started to speak again.</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“One of those Dragons was acting so arrogantly that I got annoyed and went to put a hole in his leg. They looked down on me and picked on me for being young and having a weak attribute. Stupid shitheads like that need to be taught a lesson.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben nodded his head as if he understood.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. I thought you really were going to kill them. Those bastards truly were terrible. I would have beaten them up more if I knew they were picking on a young Dragon.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t kill them. I would just cause them pain. I don’t kill for trivial reasons. Every life is precious.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Then did you just leave after watching what happened?”</p>
<p>Mila slowly shook her head.</p>
<p>“After you left, they swore at you and called you a gangster Dragon. I put a hole in each of their cheeks. Ah, I put holes in their legs as well.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben closed his mouth as if he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Even Cale’s pupils shook this time.</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon was subconsciously shaking his legs in fear.</p>
<p>Mila smiled toward the three of them.</p>
<p>“Got you. It was just a joke.”</p>
<p>‘…It doesn’t sound like a joke at all.’</p>
<p>Cale peeked at the dirt-covered scythe in Mila’s hand and held back his comment.</p>
<p>This Dragon seemed scarier than the pajama-clad Dragon and Dodori.</p>
<p>He looked toward the pajama-clad Dragon as he wanted to quickly change topics.</p>
<p>“What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Why would I tell someone like you my name-”</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon received a vicious gaze from Eruhaben and a gentle gaze from Mila.</p>
<p>He suddenly imagined himself being beaten to a pulp to the point that dust was flying in a typhoon and having holes in his legs.</p>
<p>He got the chills.</p>
<p>‘…I’m scared.’</p>
<p>He had never seen crazy Dragons like this before.</p>
<p>He felt oddly sad.</p>
<p>The pajama-clad Dragon looked ready to cry as he spoke.</p>
<p>“…My name is Rasheel.”</p>
<p>Cale gently smiled and pointed to a couch.</p>
<p>“It must be tiring to stay standing, isn’t it, sir? Please sit down. Would you like a warm cup of tea?”</p>
<p>Rasheel felt that this rude human’s words sounded oddly warm.</p>
<p>His sadness seemed to wash away a little bit.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Does Rasheel understand he is being scammed by our dearly beloved young master? Hohoho </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 633 – Not a chaotic field 5</p>
<p>There was a short moment of silence as everybody drank their tea.</p>
<p>“Could you please tell me what is going on?”</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the room changed after Mila asked the question.</p>
<p>“And what did you mean by ‘Lord’?”</p>
<p>Rasheel’s eyes looked a bit warmer as he asked that question, but Mila frowned.</p>
<p>Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>That was an existence that was no longer in this world.</p>
<p>Mila’s eyes clouded over before she turned toward Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“Did you become the Lord?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Eruhaben elegantly put down the teacup in his hand and looked at the two Dragons.</p>
<p>“This will probably be a very long story. Cale, is it okay if I do it?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben should be able to explain it better than Cale since the story was related to the Dragons.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Please do.”</p>
<p>Crunch crunch.</p>
<p>Cale bit down on a cookie and stepped back from the conversation for a moment.</p>
<p>“Then let me start with how I first met this unlucky bastard and the little kid.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben started to share everything that had happened until now.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Drip.</p>
<p>Some tea dripped out of Rasheel’s mouth. He was so shocked that he didn’t notice that his mouth was hanging open.</p>
<p>He soon jumped up out of his seat.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! How could all this have happened while I was asleep-?!”</p>
<p>Rasheel could not say anything else as he looked toward Cale. Eruhaben’s calm voice continued to fill Rasheel’s ears.</p>
<p>“As for the current situation… The White Star is planning on summoning the sealed god, and some monsters that will be a disaster to this world.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben gave a short description of the potential ending.</p>
<p>“This world will be destroyed if we cannot stop the White Star.”</p>
<p>This world would be destroyed.</p>
<p>Rasheel used the sleeve of his pajamas to wipe the tea off his mouth before pointing toward Cale.</p>
<p>“I thought the humans were having some territorial dispute because the Elementals called you a damn hero! But WHAT?! THIS-?!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben calmly responded to him.</p>
<p>“It is a kind of territorial dispute in a way. It is just on a much larger scale.”</p>
<p>“How can you phrase it like that-?!”</p>
<p>‘Just a much larger scale?! If things went wrong, a god’s seal would be released and the Demonic race that worships that god might take over this world! That bastard called the White Star or White Radish or whatever might end up becoming a god who rules over this world as well.’</p>
<p>“And you said that the last Lord’s soul is still here? And that Lord’s child is that cute but somewhat clueless kid who was talking about destroying everything earlier?”</p>
<p>Rasheel slapped himself.</p>
<p>“O, ow! That hurt! That must mean that this is not a dream!”</p>
<p>How could there be such an annoying situation like this?!</p>
<p>“Ah, fucking hell!”</p>
<p>The White Star was the last Dragon Slayer. That man had started an endless loop of reincarnation.</p>
<p>The Dragon Lord, her children, a sealed god, and even the Demonic race were involved in his quest to fulfill his wildest desires.</p>
<p>Not only that…</p>
<p>The peace of this land was on the line.</p>
<p>There might be a grand battle on a scale that has not been seen since ancient times.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It might become a war even bigger than during ancient times.</p>
<p>Even the do-as-I-please Rasheel knew his foundational duty as a Dragon.</p>
<p>They were to protect this world from outside influences.</p>
<p>The Divine race, the Demonic race, and even the gods were all included in these ‘outside influences.’</p>
<p>According to the rules of this world, any outside force trying to influence this world was breaking their rules.</p>
<p>He clenched his head and plopped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“Ow! What a headache!”</p>
<p>‘What the hell did he wake up to?! I should have just kept sleeping!’</p>
<p>“Those motherfucking Elementals! Why the hell did they need to yap so loudly?!”</p>
<p>He had been able to hear the voices of Elementals since he was young. This was something unique only to Rasheel.</p>
<p>Rasheel lowered his head.</p>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>Rasheel raised his head after feeling a gentle hand patting his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Now, now, please don’t get so riled up and drink a cup of tea. Anger is not good for your health.”</p>
<p>“…You-”</p>
<p>Rasheel had a complicated expression on his face as he looked at the smiling Cale who was filling his teacup again.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had just explained how many terrible battles this human had already been through, and he knew that there were too many more of those battles in his future.</p>
<p>Rasheel was on the selfish side and found altruistic people like Cale quite mysterious.</p>
<p>However, the life of this human named Cale Henituse was beyond mysterious; it was astonishing.</p>
<p>“…You’re a really good bastard, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Cale was also the only one who was nice to him even though he had tried to cause a ruckus.</p>
<p>“Not at all. I am not a good person; I am extremely materialistic and selfish.”</p>
<p>“…You-”</p>
<p>Rasheel was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>He stopped talking and clenched the teacup before looking away from Cale.</p>
<p>His mind was a complicated mess right now.</p>
<p>‘Good, I’m winning him over.’</p>
<p>Cale observed Rasheel and smiled internally in a way that Raon would call him a scammer if he had seen it.</p>
<p>‘Surprisingly, he is showing the most normal reaction.’</p>
<p>Cale found it odd that Rasheel was having such a normal reaction because of how their first meeting had gone. Although Rasheel grumbled and was a little rough to handle, he seemed as if he would truly give his all to fight against the White Star if Cale handled him well.</p>
<p>‘On the other hand, I can’t tell anything about this Dragon.’</p>
<p>Mila was quietly drinking tea with her scythe placed down by her side.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben asked Mila that question, and Mila turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Once I learned that I became a mother… I thought about what I could do for my child.”</p>
<p>Mila put the teacup down.</p>
<p>“You start to understand the ways of the world when you farm. No matter how much effort and love you put into raising your crops, a single natural disaster could ruin a whole season of crops and destroy everything you put your heart and soul into growing.”</p>
<p>She then picked up her scythe.</p>
<p>“I did not raise Dodori by spoiling him with the utmost care.”</p>
<p>She took a rag out of her pocket and slowly wiped the dirt off her scythe.</p>
<p>“However, if these natural disaster-like bastards try to get in my child’s way… I will get rid of that natural disaster.”</p>
<p>Mila’s face was reflected on the now-clean scythe.</p>
<p>“I will kill anything that puts my child in danger.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Clunk. Clunk.</p>
<p>The teacup and kettle on the table shook.</p>
<p>Wind was blowing around Mila.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Rasheel subconscious gulped.</p>
<p>He could feel her years of experience but had thought that her attribute would be weak because of her peaceful aura.</p>
<p>That was why he had paid less attention to this Dragon over Eruhaben, but she seemed extremely dangerous right now.</p>
<p>Clunk. Clunk. Clunk!</p>
<p>The teacup looked ready to crack at any moment because of this rumbling.</p>
<p>“To be honest with you, I don’t care what happens to this land. It doesn’t matter to me whether the God of Despair’s seal is removed, whether the Demonic race invades, or whatever the hell this White Star does. All I care about is my child’s happiness.”</p>
<p>Mila looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“However, what my child wants is to follow you and your dream of peace for this world. In that case, I must step in.”</p>
<p>Her eyes had an odd glow as she looked at Cale with a piercing gaze.</p>
<p>Rasheel slowly lowered himself down on the couch after feeling a mysterious pressure.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong, madam.”</p>
<p>He then placed his teacup on the table.</p>
<p>Tap!</p>
<p>The rumbling stopped once he gently placed his cup down.</p>
<p>“You said I’m wrong?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. My dream is not world peace. It is just focused on me. I just want a safe place for my people and I so that we can live peacefully doing whatever we want to do.”</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“I just need world peace in order to live like that. That is why I am doing all of this to protect the peace.”</p>
<p>Mila looked into Cale’s firm gaze.</p>
<p>“World peace is not what I am aiming for. Mila-nim, you must be thinking that I am very different from what you expected, am I right?”</p>
<p>Cale believed that he was not a hero and had no desire to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>He cared most about himself and his people, and his goal was to live peacefully as a slacker.</p>
<p>He truly believed he was not a good person, as he frequently told people.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>Mila quietly observed him for a bit before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“That’s… Extremely arrogant. Peace is just a step for your goal.”</p>
<p>“I never phrased it like that, madam.”</p>
<p>“That is how it sounded to me.”</p>
<p>Mila’s aura slowly dwindled before it disappeared.</p>
<p>“But I like it.”</p>
<p>She started to smile.</p>
<p>“I do not like heroes. I especially do not like heroes who sacrifice themselves.”</p>
<p>Sacrifice.</p>
<p>She believed that these heroes were very noble in their causes, however…</p>
<p>“They make the people left behind extremely sad.”</p>
<p>There will be a large number of people who will be happy about the things they earned through a hero’s sacrifice. Some of them might even feel sorry for the hero.</p>
<p>However, the people close to them…</p>
<p>The loved ones of the hero who sacrificed herself, the ones who had been by the hero’s side… They would end up feeling a deep sense of sorrow.</p>
<p>Mila didn’t like that.</p>
<p>That was not a completely happy ending.</p>
<p>She looked at Cale.</p>
<p>He was completely different from what she had learned about him from the book.</p>
<p>“A human who believes he is not a hero even when the entire world believes he is one.”</p>
<p>He still continued to sacrifice himself, but dreamt of living peacefully without sacrificing himself nor the people around him.</p>
<p>His desires were extremely clear and firm.</p>
<p>People like this usually achieved their desires.</p>
<p>“I like it very much.”</p>
<p>Mila liked Cale a lot.</p>
<p>The real Cale was like her, unlike the Cale she had learned about from the books Dodori bought and forced her to read.</p>
<p>“It sounds like Dodori will learn something good from you.”</p>
<p>Cale smiled.</p>
<p>Mila’s words meant that Dodori was definitely joining Cale’s side.</p>
<p>‘Now if Mila joins us too…!’</p>
<p>There would be seven Dragons including Sheritt and the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>Cale’s heart was beating quickly as he waited for what she had to say next.</p>
<p>Mila gently asked a question.</p>
<p>“A student’s parent can tag along and participate as well, right?”</p>
<p>‘Hmm? A student’s parent?’</p>
<p>Cale tilted his head to the side in confusion.</p>
<p>“…I’m not a teacher?”</p>
<p>“It’s my condition.”</p>
<p>Cale shut up immediately.</p>
<p>Mila just continued to speak with a relaxed expression.</p>
<p>“Show Dodori your way of life. Then Dodori will naturally learn something from you. If my child is learning something from you, doesn’t that mean that you are a teacher?”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>There was a beautiful smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right, teacher Cale?”</p>
<p>– You unlucky bastard.</p>
<p>He heard Eruhaben sigh in his mind.</p>
<p>“I am too delinquent to be a tea-”</p>
<p>“Teacher.”</p>
<p>“…I understand. That condition of being a teacher… I will accept it.”</p>
<p>But Cale added on with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>“However, although I may be a teacher by name, I will not do anything specifically to teach him. I will just let him watch what I do by my side. That is what you said, isn’t it, Mila-nim?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Please just give him a place to watch, hear, and feel things by your side, Mr. Teacher.”</p>
<p>Mila looked quite scary calling him a teacher while holding her scythe.</p>
<p>Mila noticed Cale’s gaze on the scythe and tapped the scythe with her finger.</p>
<p>“It sounds like I’ll be getting blood on this scythe for the first time in a long while. Hoho.”</p>
<p>Mila’s sparkling eyes looked the same to Cale as Dodori’s eyes when Dodori said that he would write Cale’s biography of a hero.</p>
<p>This was no mistake.</p>
<p>Dodori was just like his mother.</p>
<p>“…Son of a…”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon Rasheel looked away from Mila as his legs shook in fear. Cale wanted to shake his head at this Dragon who seemed oddly full of concerns, unlike other Dragons.</p>
<p>Dodori, Mila, and Rasheel.</p>
<p>These three Dragons… Will everything be okay with these three tagging along?</p>
<p>The die had been cast and Cale suddenly got chills on his back.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud noise and the door burst open.</p>
<p>“Why did the door…?!”</p>
<p>“Is it an enemy?”</p>
<p>They could see the anxious servants outside the door.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, so please calm down.”</p>
<p>Choi Han calmed them down while Dodori walked into the room looking confused.</p>
<p>The one who slammed the door open spoke into Cale’s mind.</p>
<p>– Human! The Dragon half-blood! The Dragon half-blood!</p>
<p>Raon’s voice was shaking as if to reveal his complicated heart.</p>
<p>– They said that the Dragon half-blood fainted!</p>
<p>Cale stood up with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood had been given half a year to live.</p>
<p>He had lived longer than that after meeting Sheritt.</p>
<p>– …Human, he is apparently asking for you……</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to go visit the Forest of Darkness.”</p>
<p>He then started to speak to the three Dragons.</p>
<p>“Please come with me to meet the Lord.”</p>
<p>Cale raised his hand.</p>
<p>Although he could not see Raon, he knew Raon was always close enough to be reached.</p>
<p>Raon touched his hand and Cale tightly clenched Raon’s shaking front paw.</p>

<p>Oh dear oh dear oh dear, what will happen with the Dragon half-blood? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 634 – The Greatest Inn Overflowing with Hope and Love 1</p>
<p>“…Lord?”</p>
<p>Dodori, who had not heard about Sheritt, tilted his head in confusion, but Cale had no time to explain.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak as if he already knew what Cale wanted him to do.</p>
<p>“I will stay behind and inform his highness about the situation.”</p>
<p>That meant that he would take part in the grand assembly as Cale’s proxy.</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>‘He’s an innocent one, so he should do a good job.’</p>
<p>Choi Han and crown prince Alberu, the two people who knew the most about his current situation, should be able to take care of any weird situations that pop up.</p>
<p>Cale felt that he had some reliable people supporting him.</p>
<p>“The preparations are complete.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the other Dragons after hearing Eruhaben’s comment.</p>
<p>Mila was walking toward him with a gentle smile and Dodori by her side, Rasheel was awkwardly stiff as he walked over, and Dodori was happily walking after hearing that they were going together.</p>
<p>– …Human.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak while patting Raon’s back.</p>
<p>“Shall we go?”</p>
<p>There was a bright white gold light, and everybody except Choi Han disappeared.</p>
<p>“W, what just-”</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff who had rushed in after being contacted by a servant didn’t know what to think as he watched Cale disappear.</p>
<p>He naturally walked toward the person who could give him some answers.</p>
<p>“Choi Han-nim. May I ask what is going on?”</p>
<p>Fear was visible on the Chief of Staff’s face.</p>
<p>There was currently a secret meeting between the chief executives of kingdoms throughout the Western continent. One of the people who should know how important such a meeting was had just disappeared with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to walk as he answered back.</p>
<p>“An individual may leave their body today.”</p>
<p>The people following behind Choi Han opened their eyes wide and shook in fear.</p>
<p>Leave their body.</p>
<p>That meant that someone might die.</p>
<p>‘Who is it?’</p>
<p>They wanted to ask who might die, but they knew that they shouldn’t ask.</p>
<p>There was just an even more awkward silence. The Chief of Staff could not break the silence and instead looked at Choi Han in admiration.</p>
<p>‘He’s not shaking.’</p>
<p>Choi Han’s age was not revealed, but he looked young enough to be known as the youngest sword master. His age probably corresponded with his appearance.</p>
<p>But such a youngster was calm while talking about someone’s death.</p>
<p>‘…Heroes are bound to be surrounded by other heroes.’</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff started to think about the hero and the hero’s party that was also full of heroes. He then thought about death and felt as if he was being suffocated.</p>
<p>This suffocation was probably from the pressure that those heroes are always facing.</p>
<p>That was why the Chief of Staff got out of the way for Choi Han, who was walking into a room that was heavy with a different type of pressure without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Choi Han walked into the meeting room and flipped the room with his words.</p>
<p>The meeting paused because of his unexpected arrival, and Alberu jumped up to look at Choi Han with confusion.</p>
<p>“Choi Han, no, instructor? What brings you here?”</p>
<p>His eyes were asking a question.</p>
<p>‘I thought you guys were dragging Dragons inside?’</p>
<p>Choi Han slightly shook his head and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Your highness. Cale-nim had to leave for urgent matters, so I came in his place. I was told to participate on his behalf.”</p>
<p>Cale had left for urgent matters.</p>
<p>Those words made Toonka, Litana, Valentino, Clopeh Sekka, and the rest of the representatives look toward Choi Han with piercing gazes.</p>
<p>They had come here wanting to ask about Cale’s condition, but that hero had left for urgent matters without even showing his face.</p>
<p>Silence filled the area for a moment.</p>
<p>“…Is something the matter with young master Cale’s health?”</p>
<p>Litana broke the silence to cautiously ask that question.</p>
<p>Choi Han did not think much about it and answered honestly.</p>
<p>“His health is never good.”</p>
<p>He needed to deliver the information about the negotiation with the Dragons and the Dragon half-blood’s condition to Alberu without informing the others.</p>
<p>That was why he had honestly answered Litana’s question while walking closer to Alberu.</p>
<p>“His health, how bad must his health be-”</p>
<p>Litana’s voice was shaking and she could not even finish her sentence, but Choi Han did not notice it.</p>
<p>He was focused on relieving Alberu’s burden, as Alberu seemed to be thinking that Cale had caused some kind of trouble.</p>
<p>“How sick is my close friend?!”</p>
<p>Choi Han nonchalantly told them about the things he had seen after hearing Toonka ask a question as well.</p>
<p>“He coughed up blood and fainted a few days ago and could not control his shaking limbs.”</p>
<p>The weak Cale that Choi Han had seen was, naturally, during Cale’s time as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“However, he survived it with his desire to save everyone and to change the future. He was in so much pain that it felt as if his heart would be ripped out, but even that could not stop Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>“…C, Choi Han-”</p>
<p>Alberu was so shocked that he forgot to call Choi Han, ‘instructor,’ and instead called out his name.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Choi Han finally realized what he had just done.</p>
<p>‘I made a mistake.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo and Cale.</p>
<p>Choi Han, who considered the two as the same person, had talked about how Cale had been while fighting against the unranked monster.</p>
<p>The current Cale’s condition was not that bad.</p>
<p>He was a bit skinny and pale, but… his health was much better than before thanks to eating well and resting well lately.</p>
<p>Choi Han felt an odd chill and turned away from Alberu to look around at the meeting room that was located at the deepest part of the palace.</p>
<p>The different representatives of each kingdom were seated around the table. They each had a few executives with them and there were also the individuals stationed around the room to protect all of them.</p>
<p>Everyone’s pupils were shaking, and they could not hide their shocks.</p>
<p>“…My goodness.”</p>
<p>Clopeh Sekka, who had been sitting quietly until then, let out a quiet sigh before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“How embarrassing.”</p>
<p>His face that seemed to be full of concern seemed even worse than usual.</p>
<p>“Even if it is the path of a hero who will go down in history… As someone who is living in the same time frame as that hero and as the representative of a kingdom, I cannot just sit still.”</p>
<p>Alberu and Choi Han were the only ones who could see the craziness in Clopeh’s eyes.</p>
<p>They thought they could feel Clopeh’s strong desire to chase after Cale, who was creating a legend, so that he too could go down as a part of that legend.</p>
<p>“We will definitely join hero Cale Henituse in his terrible yet noble fight for justice.”</p>
<p>He truly wished to do so.</p>
<p>Clopeh’s strong will to help made another passionate person respond.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“I will also join my close friend! The shield will not break!”</p>
<p>It was naturally Toonka.</p>
<p>But a burning desire to help slowly filled the hearts of everybody else as well. Some of them were passive, but they must have felt the overall feel of the room as they silently nodded their heads.</p>
<p>This was something that Choi Han, Alberu, and especially Cale had not expected at all.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A magnificent black castle that was well-suited for the Forest of Darkness appeared in front of Cale.</p>
<p>“Ohhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Its majestic nature made Dodori respond with excitement.</p>
<p>“You really did have a hidden base! Wow! It’s a black castle that is a complete contrast to the White Star! It’s even located in the Forest of Darkness! Who knew you had such preparations!”</p>
<p>“Dodori.”</p>
<p>Dodori’s mom Mila put a hand on Dodori’s shoulder and spoke in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“Quiet.”</p>
<p>“Mom, how can I be still when looking at a black castle that is making my heart beat so fa-”</p>
<p>Dodori was about to argue back to his mom before shutting up after seeing the look in Mila’s eyes.</p>
<p>‘I need to listen to my mom no matter what she says when she has a gaze like that.’</p>
<p>His Dragon life had consisted of 14 years so far. This was one of the many lessons he had learned through years of trouble.</p>
<p>Mila looked away from the now-calm Dodori.</p>
<p>“I wish to know what is going on, however…”</p>
<p>She looked at Cale and the no longer invisible Raon and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I guess I will need to wait until later.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious as well!”</p>
<p>Dodori added on because he was curious before quickly shutting up. It was because of his mom’s gaze again.</p>
<p>However, Dodori also started to frown while looking at Raon’s face.</p>
<p>He had only seen this hoobae Dragon once before, however, maybe that was why he felt concerned after seeing the look on Raon’s face.</p>
<p>‘What happened that he needed to rush out almost immediately?’</p>
<p>Dodori kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>This was the same for Rasheel as well. The still pajama-clad Dragon quietly looked around.</p>
<p>Unlike Dodori, it was not because of Raon’s expression.</p>
<p>‘…That black castle is no ordinary castle.’</p>
<p>He was looking at the black castle in front of him.</p>
<p>He could tell that something was unique about this castle.</p>
<p>Dodori probably could not notice it, but Dragons at Rasheel and Mila’s level got chills after sensing the magic circles inscribed in the castle and feeling the surrounding mana.</p>
<p>They could feel a strong presence inside as well.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The castle’s gate opened on its own.</p>
<p>Rasheel and Mila became certain.</p>
<p>‘…It’s a Dragon.’</p>
<p>There was definitely another Dragon here.</p>
<p>‘Is it that Lord?’</p>
<p>‘It’s the Dragon Lord.’</p>
<p>They heard Cale’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“I must head in first. If it is okay with you, could you please wait in the first-floor reception room?”</p>
<p>The Tiger Shaman Gashan and Lock who happened to be inside came out to greet them.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“…Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Both of them had grim expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“Gashan, please take good care of our esteemed guests.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I understand. Please head on in.”</p>
<p>Gashan looked at Raon for a moment before looking away.</p>
<p>Cale started to walk behind Lock, who had turned around to guide him.</p>
<p>Raon had a difficult-to-describe expression on his face while flying next to Cale. He wasn’t shaking unlike earlier.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was a step behind them as well.</p>
<p>“This room over here.”</p>
<p>Lock stopped in front of the door to the most isolated room inside the black castle.</p>
<p>“…Over here.”</p>
<p>He didn’t need to say who was here.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood and Sheritt. The two of them should be inside.</p>
<p>Cale stood outside that door for a moment.</p>
<p>‘It’s complicated.’</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood was an extremely complicated individual for Cale.</p>
<p>He did not grab the doorknob.</p>
<p>The individual who had opened the castle gate was not opening the door.</p>
<p>“I’m here.”</p>
<p>The door finally opened once Cale said that.</p>
<p>Sheritt, who was sitting on the couch, made eye contact with Cale.</p>
<p>No, she opened her arms toward Raon, who was floating behind Cale’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Will you come here?”</p>
<p>Raon then quietly flew over and snuggled in her arms.</p>
<p>Raon’s gaze headed toward the inside of the room.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes moved in the same direction.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh.”</p>
<p>Similar to how Cale had been during that final battle against the unranked monster…</p>
<p>Dead mana and his light attribute were continuously clashing and making the Dragon half-blood flail around with shaking limbs as he felt as if his heart would explode.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh, in the end, ugh.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood could not speak properly.</p>
<p>Cale walked over to him.</p>
<p>Cale plopped down on a chair next to the bed and started to speak.</p>
<p>“I guess you finally reached your limits.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood started to smile even though Cale sounded stoic.</p>
<p>A strand of black blood was dripping down the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ugh, yes I did. I’ve lived for a long time.”</p>
<p>“So then, are you going to die?”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood scoffed after hearing Cale’s cold tone once more.</p>
<p>Cale had asked the Dragon half-blood a question in the past.</p>
<p>‘You, what would you do if there was a chance for you to start over?’</p>
<p>That was the day that the Dragon half-blood had told Lord Sheritt and Raon everything.</p>
<p>That chance was for the Dragon half-blood to stay in the black castle, similar to Lord Sheritt.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood struggled to catch his breath as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I, ugh. I am a bastard who deserves to die.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Even death is too easy if you consider all the terrible things you’ve done. You have so many sins to pay for.”</p>
<p>Cale’s voice was extremely cold and emotionless.</p>
<p>However, the Dragon half-blood started to laugh.</p>
<p>“…Hehe……”</p>
<p>It was because he saw the complicated gaze in Cale’s eyes.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>His voice was shaking as if it could cut off at any moment.</p>
<p>“…However… I, I don’t want to disappear like this.”</p>
<p>His heart was in serious pain numerous times every minute.</p>
<p>He had lived a little over half a year while dealing with this endless pain that felt as if his body would rip into pieces.</p>
<p>However, this had been the most peaceful time of the Dragon half-blood’s 900+ years of life.</p>
<p>‘…And I was happy.’</p>
<p>He was so happy that he kept telling himself that he didn’t deserve to be happy.</p>
<p>Because of that…</p>
<p>Because he had felt that way…</p>
<p>“I want to pay for my sins.”</p>
<p>He also wanted to get revenge.</p>
<p>Cale could see the fire inside the Dragon half-blood’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I will not stay in the black castle.”</p>
<p>Cale had said something else to him in the past.</p>
<p>‘Rest a bit and then we will go attack Arm when I call you again… You will go with me to strike Arm.’</p>
<p>‘You will destroy Arm’s secret base with me before you die. That was the deal.’</p>
<p>Cale had taken the Dragon half-blood to strike Arm’s base and took back the Molan residence. They also destroyed the base by the Gate to the Demon World, the area around the current Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, the White Star and Arm were still around.</p>
<p>Cale and the Dragon half-blood’s promise had yet to be completed.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood had organized his knowledge of magic while staying in this castle.</p>
<p>He had also conducted some research.</p>
<p>He was searching for a way to kill the White Star.</p>
<p>He never looked into anything that might let him live.</p>
<p>His soul was stabbed with guilt anytime he felt even an ounce of happiness.</p>
<p>“Personally. I will personally rip that bastard’s head off and kill him.”</p>
<p>“What?</p>
<p>Cale looked back at the Dragon half-blood with an expression that seemed to be asking what nonsense he was spewing.</p>
<p>There was no way to maintain the Dragon half-blood’s body.</p>
<p>Someone walked into the room at that moment.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the person who walked up to him.</p>
<p>The person’s black robe was dragging on the ground.</p>
<p>“I believe you may need my explanation.”</p>
<p>It was Mary.</p>
<p>“Whether it is this castle or bones… They all require magic circles. I believe I can manufacture bones that are strong enough to handle magic circles.”</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes clouded over for a moment.</p>
<p>Mary took out a pile of papers that looked as if someone had gone through them quite a bit. These papers were full of expressions and formulas regarding magic circles. He could feel her tenacity and dedication to make it work.</p>
<p>Mary’s calm voice filled the room.</p>
<p>“A Bone Dragon that moves with its own will. It is highly probable that I will be able to fulfill Mr. Dragon half-blood’s request.”</p>
<p>‘…Bone Dragon? Are they…?’</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze headed toward the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>“…You’re going to become a Bone Dragon?”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood smiled in response.</p>
<p>Mary nonchalantly added on as if she was reading a book.</p>
<p>“However, both the Bone Dragon and Mr. Dragon half-blood will be gone forever if the bones break. This is just a reminder that the White Star has destroyed many of my Flying Skeleton Brigade already. Bones are strong yet weak at the same time.”</p>
<p>Although the Dragon half-blood was restricted to the black castle, he could live in peace here.</p>
<p>Then there was this other method where he could fight once more, but he would die the moment that the bone with the magic circle inscribed on it was destroyed.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood started to speak to Cale, Raon, and everybody else in the room.</p>
<p>He at least needed to get their permissions to do this.</p>
<p>“I want to become the Dragon that the fucking bastard wanted me to become for so long and fight against him.”</p>
<p>That was his last and only remaining desire.</p>

<p>Will he become a Bone Dragon? Will Cale say yes? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 635 – The Greatest Inn Overflowing with Hope and Love 2</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood raised his hand and pounded his chest.</p>
<p>“The White Star should consider me to be a failure.”</p>
<p>The White Star had collected Dragon hearts for the Dragon half-blood, however, the Dragon half-blood was only a half-Dragon who could not make it to the third growth phase.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t the White Star be at least a little bit flustered if that failure shows up in the form of a Dragon to attack him? Heh.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood started to laugh.</p>
<p>He knew how it would be.</p>
<p>Even if he became a Bone Dragon, he would not be able to take the White Star’s life. He was too weak to do that.</p>
<p>The only possible result was that he would die during the battle.</p>
<p>He still wanted to do it.</p>
<p>He looked up at Cale.</p>
<p>The face that had been slightly shocked after hearing the term, ‘Bone Dragon,’ was back to its usual stoic expression.</p>
<p>“Mary.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim?”</p>
<p>“What does it mean to be a Bone Dragon with free will? I’d like to hear some more details about it.”</p>
<p>“It’s simple.”</p>
<p>Mary responded back with her GPS-like voice.</p>
<p>Cale and Eruhaben’s gazes were focused on her.</p>
<p>“I would create a Dragon with bones and put some magic circles on the bones so that Mr. Dragon half-blood can reside within it. The difference with Sheritt-nim would be that, unlike Sheritt-nim who can maintain her form in the castle, Mr. Dragon half-blood would only have the Bone Dragon form.”</p>
<p>Mary continued to speak while looking at Cale whose thoughts she could not read.</p>
<p>“This is because unlike Sheritt-nim, Mr. Dragon half-blood does not have much life force left so it would not be as effective even if we used magic to maintain his current form. As such, I determined that it would be impossible to maintain his form.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that his life force would be low. But won’t it take a lot of mana when you cast that spell?”</p>
<p>Mary turned toward Sheritt for a moment.</p>
<p>“It would take all of Mr. Dragon half-blood’s mana. Sheritt-nim has also agreed to help out.”</p>
<p>Sheritt was hugging Raon and patting his back.</p>
<p>She had a bitter smile on her face as Raon looked up at her.</p>
<p>Raon subconsciously raised one of his paws.</p>
<p>“T, then I will al-.”</p>
<p>However, Raon could not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>It was because Cale asked a question in a cold voice.</p>
<p>“Then if that spell succeeds, the Dragon half-blood would have freedom, unlike Sheritt-nim.”</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood looked into those eyes that seemed as deep as the sea.</p>
<p>“If it is as Mary said, even though you won’t have your physical body, you’ll be able to move around freely.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood started to smile.</p>
<p>“…You don’t trust me.”</p>
<p>Cale had no idea what the Dragon half-blood might do if he could move around freely.</p>
<p>That was probably what he was worried about.</p>
<p>He was concerned that the Dragon half-blood might harm his family once he was free.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood was not disappointed to hear this.</p>
<p>In fact, Cale’s cold gaze made the Dragon half-blood feel relieved.</p>
<p>He did not dare to call Raon and Sheritt-nim his family. Cale was by their side and Cale was very thorough about anything that could harm his family even a little bit.</p>
<p>That should be the reason Cale was looking at him with such a cold gaze right now.</p>
<p>But the Dragon half-blood truly felt relieved after sensing this coldness directed toward him.</p>
<p>A gentle voice flowed out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Yes. Don’t trust me. Cough!”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood coughed so hard that his whole body jerked and blood spurted out.</p>
<p>However, he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaa. Haaaa. My attribute is, ugh. It’s light.”</p>
<p>“And I handle dead mana, which is incompatible with light.”</p>
<p>Mary added on.</p>
<p>“I plan on putting dead mana throughout the Bone Dragon’s body in the locations without the magic circles. It is mainly to strengthen the bones.”</p>
<p>Cale could see the smile on the Dragon half-blood’s face become thicker after hearing Mary’s explanation.</p>
<p>She continued to speak in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“They can also be used as bombs. Depending on the situation, we are even able to make him explode to attack our enemies.”</p>
<p>Take an enemy with you as you die.</p>
<p>It was possible to attack the enemies by putting his life on the line.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, should Mr. Dragon half-blood do anything funny, we can use the dead mana for the Bone Dragon’s body…”</p>
<p>She stopped talking for a moment.</p>
<p>It was because she remembered Raon was there.</p>
<p>She would have said that they would be able to destroy the Bone Dragon’s body as they wished. She was going to say that destroying the Bone Dragon’s body would mean the Dragon half-blood’s death, meaning that they didn’t have to worry about him doing any funny business. That was what she was going to say, however…</p>
<p>Mary chose her words wisely in consideration of Raon.</p>
<p>“…We can prevent Mr. Dragon half-blood from doing anything that goes against our wishes.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Cale stood up from the chair next to the bed.</p>
<p>“I guess you want to pay for your sins.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood flinched his shoulders after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“And get your revenge.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood had not mentioned revenge at all, but his deepest desire was found out.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood wanted to say that he was not just doing this because he was obsessed with getting revenge.</p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p>“I have a condition you must agree to if I let you do this.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood shut up after hearing Cale’s voice.</p>
<p>The condition he mentioned…</p>
<p>“Throw away any desire of getting revenge.”</p>
<p>It was too difficult to do.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood’s shaking pupils took in Cale’s stoic expression.</p>
<p>“The war that is to come is not for your revenge. It is also not for you to pay for your sins.”</p>
<p>“That… Of course I know-”</p>
<p>“For this war, we must focus on protecting and saving as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood closed his mouth.</p>
<p>A battle where they must focus on saving as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“The representatives of every kingdom throughout the Western continent are all gathered in a meeting room right now. Although the goal is to kill the White Star, their number one priority is peace and protecting their territory and the citizens who live there.”</p>
<p>Although they were using words like peace, it was just a battle to protect their land and people.</p>
<p>That was extremely difficult to do.</p>
<p>Cale wanted to find an easy way to achieve such difficult things.</p>
<p>“It is the same for me as well. I am fighting to protect myself and the people around me.”</p>
<p>Land, people, self…</p>
<p>This was a battle to protect.</p>
<p>Cale was tired of battles focused on losing something and didn’t want to fight if he didn’t need to do so.</p>
<p>“Your emotions are useless to my plan right now.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the Dragon half-blood and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Whether you cast aside your desire for revenge or suppress it… I will happily use you however I want if you can hide that emotion from me and agree to take part in this fight in order to protect.”</p>
<p>In order to protect someone.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood’s eyes automatically headed toward a corner of the room.</p>
<p>He could see Sheritt-nim and Raon looking at him.</p>
<p>He felt as if he could not breathe.</p>
<p>He needed to pay the price for his sins and he wanted to get revenge.</p>
<p>That had not changed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t even thinking about living peacefully.</p>
<p>Cale should know that better than anybody.</p>
<p>He was the one who noticed his desire for revenge after all.</p>
<p>However, Cale said that the goal of this battle was to protect something.</p>
<p>‘…Does a bastard like me have the right to protect something?’</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood could not look away from Sheritt and Raon even though there were many thoughts flowing through his mind.</p>
<p>That was why he regretted his past actions even more such that it made it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>Cale must have noticed it somehow, as he heard Cale’s cold voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Don’t think about taking it easy. You also should not think about things going the way you want them to go.”</p>
<p>His gaze turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>“This is an important battle where you must continue to move forward regardless of whether your body is destroyed or not. If you are weak, you will have to fight in a different place without being able to see the White Star’s face. You’ll keep doing that until the war ends.”</p>
<p>The war might end without the Dragon half-blood ever seeing the White Star’s face if he was weak.</p>
<p>He might die in the process as well.</p>
<p>“You can give it a go if you can accept all of that.”</p>
<p>Cale then turned away from the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>“He, hehe.”</p>
<p>He could hear the Dragon half-blood laughing behind him.</p>
<p>“…I’ve seen things.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood stared at Cale, who was saying that he would fight to protect things, with a piercing gaze.</p>
<p>Cale, who was saying that he would protect himself and his people, always fought for his people and others without caring about himself.</p>
<p>He had seen it as Cale’s enemy and again while standing on Cale’s side.</p>
<p>“Now I get it.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood decided to fight like Cale.</p>
<p>He would suppress his guilt and the desire for revenge that he would carry with him forever in order to fight like Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>Even if he died in the process, this was something he needed to do.</p>
<p>“I wish to give it a try.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood continued to look at the person who didn’t even turn around after he said that.</p>
<p>Cale did not turn back toward the Dragon half-blood. He just started to speak to Mary.</p>
<p>“Mary.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim?”</p>
<p>“When do you plan on doing it?”</p>
<p>“I plan on doing it whenever I finish the preparations. It will be within the week.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be too difficult?”</p>
<p>“It’s doable.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and that was the end.</p>
<p>He patted Lock’s shoulder once before stepping out through the open door and into the hallway.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t help but stop after hearing someone thank him.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is any need to thank me for this, Sheritt-nim.”</p>
<p>“I know. I still wanted to say it to you.”</p>
<p>Sheritt had a gentle smile on her face.</p>
<p>Raon was squirming inside her embrace.</p>
<p>Cale responded back in his normal tone.</p>
<p>“Please enjoy your chat. Raon, come back as soon as your chat is over.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly added on after seeing Raon tilt his head in confusion.</p>
<p>“We need to eat.”</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Raon finally started to smile.</p>
<p>“I got it, human! I will find you after I finish my chat with my mom and the Dragon half-blood!”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and walked out.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was standing next to him.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to say with them, Eruhaben-nim?”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason for me to be there.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben peeked toward Cale and nonchalantly made a comment.</p>
<p>“I’m debating helping them with my mana as well.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we ask the other three Dragons as well?”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked confused as his eyes opened wide to look at Cale.</p>
<p>Cale shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it lower the burden on each Dragon and be more effective if there is mana from six Dragons instead of three?”</p>
<p>“That is true.”</p>
<p>“And…”</p>
<p>Eruhaben flinched after making eye contact with Cale.</p>
<p>“You should worry more about yourself than the Dragon half-blood, Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I still have the jar.”</p>
<p>It was cracked, but Cale still had the jar with life force.</p>
<p>That item would be used to extend Eruhaben’s life.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had rejected it, but Cale was planning on making Eruhaben take the life force in the jar no matter what.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>Eruhaben suddenly felt as if his back was getting cold.</p>
<p>“Please drop your guard. The moment you drop your guard will be when your life is extended.”</p>
<p>Cale was the first one to give Eruhaben chills like this during his close to 1,000 years of life.</p>
<p>“…That is an extremely scary threat.”</p>
<p>“It is not a threat. So please, please, drop your guard.”</p>
<p>The way Cale was smiling looked completely identical to Raon.</p>
<p>Although Eruhaben knew that this was touching and a good thing, he felt as if an unknown sense of unluckiness was coming to him in buckets.</p>
<p>He tried to say something but Cale was quicker.</p>
<p>“Are Duke Fredo and Solena here?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yes. They are. We moved them here because we couldn’t continue to leave them in the Henituse territory.”</p>
<p>“Mm. I guess I should go visit.”</p>
<p>“I’ll lead the way. It’s not that far.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben pointed in the opposite direction from where the Dragon half-blood had just been.</p>
<p>“That room is where Duke Fredo is, and Solena is in the room next door. Mary has been looking after them until now.”</p>
<p>“Mary seems to have been quite busy.”</p>
<p>“Mary is the best among us when it comes to dead mana and things related to that attribute.”</p>
<p>Cale followed Eruhaben and arrived at the last room on the other side.</p>
<p>“Duke Fredo did not regain his consciousness even when you left to go to the capital.”</p>
<p>“That is weird. I heard that his recovery rate is very quick.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>Eruhaben turned the door knob and air that was colder than the hallway flowed out of the room.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale could see Duke Fredo lying there with a pale expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Solena has not regained consciousness either. They look fine and have passed the dangerous situations so I’m not sure why they aren’t waking up.”</p>
<p>Cale approached Duke Fredo while listening to Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo was lying on the bed and breathing normally, however, the way he had his eyes closed made it seem as if he would not ever wake up.</p>
<p>Cale started to frown and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Mm. Duke Fredo needs to hurry up and wake up so that we can get information on where the White Star is right no- ugh!”</p>
<p>“Cale!”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“What the hell?!”</p>
<p>Cale almost fell forward because a strong force had pulled at him.</p>
<p>“Cale, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben quickly supported him while Cale looked at the body part he was being pulled by.</p>
<p>It was his wrist.</p>
<p>“…Duke Fredo?”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo, the one who had been lying here as if he was dead, was the one who had grabbed Cale’s wrist.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes looked toward Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>“Oo…ooooooooo…….”</p>
<p>His eyes were still closed as he barely managed to open his mouth to get a single word out.</p>
<p>“…Blood……”</p>
<p>‘Blood?’</p>
<p>As Cale was about to frown…</p>
<p>“…Pa…na…ce…a……”</p>
<p>Panacea blood.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had told Cale about it in the past.</p>
<p>‘Your blood is very good for Vampires. Taste, nutrition, healing properties. It is a panacea.’</p>
<p>Cale started to speak while thinking about that moment.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>

<p>Chapter 636 – The Greatest Inn Overflowing with Hope and Love 3</p>
<p>Cale was frowning so hard that it looked as if he would never stop frowning.</p>
<p>“Cale, Is he asking for your blood right now?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben had a look of disbelief on his face and he looked back and forth at Cale and Eruhaben.</p>
<p>He then slowly asked a question.</p>
<p>“…Your blood… is a… panacea?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Human, no!”</p>
<p>Raon was quickly flying toward Cale with his wings rapidly fluttering.</p>
<p>Sheritt was naturally with him.</p>
<p>Cale had expected them to have a long conversation with the Dragon half-blood, but it seemed to have been short.</p>
<p>“Human! Not your blood! You are weaker than glass! Actually, if I am completely honest, you are weaker than a pastry! You crumble if you are even touched ever so gently! You’ll definitely crumble if your blood is drawn out!”</p>
<p>Cale felt oddly attacked by Raon’s words of concern.</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked at Raon and pointed toward Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>“Then what about Duke Fredo?”</p>
<p>“…We can’t leave him like that either!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes were moving around quickly as he thought for a moment before sticking out his front paw.</p>
<p>“I, I’ll give him my blood!”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Raon at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Who in their right mind would use a little kid’s blood?</p>
<p>It was so unbelievable that Cale could not say anything for a moment.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was also in disbelief while Sheritt was shaking her head with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>That silence seemed to have reached a certain someone differently.</p>
<p>“…N…no……”</p>
<p>Cale turned his head after hearing the extremely weak voice.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo still had his eyes closed as if he was dead, but his mouth was moving.</p>
<p>“…Dragon blood… I don’t want it… reptile blood doesn’t taste good……”</p>
<p>Cale realized it at that moment.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>He looked angry.</p>
<p>“You’re fine, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo kept his eyes closed and mumbled without any changes to his expression.</p>
<p>“…I am not okay……”</p>
<p>Cale looked down at Duke Fredo’s hand that was holding him.</p>
<p>‘Total bullshit. He wouldn’t be able to hold me like this if he wasn’t okay.’</p>
<p>Cale could tell the truth now.</p>
<p>‘This bastard is fine now.’</p>
<p>Smack.</p>
<p>Cale smacked Duke Fredo’s hand away. His hand let go of Cale’s wrist without a fight.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to open your eyes?”</p>
<p>He slowly opened his eyes after hearing Cale’s statement.</p>
<p>“When did you wake up?”</p>
<p>Fredo started to smile. It was quite bright but definitely looked weak.</p>
<p>“Right around when the necromancer left the room earlier. I decided to just quietly wait since she seemed to be in a rush and my son showed up!”</p>
<p>“Haaaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale sighed and shook his head. Raon used that moment to put his paw on Fredo’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Fredo! You can’t have our human’s blood!”</p>
<p>“…I guess not, huh?”</p>
<p>A brief moment of disappointment was visible in Duke Fredo’s eyes as he cheekily responded.</p>
<p>Cale immediately asked after noticing that gaze.</p>
<p>“Why do you need my blood?”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak as if he knew the answer without Fredo having to say anything.</p>
<p>“Are you planning on going to save the Vampires?”</p>
<p>The Vampires and Dark Elves from the Endable Kingdom were currently imprisoned to be used as sacrifices for the White Star’s summoning rituals.</p>
<p>Their safety would be guaranteed until the summoning, but they would be in danger as soon as it was time.</p>
<p>“Yes, I need to go save them.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had to hurry over to rescue the abducted people.</p>
<p>However, although his body looked much better on the outside, his insides were a mess and he could not fight against the White Star in his present condition.</p>
<p>Cale looked down at the pale Duke Fredo before starting to speak.</p>
<p>“Get some rest.”</p>
<p>“I can’t do-”</p>
<p>“I’ll save them all.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Just tell me the details.”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“Tell me where that damn White Star bastard is right now. Oh, and where the citizens of the Endable Kingdom are as well. Just tell me those things. We will take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>A short, laugh-like sigh flowed out of Duke Fredo’s mouth.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>‘…I thought that I needed to run away to Cale Henituse in order to survive.’</p>
<p>He had faith that doing so would keep him alive.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>‘Now he is saying he is going to go rescue the Vampires and Dark Elves without me?’</p>
<p>Had he ever had an ally like this before?</p>
<p>Duke Fredo looked toward Cale with a new look of appreciation as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where the White Star is right now. The White Star was on his way somewhere when Solena ran away with me on her back.”</p>
<p>“…It must have been quite important if he left without making sure to kill you first.”</p>
<p>“Yes. You should know about it as well.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo’s eyes had an odd glow to them.</p>
<p>“The White Star is incomplete right now.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>“The White Star does not have an Earth-attribute ancient power. His plate is currently unbalanced. No matter how sturdy the White Star’s plate is, his body being unbalanced will restrict him from using his full powers.”</p>
<p>Cale knew that the White Star currently had Fire, Wind, Water, and Wood attribute ancient powers, as well as the sky attribute ancient power.</p>
<p>That was why there could be only one thing that the White Star would be rushed to do.</p>
<p>“He probably left to fix his issue before the summoning.”</p>
<p>“Yes. He seemed to be on his way to look for an Earth-attribute ancient power or something that could make up for it. Well, that is just my guess. The White Star could have left for something else as well.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Fredo’s hypothesis was quite trustworthy.</p>
<p>Cale crossed his arms and started to mumble to himself.</p>
<p>There would be two summoning rituals.</p>
<p>Either of them taking place would put both the Eastern and Western continent in a terrible state of chaos. The White Star went to fill the one remaining hole he had in order to rule over that chaos.</p>
<p>“…The fact that he left without any hesitation at a time like this must mean that he already had some sort of clue.”</p>
<p>He might have to consider the fact that the White Star might end up with an Earth-attribute ancient power.</p>
<p>The enemies had time to power up while Cale’s side finished their preparations as well.</p>
<p>“Human! But we now have six Dragons! There are seven if you add the Dragon half-blood!”</p>
<p>“Well, the little kid is right.”</p>
<p>“Goldie gramps! I’m no longer a little kid! Dodori told me I’m not! He said a Dragon my age is not a little kid but a teenager!”</p>
<p>“…Haaaa. He just had to make friends with a Dragon just as weird as him. Haaaaaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale, who had quietly listened to Raon and Eruhaben’s conversation just now, turned toward Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>“Where is it?”</p>
<p>He wanted to know where the Dark Elves and the Vampires from the Endable Kingdom were being held captive.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo closed his eyes for a moment before opening them back and responding.</p>
<p>“…The land of the Cat tribe.”</p>
<p>Raon started to frown.</p>
<p>“It is the place where a few different Cat tribes live together with the Fog Cat Tribe in charge.”</p>
<p>The Fog Cat Tribe.</p>
<p>That was the tribe that called On and Hong ‘mutants’ and forced the siblings to run away.</p>
<p>“There is a large stone mountain at the center of their territory. It is kind of like a citadel. The Cats that are talented in fog and assassination are protecting the place.”</p>
<p>“That stone mountain is where the captives are?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had a serious expression on his face. But he soon flinched and looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“So that’s the case, huh?”</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo couldn’t help but question the extremely wicked smile on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>“Human! You are smiling like a delinquent! Don’t do that!”</p>
<p>Cale ignored Raon and nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“That’s perfect. I planned on causing a ruckus there anyway. This is good. This is very good.”</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes flashed as he continued to mumble that this was very good.</p>
<p>Cale clearly remembered the Cats that always spewed some bullshit every time they saw On and Hong.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo cautiously asked after seeing Cale smiling more and more like a scammer.</p>
<p>“…You plan on causing a ruckus against the Cat tribe?”</p>
<p>Duke Fredo’s eyes were full of anticipation even as he carefully asked. Cale confidently responded, as if to respond to that sense of anticipation.</p>
<p>“Yes. I plan on causing complete chaos.”</p>
<p>Everybody looked at him after hearing what he said next.</p>
<p>This was what Cale had said.</p>
<p>“Looks like we can start with the Cat tribe in our plan to take down the White Star.”</p>
<p>Their plan to take down the White Star.</p>
<p>Cale looked at Fredo, Raon, Eruhaben, and Sheritt. He shrugged his shoulders at everybody who was focused on him.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to wait until the enemies barge in, right? We can always barge in first.”</p>
<p>Cale looked quite at peace as he smiled.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Inside Leeb-An City, a free city located on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>There was an inn here that was always full of people.</p>
<p>The name of that inn was, ‘Hope and Adventure Loving Inn.’</p>
<p>That usually busy inn only had employees there, unlike usual.</p>
<p>A man who used to be a mountain bandit in the nearby Mount Leeb had an apron on as he moved the duster around as usual.</p>
<p>“You shitheads! There’s dust here! There’s dust there! This place is full of dust! Do the cleaning properly!”</p>
<p>He was the former bandit leader.</p>
<p>However, he was now running his index finger on the table and angrily shouting about the dust.</p>
<p>“You punks! Do you want to get beaten up when the Head Chef-nim shows up?!”</p>
<p>“My apologies!”</p>
<p>“M, my apologies, sir!”</p>
<p>The Head Chef.</p>
<p>The former mountain bandits and now employees seemed to be a lot more serious with the cleaning as soon as the Head Chef was mentioned.</p>
<p>The Head Chef was Beacrox Molan.</p>
<p>The former bandit leader touched the back of his head after seeing their reaction instead of smiling.</p>
<p>It was because he felt as if he would sweat bullets.</p>
<p>‘…I have no idea what the hell is going on!’</p>
<p>The true owner of the Hope and Adventure Loving Inn… was Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>Ron Molan and Beacrox Molan were his subordinates.</p>
<p>The two of them were father and son and were responsible for this inn’s operation and cooking.</p>
<p>‘Something is weird. The condition of the Eastern continent does not seem normal.’</p>
<p>Multiple kingdoms around the Eastern continent were moving troops around, making the people who lived here worry.</p>
<p>He didn’t know the details, but he was feeling it was serious because the people from the Molan Household seemed to become busy every time it happened.</p>
<p>It was because he was in charge of Cale’s secret organization here in Leeb-An City.</p>
<p>“Hey, the dust!”</p>
<p>He was in charge of the cleaning as well. He looked up toward the sign.</p>
<p>[ Hope and Adventure Loving Inn No. 1 ]</p>
<p>That was right.</p>
<p>This was the first of many inns.</p>
<p>The vicious father-son duo of the Molan household restored their ‘family’ before opening inns all around the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>Of course, normal people did not know that this inn was being run by the Molan household. They just considered it to be a great business that was extremely helpful and nice to beginner adventurers.</p>
<p>He frowned and started to mumble.</p>
<p>“ ‘…A great business that is nice to beginner adventurers,’ my ass!”</p>
<p>“What about your ass?”</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>He turned into a statue after hearing a benign voice behind him.</p>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>“There’s some dust on your shoulder.”</p>
<p>Ron brushed the man’s shoulder with gloved hands. He then walked past him as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>The former bandit leader realized something after seeing Ron appear.</p>
<p>‘He’s coming!’</p>
<p>Last night… Someone had rented out the entire inn.</p>
<p>Ron must have shown up right now knowing that the person would soon arrive.</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow!”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>Once he heard some cats meowing…</p>
<p>All of the bandit-turned-employees smiled and stood up straight.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>“Welcome, sir!”</p>
<p>“Welcome, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>The door opened and the employees all loudly greeted the person.</p>
<p>Even the former bandit leader greeted the person.</p>
<p>“Welc- ahhhh!”</p>
<p>However, he soon screamed before grabbing his hair with both hands.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>An arrow flew into the inn.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>It crashed into a picture frame and broke it.</p>
<p>“You arrogant little curly-haired punk!”</p>
<p>“Just go and sleep! Go on, junior!”</p>
<p>“Why the hell am I your junior?!”</p>
<p>“You are the last subordinate to join, so you’re the junior!”</p>
<p>“Subordinate? Ha! Then are you his subordinate too?!”</p>
<p>“Nope! I am an esteemed party member of the hero!”</p>
<p>“Ho! “You dumb little curly-haired punk!”</p>
<p>The employees watched as a pink-haired person and a buzz cut person fought against each other and destroyed different things around the inn.</p>
<p>The inn they had worked so hard to clean for the arrival of the owner was turning into a mess.</p>
<p>Two kittens.</p>
<p>A pink curly-haired person and a buzz cut person.</p>
<p>– Human! Is this our team to go barge into the Cat tribe’s territory?</p>
<p>Raon, who was currently invisible.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Finally, there was Ron, who was walking toward Cale as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>The employees blankly stared at Cale’s ‘friends’ before noticing that Cale was about to speak.</p>
<p>Cale picked up the glass of lemonade from Ron before speaking to Rasheel and Dodori.</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
<p>His other hand was pointing outside the inn.</p>
<p>“Fight outside if you’re going to fight.”</p>
<p>Rasheel and Dodori stopped fighting for a moment and looked where Cale was pointing. They then looked back at each other.</p>
<p>They shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>“Fine! Let’s go outside, you curly-haired punk!”</p>
<p>“Hmph. I guess you aren’t scared of my arrow. I’ll make you regret that!”</p>
<p>Rasheel and Dodori immediately walked out of the inn.</p>
<p>– Human! Can I go watch?</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow.”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>The children averaging nine-years-old chased after them with extremely curious expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>Cale took a sip of lemonade.</p>
<p>The bitter taste woke him right up.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, is that the team you are going to take with you?”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“…Yes. This is the team I brought with me, but…”</p>
<p>‘I may have made a mistake.’</p>
<p>Cale did not say that latter part, but Ron gently responded to him.</p>
<p>“They seem to be the greatest combination to destroy things and turn things into a mess.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“That is true.”</p>
<p>Three Dragons and two Cats.</p>
<p>There was also Cale and the Molan household.</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>“Oh! You’re here! I came right on time, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>The last member was Mercenary King Bud.</p>
<p>This was more than enough to cause a ruckus in the Cat tribe’s territory.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Oh dear, Dodori and Rasheel don’t seem to be good influences for the children… what will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 637 – The Greatest Inn Overflowing with Hope and Love 4</p>
<p>“By the way, who are the two people that the Cat children were following?”</p>
<p>The Mercenary King sat down at a table at the center of the room.</p>
<p>“Ahem.”</p>
<p>“Aigoo, there’s some urgent business to take care of in the kitchen!”</p>
<p>The bandit-turned-employees moved far away from the table.</p>
<p>“All of you can head out.”</p>
<p>Ron motioned for them to leave, and the employees quickly ran out.</p>
<p>Cale then started to speak.</p>
<p>“Dragons.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Bud, who had been looking around at the empty hall, looked completely confused. He put his finger in his ear to clear it when Cale said it once more.</p>
<p>“Dragons.”</p>
<p>“…Ah. They’re Dragons.”</p>
<p>Nod nod.</p>
<p>Bud just decided not to think about Cale’s group anymore.</p>
<p>But he still couldn’t accept it!</p>
<p>‘Dragons?! Two of them?! No wait, he already had multiple Dragons with him!’</p>
<p>Bud started to frown.</p>
<p>The door to the rear garden opened, and an employee came in and started to speak to Ron.</p>
<p>“Manager-nim, shall we bring some tea-”</p>
<p>Bud thought about the word, ‘Dragons,’ and commented.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to take down a kingdom on the Eastern continent to set an example or something?”</p>
<p>Clunk.</p>
<p>The bandit-turned-employee’s hand that was holding the doorknob was shaking.</p>
<p>‘What did I just hear? Destroy a kingdom?’</p>
<p>The employee immediately moved after seeing Ron’s benign smile.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>The door was quietly closed.</p>
<p>Cale frowned after hearing Bud’s comment.</p>
<p>“Why would I destroy a kingdom?”</p>
<p>“Well, the team you brought is strong enough to do that. They could probably destroy this Leeb-An City in like five minutes.”</p>
<p>“Cut the crap. Just hand over the information you brought.”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay!”</p>
<p>Bud took a document out of his pocket and handed it to Cale.</p>
<p>“The stone mountain where the Cats live is in the Sez Kingdom.”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe was going to be where Cale started his plan to take down the White Star’s allies.</p>
<p>This starting point to the final battle would be at the stone mountain in the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>“…Mount Nex in the Sez Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Bud responded to Cale’s mumbling.</p>
<p>“It’s a kingdom right next to the Castle of Light.”</p>
<p>It was by the Castle of Light, one of the Three Restricted Areas of the Eastern continent, the white desert where Lord Sheritt’s White Castle had once been located.</p>
<p>That castle was now Raon’s and moved to the Forest of Darkness as a black castle.</p>
<p>Cale read through the information in the document.</p>
<p>[ The Sez Kingdom is currently allied with the Endable Kingdom and is one of the strongest kingdoms on the Eastern continent. ]</p>
<p>[ It is famous for being a kingdom of knights, and the current king Bakehe is famous for being a sword master. ]</p>
<p>Bud continued his explanation.</p>
<p>“Mount Nex is located in the northern part of the Sez Kingdom. It is an area with a stone mountain at the center and the residents rarely go toward it because the terrain is difficult to traverse.”</p>
<p>Cale recalled a conversation he had with Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>‘It is the place where a few different Cat tribes live together with the Fog Cat Tribe in charge. There is a large stone mountain at the center of their territory. It is kind of like a citadel. The Cats that are talented in fog and assassination are protecting the place.’</p>
<p>‘That stone mountain is where the captives are?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Bud added on.</p>
<p>“Even without the terrain issue, the residents wouldn’t be able to go there. The document mentions why.”</p>
<p>Cale looked back toward the document.</p>
<p>[ Mount Nex has been passed down for many generations as a holy mountain based on a tale about the Sez Kingdom’s first king, and people are not allowed to enter without permission. ]</p>
<p>[ The Sez Royal Academy is located right underneath the mountain as well. ]</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Cale scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“The Fog Cat Tribe resides in a mystical mountain that has a tale about the first king? They’re letting the Cats keep the imprisoned sacrifices for the summoning ritual at such a holy mountain?”</p>
<p>Bud responded with a stiff expression to Cale’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes. The place that the citizens of the Sez Kingdom consider to be the holiest is being used for such shit.”</p>
<p>“And the leaders of the kingdom are naturally hiding that fact from the citizens?”</p>
<p>Bud nodded his head.</p>
<p>“It seemed like even most of the nobles of the Sez Kingdom didn’t know that the mountain was being used like that. We subtly asked the nobles and merchants our guild has connections within the kingdom but none of them seemed to have any idea. They didn’t seem to be hiding anything either.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“It sounds like the alliance between the White Star and the Sez Kingdom is not something that started recently.”</p>
<p>Pretty much every kingdom on the Eastern continent had aligned themselves with the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>Cale had first heard about it from Dark Tiger Alberu while he was completing the test as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>‘This situation doesn’t make sense if I think about it that way.’</p>
<p>The Cat tribe has their base on the Sez Kingdom’s holy mountain.</p>
<p>This was impossible without cooperation from the Sez Kingdom’s side.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I don’t know about the other kingdoms, but at least the Sez Kingdom, or at least its king and his loyal subordinates, seem to have made a secret alliance with the White Star a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“It seems to be quite a strong relationship. There’s no way the Sez Kingdom’s side would allow them to imprison sacrificial hostages in a holy mountain if it wasn’t.”</p>
<p>The Sez Kingdom might even have had a longer alliance with the White Star than the Molden Kingdom, which was now Cale’s ally led by Princess Jopis.</p>
<p>The Fog Cat Tribe would have needed a long time to settle there and call other Cats over.</p>
<p>‘Our only allies on the Eastern continent are Princess Jopis and the Molden Kingdom, The Mercenaries Guild, the Molan household, and Leeb-An City.’</p>
<p>Cale’s allies were few in number compared to the size of the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>They were extremely few in number.</p>
<p>Bud cautiously added on.</p>
<p>“It might be possible that it is not just the Sez Kingdom, but that the other kingdoms have had an alliance with the White Star since a long time ago. We are currently gathering information on that aspect.”</p>
<p>Ron, who had been quietly listening, interjected.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim. It will be extremely annoying for us if the other kingdoms have had a deep relationship with the White Star as well.”</p>
<p>The quality of an alliance between members who have just joined together and one whose members have been together for a long time were different.</p>
<p>Bud nodded his head.</p>
<p>“As the patriarch-nim mentioned, it might end up as a war between the Eastern continent and the Western continent if things go terribly wrong.”</p>
<p>That would mean it would become a long war as even if they managed to kick the White Star out of the Western continent, he would still have a foundation on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it was tiring.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Cale tapped on the table with his index finger.</p>
<p>His gaze headed toward the document on top of the table.</p>
<p>“The Sez Academy is the future of the Sez Kingdom.”</p>
<p>The Sez Royal Academy that was located at the bottom of the holy Mount Nex…</p>
<p>[ The Sez Royal Academy is considered one of the top three academies on the Eastern continent. ]</p>
<p>[ It accepts all students age 13 to 18 regardless of their background and students have to go through an extremely difficult admissions exam before completing a five-year curriculum. ]</p>
<p>[ The royals can only be officially accepted as royalty only by graduating from this academy. Numerous individuals from other kingdoms have also graduated from this academy and have their own small society. ]</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>Cale was tapping his finger as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Bud Illis.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“It seems that I will have to do as you said.”</p>
<p>“…What I said? What did I-”</p>
<p>Bud recalled the things he had told Cale today.</p>
<p>He then recalled a specific statement and had to ask.</p>
<p>“…Are you trying to take down a kingdom on the Eastern continent to set an example or something? …Are you talking about that statement?”</p>
<p>Bud’s pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>He could see a smiling Cale.</p>
<p>“Take down? Am I the White Star? I don’t have any plans to do that.”</p>
<p>Bud started to think.</p>
<p>Although Cale was saying that he was not planning on taking down a kingdom…</p>
<p>‘…His face makes it seem like he is planning on doing something similar.’</p>
<p>He could not share that thought out loud.</p>
<p>He just focused on Cale’s mouth that was starting to open.</p>
<p>“We are changing our target to two things.”</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>His palm tapped on the table.</p>
<p>“Our first target is destroying the Cat tribe’s base and rescuing the hostages.”</p>
<p>After that…</p>
<p>“Our second target is destroying the Sez Kingdom’s alliance with the White Star to start a chain of kingdoms on the Eastern continent breaking their alliances with the White Star. We might as well do it since we are headed to the Sez Kingdom anyway.”</p>
<p>That would be the greatest result if things went as Cale planned.</p>
<p>The White Star would end up a target with nowhere to run. Everything would end with the final battle.</p>
<p>Bud started to speak.</p>
<p>“…That’s something you might as well do because you’re headed there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sounds like something we can handle.”</p>
<p>Cale pointed to a portion of the document.</p>
<p>[ The Sez Kingdom celebrates the anniversary of the day the first king came down from the stone mountain. The current king will visit the holy Mount Nex on that day to proclaim that he has carried on the will of the first king. ]</p>
<p>Chhh.</p>
<p>Cale flipped through some pages before pointing at a different spot.</p>
<p>It was the part that explained about the academy.</p>
<p>[ There is a rule that the current king will visit the Sez Royal Academy and give a speech on the day before they visit Mount Nex. ]</p>
<p>Bud gulped and looked at Cale.</p>
<p>He could hear Cale’s calm voice.</p>
<p>“That day just happens to be in four days?”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>“It looks like we can see the king’s face on our way, so we might as well destroy the alliance as well.”</p>
<p>Bud just nodded his head.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Two days later.</p>
<p>Mercenary King Bud Illis made a statement with a grim expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day the Sez king will come to the academy.”</p>
<p>The current king of Sez will visit the academy tomorrow to give a speech.</p>
<p>He would climb Mount Nex the following day to celebrate the anniversary of the first king.</p>
<p>Cale touched the tie of a school uniform he had not worn in a long time and started to speak.</p>
<p>“We will infiltrate the academy tomorrow and grab the king.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the team, who were all wearing the different outfits they were going to be using to infiltrate the academy tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bud was in a different outfit as well.</p>
<p>‘Doesn’t grabbing the king mean that we are going to abduct him?’</p>
<p>He wanted to ask, but held himself back.</p>
<p>He said something else instead.</p>
<p>“It is not just the king. There will be other nobles who visit as well. Two Knights Brigades from the palace will be guarding them. They will also have mages and other guards.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t all.</p>
<p>The soldiers from nearby territories will be gathered together, and the nobles who have territory in the northern part of the Sez Kingdom would all be there as well.</p>
<p>It was a speech directed at the students, but it was quite a large ordeal.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>Bud cautiously shared his thoughts with Cale.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we aim for the day the king heads for Mount Nex instead of tomorrow? That’s a holy place, so he needs to go on his own.”</p>
<p>Cale shook his head.</p>
<p>“A lot of people need to see it.”</p>
<p>“…They need to see us grab the king?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The students, nobles, royals, knights… Even the citizens who were gathered outside the academy hoping to get a glimpse of the king…</p>
<p>Everybody needed to see them.</p>
<p>This need was explained easily.</p>
<p>“The Fog Cat Tribe will be the ones who abduct the king.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward On and Hong while Bud subconsciously gasped.</p>
<p>On nodded her head with a look of determination.</p>
<p>Cale patted her head and looked at the map of the Sez Royal Academy that the Mercenaries Guild had procured.</p>
<p>“We will use the king to rescue the Vampires and the Dark Elves.”</p>
<p>Bud couldn’t help but speak after hearing that they would conduct the abduction and the rescue at the same time.</p>
<p>“…Will all of that be possible?”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>A wicked-looking smile appeared on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“Yes. Of course, it’s possible.”</p>
<p>The plan would probably take all day tomorrow. It might even go into a second day, but they had figured out how they were going to do it.</p>
<p>Cale explained this to everybody, and once his explanation was over…</p>
<p>“Meeting adjourned.”</p>
<p>Cale announced the end of the meeting and looked out the window.</p>
<p>He could see the Sez Royal Academy and Mount Nex behind it through the window of the special suite in the ‘Hope and Adventure Loving Inn No. 7’ that had newly opened in the village with the Sez Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Mount Nex was covered in fog.</p>
<p>“It looks like all of that fog will disappear tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He was holding the golden top’s whip that allowed him to hear the voices of the Wind Elementals in his hand.</p>
<p>The Wind Elementals started to speak.</p>
<p>‘Long time no see! Cale, I missed you!’</p>
<p>‘Chaos, destruction, peace. Don’t worry. We will figure out where the White Star is right now.’</p>
<p>‘That’s right. We will figure out the White Star’s location even if we need to assemble all of the Elementals. We should be able to find out within a week’s time!’</p>
<p>‘…Chaos, destruction, destruction of the White Star. We will definitely get that information. Peace. Love.’</p>
<p>There were a lot of things Cale ‘might as well’ do while he was on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>The Super Rock whispered to him.</p>
<p>– Cale. Are you planning on stopping the White Star from getting another ancient power? …Are you going to take it for yourself?’</p>
<p>‘Of course.’</p>
<p>Cale was planning on taking it for himself if he could find the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>‘Chaos, destruction. The sculptures still seem to be at the Endable Kingdom.’</p>
<p>He was also planning on destroying the sculptures.</p>
<p>Eight unranked monsters… that was too many to handle.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman, who had completed the grand assembly on the Western continent last night, said the following to Cale.</p>
<p>– Dongsaeng. I have no plans on letting that White Star bastard take a single step into the Roan Kingdom’s territory. Everybody has agreed to help me.</p>
<p>Cale had the same thoughts as well.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Sez Royal Academy was extremely busy and full of people today.</p>
<p>It was because today was an important day in the students’ curriculum, the day the king would give a speech.</p>
<p>“…We’re here, nya.”</p>
<p>On had an awkward expression on her face as she touched her school uniform.</p>
<p>On was looking at a young boy who looked exactly like Duke Fredo.</p>
<p>Cale currently looked like young master Naru right now.</p>
<p>He fixed his tie before motioning to On.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The two of them headed out of ‘Hope and Adventure Loving Inn No. 7’ and looked toward the Sez Royal Academy.</p>
<p>The pillars that the White Star had worked so hard to build…</p>
<p>It was now time to take those pillars down one by one.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Aww, On in her school uniform sounds so cute. Cute girl On. Nyaaa~~~</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 638 – The Greatest Inn Overflowing with Hope and Love 5</p>
<p>There was an extremely large plaza in front of the Sez Royal Academy.</p>
<p>In an alleyway just outside that plaza…</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Does it feel weird?”</p>
<p>On touched her hair at Cale’s question.</p>
<p>Cale was here looking like Duke Fredo’s son, young master Naru, while On was in her human form.</p>
<p>However, they both looked different from their usual appearances.</p>
<p>– I used the dye spell really well!</p>
<p>Both of their hairs were as red as the sunset.</p>
<p>“You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>On immediately shook her head at Cale’s question.</p>
<p>“I like it, nya!”</p>
<p>On had subconsciously touched her hair because she liked the fact that it was the same red as Cale’s hair right now.</p>
<p>But it was also true that her mind was a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>The Fog Cat Tribe.</p>
<p>On and Hong were the former tribe leader’s only remaining bloodline.</p>
<p>However, Hong had been On’s only family member for as long as she could remember.</p>
<p>The Fog Cat Tribe only ignored them and kept them under surveillance while calling them mutants and trash.</p>
<p>On had realized that she and Hong were originally the true successors to the leader position because they monitored them despite calling the two of them trash.</p>
<p>She then found an opening to grab Hong and run away.</p>
<p>She thought that doing so would be the only way they could survive.</p>
<p>And now… They were heading over to destroy that Fog Cat Tribe.</p>
<p>‘…Maybe I’ll be able to learn the details.’</p>
<p>She might be able to learn more about herself and her brother.</p>
<p>On frowned.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to think that hard about it.”</p>
<p>On raised her head after hearing a stoic yet gentle voice.</p>
<p>Cale, who was about her height in this appearance, was looking forward.</p>
<p>“I will take care of everything. On, you just do whatever you want to do. Just think about doing that.”</p>
<p>Cale recalled the time he met the leader of the Fog Cat Tribe outside Sheritt’s castle in one of the Three Restricted Areas.</p>
<p>He was recalling the things the leader had said while looking at On and Hong.</p>
<p>‘They are the last of that bloodline, so they must have been persistent. But I didn’t know they were on Cale Henituse’s side. Is that why we didn’t find them?’</p>
<p>‘That dirty blood needs to disappear from the world.’</p>
<p>On had said that the current leader was not her family member.</p>
<p>‘On and Hong probably has the bloodline of the former tribe leader. The current leader must be the one who pushed the former out of the position.’</p>
<p>And most likely…</p>
<p>‘That current leader bastard might have killed On and Hong’s family when he took the position.’</p>
<p>However, he kept On and Hong alive.</p>
<p>That was what Cale could not figure out.</p>
<p>‘Did he keep them alive because they were young?’</p>
<p>The Fog tribe was known for being the stealthiest tribe among the Cats.</p>
<p>Being the stealthiest meant that they were the strongest of the Cats.</p>
<p>Only a select few within the Fog Cat Tribe had special abilities.</p>
<p>‘Like On and Hong.’</p>
<p>Cale reached his hand out and ruffled On’s hair.</p>
<p>“By the way…”</p>
<p>On could see Cale looking at her.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go to an academy?”</p>
<p>On flinched.</p>
<p>– Human! I don’t want to go to an academy! I am already an extremely strong and great and mighty Dragon! I’m just going to have fun with you, human! We’re going to travel the world!</p>
<p>Cale just ignored Raon’s voice as usual.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Dang- dang dang- dang—</p>
<p>The bell on the Sez Royal Academy’s bell tower was ringing.</p>
<p>It was the sign that it was now 10 am.</p>
<p>One hour.</p>
<p>It also signaled that only one hour was left until the king’s speech.</p>
<p>Cale did not have time to hear On’s response.</p>
<p>They needed to start moving.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about the academy later. Well, I’ll let you do whatever you want to do. I don’t care whether that is being a slacker or studying in an academy.”</p>
<p>Cale didn’t think much about it and shared his thoughts before stepping out of the alley.</p>
<p>He then turned around and motioned to On.</p>
<p>“Are you not coming?”</p>
<p>On looked at Cale, who looked like young master Naru right now, before recalling the first time they met Cale when he had given them food.</p>
<p>It was said that a person goes through three times of luck during their lives.</p>
<p>On was certain that the day she met Cale was one of those times for her.</p>
<p>That was the day she had found a family.</p>
<p>On heard Raon’s voice in her head at that moment.</p>
<p>– Fighting! And don’t worry! I’m going to be invisible and following you guys! You won’t get hurt!</p>
<p>On started to smile after hearing her youngest dongsaeng’s bright voice.</p>
<p>She decided to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>She just had to do whatever she wanted to do as Cale had mentioned.</p>
<p>– …Y, you look like the human when you smile like that! Are you planning on scamming someone? Tell me! I want to do it with you!</p>
<p>On’s smile grew wider at Raon’s comments before she walked toward Cale.</p>
<p>The two of them headed for the main gate of the Sez Royal Academy.</p>
<p>The way there was quite loud.</p>
<p>“Please step back! His majesty will only appear at 11 am!”</p>
<p>“Please stay in a single file line! We will kick all of you out if you don’t line up properly!”</p>
<p>People from the academy and the palace were shouting everywhere.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, let me go to the front too!”</p>
<p>“Move, move!”</p>
<p>“Wow. Am I really going to see his majesty today? I’ll even be able to hear his speech?”</p>
<p>“Of course! This is the ideal spot!”</p>
<p>Numerous citizens of the kingdom were gathered at the plaza and forming a human wave.</p>
<p>This could not be helped as well.</p>
<p>“Mommy, his majesty is the strongest in the world, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course~ our kingdom is the land of knights. Our majesty is also a sword master!”</p>
<p>“That’s right! He’s the strongest knight!”</p>
<p>The current king, Bakehe.</p>
<p>He was a sword master in the land of knights.</p>
<p>He was a strong king. That was enough for his popularity to rise significantly, but he had done something else five years ago. He had created a new law as soon as he became king.</p>
<p>‘Create a training center to teach the way of the sword!’</p>
<p>Training centers where anybody could learn the way of the sword were created throughout the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>The palace covered all fees associated with the facilities.</p>
<p>‘A person’s identity or whether they are rich or poor will not matter! Make it so that anybody who wishes to learn will be able to learn!’</p>
<p>‘Send anyone with talent to the Reserve Knights Training Center and give them the support they need to reach their full potential!’</p>
<p>Current king Bakehe opened a path to becoming a knight for everyone and after five years, there were now people popping up who had gone from orphan to knight, a poor peasant to a successful knight, people here and there who had achieved their dreams.</p>
<p>“…That’s why he’s quite popular.”</p>
<p>Cale was smiling while blending in with the crowd of people.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Why is an academy student over here?”</p>
<p>A person who made eye contact with Cale mumbled with confusion.</p>
<p>Cale’s expression instantly changed.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. Excuse me!”</p>
<p>He looked anxious and pretended as if he was trying his best to push his way through the crowd with On.</p>
<p>“One moment, please! We need to get inside! Excuse me, could you please move?!”</p>
<p>Cale’s pleading voice along with the uniform that symbolized his status as an academy student made everyone turn toward the two of them.</p>
<p>A knight in armor was frowning as he walked toward them.</p>
<p>“Over there! The student over there!”</p>
<p>Cale stopped walking.</p>
<p>He was smiling internally.</p>
<p>It would normally require a thorough identity search outside the academy gates to get inside.</p>
<p>‘But they can’t do that right now.’</p>
<p>The extremely popular king made it so that the entire plaza up to this gate was full of people.</p>
<p>It was making it difficult for the academy employees to work.</p>
<p>‘We would normally have to be checked out by an employee.’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that might lead to their ruse being found out.</p>
<p>“Knight-nim!”</p>
<p>Cale grabbed the arm of the Sez Kingdom’s knight who was walking toward them with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>The knight instantly started frowning.</p>
<p>These could be intruders posing as students.</p>
<p>“Why are you two-”</p>
<p>He could not finish speaking.</p>
<p>Plop!</p>
<p>A student ID and a doctor’s note were placed in his hand.</p>
<p>“We came out yesterday because I was sick! We really want to hear today’s speech. Is there any way we can get inside? Please?”</p>
<p>Cale put his hand on On’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“My sister’s dream is to become a knight! She really wanted to see his majesty… But she came out with me so that she could take care of me. Is there any way we can get inside?”</p>
<p>– Human, you’re so good at acting!</p>
<p>The knight still had a stiff expression while looking at this young boy with a look of desperation on his face, but his wariness was starting to subside.</p>
<p>‘…He looks very pale.’</p>
<p>It was because he was looking at a boy who was so pale, something that could not be faked with magic.</p>
<p>‘He looks young as well.’</p>
<p>Although magic could be used to dye hair or change different parts of the body, it could not be used to turn an adult into a child.</p>
<p>‘It is impossible unless there is a Dragon. And if there was a Dragon, it would be here to praise our majesty for his good deeds, not to harm him.’</p>
<p>He still needed to do this job.</p>
<p>King Bakehe was the Sez Kingdom’s greatest knight, but this knight still had to protect his liege.</p>
<p>“Follow me!”</p>
<p>He headed toward the gate with the sick-looking boy and his sister who was behind him.</p>
<p>“Please move back!”</p>
<p>“Back, move back!”</p>
<p>The gate was also extremely chaotic with people and the knight headed for a tent right outside the gate.</p>
<p>“These kids-”</p>
<p>The knight frowned after seeing that there were no employees inside the tent.</p>
<p>They must have all rushed out to organize the chaos.</p>
<p>“…There is a lot more activity than usual this year.’</p>
<p>There were more people than usual trying to push their way forward to see his majesty.</p>
<p>– Human! Bud’s mercenaries are doing a good job!</p>
<p>Those troublemakers were all camouflaged mercenaries.</p>
<p>“Ahem.”</p>
<p>The knight peeked to the side hoping that Cale wouldn’t have heard his mumbling.</p>
<p>Cale put on an anxious but bright smile.</p>
<p>“I think everybody wants to hear his majesty’s speech as close to him as possible like we do. Right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, oppa.”</p>
<p>– Wow! Both of you are so good at acting! Your acting is like the sky while Choi Han’s acting is down on the ground! Choi Han needs to practice!</p>
<p>The knight nodded his head after seeing this pair of siblings who seemed to have a very good relationship with each other.</p>
<p>“Alright, let me confirm a few things.”</p>
<p>He decided to do the check himself instead of waiting for an employee.</p>
<p>The knight headed over to multiple magic devices in the tent.</p>
<p>“We will check your student ID, followed by your aura and mana.”</p>
<p>They normally only used magic devices to check that the student IDs were real.</p>
<p>But they were checking for aura and mana today as well since the king was giving a speech. They wanted to prepare for any potential trouble.</p>
<p>“Put your student ID over here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Cale placed the ID on the magic device.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>It naturally said that it was real.</p>
<p>– Hehe. I slightly twisted the mana in the magic device!</p>
<p>It was thanks to their Dragon buddy Raon who had done something that was not easy to do at all.</p>
<p>They easily passed the mana and aura tests as well.</p>
<p>These two were On and Cale after all.</p>
<p>Both of their powers had nothing to do with aura or mana.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>The knight apologetically smiled at the siblings whose IDs were real and had no powers of any kind.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>His tone of voice was much gentler as he led them far away from the main gate to a small side gate.</p>
<p>He could not open the main gate right now.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Vice Captain-nim? Who are these kids?”</p>
<p>The knights guarding the side gate noticed Cale and On and looked toward the knight who brought them here.</p>
<p>“I checked their identities. Their IDs were real and they didn’t have mana or aura.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Is that so?”</p>
<p>Those devices were made by the Sez Kingdom’s greatest mage.</p>
<p>Nobody would question the magic devices made by a highest-grade Royal Mage.</p>
<p>Only a Dragon would be able to mess with those devices.</p>
<p>And what reason would a Dragon have to mess with a small device that checks a student’s academy ID?</p>
<p>“Alright, head on inside.”</p>
<p>Cale bowed toward the knight.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, knight-nim! I’ll be able to show something great to my sister thanks to your help!”</p>
<p>The knight chuckled after seeing the joy on the young boy’s face. On thanked the knight as well.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, sir. I truly hope I can become a great knight like you, Vice Captain-nim.”</p>
<p>“Ahem, hem! It’s not like I did much. Hurry on inside! There are less than 30 minutes left!”</p>
<p>Cale and On respectfully bowed toward the embarrassed Vice Captain shooing them inside as well as the other knights before quickly starting to move.</p>
<p>“…They really do seem to be students. They’re moving through the extremely complicated pathways of the Sez Royal Academy that are difficult to navigate without a map with no hesitation.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They seem to know exactly where they are going.”</p>
<p>The knights had no way of knowing that Cale had a clear map in his mind.</p>
<p>– Oh! Human, the buildings are all so pretty!</p>
<p>The buildings of the Sez Royal Academy were giving off a vintage feel that showed its long history as Raon mentioned.</p>
<p>However, Cale’s eyes were sharply looking around.</p>
<p>“It’s over there.”</p>
<p>He was walking through the complicated streets with no hesitation until he arrived at the Academy’s plaza that was directly in front of the main gate.</p>
<p>The plaza floor was made of marble.</p>
<p>There was a high platform in the front.</p>
<p>“That is the king’s spot.’</p>
<p>There was an area for the nobles in front of the platform, followed by an area for the chief executives of the academy and then the rows of students.</p>
<p>The whole area was surrounded by knights and soldiers.</p>
<p>‘10 minutes.’</p>
<p>There were only 10 minutes left until the speech now.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Who are you guys?”</p>
<p>The knight in the rear frowned at them and Cale quickly bowed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir! We went to the restroom-”</p>
<p>“Shut it and hurry up and get in line!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>Cale grabbed On’s hand and stood at the back of the row of first-year students as if that had been his original spot.</p>
<p>“Stand in front of me.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>On stood in front of Cale and Cale looked around.</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>– Human! The Dragons have infiltrated with no problem!</p>
<p>Raon’s report continued.</p>
<p>– Grandpa Ron and Beacrox have made it in as well! The Molan household members are all here!</p>
<p>– Bud said that he made it through a dog hole so you don’t need to worry about him!</p>
<p>One, two. As his allies all made their ways inside using their own methods…</p>
<p>Boom- boom- boooooom-</p>
<p>He heard some drums before reverent music filled the plaza.</p>
<p>Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>He could also hear the cheering of the citizens from behind the gate.</p>
<p>Cale turned toward the platform.</p>
<p>A person was slowly walking to the top.</p>
<p>He was a beefy man.</p>
<p>He was someone who had always kept his sword on him and looked after the kingdom in full armor from the moment he became king.</p>
<p>This was the Sez Kingdom’s greatest knight.</p>
<p>The Sez Kingdom’s sword master.</p>
<p>The king who had given opportunities to his people and showed his benevolence.</p>
<p>This was the man known as King Bakehe.</p>
<p>A magical fog slowly started to descend from the holy Mount Nex the moment he became king five years ago and started covering the entire mountain this year.</p>
<p>The citizens of the kingdom cheered that a new legend was starting with their king.</p>
<p>However, Cale had realized something the moment he heard about that.</p>
<p>‘This bastard.’</p>
<p>The king walking up to the platform right now…</p>
<p>‘That bastard allied with the White Star before he even became king.’</p>
<p>He must have handed Mount Nex over to the White Star once he became king.</p>
<p>The White Star would have used the Fog Cat Tribe to slowly turned Mount Nex into a place for him.</p>
<p>‘Once that fog covered the entire mountain today must have been when the Fog Cat Tribe moved over.’</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said that the entire stone mountain was a place to imprison the sacrifices.</p>
<p>Booooom Boom- boom–!</p>
<p>The king finally arrived at the top of the platform and looked down toward the crowd.</p>
<p>The music stopped and everyone bowed to show their respect to the king.</p>
<p>The king started to speak with his voice being amplified through magic amplification devices to spread throughout the academy and the plaza outside.</p>
<p>“Everybody raise your heads.”</p>
<p>Cale raised his head and whispered to On in front of him.</p>
<p>“On. Spread your fog.”</p>
<p>On nodded her head and Cale started to smile with anticipation.</p>
<p>Slowly…</p>
<p>White fog was slowly starting to appear without people noticing.</p>
<p>Once this white fog covered where Cale was standing and the platform…</p>
<p>That is when everything would start.</p>
<p>That time quickly arrived.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What the heck?”</p>
<p>Once the people in the back noticed the fog creeping in…</p>
<p>“Strongly.”</p>
<p>Cale gave the order.</p>
<p>On and Raon answered back.</p>
<p>“That’s easy, nya.”</p>
<p>– I’m getting started too!</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>There was a sudden gust of wind and the fog burst in size before charging forward as if it was going to gobble up the platform with the king.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Wind whirled around Cale’s ankles at that moment and his body followed the fog toward the platform.</p>
<p>His goal was to capture King Bakehe alive.</p>

<p>“Protect his majesty!”</p>
<p>He quickly jumped onto the platform and rushed toward King Bakehe.</p>
<p>Clang.</p>
<p>The king on top of the platform made a move as well. Bakehe, the great knight of the Sez Kingdom, pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>“Do not become anxious! Do not be scared!”</p>
<p>His majestic voice made the anxious students and academy staff subconsciously turn toward the platform.</p>
<p>“…I can’t see!”</p>
<p>“The fog-!”</p>
<p>However, people couldn’t even see the person next to them, let alone their king on top of the platform because of the thick fog.</p>
<p>Everybody could tell that this fog was not a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>Someone had attacked the Sez Royal Academy!</p>
<p>Their goal was most definitely the king!</p>
<p>The citizens outside the academy gates gasped with astonishment while looking at the plaza inside that was white from the fog.</p>
<p>“W, what is that?”</p>
<p>“What kind of fog-”</p>
<p>The citizens at the distance were becoming frantic because they could not understand this sudden development.</p>
<p>Some people started shouting from all around at that moment.</p>
<p>“A, an enemy has attacked the academy!”</p>
<p>“They must be aiming for his majesty!”</p>
<p>“No! We must save his majesty!”</p>
<p>Those words became etched in people’s minds.</p>
<p>“This king is a knight!”</p>
<p>King Bakehe’s voice echoed through the area thanks to a magic amplification device once again.</p>
<p>“I am the Sez Kingdom’s greatest knight! I am a sword master! Just trust in my abilities!”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Numerous people gasped in relief.</p>
<p>‘That’s right, our majesty is a sword master! He is the greatest knight!’</p>
<p>‘The Royal Knights Brigade and the mages are here too.’</p>
<p>‘I, I’m sure it’ll be taken care of soon!’</p>
<p>The citizens and the people stuck inside the fog all started to look relieved. They believed that nobody would be able to take down their king.</p>
<p>A couple of people slowly moved away from the plaza at that moment.</p>
<p>These people who had shouted just a moment earlier that they should save the king were mercenaries of the Mercenaries Guild.</p>
<p>“It’s going to turn into chaos.”</p>
<p>The mercenaries did not dare to imagine what the citizens would do after seeing their king being abducted in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>They heard Bakehe’s shout at that moment.</p>
<p>“Intruders! Hurry up and show yourselves! Don’t aim for our citizens, but come, I am waiting for you right here!”</p>
<p>People could feel his love for his subjects through that shout.</p>
<p>King Bakehe’s aura shot up from his sword inside the fog as well.</p>
<p>Paaaat!</p>
<p>The sky blue aura surrounding the sword was glowing even within the fog.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your majesty! Ugh!”</p>
<p>Bakehe heard the Knight Captain’s groan before it disappeared.</p>
<p>He could not even see his own hand in this thick fog.</p>
<p>Bakehe could tell that the Knight Captain had been ambushed by the enemies based on the groan.</p>
<p>‘…The fact that I don’t even hear him groaning anymore must mean……!’</p>
<p>He couldn’t even hear the faint groans of the Knight Captain who had been the closest to him.</p>
<p>‘…He must be dead.’</p>
<p>King Bakehe bit down on his lips, and his expression stiffened at the enemies’ ruthless ambush.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was something he did not know.</p>
<p>Shhhh. Shhhhh.</p>
<p>Ron, who had been disguised as an academy janitor, caressed Hong’s back once he jumped into Ron’s arms.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain, who was knocked out with sleeping poison, was on the ground in front of them.</p>
<p>The king did not know that the Knight Captain was only hit with a sleeping poison.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff!”</p>
<p>As for the Royal Mage, he was shaking in fear while looking at an arrow that had stopped right in front of his face.</p>
<p>The pink arrow imbued with a significant amount of mana was aiming for the Royal Mage as if it would blow off his head if he made the slightest of movements.</p>
<p>Now that the strongest individuals aside from the king were unable to move…</p>
<p>Bakehe frowned.</p>
<p>‘…Fog?!’</p>
<p>Why was it fog of all things that was here right now?</p>
<p>He didn’t know who the intruders were, but he couldn’t help but think of the Fog Cat Tribe living in Mount Nex behind him.</p>
<p>‘No. There’s no way those bastards are coming after me. We are allied with them.’</p>
<p>Their alliance was based on things that forced them to be together.</p>
<p>It was an alliance that could not be broken because they each had the other’s weakness in their hands.</p>
<p>In that case, what was up with this fog?</p>
<p>He could not see the enemies.</p>
<p>It was just quiet.</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew past him at that moment.</p>
<p>A whirlwind was charging toward him.</p>
<p>“Hmph!”</p>
<p>Bakehe did not hesitate and slashed his sword toward the direction of the wind.</p>
<p>He had already sensed the whirlwind.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The sword clashed with the wind and made a loud noise.</p>
<p>Bakehe lowered his sword with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>“…Is it magic?”</p>
<p>Whether it was the fog or the wind… He could only suspect it was magic because they were both artificial.</p>
<p>“…Shit.”</p>
<p>Numerous black magic arrows suddenly appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Bakehe had no choice but to swing his sword as he swore.</p>
<p>The arrows were coming at him.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baabaabaaaaaang!</p>
<p>His aura-clad sword and the magic arrows continued to strike against each other, causing an endless array of explosions.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The amount of mana in the arrows was almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>Bakehe subconsciously frowned.</p>
<p>Someone appeared in front of him at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Bastard, are you the intruder?”</p>
<p>His words made the person frown.</p>
<p>“Bastard? Did you say baaaaastard? A human king dares to call me a bastard?”</p>
<p>The buzz cut intruder shouted with a vicious expression on his openly shown face and grey mana in his hands.</p>
<p>Bakehe found this to be odd.</p>
<p>‘…Why does he use mana like a fighter? Is the black arrow this bastard’s doing as well?’</p>
<p>He became warier of the enemy in front of him.</p>
<p>He believed that the enemy’s mana was as strong as, if not stronger, than his aura.</p>
<p>He was also relieved.</p>
<p>‘This bastard must be the leader.’</p>
<p>He truly believed that this bastard here was the leader of this attack.</p>
<p>He refused to believe that there were others who were just as strong.</p>
<p>“What an arrogant little human king bastard!”</p>
<p>Rasheel, the buzz cut Dragon, used his mana for magic but also used it like aura around a fighter’s fist.</p>
<p>There was a simple reason for that.</p>
<p>He enjoyed beating things up with his hands more.</p>
<p>Rasheel instantly charged toward Bakehe.</p>
<p>Bakehe took a deep breath and pointed his sword toward the enemy’s powerful attack.</p>
<p>“Human, I will make you kneel, you basta, ahem!”</p>
<p>The charging enemy suddenly flinched.</p>
<p>“…I’ll be quiet.”</p>
<p>He then mumbled in a quiet voice before resuming his charge, looking as if he was even angrier than before.</p>
<p>It was a close-range fight from there.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Aura and mana clashed against each other and sent loud explosions echoing through the area.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Bakehe’s eyes were shaking while feeling this sturdy mana that could not be slashed through with aura.</p>
<p>‘…This fighter’s skill… He’s amazing!’</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rasheel’s fists and kicks left no opening, even when it seemed as if he was throwing them without much thought. How did Rasheel get so good at fighting? Rasheel’s punching was something he developed after three hundred years of fist fights when he got tired of using magic.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>When the fist and sword slammed against each other again…</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>The aura cracked a little.</p>
<p>‘I’m going to lose like this!’</p>
<p>King Bakehe felt a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>He also has a question.</p>
<p>‘There are still people out there other than those individuals on the White Star’s side who could toy around with me like this?’</p>
<p>As his suspicions about the intruder’s true identity were becoming greater…</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow-”</p>
<p>He heard a Cat meow nearby.</p>
<p>King Bakehe flinched after hearing the meow, but quickly steadied his mind.</p>
<p>“…Do you really think that I would lose?! I am the king of the Sez Kingdom!”</p>
<p>Bakehe brought out all of his remaining strength.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>His sword seemed to be wailing after having a significant amount of aura channeled inside it.</p>
<p>The sword art that has been passed down for generations in the Sez Royal Family, the sword that was full of valiant aura created an arc as it struck down on Rasheel.</p>
<p>“Oof!”</p>
<p>Rasheel looked angry as he tried to block the sword with both of his hands.</p>
<p>Bakehe laughed at Rasheel’s reaction.</p>
<p>“Kehehe! Are you scared now?”</p>
<p>Bakehe was about to smile once more after seeing Rasheel trying to stop his valiant sword with both hands instead of charging in to attack.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>However, the results were different from what he had expected.</p>
<p>Grab.</p>
<p>The valiant aura-covered sword had been grabbed by the grey aura-clad fists.</p>
<p>‘Hmm?’</p>
<p>Bakehe heard a quiet noise behind him before he could realize what was going on.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>It was the sound of someone landing on the ground.</p>
<p>As he noticed that stealthy movement…</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He could see a black rope tying him up.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmmmmph!”</p>
<p>He could also see cloth being shoved into his mouth.</p>
<p>His gaze headed down.</p>
<p>‘…A child? No, an academy student?’</p>
<p>A young boy with red hair who seemed to be fifteen years old at max had a twisted smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Let’s drag him away.”</p>
<p>“…I got it.”</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The aura-clad sword was separated from its hilt as if it was a toothpick and left Bakehe’s hand. Rasheel grabbed Bakehe by the back of the collar before Bakehe could do anything.</p>
<p>The fog then started to disappear.</p>
<p>Bakehe shook his head with his mouth gagged.</p>
<p>“No! No!”</p>
<p>The citizens would see his current terrible state. The great king could not show himself looking like this.</p>
<p>Bakehe had long since forgotten about the safety of the citizens.</p>
<p>Well, he had not cared about that for a long time already.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>He was flailing around so much that Rasheel lifted him so that he could see Bakehe’s face.</p>
<p>“Shut up. You damn human king bastard.”</p>
<p>Bakehe stiffened up at that moment.</p>
<p>He could see the long vertical pupils after seeing Rasheel’s eyes up close.</p>
<p>He then started to think about the spells Rasheel used that even the Royal Mage could not use.</p>
<p>Rasheel’s mana and skills were also strong enough to take down a sword master like himself.</p>
<p>There were only a few individuals who could do that, and Bakehe could only think of one other answer besides the White Star.</p>
<p>The person calling him a human bastard was not human.</p>
<p>‘…A Dragon!’</p>
<p>Smile. Rasheel started to smile.</p>
<p>“You finally get it? You finally understand who I am?”</p>
<p>The young boy walked over to Bakehe and made a comment.</p>
<p>“We gathered to prevent you from working with the White Star to create chaos in the world.”</p>
<p>Bakehe recalled how Rasheel couldn’t even talk back to this young boy.</p>
<p>He had acted as if he was addressing a superior.</p>
<p>Who could a Dragon address as a superior?</p>
<p>‘…Another Dragon!’</p>
<p>It would be impossible unless it was another Dragon.</p>
<p>“I heard that the kingdoms on the Eastern continent are working with the White Star to cause chaos on the Western and Eastern continents.”</p>
<p>The young boy gave off a noble demeanor.</p>
<p>He seemed even more Dragon-like than Rasheel and naturally gave off a sense of being a ruler.</p>
<p>“We could not sit back and let you do as you pleased. Did you really think you could survive after pulling this kind of crap?”</p>
<p>The fog was slowly going away.</p>
<p>Bakehe could slowly see people through the fog, but was unable to move his gaze from the young boy.</p>
<p>The young boy came a little closer and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“If you continue your alliance… Your future will only consist of chaos, destruction, and despair.”</p>
<p>The young boy looked toward Rasheel, who added on in a growling voice.</p>
<p>“Human, make sure to heed our warning as we are saying it as the representative of the Dragons.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
<p>‘I’m not a Dragon, so Rasheel needs to say it as the representative of the Dragons.’</p>
<p>However, Bakehe thought that Cale nodding his head looked more majestic and caused him to think.</p>
<p>‘The Dragons are gathering because of what the White Star is trying to do!’</p>
<p>Dragons were too strong.</p>
<p>They were able to easily handle a sword master like Bakehe.</p>
<p>‘And if there are multiple Dragons……?!’</p>
<p>Would he be able to survive?</p>
<p>Should he maintain this alliance?</p>
<p>Bakehe knew of the White Star’s strength, but this pressure he was feeling in person felt even heavier.</p>
<p>Cale spoke once a good amount of fog was gone.</p>
<p>“Then let me show you an example.”</p>
<p>‘…An example?’</p>
<p>Bakehe was confused, but quickly realized what the boy meant.</p>
<p>Mount Nex.</p>
<p>The young boy’s eyes were looking at the mountain.</p>
<p>The boy pulled out a flute and started to play.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii—-</p>
<p>The boy moved quickly after making a sharp noise.</p>
<p>Rasheel grabbed Bakehe by the collar and followed behind him.</p>
<p>“O, over there! His majesty!”</p>
<p>“He’s being abducted!”</p>
<p>People screamed once they could see again.</p>
<p>“The Knight Captain-nim…! Vice Captain-nim, what should we do?!”</p>
<p>“What else?! Immediately chase after those intruders! We must rescue his majesty!”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain knew that he would not be able to do anything against people who captured their king, who was a sword master. However, he needed to rescue the king.</p>
<p>‘He is our savior! Our great king!”</p>
<p>The knights saw him as the most respected king, a great figure who would help their Sez Kingdom develop even more.</p>
<p>“Your highness!”</p>
<p>“My goodness!”</p>
<p>“No, we must rescue his majesty!”</p>
<p>It was shocking to see King Bakehe being dragged away by the enemy once the fog dispersed.</p>
<p>The chaos in the minds of the citizens outside the gates was amplified.</p>
<p>Someone shouted at that moment.</p>
<p>“His majesty is being dragged toward Mount Nex!”</p>
<p>The holy Mount Nex and the benevolent and virtuous king.</p>
<p>The intruders were heading toward the holy mountain that the citizens of the kingdom did not dare to step foot upon.</p>
<p>“We should save him! There aren’t that many enemies!”</p>
<p>There really were only a few enemies.</p>
<p>There were less than ten people who were wearing masks or dressed in the academy’s uniform or employee uniform.</p>
<p>“Yes, we must save him!”</p>
<p>“First, first of all! Let’s stop them!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The people started to run toward the holy mountain that they would not dare to take a step into if it wasn’t for such a situation.</p>
<p>Of course, the knights, soldiers, and mages were already chasing behind the enemies.</p>
<p>They could not allow the enemies to step foot onto Mount Nex.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Once everybody was focused on them…</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow-”</p>
<p>One of the uniform-wearing children turned into a red cat.</p>
<p>This was On, whose fur was dyed red with Raon’s dye spell.</p>
<p>She then cast her fog again.</p>
<p>“…The Cat tribe!”</p>
<p>People realized it immediately.</p>
<p>They noticed that there was a Cat within the intruders’ team.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>King Bakehe was the most shocked of all.</p>
<p>He started to flail and kick after seeing a Cat while he was being dragged to Mount Nex.</p>
<p>‘They know……!’</p>
<p>Bakehe’s mind went blank.</p>
<p>‘These Dragons know that I am in an alliance with the Cat tribe! That’s why they are taking me hostage and headed to Mount Nex…….!’</p>
<p>Bakehe could imagine what was about to happen.</p>
<p>He turned pale, thinking about people finding out what was going on inside Mount Nex.</p>
<p>“So this is Mount Nex.”</p>
<p>The moment Cale took a step onto the bottom of Mount Nex…</p>
<p>Individuals who were just as shocked as the citizens of Sez at this sudden situation could not hide themselves.</p>
<p>Even the stealthy Cat tribe could not react immediately when someone suddenly barged into an area that was supposed to be a secret.</p>
<p>“What the hell-?!”</p>
<p>“Fuck, did you contact the leader?”</p>
<p>“Hide first!”</p>
<p>The Cats seemed to be in chaos.</p>
<p>Cale smiled, looking at the shit-show he had created with chaos to the front and the back.</p>
<p>He then waved toward the Cats.</p>
<p>“We captured the king! Stop the enemies behind us! We will drag the king up!”</p>
<p>Cale was waving as if he was happy to see reinforcements.</p>
<p>He then whispered to the pale Bakehe.</p>
<p>“You’re unsure about what to do because the White Star is strong, right? But you see…”</p>
<p>Cale whispered in a cheery voice.</p>
<p>“We’re even scarier.”</p>
<p>Bakehe’s scared expression turned into a look of sheer terror.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, Cale was just getting started.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>The king thinking Cale is a Dragon is just another misunderstanding for our poor young master who just wants to be a slacker.</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 640 – Are you scared? 2</p>
<p>Overwhelming power was not the only thing that was scary.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a small scheme to take down a plan that had taken years to create was much scarier.</p>
<p>It was also a different story when Cale was the one coming up with that small scheme.</p>
<p>“…Shit!”</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness! Over there on Mount Nex!”</p>
<p>The knights who were in the front of the group trying to rescue the king couldn’t hide their astonishment.</p>
<p>Inside the fog…</p>
<p>There were mysterious enemies inside this holy mountain that enshrined the legend of the first king.</p>
<p>“T, these bastards!”</p>
<p>“How dare they step foot onto Mount Nex and abduct his majesty?!”</p>
<p>This was not just the appearance of an enemy; this was a direct mockery of the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain who was currently leading two brigades of knights peeked toward the still unconscious Knight Captain before raising his voice.</p>
<p>“Contact the palace! Inform them to speed up with the reinforcements!”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain turned toward his king.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>His liege was looking at him with desperation while flailing around to get away.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain understood what his liege was trying to say and ordered the mage holding the video communication device.</p>
<p>“Sound the alarm! This is an attack on our kingdom; this is a declaration of war!”</p>
<p>The bastards who messed with their king and their holy Mount Nex…</p>
<p>He shouted in anger toward the people who abducted the king and the enemies who were slowly becoming visible within the fog.</p>
<p>“We will rip all of you bastards to shreds! Do not look down on our Sez Kingdom, the great land of knights!”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>He and the other knights stomped their feet and drew their swords.</p>
<p>Now that their initial confusion was gone, the courage befitting the land of knights appeared once again.</p>
<p>‘…T, that bastard!’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, King Bakehe was going crazy after seeing what the Vice Captain was doing.</p>
<p>“Why did the Knight Captain and the strongest mage have to faint……?!’</p>
<p>The two of them were the king’s subordinates and knew of his contact with the White Star.</p>
<p>However, both of them were currently unavailable and only the people who did not know about his relationship with the White Star were chasing him to Mount Nex.</p>
<p>‘…If, if what has happened in Mount Nex is revealed……!’</p>
<p>Bakehe knew that that would be the end.</p>
<p>The Cats were having the same thought.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are those bastards?!”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Where is the tribal leader? When will he get here?!”</p>
<p>The Cats who were standing guard at the foot of Mount Nex could not hide their shock.</p>
<p>This was truly total chaos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the bastards who had abducted the king…</p>
<p>“Who the hell are they?!”</p>
<p>“This is driving me nuts!”</p>
<p>The Cats all seemed frustrated while looking at Cale’s group, which had some people with masks and some people without.</p>
<p>Those were quickly charging toward them.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Why are they coming this way?!”</p>
<p>Cale, who was standing in front of this so-called group of ‘bastards,’ opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“We’re heading to the center right away!”</p>
<p>The Cats didn’t know what to do as they watched Cale and the others quickly charging forward.</p>
<p>“Squad leader! Should we attack? Sir? Should we stop them?!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know! We, for now, uhh, we-!”</p>
<p>Cale took a step onto the mountain, the Cat’s territory that didn’t even have a small fence, before the Cats could finish speaking.</p>
<p>“T, those bastards really took his majesty to Mount Nex!”</p>
<p>“We will head to Mount Nex as well! Let’s protect our majesty and our holy ground!”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain and the people of the Sez Kingdom shouted in anger while the squad leader in charge of standing guard here looked at the number of citizens behind the Knights Brigade and the soldiers and had no choice but to shout.</p>
<p>“W, we are your allies! We did not abduct his majesty!”</p>
<p>The people of the Sez Kingdom scoffed at this bullshit and became even angrier.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to insult us even more?!”</p>
<p>“Those bastards deserve to die!”</p>
<p>“We will protect our Sez! We are the citizens of the land of knights!”</p>
<p>The Sez Knights Brigade stepped foot onto Mount Nex and the fog as well.</p>
<p>The squad leader had to make a decision.</p>
<p>“…Fuck! Stop them! We can’t let them get past here! I don’t care what you do, just stop them!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>The Cats disappeared into the fog after hearing the order.</p>
<p>No matter whether it was the knights or anybody else who showed up, the Cats were the strongest in the fog.</p>
<p>“We will chase those bastards! Ring the emergency alarm!”</p>
<p>The squad leader took his strongest subordinates and started chasing after Cale.</p>
<p>There were some eerie noises throughout Mount Nex at that moment.</p>
<p>Screeeech-! Screeeech! Screeeech!</p>
<p>The fog on Mount Nex became thicker as they heard something screeching in pain.</p>
<p>“Damn it! If the fog gets thicker-!”</p>
<p>The citizens in the back stopped moving after getting scared by the thick fog.</p>
<p>They could only stand around Mount Nex and anxiously stomp their feet.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>A large number of old and middle-aged individuals stealthily moved away from that group and into the fog.</p>
<p>They looked completely different as soon as they stepped into the fog.</p>
<p>Their clothes were completely black now.</p>
<p>The oldest man raised his hand.</p>
<p>“You all remember the patriarch-nim’s orders?”</p>
<p>The Cats were not the only ones who were strong in the fog.</p>
<p>The Molan Household was also strong in the fog.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Molan household was strong in the fog, but this was especially true for these people who had the most experience.</p>
<p>These were people who barely managed to survive when the underworld of the Eastern continent was destroyed by the White Star and Arm, and that experience made it so that their stealthiness was something that the youngsters could not match at all.</p>
<p>They were the cream of the crop in the new Molan household.</p>
<p>They were currently dealing more with information and trying to come out into the light, but all of these people had their own assassination skills that were top notch.</p>
<p>They were all taking those skills back out today.</p>
<p>The oldest man started speaking again.</p>
<p>“This situation involves the patriarch-nim’s disciples.”</p>
<p>On and Hong, Ron Molan’s disciples.</p>
<p>Once Ron agreed to teach On and Hong… The people gathered under the Molan banner all knew what was going to happen.</p>
<p>‘Those two children are going to become the Molan household’s future.’</p>
<p>Although it was something that none of the four, Ron, Beacrox, On, and Hong and said or even thought about… The people who chose to serve the Molan household all thought that way.</p>
<p>‘Beacrox-nim learned to use a greatsword and his greatest desire is cooking. He has no interest in stealth either.’</p>
<p>‘These two children are carrying on the patriarch-nim’s secrets.’</p>
<p>‘They are learning everything except assassination.’</p>
<p>That was the reason they had dragged their old bodies here at Ron’s request.</p>
<p>“Our job is to help the children who will lead the Molan household in the future to proudly live under the sun while doing good deeds.”</p>
<p>The old man took a dagger out of his pocket.</p>
<p>The blue dagger had seen so much blood until now.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>They would do as they have always done. Although nobody answered the old man… The core members of the Molan household scattered into the fog.</p>
<p>There was actually one more group of people who had crept into the fog.</p>
<p>“The Vampires have saved our friends in the past!”</p>
<p>It was the Mercenaries Guild.</p>
<p>Although it had only been half of them, Duke Fredo had done everything he could to rescue the Mercenaries Guild’s Ranger Brigade.</p>
<p>The surviving members of that Ranger Brigade…</p>
<p>Bud’s core group of mercenaries entered the mountain as well.</p>
<p>“It is our turn now!”</p>
<p>As Cale stole everybody’s attention…</p>
<p>The powers who would take down the Cat tribe stealthily snuck in while the Cats were worried about the forces from the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
<p>A new legend was starting in the Sez Kingdom as the eerie alarm echoed throughout the mountain.</p>
<p>And at the center of the legend…</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>King Bakehe was continuously groaning.</p>
<p>It hurt like hell being dragged by the collar by Rasheel.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>However, Rasheel smacked the back of Bakehe’s head with his other hand.</p>
<p>“Shut the hell up.”</p>
<p>“…Mm!”</p>
<p>Bakehe could only stop after hearing the Dragon’s warning.</p>
<p>“Get him! The reinforcements will be here soon! Speed up!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>The squad leader was following behind them.</p>
<p>Those Cats with the squad leader were not the only ones.</p>
<p>– Human! Cats are coming from all directions!</p>
<p>Raon was speaking to the red-haired boy who looked like young master Naru. Cale listened to the information Raon was giving him before continuing to move without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Swoooooooosh-</p>
<p>The Sound of the Wind swirled around his ankles and helped him maintain his speed.</p>
<p>“It’s here, nya!”</p>
<p>On was telling him where to go.</p>
<p>On was able to find the path inside the fog created by the Fog Cat Tribe, leading them from the front.</p>
<p>Ron and Beacrox were guarding On from her sides.</p>
<p>Hong was in Ron’s arm as well.</p>
<p>Their goal was the mountain peak.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said the following to Cale when he told Fredo that he would save the Vampires in Fredo’s place.</p>
<p>‘The entrance to the prison with the hostages is located at the top of the stone mountain. That is the only way in and out.’</p>
<p>‘The inside of Mount Nex is completely empty.’</p>
<p>‘It is just a prison that is shaped like an ant cave.’</p>
<p>‘…It is also hell.’</p>
<p>Cale recalled the information Fredo had given him while increasing his speed.</p>
<p>– Cats are approaching from the 3 o’clock direction!</p>
<p>There were Cats chasing him.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t have to worry about them.</p>
<p>“Over there, the intruders, ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Pink arrows were flying and creating large explosions.</p>
<p>The arrows made of pure mana were blocking the Cats’ paths and preventing them from running to Cale.</p>
<p>– Human, Dodori said he will take care of this area! He says not to waste your energy on the peons!</p>
<p>Their other Dragon Dodori was acting as a magic archer and launching endless volleys of arrows to their enemies.</p>
<p>Mila was not here with them.</p>
<p>‘Only Dodori needs to go. I trained him properly so that he wouldn’t lose to anyone.’</p>
<p>Cale had no need to stop thanks to Dodori.</p>
<p>Tatap.</p>
<p>He finally entered the area that only had stones.</p>
<p>That meant that he was now at the middle of the mountain and just needed to go a little more to reach the top.</p>
<p>But to get through that middle area…</p>
<p>“He finally shows his face.”</p>
<p>Someone was in Cale’s way.</p>
<p>It was the Cat tribe’s leader.</p>
<p>This bastard was the current tribe leader of the Fog Cat Tribe and the one Cale had fought outside Sheritt’s Castle of Light in the past.</p>
<p>There were strong-looking Cats standing behind him as well.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>King Bakehe started flailing around while the tribe leader looked at him with a cold gaze before looking elsewhere.</p>
<p>He was looking at On, who was in the front of Cale’s group.</p>
<p>The tribe leader immediately recognized On even though her fur was red with Raon’s magic right now.</p>
<p>On was looking at the tribe leader with a calm gaze as well.</p>
<p>The tribe leader started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I was wondering who it was, but it is just the dirty blood.”</p>
<p>Dirty blood.</p>
<p>The Cats started whispering as soon as they heard those words.</p>
<p>“Those trash who ran away?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Of course, those inferior idiots are causing harm to the Cats in the end!”</p>
<p>“…I remember hearing that the mutants were siding with Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader ignored those whispers and snorted.</p>
<p>“I was wondering who was causing this mess, and it is none other than Cale Henituse’s subordinates.”</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t see Cale Henituse, the tribe leader started smirking after realizing that Cale’s subordinates were involved with this.</p>
<p>On asked at that moment.</p>
<p>“How did you recognize me?”</p>
<p>Her voice was calm.</p>
<p>“You, you! How dare a mutant like you speak so informally to the tribe leader! You arrogant punk!”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t know respect since she hasn’t learned anything!”</p>
<p>On just ignored their taunts.</p>
<p>She had heard much worse things while being kept under watch within the Fog Cat Tribe.</p>
<p>The tribe leader calmly responded to On.</p>
<p>“I can’t forget the dirty color of those eyes.”</p>
<p>On and Hong were the only Cats with gold eyes.</p>
<p>Their eyes were the same as the former tribe leader.</p>
<p>“Haaaa.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>They heard someone sigh.</p>
<p>The red-haired boy whom the tribe leader had not paid any attention to was looking at him.</p>
<p>That boy, Cale, was extremely annoyed after hearing the tribe leader continue to use the word, ‘dirty.’</p>
<p>“Hey, tribe leader. Can you shut the hell up before I rip apart your dirty trap?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>He flinched after seeing the boy’s face.</p>
<p>Although the hair was a different color…</p>
<p>‘…Young master Naru!’</p>
<p>He was the escaped Duke Fredo’s son.</p>
<p>They had all been looking for this bastard.</p>
<p>As the tribe leader’s eyes were starting to heat up…</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>They heard a shaky voice echo through the fog.</p>
<p>“I’m not dirty! My noona is not dirty either!”</p>
<p>Hong was shouting even though he was shaking in fear.</p>
<p>He got out of Ron’s arms, stood next to On, and bared his fangs.</p>
<p>On flinched and raised her front paw to tell him to calm down, but Hong continued to show his anger without stopping.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>The shitty kitty who hid behind his sister because he was scared last time was baring his fangs at him!</p>
<p>The tribe leader laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Kahahahahaha!”</p>
<p>It was just too unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing like that?”</p>
<p>An unexpected individual appeared behind the Cats.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale frowned.</p>
<p>A pale and feeble middle-aged man appeared from within the fog.</p>
<p>‘…It’s Dorph.’</p>
<p>He was Dorph, the Lion King.</p>
<p>They could see other Lions behind Dorph as well.</p>
<p>The Cats were not the only ones here at Mount Nex. That was the reason the Cats’ tribe leader could be calm.</p>
<p>“Let’s kill them right away.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader raised his hand once Dorph said that.</p>
<p>“Let me say something first.”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader looked toward On and Hong.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you the truth before you die.”</p>
<p>He debated telling these shitty kitties the truth.</p>
<p>“Do you know why you guys are dirty and inferior? Aren’t you curious to know why we call you mutants?”</p>
<p>On and Hong flinched.</p>
<p>They could remember being called mutants, dirty, and inferior for as long as they could remember.</p>
<p>“You two…”</p>
<p>On watched the tribe leader’s mouth open, thinking that she shouldn’t listen to what he was about to say for some reason.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>Her heart was beating wildly with an ominous feeling.</p>
<p>The tribe leader looked directly at her and smiled.</p>
<p>He then said the following.</p>
<p>“You guys will never be able to go berserk.”</p>
<p>Beast people who could not go berserk.</p>
<p>Ron, Beacrox, and everybody else flinched.</p>
<p>However, On and Hong were the most shocked.</p>
<p>“That was the reason your father was pushed out of the tribe leader position.”</p>
<p>One step.</p>
<p>The tribe leader took a step toward On and Hong.</p>
<p>“Beast people earn the true power of the Beast when they go berserk. But for you two, what you have right now is your limit.”</p>
<p>He took another step.</p>
<p>The tribe leader was getting closer to them.</p>
<p>“You two received your daddy-o’s inferior blood.”</p>
<p>The current tribe leader’s crazed eyes glared at On and Hong as he recalled the past tribe leader.</p>
<p>He took another step.</p>
<p>“Half Beast people who can’t even go berserk. Can such failures truly be called Beast people?”</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s large shadow was heading toward On and Hong.</p>
<p>“…Oo……”</p>
<p>Hong subconsciously started moving back.</p>
<p>‘Beast people who can’t go berserk?’</p>
<p>Hong recalled something he had said to the Mogoru Empire’s Sir Rex in the past.</p>
<p>Sir Rex…</p>
<p>He was the new leader of the Mogoru alongside the Sun God twins thanks to Cale’s help.</p>
<p>He was a Cat and an adult but had never gone berserk before.</p>
<p>What had Hong said to him when they first met?</p>
<p>‘He’s an older hyung, but he’s a baby because he hasn’t gone through his first berserk transformation!’</p>
<p>‘That’s right! They said all Cats are babies until we go through our first berserk transformation! He’s the same as us!’</p>
<p>But Rex had not gone berserk because he did not know anything about the Cat tribe.</p>
<p>However, On and Hong were different from Rex.</p>
<p>‘…We can never go berserk? Our blood makes it impossible? Then we really, we really… We really are mutants.’</p>
<p>Hong had no choice but to step back.</p>
<p>But in that instant Hong’s back paw was about to move back…</p>
<p>“What a load of bullshit.”</p>
<p>A brusque voice responded with disbelief.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Hong felt someone pick him up.</p>
<p>Hong could feel a rough but warm hand patting his back as he was being hugged in a person’s warm embrace.</p>
<p>On turned her head and looked at Cale instead of the tribe leader.</p>
<p>Cale was leaning on one leg and patting Hong as he shouted.</p>
<p>“Inferior my ass. There’s nothing like that. I don’t get why you keep saying nonsense with that dirty trap of yours.”</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Black mana swirled around them, and Raon appeared right next to On.</p>
<p>Raon shouted with an extremely angry expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Do you want to die? My, my-”</p>
<p>Raon hesitated for a moment before looking at On and Hong and then glaring at the tribe leader as he continued.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you mess with my noona and my hyung. I will destroy everything.”</p>
<p>His voice was calm but full of anger.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>He then moved to stand in front of On.</p>
<p>On and Hong could see Cale nodding his head.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Cale’s calm voice echoed through the area.</p>
<p>“We need to destroy everyone who messes with our kids.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Hmm… On and Hong can’t go berserk? I wonder why that is the case.</p>
<p>And Cale is such a good daddy now!</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 641 – Are you scared? 3</p>
<p>“…You bastard, are you……?”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader and Lion king Dorph. The two of their eyes clouded over for a moment.</p>
<p>This bastard they were looking at definitely seemed to be young master Naru with dyed hair. However, the way he was protecting On and Hong and this black Dragon that appeared…</p>
<p>That black Dragon only followed one human.</p>
<p>Lion king Dorph opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Are you Cale-”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>Rustle!</p>
<p>The leaves shook and a Cat who had been hidden by the shadow of the forest quickly charged toward On.</p>
<p>“…The shame of the Fog Cat Tribe!”</p>
<p>A Cat was trying to assassinate On.</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes opened wide. This sneak attack had been so stealthy that even Raon had not noticed it.</p>
<p>Raon watched as the Cat’s dagger twisted toward On’s neck.</p>
<p>“No-!”</p>
<p>As Raon was about to cast a spell…</p>
<p>“Grrrrrr!”</p>
<p>On twisted her body as soon as she noticed the movement. She focused on the dagger aiming for her neck.</p>
<p>On’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to dodge.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>On heard a gentle voice before the Cat fell to the ground with a hole in his neck.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>There was a sharp dagger in the fallen Cat’s neck. On and Hong watched as Ron Molan pulled the dagger out.</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader growled.</p>
<p>“…You somehow noticed that sneak attack.”</p>
<p>Ron had a benign smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Such crude sneak attacks won’t work on someone my age.”</p>
<p>Cale started to think at that moment.</p>
<p>‘He truly is a scary old man……!’</p>
<p>It was not crude at all! Even Cale had been shocked and was about to activate his Indestructible Shield. Ron was calling such a stealthy attack ‘crude’ and pierced the attacker’s neck! Ron truly was the scariest of all people around Cale.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of things here.”</p>
<p>Although Ron was smiling more benignly than ever…</p>
<p>“Hahaha, hahaha!”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader laughed out loud as soon as he heard that.</p>
<p>“You think a mere patriarch of the Molan household can handle us Cats?”</p>
<p>The tribe leader truly found this to be funny.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Sez Kingdom fearlessly trying to fight them in the fog at the bottom of the mountain seemed quite stupid. This patriarch of the Molan household seemed quite stupid as well.</p>
<p>Inside the forest and the fog…</p>
<p>This was a terrain where they had a complete advantage.</p>
<p>That was why the other Cats were laughing as well. What Ron had said was just too funny.</p>
<p>The tribe leader barely managed to stop laughing as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“On. Hong.”</p>
<p>On and Hong flinched after hearing the tribe leader say their names for the first time. The tribe leader had a gentle gaze as he continued speaking.</p>
<p>“I was your father’s distant cousin, but our families are so removed that we are pretty much not related.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader felt the need to teach these fools about reality.</p>
<p>“Your father… The former tribe leader was talented but very weak because he could not go berserk. On the other hand, I was strong. The former tribe leader was born weak and I felt the need to change the Cat tribe that was being led by a weakling. It was for the pride of the Fog Cat Tribe as the strongest of the Cats.”</p>
<p>On and Hong’s pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>The tribe leader enjoyed their reaction as if he was having a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Lion king Dorph held back a sneer as he watched the tribe leader.</p>
<p>‘Funny bastard. He only initiated a rebellion after aligning with our liege.’</p>
<p>The former tribe leader had declined the White Star’s offer.</p>
<p>‘Although the Cats are stealthy and hide in the shadows, we do not wish to lead the world into chaos. I plan on taking the Fog Cat Tribe and the rest of the Cats from the shadows and into the light. That is why I must decline such an offer!’</p>
<p>The White Star had sent Dorph to approach the current tribe leader after being completely shut down by the former tribe leader.</p>
<p>The current tribe leader aligned with them when they told him that they would make him the leader and received a significant amount of wealth to lure the chief executives of the Cat tribes who were upset with the tribe leader’s decision not to accept any more assassination requests.</p>
<p>They then claimed that the tribe leader was inferior as he could not go berserk and killed the former tribe leader, his family, and anybody who was loyal to him.</p>
<p>‘The former tribe leader was the one who had the right idea considering the future of the Cats, but the bastard who killed that tribe leader to take his position is talking about pride.’</p>
<p>Dorph found this to be hilarious.</p>
<p>However, he did not show it on his face as he continued listening to the tribe leader.</p>
<p>“There was nobody who chose to follow the former tribe leader who destroyed the pride of the Fog Cat Tribe and everybody told me to get rid of anyone who shared his blood. However, I kept the two of you alive.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader started smiling.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>‘Why had he kept them alive?’</p>
<p>On and Hong could only listen.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show everyone the shame of the Cats that should never be repeated. You guys were examples.”</p>
<p>Examples that the rest of them could not become inferior Cats who could not even go berserk.</p>
<p>He had kept On and Hong alive to warn the others that they had no need for weaklings.</p>
<p>“You guys ended up escaping. And…”</p>
<p>The tribe leader turned toward Ron.</p>
<p>“You guys stuck to a human bastard with no abilities. You stuck to someone who cannot go berserk.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader asked Ron a question.</p>
<p>“Hey bastard, do you really think that you can take on the Cats?”</p>
<p>If it wasn’t Cale Henituse or his usual group that was with him… The tribe leader was confident that the Cats were the greatest assassins in the world.</p>
<p>Ron still had a gentle smile on his face.</p>
<p>“You ask whether I can take on the Cats?”</p>
<p>He wiped the blood off his dagger as he responded.</p>
<p>“That’s easy.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The moment the tribe leader frowned… Ron’s smiled changed. The benign smile disappeared and was replaced with a cold smile.</p>
<p>“Plus, I have no intentions of fighting alone.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>There were small groans and some Cats who had been hidden within the shadows of the forest fell to the ground.</p>
<p>They were all ones who were hiding to the east side.</p>
<p>“What the……?!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader finally realized that someone had snuck into this battle. These people had snuck in without the Cats finding out.</p>
<p>“Come on out.”</p>
<p>People appeared from the shadow of the forest and the fog without making even the slightest of noises at Ron’s order.</p>
<p>They were so stealthy that nobody would have known that they were there if they didn’t show themselves.</p>
<p>They were all people from the Molan household. They held bloody daggers in their hands and looked toward Ron, On, and Hong with stoic expressions. They were positioned as if they were protecting the three of them as well as Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>He had gotten the chills when enemies had appeared without his knowledge, but he quickly realized there was no need to be afraid.</p>
<p>“The people you brought are all either old or look like they haven’t eaten in months.”</p>
<p>The people who appeared were all old or middle-aged.</p>
<p>The middle-aged individuals were either extremely skinny as if they had not eaten in a while or had injuries on them.</p>
<p>“I guess we were too relaxed and had our guards down. Cats were taken by such a group of fools.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader believed that he had not noticed this group of old assassin because he was focused on Ron and Cale’s group.</p>
<p>He believed that the Cats who died had also put their guards down.</p>
<p>“You really think that that is the case?”</p>
<p>As Ron smiled and asked back…</p>
<p>“…What the hell are you talking about?”</p>
<p>The tribe leader felt the forest shaking as soon as he said that.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He heard screams all around him.</p>
<p>An old man next to Ron threw something at that moment.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>It was a dagger.</p>
<p>This dagger had the crest of the Fog Cat Tribe on it. The dagger that the Cats should always be carrying with them fell to the ground without any blood on it.</p>
<p>This symbolized that the owner of this weapon was either dead or immobilized.</p>
<p>There was more than one dagger.</p>
<p>Clang. Tang, tang!</p>
<p>The people standing next to Ron all dropped the Cats’ daggers to the ground. These daggers had the Fog Cat Tribe’s crest, as well as the crests of the Cat tribes who had chosen to serve this tribe leader.</p>
<p>“…You, you!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader and the other Cats looked shocked, anxious, and embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The screams they continued to hear were all the screams of Cats. They finally figured it out.</p>
<p>Ron moved in front of Cale who was holding On and Hong.</p>
<p>“We were destroyed because we were weaker than Arm and had to escape.”</p>
<p>His benign voice reached On and Hong’s ears.</p>
<p>“And we survived.”</p>
<p>The members of the Molan household currently on Mount Nex were all people about Ron’s age.</p>
<p>They were in his generation or in the generations just above or below him, which meant that they were all people who barely managed to escape when the White Star used Arm to scorch the Eastern continent’s underworld.</p>
<p>They had all gathered under the banner of the newly reestablished Molan household.</p>
<p>“We had to go through numerous situations of life and death and had to escape and hide from those stronger than me and stronger than us together. But we survived.”</p>
<p>Ron looked at On and Hong.</p>
<p>On and Hong saw a warm gaze even though he had a cold expression on his face. They could see the firm determination in his eyes.</p>
<p>Ron continued speaking once he made eye contact with them.</p>
<p>“Yes, we survived in the end.”</p>
<p>They had survived and now planned to change the Molan household for the future.</p>
<p>“For those who believe that they were born strong… It is something that those who are drunk on that power could never understand. They will never understand how people like us grow stronger.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Ron’s mouth curled up.</p>
<p>“You two also have the power to grow like we did.”</p>
<p>On and Hong were young but had escaped the Fog Cat Tribe to survive.</p>
<p>And in the end, they did survive.</p>
<p>On and Hong were the same as Ron and the people of the Molan Household. Although the time and place were different, they went through the same ordeals. They all continued to run even when they felt as if they would die of suffocation because they couldn’t breathe. They continued to run without getting any rest and hid themselves in the grass, the dirt, and even trash and feces to survive. They had been through it all.</p>
<p>Pat. Pat.</p>
<p>Cale could feel Hong’s front paw patting his arm. He lowered his head and saw Hong nodding at him before jumping out of his arm.</p>
<p>He then stood next to Ron along with On.</p>
<p>On and Hong had figured out where they truly belonged.</p>
<p>The Fog Cat Tribe was not it.</p>
<p>They belonged here with Cale, their dongsaeng Dragon, Ron, and their friends. No, they belonged here with their family. This was their place and the thing they needed to protect.</p>
<p>The siblings could feel it with their hearts.</p>
<p>On and Hong looked at each other, nodded their heads, and spoke to Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>“We will take care of things here, nya.”</p>
<p>“Dongsaeng! You can leave it to us and go, nya!”</p>
<p>Cale asked while looking at the siblings’ firm gazes.</p>
<p>“And if it gets dangerous?”</p>
<p>“Run!”</p>
<p>“We have to run, nya! And then smack them back later!”</p>
<p>Beacrox, who had infiltrated the academy as a chef, took off his mask and made a comment.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there will be any danger at all, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>“That is true.”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader and Lion king Dorph frowned after hearing Cale’s group look down on them. Cale didn’t even give them a glance as he addressed Raon.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“I got it, human!”</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>King Bakehe floated up into the air and had his collar grabbed by Raon’s front paw.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Whirlwinds gathered at Cale’s ankles as he kicked off the ground.</p>
<p>“Do you really think we will let you go?!”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader charged toward him but Ron got in his way.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>Dagger clashed against dagger.</p>
<p>“You bastard……!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader retreated backward to dodge Ron’s dagger. Lion king Dorph shouted at that moment.</p>
<p>“Stop Cale Henituse! Rescue king Bakehe!”</p>
<p>The Lions who were next to him started to move.</p>
<p>There were approximately fifty of them. This was not all of the Lions but they were Dorph’s core warriors.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Beacrox stepped in front of the Lions. There was also a masked man dressed as a janitor. This masked man was Bud.</p>
<p>“Ha! Just two of you are going to stop us?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s the Mercenary King. Does he think that being a sword master is enough?”</p>
<p>The Lion warriors frowned and charged toward them without any hesitation.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Leader-nim!”</p>
<p>“We’re here!”</p>
<p>Numerous people appeared from the forest.</p>
<p>These were the Mercenaries Guild’s core members, the Ranger Brigade.</p>
<p>Two to three hundred people covered in blood appeared.</p>
<p>The Cats and Lions realized that there were no more screams coming from the forest anymore.</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>There was a small groan and another Cat fell to the ground. The person who had taken the Cat down was nowhere to be found. They had long since silently hidden themselves once again.</p>
<p>The Cats and Lions figured something else out at that moment.</p>
<p>‘…We wouldn’t have heard their groans if the Molans were the ones to kill them!’</p>
<p>‘It must have been a d, different faction.’</p>
<p>Then there was only one answer.</p>
<p>“…You bastards……!”</p>
<p>“Yes, we killed them.”</p>
<p>A Ranger Brigade member had a twisted smile on his face as he responded.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Ranger Brigade members surrounded the fifty or so Lions.</p>
<p>And in the front of the group was…</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Beacrox, who slammed his greatsword down with a loud noise.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>And Bud, the Mercenary King, who had his blue aura.</p>
<p>Beacrox and Bud… The two of them seemed to be the gatekeepers of the path Cale had taken to head to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>“Nobody will be able to get past us.”</p>
<p>“What bullshit!”</p>
<p>The Lion warriors sneered at him.</p>
<p>It was because Lion king Dorph was here. He was one of the White Star’s two strongest subordinates.</p>
<p>Their king would solve all of their problems!</p>
<p>“My liege-”</p>
<p>However, the warriors had to flinch after turning to look at Dorph.</p>
<p>Lion king Dorph…</p>
<p>There was a buzz-cut man standing in front of Dorph looking like a thug.</p>
<p>That man asked in a delinquent tone.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you that bastard who fucking ate a Darkness Elemental and can use its powers now?”</p>
<p>Dorph did not look good.</p>
<p>“…You’re a Dragon.”</p>
<p>The buzz-cut Dragon Rasheel licked his lips as he stood in front of Dorph.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the mountain…</p>
<p>“Maintain your formations and march forward! We must rescue his majesty!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The Sez Knights Brigade could be heard marching up the mountain.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Cale’s friends… The Mercenaries Guild and the Molan household… And now the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader frowned and shouted.</p>
<p>“Attack! Kill them all now!”</p>
<p>His body quickly reacted and he grabbed two daggers.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>There were two loud noises. The tribe leader could see Ron looking at him with a cold smile.</p>
<p>“I guess you’ll be the first bastard to die.”</p>
<p>“Meeeeeow.”</p>
<p>“Meeow!”</p>
<p>On and Hong meowed along with Ron’s comment.</p>
<p>Fog and poison mixed behind Ron and started to grow in size.</p>
<p>Inside Mount Nex that was covered by the Fog Cat Tribe’s fog…</p>
<p>A completely different red fog started to grow and increase its territory.</p>
<p>In the far future… This red fog would appear every so often in the Forest of Darkness and be the symbol of the new Molan household that would proudly appear in front of the world.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Human, we’re almost at the top of the mountain!”</p>
<p>The top of this stone mountain…</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes looked up at the large stones that were shooting up to the sky in this area that didn’t have anything other than rocks.</p>
<p>There was a large hole at the top.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>The flailing Bakehe was being held by someone else other than Raon.</p>
<p>“There are only rocks!”</p>
<p>It was the pink afro Dragon, Dodori.</p>
<p>Dodori’s attribute was boulder.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“We will destroy the prison as soon as we rescue the hostages.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>Some people responded to Cale.</p>
<p>These were members of the Mercenaries Guild’s Ranger Brigade.</p>
<p>The Vampire, Duke Fredo, had saved approximately 500 Ranger Brigade members in the past.</p>
<p>Half of them were at the center of the mountain fighting with the Lion tribe while the rest had followed Cale to the top of this stone mountain.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>That’s a sad history of how the current Cat tribe leader killed On and Hong’s daddy. Sniff sniff.</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 642 – Are you scared? 4</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were obstacles on their way to the peak.</p>
<p>“Stop those bastards!”</p>
<p>“We must protect this area at all costs!”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader and Lion king Dorph… Although their respective core members had gone with them to the center of the mountain, there were still a large number of strong individuals guarding the mountain top.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“Charge at them!”</p>
<p>Cale bluntly commented after listening to the shouts of the ones leading the Cats and Lions.</p>
<p>“I don’t have time to deal with shitty louts.” (TL: I’m sorry I just had to do it)</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked toward Dodori.</p>
<p>“Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Cale hesitated for a moment. It was extremely awkward to say what he was going to say. But he needed to say it in order to quickly take care of these chumps.</p>
<p>“My, ahem. Do you remember the battle at the Gorge of Death you read in the book about me?”</p>
<p>“Of course! I remember it very well!”</p>
<p>Cale smiled gently at Dodori, who was vigorously nodding his head and pointed to the enemies in front of them.</p>
<p>“Please do it just as I did it. You are going to recreate what I did with your own hands, Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“…R, really?”</p>
<p>Dodori’s pupils were shaking.</p>
<p>They were not shaking in fear, but in excitement. Dodori could see his hoobae Dragon clenching his paws together and shouting loudly.</p>
<p>“Dodori! You can do it! Boulder is great and mighty! I’ll hold on to our king hostage for now!”</p>
<p>Dodori’s eyes lit up with a fiery passion.</p>
<p>The battle at the Gorge of Death…</p>
<p>That story, along with the Plaza Terror incident where Cale first made his name in the Roan Kingdom as Young Master Silver Shield, was a staple that was in all books about the great Young Master Silver Shield.</p>
<p>He had been so excited after reading that story the first time!</p>
<p>‘I’m going to do that myself?’</p>
<p>It seemed as if hot steam was coming out of Dodori’s nose.</p>
<p>He looked toward Cale and responded.</p>
<p>“Just trust me! I am part of the hero’s party! I will prove my worth!”</p>
<p>Cale hid his look of disgust as he gave Dodori some words of encouragement.</p>
<p>“I have faith. You will definitely prove it!”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>Dodori stomped his feet.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The entire stone mountain seemed to shake. Dodori was able to do this with a single stomp because it was a stone mountain.</p>
<p>He charged forward like an arrow that had been released from a bow.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is that?!”</p>
<p>“Is it an archer? Why is an archer charging forward!?”</p>
<p>The enemies frowned while looking at Dodori, who was charging forward without any fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>Even the Mercenaries Guild’s Ranger Brigade members who didn’t know Dodori’s true identity seemed concerned.</p>
<p>Dodori looked young and seemed to be a long-distance dealer.</p>
<p>“Umm, Commander-nim-”</p>
<p>“Just have faith.”</p>
<p>The man who was now a former commander but forever a commander in many people’s hearts was smiling.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the Battle at the Gorge of Death?”</p>
<p>Cale was talking to a Ranger Brigade member from the Eastern continent, but every single member of the Mercenaries Guild had heard about that famous great battle on the Western continent.</p>
<p>“…The enemy that attacked with the light attribute-”</p>
<p>How had Cale gone up against that enemy?</p>
<p>How did Cale defeat that enemy?</p>
<p>He knew the answer.</p>
<p>“…With a stone spear-”</p>
<p>A stone spear.</p>
<p>Stone.</p>
<p>Boulder.</p>
<p>As the Ranger Brigade member’s eyes opened wide as he thought of those words… They could all feel the ground shake. To be more specific, they could feel the boulders they were standing on start to move.</p>
<p>As the Rangers turned toward Dodori…</p>
<p>“I will go first!”</p>
<p>“I will go as well!”</p>
<p>One of the Lion warriors and a Cat frowned at the shaking before moving forward to attack Dodori together.</p>
<p>But as they pointed their weapons and took another step toward Dodori, they could see that Dodori was smiling with joy.</p>
<p>“I truly made the right decision.”</p>
<p>As Dodori mumbled out loud… The two enemies charging forward as well as more enemies standing behind them ready to follow up all felt their bodies tilt.</p>
<p>Booboboboooooooooom-</p>
<p>Boulders shot up into the air.</p>
<p>Approximately two hundred large boulders were floating in the air.</p>
<p>Before the enemies could even register what was going on…</p>
<p>“…Shit……!”</p>
<p>“Look down!”</p>
<p>The enemies could see a pink light surrounding the entire mountain top.</p>
<p>The boulders were all glowing pink. They were so pretty that people might mistake them for things that might appear in a fairytale, but this was actually the sign of death for them.</p>
<p>Their enemy smiled and said the following.</p>
<p>“Don’t get in our way.”</p>
<p>The boulders shot down toward the Lions and Cats as if they were meteorites.</p>
<p>“They’re just stupid boulders!”</p>
<p>One of the Lions went berserk and tried to punch a pink boulder. His body was more than strong enough to destroy a boulder.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>The fist and boulder crashed into each other.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>The Lion grabbed his hand with his other hand and lowered his head. All of his fingers were broken.</p>
<p>“Holy shit…! Why the fuck are boulders so sturdy-?!!”</p>
<p>He couldn’t continue to look at his injured hand. Although his hand was broken, the boulder that didn’t even have a scratch on it still struck him.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“Run! Dodge those boulders!”</p>
<p>“These are not ordinary boulders! Retreat! Retreat now!”</p>
<p>There were screams, groans, and shouts telling people to retreat.</p>
<p>The enemies in Cale’s way were all pushed aside thanks to the boulders.</p>
<p>“…Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Cale quickly passed through the path Dodori had made for him and was able to reach the zenith without using much energy.</p>
<p>The Super Rock whispered to him.</p>
<p>– Cale. Those boulders… They became 50 times stronger once they turned pink.</p>
<p>The Super Rock’s voice was shaking.</p>
<p>– …Those aren’t boulders… They are a new kind of weapon.</p>
<p>Cale agreed with the assessment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dodori seemed disappointed as he returned to Cale’s side.</p>
<p>“…How disappointing… I’m still lacking in control and range… I couldn’t even create a stone spear…….”</p>
<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>The boulders Dodori had thrown against the enemies were not stone spears like Cale had made at the Gorge of Death. They were just large boulders.</p>
<p>He also lacked the control to accurately aim for the enemies, and he could only use the boulders in a small area of the mountaintop.</p>
<p>“You are amazing, Dodori-nim.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>Dodori, who was disappointed that he could not recreate the scene from the Great Battle of the Gorge of Death, turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>Cale was looking at the enemies who were trying to dodge the boulders as he quickly rushed past. But his words were definitely directed toward Dodori.</p>
<p>“You created a path for us without any of our allies getting hurt. You were the reason that nobody got hurt. Your attribute is amazing as well.”</p>
<p>‘They’re such sturdy boulders!’</p>
<p>Cale could not even fathom what he and Dodori could create if they worked together.</p>
<p>‘…I just need to pummel anything I don’t like.’</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile. Dodori smiled brightly without knowing what Cale was thinking about.</p>
<p>‘…He said none of the allies got hurt!’</p>
<p>Dodori liked those words very much for some reason.</p>
<p>“You’re amazing! Dodori, you rock!”</p>
<p>Dodori’s steps felt extremely light once Raon praised him as well.</p>
<p>“This is nothing! Someone in the hero’s party should be able to at least do this much!”</p>
<p>Dodori was trying his best to hide his excitement, but it was easy for everybody to tell. Raon watched him and quietly mumbled in a weak voice.</p>
<p>“…I want to use my attribute too.”</p>
<p>Dodori, his mom Sheritt, Goldie gramps… All of them looked so cool using their attributes, but Raon had still never used his attribute.</p>
<p>Raon’s attribute was ‘the present.’ That was all he knew. He had no idea about how to activate it or what it could be used for.</p>
<p>He heard Cale’s nonchalant voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“There are powers that take longer to figure out.”</p>
<p>Raon looked toward Cale’s back.</p>
<p>Cale didn’t know Raon was looking as he was thinking about his other power.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s other power…</p>
<p>This ability and ‘Record’ made him a multiple ability user, and it had activated much later than ‘Record.’ That ability strained Cale’s body so much because of how severely it overloaded his body.</p>
<p>‘That ability is related to time like Raon’s attribute.’</p>
<p>Knowing about that ability was why Cale was able to share his thoughts without thinking much about it.</p>
<p>“Maybe your attribute is waiting until when you will be okay with using it. It might be waiting until you grow big enough to handle its power.”</p>
<p>“…You think so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. So just eat well, sleep well, and enjoy life.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped walking as he said that.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boooom!</p>
<p>A large pit appeared in front of Cale as boulders continued to crash behind him.</p>
<p>The zenith of the mountain… The pit located here seemed to be a smaller version of the sinkhole in the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>“…Ha! How can they do that to people?!”</p>
<p>“Mother-fucking bastards!”</p>
<p>There was a staircase on the cliff heading down to the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p>They could see cells along the walls all the way from the top of the staircase to the bottom. They were so small that one person could barely fit inside and stretch their legs.</p>
<p>“Y, young master-nim! I, it’s the young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“What? The young master-nim?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Someone reached their hand out through the bars of their cell.</p>
<p>That person was looking at Cale.</p>
<p>Although his hair was dyed red, they could tell that this was young master Naru, the future leader of the Vampires that all of them respected so much.</p>
<p>Multiple cells became ruckus as the Vampires all looked out.</p>
<p>Cale looked at each and every one of them.</p>
<p>They were extremely skinny as if they had not eaten properly and some of them must have resisted quite a bit as they were injured and their bodies did not seem normal.</p>
<p>However, there was somewhere else his gaze landed on last.</p>
<p>“…What is that?”</p>
<p>He was asking what it was, but he already knew the answer.</p>
<p>“Human. It’s that thing! It’s the power of the Darkness Elemental!”</p>
<p>Raon was right.</p>
<p>Lion king Dorph had used it against them in the past. The darkness used by the bastard who had eaten a Darkness Elemental was covering the bottom of the pit and preventing them from seeing what was underneath.</p>
<p>They could not see through the black fog covering the bottom at all.</p>
<p>“…There was a reason Dorph came here.”</p>
<p>He was probably here to use his darkness and cover the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p>Cale had a feeling that he knew what was underneath there.</p>
<p>There was something that he had recalled as soon as he read the file about the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>“The young master-nim came to save us!”</p>
<p>“Sooooob! Sob!”</p>
<p>“P, please save us!”</p>
<p>Cale removed the band on his wrist as the Vampires shouted.</p>
<p>That band was the treasure that had been passed down through Duke Fredo’s family, the item that allowed him to look like young master Naru.</p>
<p>He was returning to his normal appearance now that he had taken it off.</p>
<p>“H, he is-?!”</p>
<p>“Why did young master Naru-”</p>
<p>Cale, who was wearing the uniform for a senior of the Sez Royal Academy, was back to his original appearance.</p>
<p>He gave an order.</p>
<p>“Rescue the hostages!”</p>
<p>He then added on.</p>
<p>“I’m heading down.”</p>
<p>He jumped down before the Rangers could even respond.</p>
<p>The Rangers saw Cale being covered by rose gold-colored light the instant they were about to flinch.</p>
<p>The power of the Darkness Elemental…</p>
<p>Cale had a power that could light up that darkness.</p>
<p>– Just leave it to me.</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction.</p>
<p>This ancient power spoke up for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>Craaaackle-</p>
<p>A burning red light started to gobble up the darkness.</p>
<p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
<p>There was a chilling screech as the rose gold currents ate away at the darkness.</p>
<p>It was like the first torch lighting up the darkness… The darkness disappeared more and more as Cale headed down to the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p>Both the Vampires who were chaotic at Naru turning into Cale and the Rangers who had tried to move quickly could only blankly watch in shock.</p>
<p>Dodori could not take his eyes off that sight either.</p>
<p>He then saw Raon, who was next to Cale. Raon was always by Cale’s side, and it would be weird if he wasn’t.</p>
<p>“I should go too.”</p>
<p>Dodori knew he should quickly follow behind them.</p>
<p>“…Ah-”</p>
<p>But he suddenly stiffened up like a statue.</p>
<p>“W, what is that-”</p>
<p>His voice was shaking.</p>
<p>Now that the bottom of the pit was revealed because the darkness had disappeared…</p>
<p>Dodori could not move once he saw what was down there.</p>
<p>Many of the scenes he had read in the stories of great figures had been vivid on his mind, however… It was completely different from experiencing it himself.</p>
<p>“…W, why are there so many bones-”</p>
<p>There were piles of bones once the darkness disappeared.</p>
<p>Large circular glass coffins were at the center of the bones.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Dodori covered his mouth.</p>
<p>A putrid odor was seeping out of the circular glass coffins now that the Darkness Elemental’s power was no longer suppressing it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an actual odor. Only Dragons who were sensitive to mana would be able to feel it.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>Cale descended to the middle of the piles of bones and looked at the four large glass coffins as he asked.</p>
<p>“Is that the fluid you talked about being processed with dead mana?”</p>
<p>“That’s right! Human! It is that thing! This odor, this aura, everything is the same!”</p>
<p>Around these four large circular glass coffins… People wearing grey priest outfits were holding weapons and glaring at Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse!”</p>
<p>“…Fuck! What the hell were the Lions and Cats doing?!”</p>
<p>But Cale was not looking at them.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>At the center of the four circular glass coffins…</p>
<p>There was an altar.</p>
<p>There were four sculptures of monsters Cale was familiar with on the altar.</p>
<p>“…Half of the unranked monsters are here.”</p>
<p>Cale could hear the urgent voices of the Wind Elementals as he was holding the golden top’s whip.</p>
<p>‘Chaos, destruction! I really thought they were all still at the Endable Kingdom!’</p>
<p>‘When did they move it?! Did we not notice because of the Darkness Elemental’s power?’</p>
<p>‘I guess so. Cale, we’re sorry. But those sculptures and this fluid are definitely in the Endable Kingdom as well! I’m sure of it!’</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about that later.”</p>
<p>His voice was void of all emotion that the Wind Elementals urgently responded.</p>
<p>‘Chaos, destruction, apologies! We’re truly, truly sorry! We didn’t know!’</p>
<p>‘Sorry, Cale. We dropped the ball big time. What do we do now?’</p>
<p>‘We’ll redeem ourselves next time!’</p>
<p>But Cale was not listening to the Wind Elementals right now.</p>
<p>He moved his hand.</p>
<p>“Mmph! Mmph!”</p>
<p>He reached toward Bakehe, who was floating in the air with Raon’s magic…</p>
<p>And grabbed him by the collar.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He then slammed Bakehe down on the ground. King Bakehe rolled around while still completely bound.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Cale then pushed down on Bakehe’s head with his foot.</p>
<p>Bakehe could see the pair of cold eyes looking at him. Cale continued speaking in a stoic voice.</p>
<p>“Here’s another son of a bitch like Adin.”</p>
<p>Underneath the Mogoru Empire’s Alchemists’ Bell Tower…</p>
<p>The large pile of bones that filled that area…</p>
<p>The numerous people who were killed to create dead mana…</p>
<p>Most of them were people who had come after hearing that they could become Alchemists.</p>
<p>They were abducted by human traffickers and ended up as slaves.</p>
<p>This was the reason Cale had an ominous feeling when he had first heard of the Sez Kingdom’s sword art training center.</p>
<p>“Human! T, there are more bones here than at the Mogoru Empire!”</p>
<p>Raon’s voice was shaking. The bones here were at least ten times as much as the ones underneath the Alchemists’ Bell Tower.</p>
<p>“One was an Alchemist, and the other is a knight. Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale chuckled.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh! Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>He was still stepping on King Bakehe’s head as he started speaking.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the altar at the center of the piles of bones.</p>
<p>“Destroy those sculptures.”</p>
<p>“Human, I got it! I’ll break them this time! I can’t forgive those bastards for doing this!”</p>
<p>The priests of the Endable Kingdom who served the Demonic race and the Demonic Gods shouted at them.</p>
<p>“If you break these sculptures! These fluids will flow out and we will all die!”</p>
<p>“I dare you to destroy them! Everyone inside the Sez Kingdom will die from the fluid!”</p>
<p>Raon hesitated after hearing that.</p>
<p>He had failed to steal the sculptures last time at the Endable Kingdom as well. It was because of these processed dead mana fluids connected to the sculptures.</p>
<p>It would be bad if these things got out.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>He heard a low voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. I will take care of everything.”</p>
<p>It was the most reliable voice.</p>
<p>Raon was unable to hear this voice when he was trying to destroy the sculptures last time at the Endable Kingdom, but the owner of this voice was next to him once again.</p>
<p>“I got it, human!”</p>
<p>Raon was not worried about anything anymore.</p>
<p>Cale was standing behind Raon with a cold smile on his face.</p>
<p>Someone had been speaking in his mind since a bit earlier.</p>
<p>– They are the same at the foundation.</p>
<p>During the Era of Darkness that covered the ancient times…</p>
<p>The warrior who had created a sea of fire everywhere to burn up the dead mana…</p>
<p>The Fire of Destruction was informing Cale about this fluid.</p>
<p>– Whether it is dead mana or this fluid, we just need to burn it all.</p>
<p>Purify this crap.</p>
<p>Use that power.</p>
<p>It was saying that the rose gold thunderbolts could purify this fluid.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>“…They found it.”</p>
<p>Lion King Dorph peeked toward the apex of the mountain before looking toward the enemies with a twisted smile on his face.</p>
<p>“You can’t use your powers properly because of the darkness, right?”</p>
<p>Mount Nex had become covered in darkness that was even thicker than the fog.</p>
<p>Not a single ray of sunlight could make it through this black wall.</p>
<p>It was the power of Dorph’s Darkness Elemental. Those with the Darkness attribute would get stronger under this black wall, while others would become weaker.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Beacrox looked down at his palm. He could tell that he was losing strength.</p>
<p>“Suddenly!”</p>
<p>“My body feels slower!”</p>
<p>It was the same for the Ranger Brigade members and the Mercenary King.</p>
<p>This black wall that suddenly appeared made it so that they could not use their powers properly.</p>
<p>‘Time, we need time to adjust to it!’</p>
<p>Dorph smirked while sword master Bud had that thought.</p>
<p>Even Rosalyn and Eruhaben could only use a fourth of their mana while under this black wall.</p>
<p>“Even that ancient Dragon could not use his mana properly under this black wall last time. It should be the same for you, right?”</p>
<p>Dorph was looking at Rasheel, who was standing there with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>Rasheel recalled something Cale had said at that moment.</p>
<p>‘Rasheel-nim, you just have to beat one bastard down to start.’</p>
<p>‘Huh? Only one? I can beat more chumps down.’</p>
<p>‘Just one to start.’</p>
<p>‘Who is that one bastard?’</p>
<p>‘The Lion King.’</p>
<p>Rasheel thought that Cale must have anticipated this moment.</p>
<p>‘He’s quite big when he goes berserk.’</p>
<p>‘Oh. It should be entertaining to beat him up. Fine. This great Dragon will pummel that bastard.’</p>
<p>‘Hmm, how should I beat him up?’</p>
<p>Rasheel’s face was stiff from too much excitement.</p>
<p>Nobody here knew that this was the case.</p>
<p>‘Rasheel-nim, feel free to beat him up as you please.’</p>
<p>There was nothing stopping Rasheel since he had received Cale’s permission before coming here.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Happy holidays from our translation team to you and your family! Hope your face is as stiff with excitement as Rasheel’s!</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 643 – Are you scared? 5</p>
<p>Dorph sighed after looking at Rasheel, who just quietly stared at him with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>‘Dragons are not omnipotent.’</p>
<p>Magic, lifespan, and attribute. Dragons were born with the greatest conditions such that it would be weird if they did not get strong. But their ‘attribute’ or ‘special trait’ that helped make them become strong was also a restriction on the Dragon.</p>
<p>They couldn’t help but be impacted by powers that were incompatible with it.</p>
<p>‘Most Dragons have traits that are the opposite of dead mana or darkness.’</p>
<p>It made sense since they were most experienced with living mana and not dead mana.</p>
<p>‘His power has decreased.’</p>
<p>The grey mana surrounding Rasheel’s body was smaller than before. This proved that Rasheel was being impacted by the power of this black wall.</p>
<p>“Nothing more to see here.”</p>
<p>Dorph turned around without any hesitation.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse. I need to stop that bastard.’</p>
<p>Dorph had already felt that the darkness he had cast at the bottom of the pit had disappeared.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse would have seen everything. That bastard will do whatever he could to hinder them, so Dorph had to hurry.</p>
<p>There was one other reason.</p>
<p>‘The Dragon will adapt to this very quickly.’</p>
<p>Unlike the others, the Dragon will quickly find a way to properly use his mana underneath this darkness.</p>
<p>That black Dragon named Raon had already done so once before.</p>
<p>Dorph made eye contact with the Cat tribe leader.</p>
<p>He then motioned toward the mountain peak with his eyes.</p>
<p>‘I’ll head over first.’</p>
<p>That was the meaning inside his gaze. But he could see the Cat tribe leader’s mouth urgently opening.</p>
<p>“…Behind y-!”</p>
<p>Dorph felt chills down his back before the Cat tribe leader could finish.</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Right behind his back… Actually, it was right behind his neck. Dorph had to roll forward as soon as he heard a low laugh right behind his neck.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>His eyes opened wide at the explosion that had taken place and realized that he had just barely managed to dodge.</p>
<p>“…How?”</p>
<p>Rasheel had much more mana around his body compared to before as he stood there in the scattering dust.</p>
<p>“Heh, hehehe-”</p>
<p>Rasheel commented while laughing as if he was very amused.</p>
<p>“Keep dodging. You’re dead if I catch you. Kehehehe.”</p>
<p>He charged toward Dorph again. Dorph gasped in surprise. He had to move with urgency as a Dragon’s physical strength was comparable to his in his present berserk transformation.</p>
<p>“How-?!”</p>
<p>Why was this Dragon not as affected by the black wall?</p>
<p>Actually, why was this Dragon becoming stronger?!</p>
<p>“Why?! Why are you not impacted?!”</p>
<p>Dorph asked, but the response he got was a fist aiming for his head.</p>
<p>He jerked both arms up to block the fist.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>There was a loud bang and Dorph was pushed back by a formidable amount of mana and strength. Rasheel did not miss that moment of opening.</p>
<p>Rasheel’s foot that was covered in so much grey mana that it looked as if it would explode was used to kick Dorph’s calf.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The impact was so strong that Dorph, the largest of the berserk Lions, was shaken to the core.</p>
<p>Dorph frowned.</p>
<p>“This, crazy-”</p>
<p>‘Why the fuck is a damn Dragon more skilled in fighting like this than using magic?!’</p>
<p>The enemy continued to attack the shaken up Dorph without holding back.</p>
<p>“Did this Lion bitch just call me crazy? Hmm? Huh? Do you want to die? No, I’ll just pummel you until you’re just about to die, kehehehehe!”</p>
<p>Rasheel felt as if he was relieving all of his stress for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>He peeked toward the black wall while nobody could see him. His smile became thicker.</p>
<p>‘Rasheel-nim, what is your attribute?’</p>
<p>Rasheel had a conversation with Cale a while back. He recalled the conversation he had had with Cale while Raon had been on Cale’s back.</p>
<p>‘Me?’</p>
<p>Rasheel had confidently responded to Cale who was asking about his special trait.</p>
<p>His attribute that was more hostile and destructive than anybody else’s was his pride and joy.</p>
<p>‘Indomitability.’</p>
<p>‘…Excuse me?’</p>
<p>‘My special trait is indomitability!’</p>
<p>Raon and Cale had looked confused, but Rasheel had not noticed as he continued talking with pride.</p>
<p>‘It is a very offensive and destructive attribute.’</p>
<p>‘…Rasheel… That is what indomitability means?’</p>
<p>Raon had tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>‘Human! Doesn’t indomitability mean that you will not submit under any situation and overcome everything-? I, isn’t it used in a different way than for attacking?’</p>
<p>‘My, my. Little kid, you still have a lot to learn.’</p>
<p>Rasheel then explained the true meaning of his attribute to Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>‘Thanks to this indomitability attribute, I am not impacted by environments that should negatively affect my mental or physical strength.’</p>
<p>‘…You are not impacted by the environment?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. This great Dragon’s attribute has an even more amazing factor.’</p>
<p>‘What is that, Rasheel-nim?’</p>
<p>Rasheel became excited after seeing Cale looking very interested and thoroughly explained.</p>
<p>‘To beat the enemy down or pummel them to death! As my desire to win no matter what grows deeper, my Indomitability attribute gets even stronger in negative environments. I become almost invincible during those times. Kehehe.’</p>
<p>‘…Rasheel! How is that used for attacking? I still don’t get it!’</p>
<p>‘Tsk tsk.’</p>
<p>He explained something he learned throughout his Dragon life to the little Dragon.</p>
<p>‘Alright, what does it mean that I have the indomitability attribute?’</p>
<p>Rasheel held back a smile after seeing Cale paying attention to him as well and continued speaking.</p>
<p>‘I am able to fight like hell no matter the situation.’</p>
<p>‘Excuse me?’</p>
<p>Cale seemed shocked, but Rasheel did not see his face as he continued with his explanation.</p>
<p>‘No matter the situation! If there is a bastard messing with me! The more that bastard does things to put me at a disadvantage! The more he makes me angry! I, the great Dragon Rasheel, will become stronger and stronger to pummel that bastard all I want! That is what I mean! How can you say it is not for attacking? You want to know what happens when I activate my attribute?’</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Rasheel had smiled.</p>
<p>‘That means that the bastard who created that situation will die by my hands.’</p>
<p>Rasheel stopped thinking about that short conversation and looked toward Dorph with a burning gaze.</p>
<p>“Hehe, Cale Henituse was right. It really is fun beating this bastard up. Khahahaha! He’s so big that I can punch anywhere and it still lands! Kahahaha! This is fun, this is so fun!”</p>
<p>He truly looked like a crazed lunatic, well, crazed Dragon.</p>
<p>Both allies and enemies alike couldn’t help but flinch at Rasheel, who seemed quite crazy as he stood there surrounded by his grey mana.</p>
<p>Pow! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Rasheel launched strong and quick attacks toward Dorph that he seemed to be launching attacks pretty much every second.</p>
<p>‘Damn it!’</p>
<p>Dorph was about to go crazy.</p>
<p>‘He’s at least 1.5 times stronger than before. What?! He’s getting even stronger! Fuck!’</p>
<p>The Dragon’s physical strength and his mana were continuing to get stronger. Dorph had no way of responding to it as he noticed this change first hand.</p>
<p>‘I can’t handle any more!’</p>
<p>He decided to use more of the Darkness Elemental’s power.</p>
<p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
<p>There was an eerie noise and the black wall became even thicker as it descended to the ground.</p>
<p>“T, this is!”</p>
<p>“It’s a curse! A curse is descending on Mount Nex!”</p>
<p>“Oh, lord! Please save our majesty!”</p>
<p>After having seen the fog that was thicker than before covering the mountain, seeing this black wall-like thing descending on the mountain made the citizens of the Sez Kingdom who were around the mountain unable to contain their shock and anxiety.</p>
<p>Some were shaking in fear while others started to run away.</p>
<p>“…What the hell is going on? Shit.”</p>
<p>“Vice Captain-nim, will we continue moving forward?”</p>
<p>The Knights Brigades that were climbing the mountain in formation couldn’t help but become flustered as well.</p>
<p>Actually, it was even worse for them.</p>
<p>“…Vice Captain-nim, my strength is falling!”</p>
<p>“My mana, my mana is not moving properly!”</p>
<p>The knights, mages, and soldiers under the black wall were being impacted by the Darkness Elemental’s ability as well.</p>
<p>However, the Vice Captain could not stop.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>He had been hearing loud explosions from above the mountain.</p>
<p>“…I’m sure it is not just our enemies up there!”</p>
<p>They would not hear the sounds of battle if the Cats that had abducted their liege were the only ones up there.</p>
<p>“Did you all not see the dead Cats? There are people who are our allies or wish to be our allies already up there fighting against the Cats!”</p>
<p>They didn’t know who these people were nor why they were helping them out.</p>
<p>However, the truth was that these people were helping them in this situation where their king had been abducted.</p>
<p>“That is why we must hurry!”</p>
<p>The others nodded their heads and firmed their resolves after hearing the Vice Captain’s words.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>They heard the rustling of leaves and an unfamiliar cry.</p>
<p>Caw. Caw. Caw.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain could see someone reveal their presence to appear the moment he heard the Crows.</p>
<p>It was easy to tell who this individual was.</p>
<p>“…A Tiger.”</p>
<p>The old Tiger with white hair walked up with his staff.</p>
<p>It was the Tiger shaman Gashan.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain peeked toward the Knight Captain and the strongest Royal Mage who were still unconscious and became extremely wary of this new arrival.</p>
<p>The Tigers were known to be extremely strong Beasts on the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>“…Why is a Tiger here?”</p>
<p>Gashan responded to the Vice Captain.</p>
<p>“Why is it weird for a Tiger to be in the mountains?”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain closed his mouth.</p>
<p>The Tiger tribe.</p>
<p>Inside the dangerous mountains throughout the Eastern continent… It was rumored that a Tiger or a Tiger and its family resided in any mountain that people could not climb because it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain cautiously asked.</p>
<p>“…Are you the ones fighting against the Cats right now?”</p>
<p>Gashan smiled.</p>
<p>He recalled what Cale had told him before asking him to come here.</p>
<p>‘Gashan. You guys have built a home in Harris Village. But shouldn’t you get it back?’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by ‘get it back?’ ’</p>
<p>‘Your original home.’</p>
<p>‘…….’</p>
<p>‘I’m not saying build homes in every mountain that you guys lived in. But at minimum, the ability to freely come and go from there as you please… Isn’t that the freedom that the Tigers used to have?’</p>
<p>No matter how harsh the mountain was…</p>
<p>No matter where the mountain was located…</p>
<p>The Tigers were a tribe that wanted to seep into nature and live freely.</p>
<p>Gashan happily agreed with Cale’s statement that described the Tigers’ way of life.</p>
<p>This holy Mount Nex was quite a great place to start.</p>
<p>‘Rise as a new faction on the Eastern continent with the Molan household, the Mercenaries Guild, and the Endable Kingdom led by Duke Fredo.’</p>
<p>The Tigers had been pushed out by Arm because they had been living separately on different mountains.</p>
<p>But the Tigers that had gathered in the Henituse Duchy’s Harris Village led by Gashan were still independent while knowing the value of being together.</p>
<p>‘Gashan. I want to help the Tigers regain what they lost because you’ve helped me so much.’</p>
<p>Gashan smiled while remembering Cale’s stoic expression. His smile was directed at the Vice Captain.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain had asked about the people fighting here right now.</p>
<p>The answer was already predetermined.</p>
<p>“We are an organization trying to rescue the Eastern continent.”</p>
<p>“…An organization? What is its name?”</p>
<p>“Ah, its name is-”</p>
<p>He had not discussed a name with young master Cale.</p>
<p>Gashan debated for a moment but decided to use the value that Cale was pushing for.</p>
<p>“We are the Society of Peace.”</p>
<p>“…The Society of Peace?”</p>
<p>The Vice Captain had never heard about this organization.</p>
<p>“That’s right. That is our name. Did you know…”</p>
<p>Gashan walked toward the Vice Captain.</p>
<p>Caw. Caw.</p>
<p>As the crows continued to caw… Gashan looked at the Vice Captain and spoke to the Sez Kingdom’s troops who were looking at him.</p>
<p>“The person who abducted the Sez Kingdom’s king is someone called the White Star.”</p>
<p>Actually, Cale had done it.</p>
<p>But besides that lie, Gashan told the people in front of them about the truth that they didn’t know about.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, there are citizens of the Endable Kingdom, an ally of the Sez Kingdom, imprisoned inside this mountain. This was all done by this crazy villain called the White Star. Ah, there may be some of you who do not know about the Endable Kingdom. Mm, to tell you everything……”</p>
<p>Gashan quickly but thoroughly delivered his message to the Sez Knights Brigades, mages, and soldiers.</p>
<p>They looked as if they could not believe what Gashan was saying.</p>
<p>But they still accepted Gashan’s guidance and quickly headed toward these allies called the Society of Peace. They needed to help this organization of good that was fighting against this evil villain called the White Star.</p>
<p>One of that great villain’s most loyal subordinates was going crazy right now.</p>
<p>Baaa, baaaaang, baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh!”</p>
<p>Dorph had no idea what was going on because Rasheel’s attacks were slowly getting stronger.</p>
<p>He could not understand why Rasheel was getting stronger even though he had strengthened the black wall. He debated whether this Dragon had the darkness attribute, but that wasn’t it.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Dorph chose to escape.</p>
<p>He charged toward the mountain peak as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>‘Crap!’</p>
<p>He heard a crazed voice behind his back. It was a formidable reaction speed.</p>
<p>Rasheel grabbed Dorph by the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Dorph felt as if he couldn’t breathe because of the strong grip as he made eye contact with the Dragon.</p>
<p>“I guess you think that Dragons are nothing.”</p>
<p>Dorph then saw a grey fist landing on his face.</p>
<p>He quickly raised his arms. The grey mana slammed into the arms of the Lion King, the strongest individual while berserk.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>And those arms broke instantly.</p>
<p>The stronger the black wall became and the angrier Rasheel became, the stronger his body and mana became. They were strong enough to easily defeat Dorph now.</p>
<p>In some aspects, Rasheel was the most incompatible enemy for Dorph. There might have been different results if Rasheel went up against someone else, but Cale had stuck Rasheel on Dorph and that had pretty much sealed Dorph’s fate.</p>
<p>As for the other leader who was trying to move to the top of the mountain as well…</p>
<p>“…You motherfucking bastards……!”</p>
<p>Ron was in front of the Cat tribe leader. On and Hong were releasing a red fog as they walked toward him while cutting off all paths of escape.</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader stopped running away.</p>
<p>He needed to stop what Cale Henituse was doing on the mountain peak, but he could not accept the two beings getting in his way.</p>
<p>“You bastards, you dare to attack me to pay me back for the grace I showed you by keeping you alive-!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s eyes had an odd glow as he looked at On and Hong.</p>
<p>He was going berserk.</p>
<p>The Cats’ berserk state was different from the Wolves and Lions who became stronger and more destructive.</p>
<p>They became quicker, sharper, and the special ability held by a select few of the Fog Cat Tribe became stronger as well. For the tribe leader, it meant that his fog ability became amplified.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by grace?! Stop with the nonsense!”</p>
<p>On bared her fangs toward him.</p>
<p>Hong stood next to his sister and closed his eyes as he slowly took some breaths.</p>
<p>On and Hong. In the quiet moment as the tribe leader’s change was happening…</p>
<p>“Oh my.”</p>
<p>Ron leisurely walked in between them.</p>
<p>“Tribe leader. You don’t seem to understand the situation.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ron smiled and pointed to the mountain peak. On and Hong looked up as well and their faces lit up while the Cat tribe leader looked extremely desperate.</p>
<p>They all heard Ron’s relaxed voice.</p>
<p>“It looks like our young master-nim has achieved his goal to some degree. I suppose we don’t need to drag this out any longer.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader turned his head toward Ron.</p>
<p>“Go on and go berserk. I shall show you the official art of the Molan household.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>On a place higher than the mountain peak… They heard noises from the sky on top of the black wall.</p>
<p>Rumble- ruuuuuuuuumble-</p>
<p>It sounded like the clouds just before a thunderstorm happened.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Sez Kingdom standing outside the mountain curled up in fear at this new situation, but it was an extremely welcome noise for Cale’s allies.</p>
<p>“…Thunderbolts!”</p>
<p>The Mercenaries Guild’s Ranger Brigade members pointed to the sky.</p>
<p>Ruuuuumble- ruuuuuuumble-</p>
<p>They could slowly see flashes of rose gold light trying to pierce through the black wall.</p>
<p>The rose-gold thunderbolts looked ready to strike down at any moment. They were roaring while waiting for orders from their master.</p>
<p>—</p>

<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 644 – Are you scared? 6</p>
<p>“N, nooooo!”</p>
<p>“Crazy bastard! Do you think we are the only ones who will die? Everybody will die! Do it if you dare!”</p>
<p>The people wearing grey priest outfits were shouting.</p>
<p>Their eyes were focused on Raon and Cale who were heading to the altar. They then looked toward the rose gold thunderbolts that looked ready to pierce through the black wall and strike down at any moment.</p>
<p>However, nobody dared to move.</p>
<p>“All those who worship the Demonic race will curse you Cale Heni…ugh!”</p>
<p>“Curse that Dragon, ahhhh!”</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Pink arrows landed right in front of the priests who were shouting curses. Those arrows would have gone right through their heads if they moved even 1cm closer.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dodori!”</p>
<p>“This is just basic stuff, my hoobae Dragon!”</p>
<p>Cale just quietly observed the scene with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“…Ugh. Ugh.”</p>
<p>He was sitting on king Bakehe as a chair.</p>
<p>– Cale. Will you purify things right away once that young Dragon destroys the sculptures?</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head at the Super Rock’s question.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be weird if he told Raon to hurry, but Cale looked relaxed. However, his mind was not relaxed at all.</p>
<p>He wanted to take care of everything as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, he could not hurry.</p>
<p>“Please go back inside!”</p>
<p>“We will get you out again if you go in for now! We’re not going to lock the cell doors. Do you see those thunderbolts?! You’re done for if you get struck by it!”</p>
<p>The Ranger Brigade members had stopped rescuing the hostages and were sending them back into the cells.</p>
<p>‘It’ll be bad if the hostages get hurt by the fiery thunderbolts.’</p>
<p>Cale was very good at controlling the fiery thunderbolts but he didn’t want any accidents where a hostage who was moving got injured.</p>
<p>He needed to be super careful because a lot of their bodies were messes right now.</p>
<p>That was why Cale kept up a poker face while hiding his nervousness.</p>
<p>– Cale. You seem quite nervous…is there a reason for that?</p>
<p>The ancient powers realized it.</p>
<p>And Raon, who peeked behind him, realized it as well.</p>
<p>– Human! Is there anything urgent? Why do you look like that even though grandpa Ron isn’t telling you to drink lemonade?</p>
<p>Cale didn’t respond to Raon and only answered the ancient powers in his mind.</p>
<p>‘There are only four of them.’</p>
<p>Only four of the sculptures were here.</p>
<p>Then where were the remaining four?</p>
<p>Cale said a single statement out of nervousness.</p>
<p>“…There are no Dark Elves here.”</p>
<p>The hostages had cheered with joy thinking that Cale was young master Naru.</p>
<p>They had reached their hands out for him to save them.</p>
<p>The Endable Kingdom’s citizens had never given up their will to survive even though their bodies were injured and tired.</p>
<p>But the Dark Elves were not here.</p>
<p>Of course, Cale had only taken a quick glance so he was waiting for a report from the Ranger Brigade.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim!”</p>
<p>The Ranger Brigade members who had inspected the cells from top to bottom urgently shouted toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Not a single Dark Elf is here sir! The lower cells are all empty sir!”</p>
<p>“Over half of the cells are empty sir!”</p>
<p>None of the Endable Kingdom’s Dark Elves who were also going to be used as sacrifices were here.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>Cale realized that his thoughts had been correct. He immediately opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Hurry! Speed up!”</p>
<p>The Ranger Brigade members increased their speed to move the Vampires back into the cells.</p>
<p>Their jobs were almost done but Cale was just getting started.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Cale stood up and grabbed king Bakehe by the hair.</p>
<p>“Hey. Where are four of the sculptures?”</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>Cale pulled king Bakehe’s hair even harder after seeing him desperately shaking his head.</p>
<p>Cale’s stoic expression as he asked was quite contrary to everybody else’s anxious faces, making Bakehe scared.</p>
<p>He didn’t know whether those red thunderbolts would strike down at him.</p>
<p>“Then I will ask a different question. Where did the Dark Elves go?”</p>
<p>“Mm, mmph.”</p>
<p>Bakehe hesitated after hearing the question.</p>
<p>Cale quietly looked at him for a moment before moving while dragging Bakehe behind him. He was headed toward the altar. Cale’s silent action made Bakehe feel as if Cale would break him as he was planning to do with the sculptures.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Heavy.”</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly commented before looking down at him.</p>
<p>“You’re quite heavy to drag. Shall I get rid of some weight?”</p>
<p>King Bakehe turned pale.</p>
<p>‘Weight? What weight?’</p>
<p>He then looked down at his body. They had taken his sword and he only had his clothes, which meant that the heaviest thing right now was his body. Just thinking about how to lessen the weight was terrible.</p>
<p>A swordsman’s body was extremely important.</p>
<p>He looked at Cale’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph, mmmmmph!”</p>
<p>Bakehe was flailing as much as possible and looked as if he wanted to say something.</p>
<p>‘He means it.’</p>
<p>This bastard really was finding it heavy to drag him. Then he really might do as he said!</p>
<p>‘Please!</p>
<p>Please let me talk!’</p>
<p>Bakehe desperately flailed and Cale happily ungagged him.</p>
<p>“Speak.”</p>
<p>“Sayeru!”</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes clouded over once he heard the Bear King Sayeru’s name.</p>
<p>“Sayeru took all of the Dark Elves back to the Endable Kingdom a few days ago! H, he said that we should divide the locations after it was found out by Duke Fredo a, and took the Dark Elves back while not bringing over the sculptures he was planning on bringing! He said we need to change the number of summonings! I’m telling the truth! Please believe me! Ugh!”</p>
<p>Cale released his grip and Bakehe fell to the ground. Cale didn’t even glance at the fallen Bakehe.</p>
<p>Nervousness was visible on his face now.</p>
<p>Duke Fredo had said that there would be two summoning rituals.</p>
<p>One was to summon the sealed god.</p>
<p>The other was to summon the unranked monsters into this world.</p>
<p>‘But they’re splitting the unranked monsters’ summoning into two again?’</p>
<p>Cale quickly headed toward the altar.</p>
<p>“Raon!”</p>
<p>Half in the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>Half in the Sez Kingdom’s Mount Nex.</p>
<p>The unranked monsters would be summoned in split locations.</p>
<p>“Human, what’s wrong? Your expression is quite tense!”</p>
<p>“The bottom!”</p>
<p>Cale pointed to the bottom of the altar.</p>
<p>“Destroy the bottom!”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“T, throw your body!”</p>
<p>“Let’s sacrifice ourselves! We must stop this!”</p>
<p>The priests screamed and ran toward the altar once Cale pointed to the bottom of it. They seemed to have forgotten about Dodori’s arrows, but there was someone who was quicker than them.</p>
<p>“Hmm? I got it, human!”</p>
<p>Crack, crack!</p>
<p>Raon could see something black in the cracked area the moment his black aura cracked the bottom of the altar.</p>
<p>“Huh? Huh?!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>Dodori reacted the same way.</p>
<p>A black pattern appeared once the bottom of the altar was destroyed.</p>
<p>“That’s weird. It looks like a magic circle but it is different from the ones I know.”</p>
<p>“Dodori, t, this seems to have black magic mixed in it!”</p>
<p>“What?</p>
<p>A black magic circle had been hidden under the altar.</p>
<p>“I, I didn’t know! Human, I didn’t know this magic circle was here because I didn’t feel any traces of mana!”</p>
<p>A magic circle without mana would just be a picture or a peculiar pattern. Magic circles only worked if there was mana to activate it.</p>
<p>There was a large amount of dead mana here to activate the black magic circle.</p>
<p>These dead mana were transformed to become even more powerful.</p>
<p>“Human! T, this looks like a teleportation magic circle!”</p>
<p>Cale immediately asked once Raon figured out what it was. He seemed quite calm as if he had expected it.</p>
<p>“Figure out the coordinates.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? The coordinates? It’ll take long because it is black magic-”</p>
<p>Although his voice was calm, Cale didn’t have the time to listen to Raon’s full statement.</p>
<p>He just said two words.</p>
<p>“Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“See if the coordinates are set to Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Where would they send the unranked monsters once they were summoned?</p>
<p>The chances of them being sent to Puzzle City were quite high.</p>
<p>And if things were the same as Cale had heard, all of the sacrifices for the summoning ritual should have been here.</p>
<p>However, half of them and half of the sculptures were in the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure Dorph told Sayeru that they were being attacked here.’</p>
<p>Bear King Sayeru was guaranteed to be at the Endable Kingdom preparing to summon the other four sculptures with the Dark Elves as sacrifices.</p>
<p>‘Once Sayeru learned that they were attacked here-’</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“…He might have proceeded with the summoning.”</p>
<p>That altar probably has a teleportation black magic circle hidden at the bottom as well.</p>
<p>Both of them would probably have their coordinates set to the Roan Kingdom’s Puzzle City.</p>
<p>The plan was to use the monsters to destroy Cale Henituse’s foundation since he was the most bothersome pest in their attempt to summon the sealed god.</p>
<p>‘I need to hurry.’</p>
<p>Cale had realized that he did not have much time the moment he heard that the Dark Elves were not here.</p>
<p>“Commander-nim! We have everybody under cover! We have taken cover as well!”</p>
<p>“Human, do I need to find out the coordinates?”</p>
<p>He could hear the voices of the others around him.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>“It won’t do anything if we attack those bastards! Destroy the glass coffins!”</p>
<p>“Oh great Demonic Gooooood!’</p>
<p>He could also hear the shouts of the enemies.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth in the midst of all the noise.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’m figuring out the coordinates!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do that anymore. Step back and create a teleportation magic circle. Make it so that we can go whenever I give the signal.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What about the sculptures?”</p>
<p>“We are teleporting to the Endable Kingdom. I will take care of the sculptures.”</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“Contact his highness, no, contact everyone with the Grade-1 warning. Tell them to send the troops to Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Cale called forth the wind.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Everybody other than Raon and himself were pushed away from the altar by this sudden gust of wind.</p>
<p>Finally, the roars that had been quietly waiting in the sky started to burst out.</p>
<p>Ruuuuumble- ruuuuuuumble-</p>
<p>Everybody looked up after hearing the scary noises.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Sez Kingdom…</p>
<p>The Vampires and Ranger Brigade members hiding in the cells…</p>
<p>Even Cale’s allies and enemies fighting at the middle of the mountain…</p>
<p>Everybody watched as the black wall was destroyed.</p>
<p>Then all they saw was red.</p>
<p>There was no noise.</p>
<p>As this red light that might last an instant or forever covered their sights and suppressed all other senses…</p>
<p>And as they noticed the moment that was happening…</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p>
<p>A loud explosion that felt as if it might explode their ears shook Mount Nex.</p>
<p>The people outside could see the rose gold thunderbolt piercing through the top of Mount Nex.</p>
<p>The people inside the pit at the peak couldn’t take their eyes off of this phenomenal sight.</p>
<p>The red light was so beautiful that they couldn’t take their eyes off of it, even while knowing that touching it would mean that they would die.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-!</p>
<p>The thunderbolts accurately pierced through the four glass coffins. The fire gobbled up the things inside.</p>
<p>The purification had started.</p>
<p>However, the others could not see it properly.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>They could not tell what was going on because rose gold colored lights were shooting up endlessly from the coffins.</p>
<p>The priests started to panic.</p>
<p>“No! All of the dead mana we worked so hard to gather!”</p>
<p>“We need to go to the center!”</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse—!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>They wanted to harm Cale Henituse who had created these fiery thunderbolts, but… They could not reach Cale.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The center of this area…</p>
<p>At the altar with the sculptures…</p>
<p>The rose gold thunderbolts that were surrounding the altar, striking down, shooting up, just to strike back down, created an isolated area in all directions.</p>
<p>Cale and Raon were the only ones in this isolated area.</p>
<p>Raon spoke in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>“H, human!”</p>
<p>Raon gulped as Cale’s face did not look good.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Cale, who had turned pale after using a lot of the Fire of Destruction, looked toward the item he had just taken out of his spatial pocket bag.</p>
<p>He just grabbed a badge from the first clothes he could touch, so it was a badge with the Roan Crest from his Commander uniform.</p>
<p>That badge was vibrating intensely.</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes sparkled as he shouted.</p>
<p>“Human, did you loot them in the end?”</p>
<p>The four sculptures that should be on the altar were completely gone.</p>
<p>The transformed dead mana pouring out of the coffins that had been connected to the sculptures were turning into ash after touching the rose gold thunderbolts.</p>
<p>Ooooooo-</p>
<p>The aura that had been surrounding Cale’s body slowly dwindled until it disappeared.</p>
<p>He tightly clenched the badge. The badge quieted down as if it was being dominated by Cale.</p>
<p>This was Embrace, the ability Lee Soo Hyuk had given him.</p>
<p>This was the third time Cale had used that ability.</p>
<p>The sculptures that the White Star and his subordinates had worked so hard to prepare were under Cale’s control now.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m going to loot the rest of the sculptures too.”</p>
<p>Cale would normally get rid of everything that might do some useless crap in the future, however…</p>
<p>“I’m too annoyed to just let them off easy.”</p>
<p>He needed to smack them from the back extremely hard to feel better.</p>
<p>The four sculptures were forever under Cale’s control now and Cale wondered if he could do something with them.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t know how to do that right now.</p>
<p>There may be no way to do so.</p>
<p>‘Then I just need to destroy them.’</p>
<p>Now that they were under Cale’s Embrace, nobody else could take them out or destroy them.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>“I got it!”</p>
<p>Paaaaat-</p>
<p>Raon and Cale were surrounded by mana.</p>
<p>“Tell the others to take care of the rest before coming over.”</p>
<p>“I got it human!”</p>
<p>The teleportation spell started to activate.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The rose gold thunderbolts were still striking down and they would turn into ashes and disappear once everything had been purified.</p>
<p>In the future, people will discuss the black wall that covered Mount Nex and the radiant rose gold thunderbolt that pierced through it as the prelude to the greatest war since the ancient times and the first step of the noble sacrifice.</p>
<p>It was also the start of the final battle for peace for the individuals who will be heralded as heroes in the future.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Oh snaps oh snaps oh snaps! “It was also the start of the final battle for peace for the individuals who will be heralded as heroes in the future.” Clopeh would go frantic over this statement!</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 645 – We cannot retreat 1</p>
<p>Paaaat-</p>
<p>In a place where black smoke had risen once already… Cale and Raon appeared.</p>
<p>“Human, everybody should do a good job, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Of course.”</p>
<p>Ron, Bud, and Gashan would take care of the strategy. Dodori and Rasheel would provide the muscles.</p>
<p>Beacrox, On, and Hong would support all of them. There were also numerous other helpers.</p>
<p>Taking care of the Lion tribe and the Cat tribe on Mount Nex shouldn’t be difficult at all for those people.</p>
<p>‘I am feeling iffy about coming without finishing things over there though.’</p>
<p>Cale wanted to take care of every step properly because he started the situation in the Sez Kingdom while thinking that it was the start of the final battle.</p>
<p>But there were times when you had to rely on your allies to take care of things.</p>
<p>“…It’s quiet.”</p>
<p>Those times were when something more dangerous and urgent came up.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward the sinkhole, one of the Eastern continent’s Three Restricted Areas and the entrance to the Endable Kingdom. He walked toward the Gate to the Demon World……”</p>
<p>He had teleported right outside the Endable Kingdom, the same place Alberu had been stationed while going to rescue Cale from the black orb.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The wind was blowing, and the leaves were shaking.</p>
<p>It was extremely calm.</p>
<p>“Human, are we heading in right away?”</p>
<p>There weren’t even any guards.</p>
<p>Raon thought that that made it even weirder. Raon didn’t even realize that he sounded anxious because it seemed so weird.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Let’s head in right away.”</p>
<p>It was the same for Cale.</p>
<p>The Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>That was a place where people and many races with the darkness attribute lived together. There was no noise coming from there, even though it was the middle of the day right now.</p>
<p>It felt as if something was about to happen.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Wind quickly surrounded Raon and Cale and moved them on top of the cliff to go into the sinkhole.</p>
<p>“Human! The palace is weird! I remember destroying the roof!”</p>
<p>It was the White Star’s palace. The roof Raon had destroyed while rescuing the Wolf children was covered in a white cloth to hide what was inside.</p>
<p>“Human, that really seems suspicious!”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and responded as he felt the same way.</p>
<p>“Raon, invisibility magic-”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Cale stopped talking and turned toward the direction of a noise he heard.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
<p>A sharp alarm rang loudly.</p>
<p>“It’s the crown prince!”</p>
<p>“Connect it.”</p>
<p>Cale could not reject a call from the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Raon had left messages to important people through the video communication device before teleporting here from Mount Nex. Alberu must have contacted him right away after receiving the message.</p>
<p>‘The others don’t matter as much, but at least his highness and Choi Han knowing the situation would be beneficial.’</p>
<p>Every second was important right now, but this was a call from someone to whom he should explain the situation even if he only had five, no, even just one or two minutes.</p>
<p>– Cale.</p>
<p>Cale could see what looked like a meeting room as soon as the call was connected. There was a long table. Alberu, who was at the head of the table, was speaking.</p>
<p>– You think that another summoning ritual might have taken place in the Endable Kingdom?</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>– There are four mons- never mind. No need to repeat things we already know.</p>
<p>Alberu was speaking with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>– How long will Puzzle City be able to last if four monsters teleport there?</p>
<p>Alberu had only fought against a single unranked monster. Furthermore, he had only helped out once Cale and the other Earthlings had weakened it significantly.</p>
<p>He looked at Cale and the entrance to the sinkhole over Cale’s shoulder as he anxiously awaited Cale’s response.</p>
<p>Cale soon responded.</p>
<p>“One hour, sir.”</p>
<p>They would be able to last one hour if all four monsters came to Puzzle City.</p>
<p>The meeting room quickly turned into pandemonium. Cale could hear a lot of people’s voices.</p>
<p>– Your highness! That’s unbelievable!</p>
<p>– Have you heard the former Commander making things up?! My goodness, just one hour?! How-</p>
<p>– …Ho. How strong are these monsters… are they like the monsters we’ve read about in myths? W, why are these things happening……?</p>
<p>Cale interrupted them.</p>
<p>“That would be the case if everybody ran away.”</p>
<p>Alberu smiled, and silence filled the meeting room.</p>
<p>“If we can bring in as many reinforcements as possible, even with four monsters… Three hours. We should be able to tie the monsters down inside Puzzle City for three hours.”</p>
<p>Everybody became silent again.</p>
<p>The time had increased by three times the amount, but they didn’t know what to say after hearing that they would only be able to hold back the four monsters for three hours.</p>
<p>What if the monsters left Puzzle City after that?</p>
<p>They might destroy all of the Roan Kingdom. The chief executives were sweating in fear.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak again at that moment.</p>
<p>“That is the worst possible situation.”</p>
<p>All of them turned toward Cale again.</p>
<p>“I came to destroy the remaining four sculptures. That is why, although we should prepare for the worst, there is no need to be scared already.”</p>
<p>The chief executives lightly sighed in relief.</p>
<p>‘Yes. There should be some level of progress since young master Cale is on the move.’</p>
<p>‘The chances of the worst situation happening is pretty low. There’s no need to be scared already.’</p>
<p>The people started to snap out of fear as this sense of terror slowly dissipated.</p>
<p>They were only able to do that because they, the people of the Roan Kingdom, had experienced victory in many battles starting with the battle at the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>Someone broke the silence at that moment.</p>
<p>– Did you go alone?</p>
<p>The vassals looked toward the back of the chair Alberu was sitting on.</p>
<p>Choi Han was standing there.</p>
<p>Cale smiled after hearing Choi Han’s question.</p>
<p>“I came with the most reliable and mighty mage.”</p>
<p>– Human! Am I reliable? Really?</p>
<p>Raon, who was invisible and holding the video communication device while on the other side of Cale, sounded excited.</p>
<p>Cale gave Choi Han an order instead of responding to Raon.</p>
<p>“You go to Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Silence filled the meeting room for a different reason.</p>
<p>‘Only two?’</p>
<p>‘Only two of them went…to a place where monsters that could destroy Puzzle City in three hours are being summoned?’</p>
<p>‘…Even if it is just destroying the sculptures, will they be okay?’</p>
<p>Would they be able to destroy the sculptures with just two people?</p>
<p>They were concerned, but they thought about how Cale had overcome many situations that seemed unfavorable to him. They knew that Cale would manage to achieve some things, as he had shown them many times already.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>‘…My goodness. The Commander is working so hard but I was just here being afraid-’</p>
<p>“Young master Cale is really-’</p>
<p>They were getting emotional thinking about Cale, who was heading into the most dangerous area.</p>
<p>– Why is it just the two of you?</p>
<p>Cale slowly turned around and answered Alberu’s question. It was time to end the call and enter the Endable Kingdom. He could not wait any longer as everything was quiet.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of things to finish at Mount Nex, so I’ve ordered our allies to take care of things there before moving elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked at the back of the person heading to the Endable Kingdom and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>– I see. I can’t hold onto you for a long time since every second is imp-, what is it?</p>
<p>Alberu was about to end the call when he froze after seeing Cale.</p>
<p>Cale had suddenly stopped moving.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Cale heard an odd noise. He looked toward the direction of the noise.</p>
<p>Crack. Crack.</p>
<p>He continued to hear something breaking.</p>
<p>– H, human!</p>
<p>Raon’s face was pale. The young Dragon’s eyes looked up toward the sky as well. Raon’s front paw holding the video communication device subconsciously moved, letting the others see the sky as well.</p>
<p>Crack. Crack, crack.</p>
<p>It was not the sound of something breaking.</p>
<p>In the sky… A very small grey mouth was appearing in the air above the Endable Kingdom. That mouth was chewing on something.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>It was not the sound of something breaking; it was the sound of that mouth in the air eating something. That grey mouth was getting bigger. It was an eerie and disgusting sight.</p>
<p>Cale realized it at that moment.</p>
<p>‘Ah.’</p>
<p>The summoning had started.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Boom- boom, boom, booom-</p>
<p>They could hear the sound of drums coming from the sinkhole. It was not just one person drumming. It sounded as if tens of people were drumming, making it loud enough to hurt Cale’s ears.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Cale’s body was quickly covered by whirlwinds.</p>
<p>Cale and Raon were already heading into the sinkhole.</p>
<p>– Human! T, that! The cloth on the roof-!</p>
<p>The white cloth was slowly ripping as Raon mentioned. The cloth ripped extremely quickly once Cale and Raon noticed it.</p>
<p>Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiip-!</p>
<p>White light shot out from the opening. They were familiar with this light.</p>
<p>“Bear King Sayeru……!”</p>
<p>Bear King Sayeru’s ancient power was the light attribute power, and his light looked like this when it was used to attack as an arrow or spear.</p>
<p>“They realized we are here.”</p>
<p>The enemies had noticed their intrusion.</p>
<p>‘Dorph really did contact him in advance.’</p>
<p>That was why the summoning ritual had started so quickly and Sayeru had attacked Cale, who had not become invisible.</p>
<p>He turned his gaze.</p>
<p>He could see the video communication device in the still invisible Raon’s hand.</p>
<p>The Roan kingdom’s vassals were all standing while looking at him. They all looked completely astonished. They must have seen everything.</p>
<p>Cale looked at them, as well as Alberu, the only one who was still sitting, and Choi Han, who was observing him with a piercing gaze and started speaking.</p>
<p>“See you at Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>The video communication device could only see a silver shield that appeared to block the light spear. The video communication device turned off and Raon quickly shoved the video communication device in his spatial dimension and channeled his mana.</p>
<p>“Human! I will block them!”</p>
<p>Ooooooo-</p>
<p>Black mana shook around Raon before exploding out of Raon. Tens, no, hundreds of black arrows were quickly created and Raon blocked the light spears as he pointed toward Sayeru standing under the cloth.</p>
<p>“I’m firing!”</p>
<p>The black arrows were immediately launched toward Sayeru and the other enemies around him.</p>
<p>“Human! I’ll open up a path for you!”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Cale’s lips curled up. He found Raon, who was doing well even without him having to say anything now that he was a little older, to be very reliable.</p>
<p>He then looked toward the center of the area underneath the cloth.</p>
<p>He could see four sculptures surrounded by grey smoke.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Cale and Raon headed toward the sculptures.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Inside the Roan Palace meeting room… The vassals were still standing while blankly looking at the ended video communication device screen.</p>
<p>A volley of light spears… The shield that blocked them… The sight of the summoning ritual taking place…</p>
<p>They couldn’t help but hold their breaths.</p>
<p>Tap! Tap!</p>
<p>They then saw Alberu tapping on the table and finally released their breaths.</p>
<p>Their crown prince had been the only one to remain calmly seated from start to finish. He looked at his vassals and started speaking.</p>
<p>“Knight Captain.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness!”</p>
<p>“Leave the minimum amount of troops to protect his majesty and the royals and take the rest of the troops to Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Mage captain.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness?”</p>
<p>“Head to Puzzle City. Have the Foreign Affairs team contact our allied kingdoms immediately as well.”</p>
<p>Alberu gave his orders in a calm but efficient manner. Choi Han stood behind Alberu and quietly watched him.</p>
<p>‘…He should know that the Dark Elves are being held captive as sacrifices.’</p>
<p>Choi Han felt pain in his heart thinking about how Alberu must feel right now. The Alberu he had seen had deep yet complicated feelings for the Dark Elves as he did for the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>The summoning ritual where the Dark Elves would be used as sacrifices had started in front of such a person’s eyes.</p>
<p>The lives of so many people were bearing down on this person’s shoulders right now.</p>
<p>Choi Han wanted to go to Cale and Raon and fight with them, but he could not open his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward him at that moment.</p>
<p>“Instructor, please go to young master Cale.”</p>
<p>Choi Han could see in Alberu’s eyes that he was worried about Cale. He had not said anything when Cale mentioned that only he and Raon were going to fight, but he must have been quite worried.</p>
<p>Choi Han quietly looked at Alberu for a moment before shaking his head.</p>
<p>“Your highness, I serve Cale-nim.”</p>
<p>The Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Puzzle City was located in the Roan Kingdom’s northeast region, close to the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>The Cale Choi Han knew… The reason Cale had Choi Han stay here was not that he wanted Choi Han to fight, it was because he wanted Choi Han to protect people in case things went terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Choi Han, like Cale, had a lot of people he cared about in the Henituse territory, the Roan Kingdom, and the Western continent.</p>
<p>“Your highness, Cale-nim’s orders supersede your own.”</p>
<p>The corners of Alberu’s lips oddly twisted up.</p>
<p>Choi Han was basically saying that he was not going to listen to the orders of the crown prince, but he understood how Choi Han and even Cale felt right now.</p>
<p>Alberu stood up while looking at Choi Han, the only person to oppose his orders, and his vassals who were waiting for his orders.</p>
<p>“Everybody, hurry. The troops and communication team will go to Puzzle City while the rest will remain in the palace! I am going to Puzzle City so the Foreign Affairs team and the Administrative team should turn to his majesty or the second prince for any questions!”</p>
<p>The vassals shouted to oppose Alberu’s decision.</p>
<p>“Your highness! What do you mean that you are going to Puzzle City?! The danger level in this battle is much greater than the other battles!”</p>
<p>“Even the residents of Puzzle City are all evacuated to nearby territories or at least a couple kilometers outside! It is a completely empty city! The people who have evacuated to the outside will soon be moved to nearby territories as well! So why would you go to such a place, your highness?!”</p>
<p>“Your highness, why don’t you retreat as well?”</p>
<p>“That’s right! We are not telling you to run away, your highness. We just hope that you can stay here and give orders. The foundation of the Roan Kingdom would break if anything were to happen to you, your highness!”</p>
<p>They would only be able to last three hours maximum if four monsters attacked.</p>
<p>The pressure from those numbers was making Alberu’s vassals stop him. They believed that even if Puzzle City was to fall, they would be able to get back up if Alberu was alive.</p>
<p>“Then you want me to just sit back and watch as our soldiers, knights, and mages go to fight?”</p>
<p>Alberu’s calm voice made everybody silent once again.</p>
<p>“The monsters will be large and the battle will be fierce.”</p>
<p>There may be extremely loud noises, rumblings, and explosions. They had no way of knowing how much of Puzzle City would end up destroyed.</p>
<p>The traces of battle will spread throughout all the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Alberu closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He recalled the last moment he saw on the video communication device.</p>
<p>He recalled seeing Cale’s back as he rushed toward the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>He thought about something else as he thought about how Cale had charged forward without any hesitation.</p>
<p>He remembered Kim Rok Soo’s back as he fought against the unranked monster.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but think of how Cale’s back had looked.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>A small chuckle came out of his mouth. He started walking without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“I.”</p>
<p>At least in the Roan Kingdom…</p>
<p>“I cannot retreat.”</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“I must not retreat.”</p>
<p>Just like how the people at the Seomyeon shelter had fought while looking at Kim Rok Soo’s back…</p>
<p>“…They should fight while looking at my back.”</p>
<p>The people here will fight while looking at his back. Just like the sun rising between two cliffs, his people will be energized by looking at their light.</p>
<p>He wanted to remain as the Roan Kingdom’s sun.</p>
<p>“Your highness! You can’t do that!”</p>
<p>“…It can’t be helped. I understand, your highness.”</p>
<p>“Your highness, please reconsider!”</p>
<p>Alberu could see Choi Han standing next to him at that moment. Alberu started to think while looking at Choi Han quietly standing there with his hand on his scabbard.</p>
<p>‘If I was alone… I might have felt scared and chaotic.’</p>
<p>Three hours.</p>
<p>There was nobody here who felt the fear from that number more than Alberu. He felt as if he could not breathe while thinking about all of his subjects who might die.</p>
<p>However, Alberu calmed himself down while thinking about someone.</p>
<p>It was someone who, because he knew he could not retreat… This person, his ally, walked forward without any hesitation to protect his people.</p>
<p>“I won’t be lonely.”</p>
<p>He had a faint smile on his face.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman soon led the troops and headed toward Puzzle City.</p>
<p>He was hoping that Cale, who could not retreat and took another step forward in order to not retreat… And his other precious allies were all safe.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Boom- boom! Boom-</p>
<p>Cale landed on the ground amidst the beating of the drums.</p>
<p>Cale made eye contact with hundreds of enemies and felt their hostilities with Raon as his only ally here.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Alberu sounds so cool and serious. Yes, we cannot retreat. Let’s go!</p>
<p>What will happen next?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 646 – We cannot retreat 2</p>
<p>Hundreds of Bears were already in their berserk transformations to face off against Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>The sight of the remaining members of Arm all pointing their weapons at Cale and Raon…</p>
<p>The light surrounding Bear King Sayeru who was standing in front of them…</p>
<p>Cale and Raon had to make their way through all of them.</p>
<p>However, Cale could not look at them.</p>
<p>“…Blood.”</p>
<p>He could see that the originally red blood had dried and turned black on the palace floor.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t smell blood at all. All he could smell was the refreshing scent of the forest.</p>
<p>“T, this is not possible… This!”</p>
<p>Raon’s voice was shaking slightly. Cale realized that Raon was looking at the same thing as him.</p>
<p>“Sooooob!”</p>
<p>“Mmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>“Oo…ooooooooo…….”</p>
<p>Past the numerous enemies in front of Cale and Raon… They could see the cage carriages imprisoning the Dark Elves.</p>
<p>However, some of them were completely empty. The Dark Elves who were still in the carriages seemed completely out of it or were anxiously shaking in fear.</p>
<p>Boom- boom, boom–</p>
<p>The drumming continued. The enemies. And then those cage carriages. Behind that were people wearing grey priest robes banging the drums while bleeding out of their noses and mouths.</p>
<p>On top of the circular altar they were surrounding…</p>
<p>“Human! Those are not the sculptures we saw before!”</p>
<p>The sculptures were already dyed grey and all glowing in different lights.</p>
<p>Cale turned toward Sayeru.</p>
<p>“…You didn’t start the summoning ritual after being contacted by Dorph.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It was quite difficult finishing the summoning preparations so early in the morning.”</p>
<p>Sayeru looked somewhat pleased. This small amount of joy was coming from the fact that he would finally be able to pull one over Cale and that their greater good was near.</p>
<p>“We were going to finish the summoning ritual here in the Endable Kingdom and then proceed with the second summoning ritual at Mount Nex if we succeeded.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>The corners of Sayeru’s mouth twisted up.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse, why do you have such an expression on your face?”</p>
<p>He looked at Cale as if he found him to be ridiculous.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why you have such an expression while looking at the empty cage carriages and this dried blood. Are you sad looking at the blood of the dead sacrifices? Does it make you angry?”</p>
<p>No emotions were visible on Cale’s face now that the look or urgency was gone. However, Sayeru couldn’t help but sneer while looking at Cale’s eyes that looked extremely chaotic despite his stoic expression.</p>
<p>“They weren’t even the Vampires that sided with you. These Dark Elves are your enemies who attacked and killed your allies. Shouldn’t you be happy that there are less of them now? Your enemies are dead, you bastard.”</p>
<p>Raon channeled his black mana as he was unable to hold back his anger.</p>
<p>“You trashy Bear King, I, eek!”</p>
<p>At that moment… Raon saw a large water spear charging toward the Bear King. Cale had launched his ancient power.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-</p>
<p>The light and water crashed into each other and broke down. The Bear King could see Cale charging toward him through the clashing powers.</p>
<p>Bear King Sayeru commented to the leader of the enemies who had taken one of his arms.</p>
<p>“It’s already too late.”</p>
<p>He then raised his arm. The rest of the Bears charged toward Cale at his signal.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>Hundreds of berserk Bears moving at once shook the ground. The remaining members of Arm spread out to aim for Cale’s blind spots at the same time.</p>
<p>Wind… And Water.</p>
<p>Cale was using two powers at once.</p>
<p>– Aren’t you overdoing it?</p>
<p>The Super Rock asked, but Cale did not answer. No, he didn’t have time to answer.</p>
<p>The summoning ritual had started long before Cale attacked Mount Nex.</p>
<p>If it had already started, he needed to stop them before it was too late.</p>
<p>“Human! Don’t overdo it! I will stop them all!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sayeru appeared in front of Raon.</p>
<p>And in front of Cale…</p>
<p>“Kahahaha! I’ve been waiting for this moment!”</p>
<p>“The enemy of the Bears!”</p>
<p>There were so many enemies that he could not see in front of him.</p>
<p>This entire area was full of burning hostility. The Bears swung their weapons, their fists, and their legs while looking at this person who was the greatest enemy of the Bears under the heavens.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baang, baaaang!</p>
<p>Cale summoned his shield. He then continued to charge forward while riding the wind.</p>
<p>The ground started shaking at the same time.</p>
<p>– …You’re going to use me as well?</p>
<p>Inside the sinkhole where the Endable Kingdom was located… The cliffs crumbled and hundreds of stone spears appeared.</p>
<p>Those stone spears all headed toward the altar.</p>
<p>“Raon!”</p>
<p>“I’m already on my way!”</p>
<p>Raon was heading toward the circular altar in between the stone spears. Hundreds of black arrows filled the gaps between the stone spears.</p>
<p>The black arrows looked like the night sky as they filled the area, while the stone spears looked like meteorites shooting down to the ground.</p>
<p>Raon was channeling so much mana at once to do that.</p>
<p>He was sweating all over.</p>
<p>‘This is dangerous!’</p>
<p>The four sculptures were completely dyed grey and giving off an eerie light.</p>
<p>In addition…</p>
<p>‘The glass coffins!’</p>
<p>The four glass coffins with the transforming dead mana… The large amount of liquid inside these coffins that were connected to the sculptures was pretty much gone.</p>
<p>Toward the only power he could use… Raon shouted toward his mana.</p>
<p>“Destroy them!”</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>He heard a low chuckle.</p>
<p>“Do you think that is possible?”</p>
<p>Raon could see an extremely bright light wall appearing around the sculptures like an umbrella.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaa- baaaaaaaaaa, baaaaaaaaang-</p>
<p>Stone spears and black arrows pouring down… A light wall receiving the full brunt of the attack.</p>
<p>All three were destroyed to pieces.</p>
<p>“Ugh, cough!”</p>
<p>Sayeru coughed and spit up some black blood.</p>
<p>Raon and Sayeru made eye contact. Sayeru started speaking to the young Dragon.</p>
<p>“You didn’t think that you guys are the only ones able to learn and grow, did you? Am I right?”</p>
<p>The Bear who only used to use the light spears could use his light to defend as well now.</p>
<p>“I am putting my life on the line today.”</p>
<p>Sayeru had given up on his life and was looking at Raon with a dedication only to the greater good. Raon felt as if he couldn’t breathe for a moment from the weight he felt in Sayeru’s gaze.</p>
<p>Raon had never seen an enemy going all out like this before. The young Dragon subconsciously turned toward where he expected Cale to be.</p>
<p>“H, human-”</p>
<p>However, he could not see Cale.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Numerous Bears were piled up like a hill, making it impossible for Raon to even see Cale’s shield. The members of Arm were finding any openings in between the Bears to attack as well.</p>
<p>Raon realized it after seeing this sight.</p>
<p>He could move freely because Cale was taking on all of their attacks.</p>
<p>“Young Dragon.”</p>
<p>Sayeru spoke to Raon again.</p>
<p>“Are you prepared to fight me with the same kind of resolve?”</p>
<p>The now extremely pale Sayeru looked calm.</p>
<p>Raon subconsciously clenched his fists. His front paws were shaking. Sayeru’s eyes clouded over as he looked at the young Dragon. His words seemed to have affected the still young and naive Dragon as he had expected.</p>
<p>Boom- boom, boom–!</p>
<p>The drumming continued. Raon saw something and his eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Crack. Crack.</p>
<p>The grey mouth in the sky was now large enough to cover the entire sinkhole. He could see darkness darker than the abyss in between the lips of the grey mouth.</p>
<p>And one more thing…</p>
<p>Craaaack-</p>
<p>Two of the grey sculptures were starting to crack.</p>
<p>“Continue drumming!”</p>
<p>“Keep praying!”</p>
<p>“We must offer more sacrifices! Go bring more sacrifices!”</p>
<p>The priests serving the Demonic race looked crazed as they shouted while coughing up blood. A black light appeared underneath the altar as well.</p>
<p>“A teleportation magic circle!”</p>
<p>The teleportation magic circle was slowly being activated so that it would be ready to use the moment the summoning was complete.</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>There were some people pulling off their grey robes. These people were black mages.</p>
<p>Sayeru commented once Raon saw them reveal themselves.</p>
<p>“You guys aren’t the only ones who can use disguises. These are all things we learned from you guys. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Even Raon’s clenched front paws were full of sweat.</p>
<p>“I, I-”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Raon!”</p>
<p>The moment he heard Cale’s voice…</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>There was a large gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The whirlwind was so strong that the Bears were sent flying. Cale was standing at the center of the whirlwind.</p>
<p>Cale already had black blood in the corners of his mouth after continuously using his ancient powers.</p>
<p>Raon finally started speaking.</p>
<p>“H, human! Two of the sculptures are cracking!”</p>
<p>“It means that you’re already too late.”</p>
<p>Sayeru cheerily added on. He couldn’t help but smirk.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse has never experienced such failure!’</p>
<p>That fact was making him smile. He would have no regrets if he died while doing a lot for the greater good and landing a blow on this bastard.</p>
<p>“There are only one or two minutes left now.”</p>
<p>Sayeru looked at Raon and Cale as he added on.</p>
<p>“No matter what attacks you launch, no matter who you bring over, there is no way you will be able to destroy those sculptures in just two minutes. I will put my life on the line, no, all of us will put our lives on the line to stop you.”</p>
<p>The start of the great story they had been waiting 1,000 years for would start in just two minutes. Sayeru felt as if he would cry tears of joy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Raon was about to cry for a different reason.</p>
<p>‘It’s impossible!’</p>
<p>Even if they called people over, the summoning would finish while he contacted them.</p>
<p>Even if he used his magic, the enemies putting their lives on the line would be able to last at least one or two minutes.</p>
<p>“H, human, what do we do?”</p>
<p>Raon couldn’t help but look for Cale. Cale had always shown him the way. The only place for the young Dragon to retreat to was to Cale.</p>
<p>“Raon. Contact his highness. Do it now.”</p>
<p>Cale looked as calm as usual.</p>
<p>“Ha! Are you planning on calling over your allies? I told you that the summoning will finish while you do that.”</p>
<p>Sayeru sneered at Cale who looked just as pale, no, even worse than him.</p>
<p>However, Raon immediately did as Cale asked.</p>
<p>– Hmm?</p>
<p>Alberu had just stepped onto a teleportation magic circle to move to Puzzle City. His face stiffened while looking at the sight that appeared through the video communication device.</p>
<p>Choi Han and the strongest individuals from the palace who were by his side had the same reaction.</p>
<p>Through the video communication device in the floating Raon’s paws… They could see everything.</p>
<p>Cale knew that they could see everything and that Alberu would be able to understand what was going on.</p>
<p>“Your highness. The Dark Elves… Please send the Dark Elves and anybody else you think would be necessary to take care of things here.”</p>
<p>– Cale! I’ll send Eruhab-</p>
<p>“It is useless.”</p>
<p>It would be too late, no matter how quickly Eruhaben rushed over.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was already too late, as is.</p>
<p>“Kekeke. There’s less than one minute left!”</p>
<p>Cale felt as if the screams of ghosts swept over him like a tsunami along with Sayeru, Arm, and the Bears’ laughs.</p>
<p>“Human! I’ll try something!”</p>
<p>– …Cale. Even if it is useless-</p>
<p>Cale did not look at Raon, Alberu, or Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>– What?</p>
<p>“Two monsters at max will end up over there. Please be ready.”</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>The whirlwind swirled even harder around Cale. He was gathering the power of the wind and then gathering some more, as if he had turned into a rocket.</p>
<p>Raon subconsciously moved toward the whirlwind.</p>
<p>Alberu asked the question Raon wanted to ask.</p>
<p>– …What about the rest?</p>
<p>‘What about the two other monsters? What were they going to do about the two remaining sculptures?’</p>
<p>Cale answered calmly, as he always did.</p>
<p>“I will get rid of them.”</p>
<p>‘How?’</p>
<p>Alberu could not ask.</p>
<p>It was because Cale’s eyes that became visible for a moment through the whirlwind had turned strange. He couldn’t see Cale’s eye area clearly.</p>
<p>The area around Cale’s eyes seemed blurry, as if they were covered by haze. Alberu subconsciously grabbed Choi Han’s arm. He had an unexplainable sense that something terrible was about to happen.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>“…Human.”</p>
<p>Raon flinched at the unusual and unexplainable situation. But Raon looked ready to rush through the whirlwind and to Cale’s side after hearing what Cale said next.</p>
<p>“Raon, the moment I become unconscious… Move me to the Roan Kingdom immediately.”</p>
<p>“Human, you can’t fai-”</p>
<p>“Raon. Decisions need to be made in times like this.”</p>
<p>Cale put his hand up as if to tell Raon not to come. Raon froze in spot and looked toward Cale as Cale had never done that to him before.</p>
<p>– This is the limit.</p>
<p>The Sound of the Wind commented in her husky voice.</p>
<p>– The wind will soon roar as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The whirlwind had compressed and then compressed again to prepare to roar at its maximum speed.</p>
<p>Cale gathered his thoughts one last time in the middle of the whirlwind.</p>
<p>‘If all four unranked monsters go to the Roan Kingdom, we might be able to take care of them, but thousands, no, hundreds of thousands of people may die in the process. Actually, millions of people will die.’</p>
<p>Fighting normally against unranked monsters would take a long time.</p>
<p>They could only finish the battle quickly if they focused on the monsters’ weaknesses, as he had done while fighting against the Electric Eel.</p>
<p>However, it would be impossible to do that while fighting against four of them at once. The chances of the battles against the seventh and eighth unranked monsters, the two that they had no information on, lasting a long time were very high.</p>
<p>‘That is why decisions need to be made at times like this.’</p>
<p>Cale still had the time to make a decision.</p>
<p>One choice was for him to get hurt.</p>
<p>The other was for him to retreat.</p>
<p>“Raon. I’m someone who cannot forget.”</p>
<p>Raon had never heard Cale speaking so gently before.</p>
<p>Actually, even the people on the other side of the video communication device had never heard this gentle yet weak voice.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was someone who could not forget anything.</p>
<p>‘If I retreat right now, my people might get hurt. My home might get destroyed.’</p>
<p>If he retreats now and his people get hurt… If his home gets destroyed…</p>
<p>Cale could never forget that. The moment he made that decision it would be recorded and run in an endless loop.</p>
<p>‘What happens to certain people and the world because I hesitated thinking that I could suffer less… I will never be able to forget that.’</p>
<p>But if there was a reason Cale was thinking so hard about this right now…</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>It was because of the young Raon.</p>
<p>Raon could see Cale turning his head toward him.</p>
<p>But he could not see Cale’s eyes properly as they still seemed covered by haze. Raon opened his eyes wide trying to see Cale’s eyes, but he could only hear Cale’s voice properly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like me.”</p>
<p>Cale was giving Raon advice.</p>
<p>“Make different decisions than I’ve made.”</p>
<p>He alone was enough to live a life like this.</p>
<p>That was why, for the young Raon…</p>
<p>“You MUST rescue me and escape.”</p>
<p>He would make Raon make a different decision.</p>
<p>– Cale Henituse!</p>
<p>– Cale-nim!</p>
<p>“Kekeke. There’s less than ten seconds left now. What can you do in that time before running away?”</p>
<p>Sayeru sneered at Cale while Alberu and Choi Han were almost screaming after sensing something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Do you really think that your shitty wind can pierce its way through?! It won’t be able to reach inside!”</p>
<p>Sayeru suddenly flinched and closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile.</p>
<p>He could feel the wind.</p>
<p>“I’m relieved.”</p>
<p>A long time ago, when he went to see the Mercenaries Guild’s Directory… That was the first time Cale used Kim Rok Soo’s ‘Record’ ability.</p>
<p>He had brought over a portion of the Grade 1 ability user Kim Rok Soo’s abilities to this world and had realized he could use a portion of his multiple abilities in this world.</p>
<p>Then came the sealed god’s test.</p>
<p>His body had changed after going to the parallel world and defeating an unranked monster inside that twenty years old Kim Rok Soo’s body.</p>
<p>‘That portion became whole.’</p>
<p>A thick smile appeared on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>Cale’s first ability, ‘Record,’ heated his body and put a lot of pressure on his body, but his second ability gave him a much more serious pain.</p>
<p>‘It’ll be troublesome if I get overloaded. But I still have to use it.’</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-!</p>
<p>The remaining two sculptures started to crack as well.</p>
<p>Sayeru watched that sight and started shouting again.</p>
<p>“You guys are done for! Glory to our Endable-!”</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>The teleportation magic circle underneath the sculptures started vibrating and lighting up.</p>
<p>The sculptures started to crack even faster.</p>
<p>“W, what-”</p>
<p>As Raon stuttered without knowing what to do…</p>
<p>“Try not to look.”</p>
<p>Raon heard those words and stopped with his eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>No, something stopped him.</p>
<p>It felt as if the entire world had stopped.</p>
<p>It had not actually stopped, but it made him feel as if it had.</p>
<p>It was because there was someone who seemed to be moving in a different timeline.</p>
<p>Our young Dragon saw it.</p>
<p>In that very short period of time…</p>
<p>In that ‘instant’…</p>
<p>He saw someone shooting forward as if he was made of light.</p>
<p>That person was his human.</p>
<p>‘Instant.’</p>
<p>This was Cale, well, Kim Rok Soo’s second ability and the ability that allowed him to lead the attack team.</p>
<p>Someone had recorded some information about Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>[ Team leader Kim Rok Soo’s second ability, ‘Instant’ is an ability that transcends time. ]</p>
<p>[ The human brain is said to control the human body. ]</p>
<p>[ Kim Rok Soo's brain is able to push the human body to its limit, making him move at a speed that humans aren’t able to move in, allowing him to make movements that humans wouldn't normally be able to make. ]</p>
<p>[ It makes it look as if he is jumping through time and space. ]</p>
<p>[ He is the only person able to move in the world during that time. ]</p>
<p>[ That time only lasted an ‘instant’ as its name implied. He could only use it for about five seconds. ]</p>
<p>[ However, there was a price to pay for using this ability. Although this ability allowed him to break the laws of time and space, his body was unable to handle the impact. ]</p>
<p>One step.</p>
<p>Cale took another step forward as everything around him slowed down to the point it seemed as if they had stopped.</p>
<p>He couldn’t hear anything.</p>
<p>However, every time he took a step forward…</p>
<p>Crack-!</p>
<p>He could hear his body starting to break down.</p>
<p>Crack, crunch!</p>
<p>Legs, body, arm… His entire body was starting to get injuries as if he had received paper cuts all over his body.</p>
<p>Blood splattered like water behind him.</p>
<p>‘This body will become like Kim Rok Soo’s body. Actually, it’ll be even worse since Cale Henituse’s body is even weaker.’</p>
<p>The reason Kim Rok Soo’s entire body had been full of scars…</p>
<p>Cale thought about the biggest of many reasons he always needed to wear a long-sleeved shirt and couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
<p>‘Instant.’</p>
<p>It was a very short duration of time, but Cale was able to get past everything in his way.</p>
<p>He was the only one who was free during this moment.</p>
<p>He pushed forward with the help of the wind just before using his ability.</p>
<p>But even the wind stopped once he used ‘Instant.’</p>
<p>Cale was making movements that his body would normally never be able to make in this world where everything seemed to have stopped.</p>
<p>He jumped over the Bears and moved past them, as well as a shocked Sayeru.</p>
<p>His head hurt.</p>
<p>It felt as if it would explode.</p>
<p>He had a fever.</p>
<p>Cale, with his experience from being Kim Rok Soo, knew that he couldn’t close his eyes right now.</p>
<p>He moved toward his goal. He charged forward toward the sculptures.</p>
<p>‘3.’</p>
<p>The ‘instant’ given to him would not last very long.</p>
<p>He needed to achieve his goal before it ran out.</p>
<p>‘2.’</p>
<p>One foot forward. One step.</p>
<p>His legs, arms, body… Every muscle in his body felt as if they would rip apart.</p>
<p>But he continued moving.</p>
<p>‘1.’</p>
<p>And as that ‘instant’ was coming to an end…</p>
<p>The haze covering Cale’s eyes disappeared. He reached his hand out and grabbed the sculpture in front of him.</p>
<p>15 seconds. He should have about fifteen seconds left if Sayeru had been telling the truth.</p>
<p>His hand was covered in blood from numerous cuts. Cale felt as if everything was turning red.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff.”</p>
<p>He was having trouble breathing. He could barely lift the sculpture using every ounce of strength left in his body.</p>
<p>Soon…</p>
<p>He would definitely faint soon.</p>
<p>However, there was something he needed to do before that.</p>
<p>The sculptures were glowing.</p>
<p>He could not use his ancient powers, nor could he call his friends.</p>
<p>There was only one way to destroy these things.</p>
<p>“This is the only thing I can grab.”</p>
<p>He used the sculpture he grabbed with both hands to strike down on another sculpture.</p>
<p>This was one way to destroy the sculptures of the unranked monsters.</p>
<p>He could use the sculptures of other unranked monsters to strike down and destroy them both.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The sculpture of the seventh unranked monster struck down on the second unranked monster, and the second sculpture crumbled into pieces.</p>
<p>“N, no—-!”</p>
<p>The world was moving as normal again. Cale turned his gaze toward his next goal as he heard Sayeru’s shout.</p>
<p>The person covered in blood was moving his tired body on top of the circular altar.</p>
<p>He could not stop, and he could not retreat.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Wow, Cale’s second ability is… so … painful.</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 647 – We cannot retreat 3</p>
<p>‘There are three sculptures left now. There’s the first sculpture and the eighth sculpture…’</p>
<p>The third was the sculpture of the seventh unranked monster in Cale’s hand.</p>
<p>‘I must destroy the seventh and eighth sculptures!’</p>
<p>Those were the two strongest monsters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cale did not have any data on them as he had never faced them before.</p>
<p>Numerous thoughts flew through Cale’s mind in a short period of time. However, hot breath came out of his mouth every time he took a step and he was having trouble breathing.</p>
<p>It felt as if his senses were slowly fading away.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>However, Cale continued to move.</p>
<p>He had an ominous feeling after the second sculpture crumbled so easily.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>The sculpture of the seventh monster in his hand cracked a little more. Red smoke was starting to seep out from the crack. It was as red as blood.</p>
<p>One step.</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes recorded everything as he took another step forward.</p>
<p>It recorded the destroyed sculpture of the second unranked monster on the ground. The sculpture that had been dyed grey returned to its original color on the ground.</p>
<p>The eerie smoke that used to come out of the cracked areas was no more.</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>Cale stepped on that sculpture and moved forward.</p>
<p>He was looking at the eighth sculpture.</p>
<p>He headed toward the strongest unranked monster.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff.”</p>
<p>He was having trouble breathing.</p>
<p>After having used, ‘Instant,’ his brain had overloaded, and he did not have the strength or focus to use ‘Record’ or ‘Embrace.’</p>
<p>Unlike the other sculptures, a holy white light was coming out of the cracks on the eighth sculpture.</p>
<p>It felt as if he had seen this color somewhere before, which made him scared.</p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>His heart was beating extremely wildly just because he saw the white light flowing out.</p>
<p>“Huff, huff.”</p>
<p>Cale raised both hands.</p>
<p>His entire body was shaking.</p>
<p>The eighth sculpture… He couldn’t even fathom how long it took him to get in front of it. It felt like an eternity to him, but it would have only been an instant for the others.</p>
<p>– Cale! Y, your body right now-</p>
<p>– You should only use the Vitality of the Heart! The moment you use anything else…! Ah, damn it, I don’t know!</p>
<p>– …Shit. Your plate! Cale, don’t use any ancient powers nor other abilities! Forget breaking, your plate is going to melt!</p>
<p>– You crazy bastard! Why would you use an ability like this?! Do you want to die?!</p>
<p>The ancient powers were unable to hide their anxiety and screamed at Cale.</p>
<p>But even their voices sounded extremely far away to Cale.</p>
<p>Oooooong- oooooong- ooooooong-</p>
<p>All he could hear was the buzzing noise that let him know that his condition was not normal.</p>
<p>Squeeze.</p>
<p>The sculpture of the seventh monster in his hand moved toward the eighth sculpture.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“You crazy bastard! Noooooo!”</p>
<p>Cale could see a bright light heading toward him. He immediately cast his shield.</p>
<p>– Cale! Don’t use anymore ancient powers!</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>Cale could faintly hear the Super Rock’s shaking voice and the loud explosion.</p>
<p>He turned his head.</p>
<p>Sayeru, who looked like a devil, was screaming and charging toward him from the direction the light spear had come from.</p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaah! Kill him!”</p>
<p>The Bears, Arm members, and numerous other enemies approached Cale from all around the circular altar to kill him.</p>
<p>But none of them were as angry as Sayeru.</p>
<p>“I will at least kill you!”</p>
<p>‘HOW?!’</p>
<p>Sayeru could not understand how Cale Henituse managed to get on top of the altar in an instant. It looked as if Cale Henituse was moving at a different speed for an instant.</p>
<p>Once he saw Cale Henituse destroy one of the sculptures…</p>
<p>He became scared.</p>
<p>This was the first time he was scared of Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>A fear even greater than his anger made Sayeru rush to kill Cale.</p>
<p>Sayeru had a light spear in his hand as he charged toward Cale Henituse, who was barely standing. He swung his arm toward the crazy bastard who was covered in numerous injuries and blood.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“…This stupid Dragon bastard!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a small body got in Sayeru’s way.</p>
<p>The black Dragon was dripping tears from both eyes but still viciously glared at Sayeru.</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>Raon, who had cast a teleportation magic circle so that he could teleport at any moment, gathered his black mana around his body and got in Sayeru’s way.</p>
<p>Raon heard Cale’s weak voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>There was another sharp noise that came from on top of the altar at the same time.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>It was the sound of a sculpture breaking.</p>
<p>“…Ah……”</p>
<p>Sayeru staggered.</p>
<p>The seventh sculpture… It crumbled like glass and scattered into the air. Sayeru lost his mind for a moment seeing that the sculpture was completely destroyed to the point that he couldn’t even gather the pieces.</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>As for Cale, he frowned.</p>
<p>He had struck down on the eighth sculpture with the seventh sculpture.</p>
<p>However, the seventh sculpture broke even worse than the other sculpture he had broken moments before.</p>
<p>‘Fuck!’</p>
<p>He swore internally.</p>
<p>That ominous feeling had been accurate.</p>
<p>Cale had felt that it was weird that the second sculpture broke so easily.</p>
<p>How did that happen when Cale didn’t have much strength in his body?</p>
<p>The answer was simple.</p>
<p>‘The second sculpture crumbled so easily because the seventh sculpture is stronger than it.’</p>
<p>The eighth sculpture was so much stronger than the seventh that the seventh was the one to break when Cale slammed down with it.</p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>
<p>He coughed up blood once again. Blood dripped down the side of his lips.</p>
<p>His gaze was still focused on the eighth sculpture despite the pain.</p>
<p>‘…I need to destroy it……!’</p>
<p>The moment he took one step forward…</p>
<p>“Motherfucking bastards!”</p>
<p>Cale could see Sayeru covering the eighth sculpture with his body. Sayeru looked terrible right now as well.</p>
<p>Cale flinched before taking another step.</p>
<p>– No! Cale, don’t use us!</p>
<p>The moment he tried to use an ancient power…</p>
<p>“Gasp!”</p>
<p>Cale’s body staggered.</p>
<p>He clenched his head. His fever was so hot that his head felt like it would explode.</p>
<p>He was at his limit.</p>
<p>Cale finally realized his condition.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Increase the sacrifices!”</p>
<p>One of the priests shouted.</p>
<p>‘The Dark Elves-!’</p>
<p>Cale thought that he couldn’t let any more Dark Elves die.</p>
<p>The remaining Dark Elves had been shaking in fear while looking at the empty carriages. There were too many Dark Elves here who had not fought against Cale or the Mercenaries Guild to call them all his enemies.</p>
<p>And even if they were his enemies, he couldn’t let them die as sacrifices.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He heard a terrible scream.</p>
<p>However, it was not from the Dark Elves.</p>
<p>The priest who had shouted for them to increase the number of sacrifices… Had taken his own life.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>Screeeeech- screeeech—- screeeeeech-</p>
<p>A new chilling noise that was much worse than anything he heard earlier pierced through Cale’s ears. The screeching was so terrible that it even made him forget about his headache.</p>
<p>He lifted his head up.</p>
<p>The grey mouth was big enough to cover the entire sinkhole now.</p>
<p>The terrible screech was coming from inside the mouth.</p>
<p>Craaaack-</p>
<p>Light shot out from the eighth sculpture that Sayeru was hugging.</p>
<p>The same thing was happening with the first sculpture.</p>
<p>The sculpture split in half in what Cale felt was an instant.</p>
<p>“Kahahahahaha!”</p>
<p>Sayeru laughed maniacally as he moved away from the sculpture.</p>
<p>It was as if Cale’s attacks would not matter anymore.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-</p>
<p>Black smoke could be seen as the teleportation black magic circle underneath the altar activated.</p>
<p>Cale could see the white light and the blue gold smoke that came out of the two sculptures quickly taking shape.</p>
<p>They were not taking the form of small sculptures, but that of large monsters.</p>
<p>‘They’re coming.’</p>
<p>Those monster bastards were headed to the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>– Cale, we told you to stop using any ancient powers!</p>
<p>Unlike Cale’s other abilities, he could still use his ancient powers regardless of whether it burdened his body or not. That was why Cale could not stop.</p>
<p>A faint fiery thunderbolt shot out toward the white light.</p>
<p>Pssssssssss-</p>
<p>However, that fiery thunderbolt disappeared before it could reach the white light.</p>
<p>Screech- screech-</p>
<p>The screeching grey mouth had eaten it.</p>
<p>Even Raon’s strong mana attack was eaten by it as well.</p>
<p>“Kekekekeke! How could a mere human stop the cries of the God of Despair?!”</p>
<p>Sayeru continued to laugh maniacally.</p>
<p>‘Success!’</p>
<p>The grey mouth. As long as the eerie cries came out of the God of Despair…until that cry called forth the monsters… Nothing would be able to stop this ritual until the monsters were completely summoned now.</p>
<p>That despair would eat anything that tried to do so.</p>
<p>‘Of course, this grey mouth is just a half-powered one.’</p>
<p>It had many flaws, as it was a ritual using a sealed god.</p>
<p>That was why Sayeru predicted that it would not work many times against Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>However, all he needed was once. He just needed it to work one time, and although it was only a fourth of the original number, he had successfully summoned some monsters.</p>
<p>“This is really the end.”</p>
<p>Sayeru seemed to be telling Cale that he could not stop it.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Motherf-”</p>
<p>Cale’s body staggered.</p>
<p>“Human.”</p>
<p>Raon supported Cale’s body.</p>
<p>Cale looked down at Raon, who snuggled into his chest to support him.</p>
<p>His eyes that made everything look red were turning white.</p>
<p>It was time for him to faint.</p>
<p>However, Cale could not do that.</p>
<p>Raon spoke to Cale, who couldn’t even tell that his tears were drenching his clothes.</p>
<p>“Human, you destroyed two sculptures as you promised.”</p>
<p>He kept his word even though his entire body broke down in the process.</p>
<p>“The crown prince and Choi Han told me. They said it is time to bring you back.”</p>
<p>Raon raised his head. He could see Cale’s blurry eyes.</p>
<p>They looked as if he could not process what was happening properly.</p>
<p>Raon had never seen Cale’s eyes looking like this before.</p>
<p>Raon needed to make a decision at this moment.</p>
<p>Would he stay here and stop that first and eighth sculpture no matter what it took?</p>
<p>Or will he take Cale, who looked as if he could die at any moment, and escape?</p>
<p>Raon quickly made his decision.</p>
<p>Cale had already given him the answer.</p>
<p>“Human, you told me to immediately take you and run away.”</p>
<p>Raon decided to listen to Cale’s orders.</p>
<p>For Raon, saving one person, saving Cale, was the most important thing in the world, even more important than saving everybody else.</p>
<p>Cale was the one who gave Raon the chance to see the world.</p>
<p>Raon could never forget the arms that carried him and took him out of that cave.</p>
<p>“…Raon.”</p>
<p>Cale looked into Raon’s eyes as his sight continued to go white to the point that he could only see a small speck.</p>
<p>Those dark blue eyes were firm.</p>
<p>Cale wanted to smile. However, he didn’t even have the strength to do that. That’s why his expression ended up an odd mess as Cale closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t destroy the eighth and first sculptures…</p>
<p>Although he had no information whatsoever on the eighth sculpture…</p>
<p>He did as much as he could, and he had allies.</p>
<p>His people also had the strength to take on these monsters.</p>
<p>He released his strength, and his body limped.</p>
<p>The black magic circle activated at that moment.</p>
<p>The blue gold smoke and the white light started teleporting.</p>
<p>Raon cast his teleportation at that moment as well.</p>
<p>“…I …leave it to you……”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, human!”</p>
<p>Raon answered energetically, and the two of them disappeared from the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>It had happened a few seconds after the black magic circle had activated.</p>
<p>Everything that had happened had been captured by a video communication device that was rolling around on the grounds of the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>Raon had placed the video communication device on the ground a moment ago when he blocked Sayeru.</p>
<p>The images captured by the video communication device were all sent to a single place, the video communication device in Alberu’s hand.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Alberu dropped the video communication device in his hand.</p>
<p>He had missed a few things because he had to teleport in the middle, but he saw all the important parts.</p>
<p>Clang-!</p>
<p>The video communication device fell to the ground and broke into pieces.</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness?”</p>
<p>Alberu heard Choi Han’s response as he stepped forward.</p>
<p>The City Hall was the largest building in Puzzle City. The mayor’s office terrace at City Hall was a spot where everything in Puzzle City was visible.</p>
<p>“Everybody is busy.”</p>
<p>The chief executives who had seen about half of what had happened because they were with Alberu and Choi Han and urgently rushed to their positions after seeing Cale’s entire body gushing blood.</p>
<p>Alberu looked down at Puzzle City.</p>
<p>The entire city was empty other than the soldiers.</p>
<p>A black magic circle suddenly appeared at the center of the city and a blue gold smoke and white light burst out as if they were exploding.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“…We’re here.”</p>
<p>Raon and Cale appeared on the terrace.</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t even bear to look at the terrible condition Cale was in as Raon gently carried him.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>“I know it was tough.”</p>
<p>Choi Han had a calm expression on his face as he received Cale from Raon. He then laid Cale down on the bed they had prepared in the office.</p>
<p>Choi Han heard Alberu’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Choi Han, you’re confident, right?”</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at Alberu.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman was wearing white armor and a white helmet. The white spear was already in his hand.</p>
<p>Choi Han started speaking as he walked over to Alberu.</p>
<p>“We’ve already killed one bastard before.”</p>
<p>The monster appearing inside that blue gold smoke…</p>
<p>That was that same unranked monster, the Electric Eel.</p>
<p>Choi Han had fought against that bastard before.</p>
<p>As for the eighth unranked monster that was said to be the strongest…</p>
<p>“As for the other bastard, your weapon was made with that bastard’s bones, right your highness?”</p>
<p>Alberu looked at Choi Han, who was wearing black leather armor. The shining black aura was already coming out of his sword.</p>
<p>“Yes. My weapon was created by the bone they gathered after killing that bastard.”</p>
<p>– That is right, master. That is why I am a great EX-Grade weapon.</p>
<p>The Unbreakable Spear in Alberu’s hand…</p>
<p>Taerang, the AI inside the spear, continued speaking.</p>
<p>– As mentioned before, this item was created from the bones of an Ex-Grade monster, which have been designated as the most terrible monsters. It has significant durability and is the only thing that is capable of breaking that monster’s bones.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu chuckled.</p>
<p>He addressed Choi Han, who was smiling the same way as if he had seen Alberu’s smile underneath his helmet.</p>
<p>He was not laughing because he wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>It was not because he found this situation funny nor because it was amusing.</p>
<p>It was because he could not cry and because he needed to receive the baton.</p>
<p>Alberu and Choi Han…</p>
<p>The two of them knew why Cale had contacted them in the middle of that situation. He was leaving the rest to the two people who had seen a portion of his life as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>That was why they needed to put an end to it.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse created the best, no, the situation with the greatest chance of success.”</p>
<p>He didn’t know whether Cale intended it to be like this or not. However, the first and eighth monsters were a better match for them compared to the second and seventh monsters.</p>
<p>They had the power to go up against these two monsters.</p>
<p>“The others will be here soon. Shouldn’t we do our part now that Cale Henituse has set the field for us?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Alberu and Choi Han…</p>
<p>The two men kicked off the terrace railing and charged forward.</p>
<p>They were headed toward the two large unranked monsters that had appeared in the Puzzle City plaza.</p>

<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>WHO CUT THE ONIONS?!!! SOOOOOOOB</p>
<p>What will happen next? </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 648 – We cannot retreat 4</p>
<p>Boom-!</p>
<p>The ground felt as if it would crumble from the shaking.</p>
<p>“That, that-”</p>
<p>“…Oh, God……”</p>
<p>The knights couldn’t even feel the ground shaking as they were too busy looking up, dazed by what they were looking at.</p>
<p>These knights had prepared themselves to charge forward toward the enemies at any moment, waiting for the order to move.</p>
<p>They were here to protect the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>They had come here without any hesitation.</p>
<p>For my kingdom, my friends, my family… Their steps were heavy on this path to save everyone but they had the courage to move forward.</p>
<p>“I, it really is a m, monster……”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what they imagined was different from reality.</p>
<p>“Shhhhhhhhhhhhh–”</p>
<p>“Chhhhhh— chhh—”</p>
<p>A snake and an eel…</p>
<p>The monster that seemed to be something between those two had two heads. One was a blue while the other was yellow.</p>
<p>The monster had horns and fangs and was the size of an adult Dragon. They had never seen such a weird monster before. It was a terrible monster they could only see in their imaginations or mythologies. It looked like the type of monster that would appear as a final boss a hero must defeat in a novel.</p>
<p>But at least this snake-thing looked like a monster.</p>
<p>The thing that scared the knights was not this two-headed snake.</p>
<p>“…Ah…unbelievable……”</p>
<p>“…That’s a monster……?”</p>
<p>The creature that appeared in this world in a bright white light…</p>
<p>That monster had eight Dragon wings and Dragon scales.</p>
<p>It also had a lion’s head with a lustrous mane and claws sharper than those of Eagles.</p>
<p>It walked on two feet and the ground pressed down once its two feet touched down.</p>
<p>Boom, boooooom-</p>
<p>The plaza was barely big enough for the two-headed snake; the buildings started to break down once the lion-headed monster descended as well.</p>
<p>“…Unbelievable……”</p>
<p>But this monster looked so holy.</p>
<p>The monster’s eyes glowed gold while the Dragon scales covering the monster’s body and its mane were bright white.</p>
<p>If the two-headed snake looked like a villain from a myth, this monster looked like a warrior that protected the gods.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The lion silently looked around with its gold eyes.</p>
<p>The knight felt as if he had lost all strength in his legs just because the lion looked in his direction.</p>
<p>“…A Dragon…it looks stronger than a Dragon.”</p>
<p>His superiors did tell him about it.</p>
<p>He was told that they would have to fight against the worst monster ever. He was told that these monsters would be stronger than Dragons and that they all needed to give their best as these monsters might be from the Demon World.</p>
<p>His superiors had been right.</p>
<p>These truly were the worst monsters, looked stronger than Dragons, and were not from this world.</p>
<p>‘…Our best? Is this something we can defeat by giving our best?</p>
<p>Forget giving our best, I feel like I’m going to die the moment I charge forward.’</p>
<p>The knight couldn’t think about anything else as he was drowning in fear and anxiety from the overwhelming monster’s presence.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn’t look at the soldiers following him.</p>
<p>“H, holy shit-”</p>
<p>“We’re all dead! We’re all going to die! Look at that! Nobody will be able to defeat that thing!”</p>
<p>“…Do you think that we are the only ones who will die? The entire continent will turn into a mess!”</p>
<p>The soldiers holding their weapons were shaking in fear.</p>
<p>‘We can’t do it.</p>
<p>We can’t fight it.</p>
<p>We are not enough.’</p>
<p>They didn’t have the courage to charge forward.</p>
<p>“W, who would be able to charge toward t, that monster? T, this is impossibl-”</p>
<p>This is impossible.</p>
<p>A soldier lost strength in his hand as he was about to say that.</p>
<p>Clang-!</p>
<p>His sword fell to the ground. However, the soldier could not even think about picking it back up as he pointed toward the sky.</p>
<p>“…Your highness?”</p>
<p>A person in white armor was jumping across the roofs toward the monster.</p>
<p>“…Swordsman-nim-”</p>
<p>Next to him was a swordsman whose black hair was fluttering in the air. His black aura was around his sword as he moved toward their enemy, the monster, without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Those two must be crown prince Alberu Crossman and Choi Han, the youngest sword master.</p>
<p>One person had an extremely bright white spear.</p>
<p>The other had something that they knew was a sword, but it was sparkling like a starry night sky because of his shining black aura.</p>
<p>“…Shit.”</p>
<p>The knight finally snapped out of it after seeing the two of them. He bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>His lower lip started to bleed. However, the knight felt as if he could think properly again after tasting blood.</p>
<p>His eyes, and the eyes of all of the leaders standing in front of their troops throughout Puzzle City, became focused on the backs of these two people.</p>
<p>One person was wearing armor with the Roan Kingdom’s crest while the other had light leather armor on and only had a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>This white knight and black knight looked extremely different from each other.</p>
<p>However, the people looking at their backs felt the same emotion from both men.</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>Clang-!</p>
<p>The knight swore as he pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>The soldier who had dropped his sword bent down and picked it up.</p>
<p>Their leader, the Knight Captain, moved from the back of the group to the front.</p>
<p>He had shown up later than the rest as he was busy coming up with a strategy with the other leaders. He shouted as he moved to the front of the group.</p>
<p>“There are only two of them!”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain looked at the back of his liege who had charged forward before him and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Everybody should remember that there were originally supposed to be eight of those monsters!”</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Alberu had prepared for the worst after hearing that the summoning would take place in Puzzle City. That was why the knights and soldiers had been training as if eight monsters would invade Puzzle City.</p>
<p>“You should have also heard that the eight became four and then decreased again to two!”</p>
<p>This was also true.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain looked at the soldiers listening to him and closed his eyes for a moment before opening them back. He was feeling emotional.</p>
<p>However, he shouted without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Thanks to former Commander Sir Cale Henituse fighting in front, we only have to face two of the eight monsters!”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain was calling Cale Sir Cale Henituse even though Cale was not a knight. It was a form of respect and there was nobody here who had any issues with that.</p>
<p>“And now, his highness and Sir Choi Han will be in the front to fight against these two monsters!”</p>
<p>The fact that his liege, the person he should protect, and a swordsman who was younger than him was leading the fight in front of them made the Knight Captain forget his fears of the monsters.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect a lot from you! Maintain your positions! Do your part!”</p>
<p>That was the hardest thing to do in battle.</p>
<p>However, the Knight Captain couldn’t help but shout like that.</p>
<p>He was saying it to himself as well.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Boooooooom-</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion that made their ears ring.</p>
<p>The black aura charged toward the first unranked monster, the Electric Eel, as if it was a thunderbolt shooting up from the ground.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh–!”</p>
<p>“Ssss!”</p>
<p>The two snakes’ eyes headed toward Choi Han, the owner of the black aura that had attacked them.</p>
<p>However, Choi Han was already preparing his next attack.</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>As if it was an imugi’s last breath on Earth before it ascended to the heavens… A black Yong revealed itself wrapped around Choi Han’s sword and his body.</p>
<p>Choi Han opened his mouth while looking at the two headed snake looking at him.</p>
<p>“I will take care of this thing quickly and then join you soon, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu touched his spear and asked.</p>
<p>“Can you take care of it on your own? You couldn’t do it alone last time.”</p>
<p>“…I will at least try.”</p>
<p>Choi Han could not be certain that he could take care of it alone.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel’s scales were so sturdy that Choi Han couldn’t slash through it with his aura. It just had a few places Choi Han could aim for, such as its horn and inside its mouth.</p>
<p>‘The question is whether I can attack those spots on my own.’</p>
<p>Choi Han thought about how Cale had tied the Electric Eel up last time he aimed for those weaknesses. The help of their many allies on Earth made that fight possible.</p>
<p>Choi Han didn’t share that part with Alberu.</p>
<p>“…Will you be okay on your own?”</p>
<p>Choi Han instead asked Alberu in a concerned tone.</p>
<p>“We’ve already discussed this.”</p>
<p>Other than Cale, Choi Han knew the most about the Electric Eel.</p>
<p>As for Alberu, he was the person best suited to take on this eighth unranked monster.</p>
<p>“We can’t let either of these monsters get out of Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>That was why Choi Han and Alberu… The two of them stood in front of everybody else to tie these two monsters down.</p>
<p>That was the first and most urgent matter.</p>
<p>“I will take care of it quickly and then help you, your highness.”</p>
<p>“Choi Han. Don’t push yourself too hard alone.”</p>
<p>Choi Han turned around to look at Alberu after hearing his name.</p>
<p>This time, Alberu looked at the enemy he was to face and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“…Don’t die. We will find the answer if we stay alive and keep fighting. We can’t have anybody else push themselves too hard.”</p>
<p>“That is what I wish to say to you, your highness.”</p>
<p>Choi Han then left Alberu’s side and charged toward the two-headed snake.</p>
<p>He reached his sword out.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The black Yong followed his sword and jumped out of the tip of the sword to charge toward the monster with its jaw open. It seemed as ferocious as the two-headed snake.</p>
<p>“My instructor-nim sure is strong.”</p>
<p>Alberu mischievously commented before grabbing his spear and charging forward as well.</p>
<p>‘I need to see what this monster is capable of first.’</p>
<p>He needed to test the strength of this monster that was quietly standing there and looking down at him. That was the first priority.</p>
<p>– This monster was called the Lion Dragon on Earth 3.</p>
<p>Alberu cast his magic while listening to Taerang’s voice.</p>
<p>Paaaat-</p>
<p>A gold light that resembled the rays of the sun covered the white spear and made it look as if Alberu was swinging a beam of light toward the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang—!</p>
<p>There was another loud explosion.</p>
<p>“…Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>Alberu laughed at the end of that explosion.</p>
<p>– The scary thing about the Lion Dragon is that it uses a weapon. It uses a weapon even though it has a strong body, sharp claws, and numerous other abilities.</p>
<p>Alberu sighed while looking at the weapon that blocked his spear.</p>
<p>– And that weapon is a shield.</p>
<p>A Holy White Shield had suddenly appeared in the Lion Dragon’s hands.</p>
<p>It made him think about a certain someone’s silver shield.</p>
<p>– We call that shield the Unbreakable Shield. That is why this spear that was made from that monster’s bone is called the Unbreakable Spear.</p>
<p>Taerang stoically continued speaking.</p>
<p>– Seven nights and eight days. We were finally able to kill the Lion Dragon after seven long nights and eight days. Thousands of people died and an area ten times the size of Seoul became desolate, unable to be restored ever again.</p>
<p>– That was why the monster ranking that had stopped at SSS-Grade had changed to include the EX-Grade for the first time.</p>
<p>The smile disappeared from Alberu’s face. His eyes that were cold with anger stared out the helmet and into the monster’s gold eyes.</p>
<p>“…The Unbreakable Shield, huh? It has a similar name but it is used so differently.”</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t even make a scratch on the monster’s white shield.</p>
<p>– The Unbreakable Spear is able to pierce through the Lion Dragon’s hide and bones which are said to be the strongest among all monsters. However, it is unable to break that shield.</p>
<p>Taerang added on in an emotionless voice.</p>
<p>– Based on your current strength… Your chances of victory is 0%. 1 hour. Master, should you and swordsman Choi Han fight to your deaths, you will be able to last one hour.</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Alberu laughed again.</p>
<p>Even if he and Choi Han died, they would only be able to last one hour. That showed the strength of this Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>– Do you really have no thoughts of running away?</p>
<p>Don’t you want to live?</p>
<p>Alberu looked into the Lion Dragon’s gold eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe this monster didn’t have much thought about fighting or it might be thinking about something else as it just silently looked down at Alberu.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang- baaaaang–</p>
<p>Alberu clenched his spear as he could hear the fight happening nearby.</p>
<p>Choi Han truly was giving his best, yes, he was fighting without caring about his own life. Alberu could tell by the sounds.</p>
<p>It was obvious that Choi Han would soon reach his limit but he continued to attack not using his regular aura but his black Yong, desperately looking for any openings to attack the two-headed snake’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>Alberu responded to Taerang’s question about whether he wanted to live.</p>
<p>“…I will live. I will definitely live.”</p>
<p>‘I, the others, our kingdom…</p>
<p>And even this world.’</p>
<p>Oooooooong- ooooooong-</p>
<p>Light shot out of the white spear once again. The area around Alberu started to shake. Regular mana and not dead mana activated intensely in his magic.</p>
<p>– Master, you really meant that.</p>
<p>Alberu, who was prepared to give it his all as Choi Han was already doing, charged toward the monster once again.</p>
<p>The monster just raised its large shield to block the puny Alberu.</p>
<p>Baaa- baaaaang, baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Alberu continued to attack, hoping to either pierce the shield or to dodge the shield and get closer to the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon frowned. The monster seemed to be observing the spear before swinging the shield differently from before.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang–!</p>
<p>The loudest explosion to this moment could be heard and Alberu’s body was flung backward.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>His body crashed into a building wall. The monster, not just defending but using the shield to smack him was so strong that Alberu could not even control his body as it got sent flying.</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>‘It is strong.</p>
<p>It is too strong.’</p>
<p>– Master, are you okay?</p>
<p>Alberu closed his eyes for a moment feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>It was at that moment. His eyes jolted open.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii– piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii–</p>
<p>He heard the sound of a flute.</p>
<p>“He’s finally here.”</p>
<p>Alberu stood up. Crumble. The debris from the wall fell off his body.</p>
<p>He didn’t pay any attention to his crushed armor and turned toward the direction of the flute.</p>
<p>The sound of the flute was coming from the North.</p>
<p>He could soon see a large wyvern appearing in the sky above Puzzle City.</p>
<p>There were four people on the wyvern’s back.</p>
<p>“I guess we are the first to arrive.”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>A water whip cut through the air before the master of the whip alighted to the ground.</p>
<p>Witira, the future Whale Queen. She smiled brightly toward Choi Han and Alberu who were looking at her.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Two men alighted behind her. The Whale Archie and the half-blooded Whale Paseton looked at the two monsters before speaking.</p>
<p>“Wow. These monsters look like they would be fun to beat up.”</p>
<p>“Mm. I guess we’ll need to fight them first.”</p>
<p>After the Dragons… The Whale tribe was said to be the strongest of the Beast people.</p>
<p>As for the wyvern master who brought the Whales over…</p>
<p>“We cannot be late on the path to becoming a legend. A true hero is there first to progress with the legend.”</p>
<p>Guardian Knight Clopeh Sekka blew the flute.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiii– piiiiiii-</p>
<p>More wyverns with knights on them would head over after hearing the flute.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>However, Clopeh felt an eerie aura and stopped playing the flute.</p>
<p>He turned his head.</p>
<p>He looked toward the Eastern sky.</p>
<p>Something black was rising up like the sun over the horizon and getting closer.</p>
<p>Clopeh started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Bone Dragon?”</p>
<p>Alberu looked toward the Eastern sky and smiled.</p>
<p>It was a black Bone Dragon with a sturdy armor on top of its black bones.</p>
<p>The Dragon’s eyes were glowing white gold. It was the same color as the Dragon half-blood’s light attribute.</p>
<p>And on top of that large Bone Dragon that was flying freely as if it was a living Dragon… Who else would it be but Mary, the one and only necromancer in the world?</p>
<p>The sleeves of her black robe were fluttering and two people were standing behind her.</p>
<p>Alberu immediately figured out who they were.</p>
<p>“…The Dragons are here.”</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben and Mila.</p>
<p>The Dragons were here.</p>
<p>Alberu clenched his fists.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and then opened them again.</p>
<p>They were just the start.</p>
<p>Their allies should be coming from all over the continent right now.</p>
<p>“…It’s worth trying.”</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman, the man who would be recorded as a great king in the near future, did not doubt their victory anymore.</p>
<p>The reason this war becomes known as the greatest battle in the future is because this was not just a battle for the humans. It was a battle that involved all living beings throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Humans. Many different types of Beast people. Those who were shunned for having the Darkness attribute. Mysterious creatures that people had heard about but had never seen before.</p>
<p>They would all fight in this war and this would be the start of how all creatures living on the continent become aware of each other and live together.</p>
<p>In the future, the person who gathered all these different races together would be called the beginning and the end of everything.</p>
<p>But that person, Cale Henituse, was currently lying on a bed unable to open his eyes.</p>
<p>“…Haaa…ha……”</p>
<p>The man whose breath was heavy and hot was lying in bed with Raon unable to leave his side.</p>
<p>Raon turned his head for a moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>A fierce battle was happening outside the terrace.</p>

<p>Chapter 649 – We cannot retreat 5</p>
<p>Choi Han and the two-headed snake were in an intense battle. Alberu’s side seemed to be at a standstill.</p>
<p>However, the battlefield wasn’t the problem for Raon.</p>
<p>The eighth unranked monster… And the first unranked monster…</p>
<p>Raon stared at the large monsters that were no longer sculptures before turning his head.</p>
<p>“…Human.”</p>
<p>“Haaa……haaaaa…haaaaa.”</p>
<p>Cale’s breath was hot and heavy and his body was covered in dry blood.</p>
<p>“…Human, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Raon grabbed a corner of the blanket and brought it up to Cale’s nose. Cale’s nose was bleeding.</p>
<p>“This is weird. This is very weird.”</p>
<p>He usually showed some signs of healing at this point when he fainted like this in the past. But it was different this time.</p>
<p>His injuries were closing very slowly unlike usual. There were no changes even when he poured a potion on him.</p>
<p>He also had a terrible fever and his nose and ears kept bleeding.</p>
<p>Raon thought Cale might die from loss of blood. Raon wasn’t the only one worried about this.</p>
<p>– Cale, Cale! Can you hear us?</p>
<p>– …No. You need to hurry up and wake up!</p>
<p>– Hey, Super Rock! Stop talking! Nobody other than the Vitality of the Heart do anything right now!</p>
<p>The ancient powers that tried to talk to the unconscious Cale stopped after hearing the Sound of the Wind’s voice.</p>
<p>The Vitality of the Heart that had been eaten, no, that became a part of the Indestructible Shield…</p>
<p>Only that power was faintly using its power with Cale’s heart at its focus so that it wouldn’t burden his body.</p>
<p>– …Apparently it’s not working.</p>
<p>The glutton priestess of the shield weakly mumbled.</p>
<p>– Apparently the restoration is not working well. It looks like Cale needs to wake up. I think we need Cale’s will.</p>
<p>The Super Rock made a comment.</p>
<p>– Cale. Please wake up. Please.</p>
<p>Unfortunate, neither the voices of the ancient powers nor Raon could reach Cale.</p>
<p>Raon clasped his two front paws together after seeing no movement in Cale’s body.</p>
<p>“Human.”</p>
<p>He felt as if he could see that scene again when he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>An instant.</p>
<p>Cale had pushed forward doing something even a Dragon could not do for a very short period of time.</p>
<p>The drops of blood that couldn’t even fall to the floor during that time created a red path behind him.</p>
<p>The drops of blood were so red that they looked like flower petals fluttering in the wind, but they were too terrible and painful to be called beautiful.</p>
<p>“…I……”</p>
<p>Raon clenched his paws even tighter.</p>
<p>‘If I was a little stronger…’</p>
<p>He was thinking that Cale wouldn’t have had to push himself so hard if that was the case.</p>
<p>‘If I was stronger, I, instead of the human-’</p>
<p>Raon shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He released his clenched front paws.</p>
<p>“…I can’t have such thoughts.”</p>
<p>Raon was young but he knew.</p>
<p>“I am a great and mighty Dragon. I know what our human was thinking.”</p>
<p>This stupid human who never seemed to care about his own health definitely did not want Raon to do the same thing he just did.</p>
<p>That was why Raon couldn’t think that he could have stepped forward in Cale’s place if he was stronger.</p>
<p>What his human, what Cale wanted was not for Raon to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>Cale had always said the following.</p>
<p>Fight with an overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>If not, run and smack them from behind later.</p>
<p>Raon noticed the hidden meaning behind those words.</p>
<p>‘That’s the way to make sure nobody gets hurt.’</p>
<p>That was probably the message Cale wanted to convey.</p>
<p>Raon repeated something he said to himself many times in the past.</p>
<p>“…Whatever it is, I just need to learn it and grow stronger.”</p>
<p>Raon still had no idea about how to use his ‘present’ attribute. But that didn’t mean that he could just sit back and do nothing.</p>
<p>He needed to think fiercely and ponder about it.</p>
<p>Thinking and pondering would not hurt or kill someone no matter how hard it was. In fact, it might be a way to save their allies.</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooo–</p>
<p>Black mana fluctuated around Raon. Raon took out every video communication device he had in his spatial dimension.</p>
<p>Raon spoke to Cale who had his eyes closed as if he was wiping away all of his uncertainties.</p>
<p>“Human. The crown prince, Choi Han, and goldie gramps are all here. They are fighting right now so one position is empty.”</p>
<p>Raon could not leave Cale’s side. Someone needed to protect him.</p>
<p>But he also couldn’t just sit here.</p>
<p>He realized something after having those thoughts.</p>
<p>“There’s nobody to lead right now.”</p>
<p>Usually, Cale, Alberu, Eruhaben or someone like that would be in the back controlling the flow.</p>
<p>However, there was nobody to do that right now.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to lead. But I am very good at video communication.”</p>
<p>The spell he used the most while traveling with Cale had been the video communication spell.</p>
<p>Raon floated the video communication devices into the air.</p>
<p>His black mana surrounded them and started contacting them to different people.</p>
<p>– Hello Raon-nim. We have gathered the team to rescue the Dark Elves and are about to infiltrate the Endable Kingdom. Will the Elves send additional reinforc-, hmm? Is that Cale-nim behind you?</p>
<p>Tasha, the squad leader for the combined Elves and Dark Elves team headed toward the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>– Oh, my hoobae Dragon! Rasheel is currently beating Dorph to dea- eek! Isn’t that Cale Henituse?! Why does he look like that?!</p>
<p>A second one connected to a different battlefield.</p>
<p>Dodori had happily picked up the call from the Sez Kingdom’s Mount Nex where their allies were fighting against the Cats and Lions.</p>
<p>– Raon.</p>
<p>Third was to his mom Sheritt.</p>
<p>– Raon-nim! We can finally contact you!</p>
<p>– I was already planning on heading over, please wait!</p>
<p>There were also video communication devices connected to Saint Jack, excommunicated priestess Cage… Raon contacted everybody he knew.</p>
<p>Raon didn’t know how to lead.</p>
<p>But there was something he did know.</p>
<p>“Information needs to flow smoothly.”</p>
<p>There were large battles going on in multiple places. The important thing in such a situation was that the information about each battlefield was quickly delivered. It would let them rescue anybody who might be in big danger and allow others who have some breathing room to move to help someone else.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo and now Cale Henituse had lived a life on the rear support squad before moving to the vanguard attack squad.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Raon was moving from his usual position in the front attacking the enemies to a rear support position to do whatever was needed.</p>
<p>‘Human, don’t worry. I, the great and mighty Raon Miru am good at everything.’</p>
<p>Raon placed one of his front paws on Cale’s limp hand and turned toward the video communication devices looking at him.</p>
<p>Their allies scattered around were all looking at him. Raon could get a feel for how much pressure Cale must have felt while receiving these gazes.</p>
<p>Raon firmed his resolve and started talking.</p>
<p>“Tell me all of your current situation! I will tell you the situation here first!”</p>
<p>– Please wait!</p>
<p>– I have something to say as well, Raon-nim.</p>
<p>Raon’s gaze headed toward the people who shouted at him with urgency.</p>
<p>The former was Saint Jack while the latter was the Tiger Shaman Gashan who had received the video communication device from Dodori.</p>
<p>“I have something to say to you as well, Saint Jack! Hey Saint, are you able to come here?”</p>
<p>He needed the Saint’s healing ability.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to Cale.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Saint Jack frowned and shook his head.</p>
<p>– …I think that will be difficult.</p>
<p>Jack started to explain why and after he heard Gashan’s explanation as well…</p>
<p>“That motherfucking White Star!”</p>
<p>Although Cale might have gasped after hearing that, Raon swore in the exact same manner as Cale before heading toward the terrace.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>– Hey crown prince!</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Clopeh Sekka, the Whales, Mary, the Bone Dragon, and Dragons. Alberu who could take a breath after the appearance of their allies turned toward the urgent voice.</p>
<p>He looked toward the City Hall’s terrace. He could faintly make out a black figure.</p>
<p>– I’m currently contacting our other allies!</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes under the helmet opened wide after hearing Raon’s voice.</p>
<p>‘…Not bad.’</p>
<p>He had been worried about the flow of information now that even he was fighting, but Raon was filling that empty void.</p>
<p>– Bad news!</p>
<p>He soon frowned.</p>
<p>– I talked with Saint Jack! He said that Arm is invading the Mogoru Empire! There are Black Knights on black horses as well!</p>
<p>– Jack contacted the priests of the Sun God in other kingdoms and apparently they are all being attacked by unknown forces right now!</p>
<p>Arm and other unknown forces were attacking the different kingdoms throughout the Western continent.</p>
<p>“…I just thought they were running late.”</p>
<p>Alberu finally realized why the Jungle, the Whipper Kingdom, and others were not here yet and had not contacted them at all.</p>
<p>– Tiger Gashan said something too!</p>
<p>He then heard information about the Eastern continent.</p>
<p>– Mercenaries all around the Eastern continent contacted Bud and said that multiple kingdoms seemed to have activated large-scale teleportation spells!</p>
<p>‘Large-scale teleportation?’</p>
<p>Alberu’s eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>– I think they must have used those large-scale teleportation spells to come to the Western continent!</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head.</p>
<p>– Do you think that the people attacking the different kingdoms here on the Western continent are a combination of the White Star’s subordinates and those kingdoms?</p>
<p>There were many kingdoms beside the Sez Kingdom that were allied with the White Star.</p>
<p>He could have requested troops from other kingdoms while preparing for the summoning ritual in the Sez Kingdom.</p>
<p>Alberu started to speak.</p>
<p>“…Motherfucking bastards. They used their heads this time.”</p>
<p>Archie, who was walking over, flinched and stopped.</p>
<p>“We will fight.”</p>
<p>Witira nonchalantly pointed toward the eighth monster.</p>
<p>Paseton was already charging toward the eighth monster, the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t even glance in Paseton’s direction as he was deep in thought.</p>
<p>The reason that the White Star was dragging in other kingdoms to attack the entire Western continent despite his now low number of forces…</p>
<p>“…It must be so that nobody can help the Roan Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Isolation.</p>
<p>His plan must be to isolate the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>And the reason he has not attacked the Roan Kingdom beside these monsters…</p>
<p>“…He thinks these two bastards are enough.”</p>
<p>The White Star must think that these monsters were enough to destroy not just Puzzle City but the entire Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Alberu raised his head to look at the people coming down from the sky.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>He made eye contact with Clopeh Sekka.</p>
<p>“Sir Clopeh. Did your kingdom not get attacked?”</p>
<p>“We did get contacted about an attack from an unknown group of people. However, the Whales and Wyvern Knights are fighting against them. It’s okay for four of us to not be there.”</p>
<p>Smirk.</p>
<p>Clopeh started to smile. He took a video recording device out of his pocket. Everything was being recorded right now.</p>
<p>“I could not be left out on the path of a legend.”</p>
<p>‘…Crazy bastard.’</p>
<p>Alberu sighed after hearing Clopeh’s response.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang! Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Alberu could see Archie being flung away by the Lion Dragon’s shield.</p>
<p>His face stiffened up.</p>
<p>He could see Witira biting down on her lip.</p>
<p>This strong future Queen of the Whales had an awkward expression on her face as she stood there with her whip in hand, unable to do anything.</p>
<p>The two of them made eye contact.</p>
<p>“…It looks like we need to get rid of the shield first.”</p>
<p>That shield was a problem for the Whales as well. They needed to get past that shield to attack the Lion Dragon’s body, but that first part was extremely difficult.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>‘We can’t expect help from other kingdoms now.’</p>
<p>The entire Western continent was currently having trouble protecting themselves.</p>
<p>‘…We need to defeat these monsters with the strength of the Roan Kingdom alone.’</p>
<p>Alberu subconsciously tightened the grip on his spear.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>He turned his head after hearing a voice right behind him. The ancient Dragon was looking at the battlefield and Alberu with his eyes that were deep with experience fitting his age.</p>
<p>Swiiiiiish- Swiiiiiiiish-</p>
<p>He felt a gust of wind above him.</p>
<p>Alberu noticed a shadow above him just as the Lion Dragon noticed it as well and raised its head. The monster looked at the individual responsible for casting a shadow on it.</p>
<p>“Is it this bastard?”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood’s voice came out of the black Bone Dragon’s mouth as the Lion Dragon’s gold eyes looked into the slightly brighter gold eyes of the Dragon half-blood.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood had achieved what he wanted.</p>
<p>Although it was just bones, he was able to become a Dragon and look down at others from the sky.</p>
<p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
<p>Numerous monsters of the Flying Skeleton Brigade made of white bones were flying over looking like clouds from the Northeast.</p>
<p>“There are only two enemies. There are hundreds of us. We will win if we push forward with our numbers advantage.”</p>
<p>Mary calmly stated in her GPS-like voice as she stood on top of the Dragon half-blood’s back.</p>

<p>Chapter 650 – We cannot retreat 6</p>
<p>Alberu looked at Mary and the Dragon half-blood before looking at the two who were next to him and no longer by Mary’s side as he started speaking.</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben had left the Bone Dragon and descended next to Alberu. Mila was by his side.</p>
<p>The two Dragons looked toward the eighth monster.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Dodori’s mom Mila groaned.</p>
<p>She rubbed her arm with her hand. She had goosebumps on her arms and cold sweats on her back.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh–!”</p>
<p>“Sssss, ssssss!”</p>
<p>Unlike the Electric Eel that was screeching in its intense battle with Choi Han, the Lion Dragon just quietly looked around. Mila could feel an overwhelming power coming from the monster.</p>
<p>A Dragon like her had never felt this kind of emotion before.</p>
<p>‘Fear.’</p>
<p>She subconsciously had a thought once she named the emotion she was feeling toward this monster that was stronger than her.</p>
<p>‘We can’t beat it.’</p>
<p>They couldn’t beat it even if the Dragons got involved.</p>
<p>This monster felt so strong that she thought that if gods truly existed, they would manifest themselves like this.</p>
<p>“Eru-”</p>
<p>She turned toward the ancient Dragon who had more experience than she did before her expression stiffened up for a different reason.</p>
<p>“…You, are you thinking about-”</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>Numerous golden dust particles were gathering around Eruhaben. The mana nearby was rumbling as well.</p>
<p>As someone who knew Eruhaben’s age, Mila knew that he did not have much time left to live. Someone like that channeling this much mana could only mean one thing.</p>
<p>‘Is he planning on putting everything on the line in this fight?’</p>
<p>She could read Eruhaben’s intentions through his smile.</p>
<p>‘Eruhaben is putting his life on the line.’</p>
<p>Mila didn’t notice it, but the oldest Dragon in the world’s strong will to fight had subconsciously pushed her fear away.</p>
<p>‘Dragons are strong and live long lives. In return, we must work hard to make sure that the laws of the world are maintained.’</p>
<p>That was why they needed to stop the Demonic race, the Divine race, and any other individuals from other worlds who tried to destroy this world.</p>
<p>But that sense of responsibility was not the reason Eruhaben had made up his mind to go all out.</p>
<p>She thought about the people Eruhaben cherished. Thinking about the future Eruhaben was hoping for made Mila think about Dodori, the person she cherished.</p>
<p>The moment Mila was deep in thought…</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon’s gaze moved.</p>
<p>This was the first time.</p>
<p>It was the first time that the monster’s golden eyes fluctuated a bit.</p>
<p>Eruhaben smiled in response.</p>
<p>“Did you finally see me?”</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon looked at Eruhaben.</p>
<p>Its demeanor was different from how it had treated Alberu and the Whales as if they were annoying little flies.</p>
<p>Eruhaben calmly smirked at its reaction and addressed Alberu.</p>
<p>“Alberu Crossman.”</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>Alberu got an unexplainable chill watching Eruhaben and the Lion Dragon look at each other.</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooo–</p>
<p>He subconsciously took a step back. Golden mana was calmly fluctuating around Eruhaben, but every single piece of dust around him felt as if they were bombs waiting to detonate.</p>
<p>Dragon.</p>
<p>That word came to Alberu’s mind the moment he looked at Eruhaben for some reason.</p>
<p>Eruhaben kept his eyes on the Lion Dragon as he asked.</p>
<p>“Are there no more reinforcements?”</p>
<p>“The White Star has attacked the other kingdoms, Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>“Is he trying to isolate the Roan Kingdom?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh–!”</p>
<p>“Sssss- sssss!”</p>
<p>Baaaaaang-</p>
<p>The Electric Eel screeched, and there was an intense explosion.</p>
<p>Crackle. Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Electric currents and water. The two-headed snake’s body became covered in two different attributes as it screeched into the air.</p>
<p>“Damn it, we can’t even aim for its weaknesses! Choi Han, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Archie, who was attacking the Electric Eel with Choi Han instead of going back after the impossible to attack Lion Dragon, frowned while looking at Choi Han.</p>
<p>“I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Okay,’ my ass!”</p>
<p>Archie couldn’t help but sigh while looking at Choi Han, who calmly responded and started attacking again.</p>
<p>Baaaaa- bang!</p>
<p>His shining black aura aimed for the two-headed snake nonstop.</p>
<p>Choi Han did not use the black Yong anymore. The reason was simple.</p>
<p>‘I need to defeat this Electric Eel while using as little strength as possible.’</p>
<p>Choi Han realized that the Electric Eel was not the issue after seeing the strength of the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>He shook his head toward Mary, who looked at him from up in the sky.</p>
<p>Mary, who was strong enough to defeat him multiple times, needed to fight the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>‘She probably can’t use the skeleton monsters again if they break. We need to save Mary’s strength for now.’</p>
<p>They couldn’t waste their strength right now.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if they had no other choice, but there was a way to take down the Electric Eel and Choi Han would go on for as long as he could.</p>
<p>‘We will proceed with the original plan.’</p>
<p>Choi Han was waiting for a moment to suppress this Electric Eel.</p>
<p>“Who cares if we know that the weaknesses are the mouth and the horn if we can’t attack them?!”</p>
<p>Choi Han could hear Archie grumbling.</p>
<p>It was as he said. They knew the weaknesses of this monster but could not attack it.</p>
<p>The Electric Eel’s powers of water, electricity, and earth were blocking Choi Han’s attacks. Furthermore, its scales wouldn’t get cut even if his aura struck it.</p>
<p>It made him think about Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>They would have been able to slash it so easily if he was here. Actually, if someone could at least stop these snakes from moving… Then Choi Han could attack inside the mouth and destroy the other weaknesses.</p>
<p>‘…Only if we had something similar to Cale-nim’s wood power!’</p>
<p>He recalled how Cale had used his tree roots and branches to tie the Electric Eel the last time they fought it.</p>
<p>Choi Han shook his head as soon as he had that thought.</p>
<p>‘No. I can’t keep relying on him.’</p>
<p>He thought about how Cale had been covered in blood and his eyes were so hazy as he could not think straight.</p>
<p>Choi Han felt suffocated.</p>
<p>Cale had ended up that way fighting on his own.</p>
<p>It was because he didn’t want anybody else to end up like that.</p>
<p>Choi Han bit down on his lower lip.</p>
<p>‘I will do it no matter what.’</p>
<p>Choi Han looked calm on the outside while the smell of blood in his mouth after biting down too hard calmed him on the inside as well. He couldn’t let himself be influenced by his anger or his emotions.</p>
<p>He needed to face the enemy with a cold and rational mindset until the end.</p>
<p>It was one of the things Choi Han had learned from Cale.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The blue head that was covered in water glared at Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>It shouted, and the water shot out toward Choi Han as if it was an arrow.</p>
<p>Someone would stop that attack or support Choi Han from behind if he was on Earth. Choi Han recalled the past as he swung his sword. His aura crashed into the water.</p>
<p>“Roooooooooar!”</p>
<p>The blue monster roared as if it was in pain.</p>
<p>The blue monster staggered.</p>
<p>Choi Han could see his friends rushing toward the monster.</p>
<p>Screech- screech-</p>
<p>Mary’s Flying Skeleton Brigade had moved. There were people on the white skeleton monsters’ backs.</p>
<p>The first to jump off cut through the blue monster head’s water and slammed down with a shield again.</p>
<p>Baaaaang-</p>
<p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p>
<p>Choi Han could see his friend with a large shield standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“Hyung, sorry I’m late. I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>It was Lock.</p>
<p>“The Wolves and Tigers are all here.”</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>The warriors of the Wolf tribe and the Tiger tribe all jumped off the white skeleton monsters.</p>
<p>They were all in their berserk transformations, which made them large and buff; they were giving off the aura of ripping off the enemy’s necks right away.</p>
<p>“Noona said she was coming too. Is she here yet?”</p>
<p>The moment Lock smiled and looked at Choi Han…</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooo–</p>
<p>They heard the rumbling of mana, and Choi Han responded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Looks like she’s here now.”</p>
<p>Choi Han looked toward the plaza.</p>
<p>A large teleportation magic circle appeared with numerous people on top of it.</p>
<p>The person standing in front was Rosalyn, who was wearing highest-grade magic stones like a necklace, once again.</p>
<p>She pointed to the Electric Eel and asked Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Do I just need to tie down those two heads?”</p>
<p>Although it would not be with tree roots as Cale had done, someone who could tie this monster down with her precise control and influx of mana from these magic stones had appeared.</p>
<p>Electric currents, water, and earth. Someone who could use as many different types of spells as the monster’s numerous attributes would at least create a situation where Choi Han could fight properly.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at Rosalyn and Lock and made a comment.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since the three of us fought together.”</p>
<p>The greatest efficiency with the least amount of people.</p>
<p>Choi Han was certain that his goal would be achieved.</p>
<p>And finally, the time to suppress this Electric Eel had arrived.</p>
<p>Someone rushed past the numerous people who came with Rosalyn.</p>
<p>“Your highness, I apologize for my tardiness.”</p>
<p>“Duke Deruth.”</p>
<p>Duke Deruth had come with the strong individuals from all over the continent he had hired by pouring out money as if it was water.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth bowed toward Alberu as he spoke.</p>
<p>“The troops from the northeast region and the other territories will be here soon, your highness.”</p>
<p>Duchess Violan, the matriarch of the Ubarr household, and other nobles of the northeast region were leading their troops here.</p>
<p>The same thing was happening throughout the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Alberu recalled Eruhaben’s question.</p>
<p>Eruhaben had asked if the White Star was planning on isolating the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>‘That’s right. He plans to isolate us.’</p>
<p>The White Star believed that the Roan Kingdom alone could not defeat these monsters.</p>
<p>He believed that it would be impossible even if Cale’s allies showed up.</p>
<p>‘He probably included the Dragons in his calculations.’</p>
<p>He wouldn’t have forgotten to add Eruhaben and Raon into the group.</p>
<p>However, the White Star’s side must have determined that these two Dragons and the rest of the strong individuals by Cale’s side would fail.</p>
<p>‘That is how strong this Lion Dragon is.’</p>
<p>Alberu accepted that as well.</p>
<p>He could tell after going up against it. Overwhelming strength was a term reserved for monsters like this.</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t help but wonder what the White Star was thinking to summon such a monster. The White Star couldn’t defeat this monster either.</p>
<p>‘However.’</p>
<p>But there was no need for Alberu to feel depressed.</p>
<p>He heard Eruhaben’s voice.</p>
<p>“We have quite a lot of allies to be considered isolated.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head.</p>
<p>They really did have a lot of allies, as Eruhaben mentioned.</p>
<p>Their friends who had come to help them for a greater future. The citizens of the Roan Kingdom who were rushing over even though they could lose their lives. The people who couldn’t come but were fighting their own battles in their respective areas.</p>
<p>Alberu could feel a wave of emotion in his mind.</p>
<p>It was a different feeling than the heavy burden of responsibility.</p>
<p>“We will definitely win.”</p>
<p>He said that to Eruhaben, but it sounded as if he was confirming it to himself.</p>
<p>Eruhaben calmly responded to him.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Alberu flinched at this extremely calm voice and looked toward Eruhaben.</p>
<p>He felt that the golden dust particles around Eruhaben increased in number and opacity. The Lion Dragon was still observing Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“Alberu, your weapon can break that monster’s hide and bones?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head as Eruhaben looked at the white spear.</p>
<p>It was odd.</p>
<p>Eruhaben’s extremely calm demeanor felt weird.</p>
<p>Alberu then saw the concern on Mila’s face.</p>
<p>‘She’s worried?’</p>
<p>Eruhaben gently patted Alberu’s shoulder as Alberu was thinking about her odd expression.</p>
<p>“Get on my back.”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Alberu had to step back as he asked.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t help but do so because of the strong gust of wind with Eruhaben at the center. He looked for Eruhaben through the gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Alberu finally managed to spot Eruhaben through the wind and the golden dust particles that were swirling with it.</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim!”</p>
<p>Dragon wings appeared on Eruhaben’s back and his body started to become covered in scales.</p>
<p>However, he soon became covered by the gold dust.</p>
<p>“…Fuck. That is your decision.”</p>
<p>Mila sighed and swore while Alberu looked up.</p>
<p>The whirlwind with the golden dust shot up into the sky.</p>
<p>The gold light that was extremely small compared to the Lion Dragon increased in size once it was in the sky.</p>
<p>Everybody on the battlefield could see it once that gold light disappeared.</p>
<p>“…A Dragon.”</p>
<p>A Dragon giving off a radiant gold light covered the sky.</p>
<p>It truly looked like the great and mighty Dragons they had heard about in legends.</p>
<p>The golden Dragon in the sky looked down at the holy-looking monster standing on the ground.</p>
<p>The monster with a lion’s mane looked up at the Dragon as well.</p>

<p>Chapter 651 – Everything can be connected 1</p>
<p>“…H, holy shit. What am I looking at right now?”</p>
<p>Step step.</p>
<p>The soldier who was retreating backward tripped and plopped down on the ground. However, her gaze could not move away from the golden Dragon in the air.</p>
<p>This was the same for the others as well.</p>
<p>“My goodness.”</p>
<p>“We have a Dragon as an ally?”</p>
<p>What kind of existences were Dragons?</p>
<p>People would probably give many different answers to that question.</p>
<p>However, it was rare for people to see a Dragon and only thought of them as strong, violent, and violent creatures they’ve heard about in legends, myths, and novels.</p>
<p>“…Beautiful.”</p>
<p>However, the Dragon they were seeing with their own eyes was abnormally beautiful. Its gold scales were shining as if the sun was only beaming down on this Dragon.</p>
<p>“S, scary.”</p>
<p>Although the Dragon was beautiful, it was close to 20 meters in length. There were also its wings, horns, fangs, and claws. Everything looked vicious, and its gold eyes gave off an unknown sense of pressure.</p>
<p>One soldier who looked into those gold eyes suddenly thought of something and shouted.</p>
<p>“…There are two Dragons!”</p>
<p>She thought of the other Dragon with slightly whiter gold eyes.</p>
<p>It was the black Bone Dragon with Necromancer Mary, one of the Roan Kingdom’s famous heroes, on its back.</p>
<p>“No! That’s not a real Dragon. It is just a Bone Dragon controlled by the Necromancer-nim.”</p>
<p>“Really? It seems a bit different though.”</p>
<p>The people talking about the Bone Dragon soon flinched.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>They could feel something rumbling… The ground was shaking. The soldiers looked toward the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>“I, it just moved, right?”</p>
<p>“That bastard moved!”</p>
<p>The monster that had stood firm and only blocked the attacks headed toward it had raised its foot for the first time and stomped on the ground.</p>
<p>Crack- crack.</p>
<p>The ground of the plaza where it stomped crumbled, making it impossible to tell its original shape anymore.</p>
<p>Some people felt fear once again at this sight, but others were looking at the monster with odd gazes as well.</p>
<p>“That monster reacted for the first time. Doesn’t that mean that this Gold Dragon-nim is that strong?”</p>
<p>“It looks like we might have a chance at victory.”</p>
<p>This beautiful yet violent-looking Dragon…</p>
<p>The fact that this Dragon was their ally was filling the people here with courage.</p>
<p>A new emotion was spreading on the battlefield that had been submerging in fear and desperation.</p>
<p>The name of that emotion was hope.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Alberu was the first to notice that change.</p>
<p>“He changed the entire atmosphere.”</p>
<p>Alberu realized the reasons Eruhaben revealed his Dragon body.</p>
<p>The first reason was because his large Dragon body was better to fight against such a large monster. Another reason was to change the atmosphere on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The final reason was to show his determination to fight to the end.</p>
<p>“Move back!”</p>
<p>Alberu immediately shouted toward his troops.</p>
<p>This Dragon was close to 20 meters long. There was also a monster that was just as majestic.</p>
<p>“All of you, move back!”</p>
<p>He raised his voice as much as possible.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth, who had been about to ask where his son Cale was, took off his cumbersome cape that was around his armor and threw it on the ground as he shouted.</p>
<p>“Move back immediately!”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain did the same.</p>
<p>“All units move to the third line of defense!”</p>
<p>Leaders were shouting all around them to get the troops to move back. One of the knights walked up to the Knight Captain and asked.</p>
<p>“Captain-nim, the third line of defense is past Puzzle City’s walls! Isn’t that too far away?”</p>
<p>Puzzle City’s walls.</p>
<p>Although the walls were originally just regular stone walls, they had been fortified with all sorts of spells and devices from the moment Alberu learned that the monsters may appear here.</p>
<p>The peculiar thing about it was that most walls would put fortification spells and defensive spells on the outside so that enemies couldn’t invade, but these walls had all sorts of magic devices installed on the inside to prevent things from getting out.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain looked at the knight with a frustrated expression.</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to die?”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain looked away from the slow knight and shouted toward the soldiers, who were quickly retreating.</p>
<p>“We might end up being swept up in the battle between these large beings and die before we can even fight!”</p>
<p>A battle between a Dragon and a monster.</p>
<p>Their fight would make the ground shake and buildings fall.</p>
<p>The chances of the inside of Puzzle City turning into ruins were quite high.</p>
<p>It was sad that people’s homes would be destroyed, but they could rebuild the homes later if nobody dies.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain shouted toward the clueless knight.</p>
<p>“That’s why you need to hurry up and move back if you want to live! Our role right now is to wait!”</p>
<p>They needed to first watch the battle of these large beings and the heroes.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain watched everybody move back before being the last to retreat.</p>
<p>‘There was a Dragon by Sir Cale Henituse’s side as well.’</p>
<p>The Knight Captain recalled the last thing he saw through Alberu’s video communication device.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse had turned into a bloody mess while showcasing a phenomenal ability. He had to leave immediately after that, after hearing Alberu Crossman’s pained and cold voice.</p>
<p>He and the other executives saw a young black Dragon by Cale Henituse’s side at that time.</p>
<p>That was why the message from his highness the crown prince had stuck in their minds as they left.</p>
<p>‘Dragons and numerous non-human races will be involved in this battle. Do not become flustered in the middle of the fight.’</p>
<p>The Knight Captain got chills on his back.</p>
<p>“…Are there a total of three Dragons?”</p>
<p>However, he was wrong.</p>
<p>There were more Dragons.</p>
<p>One of the other Dragons mumbled to herself while looking at the Dragonified Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be quite intense.”</p>
<p>Mila slowly stepped back.</p>
<p>She was moving so stealthily that nobody noticed her moving away.</p>
<p>– Good luck.</p>
<p>However, she could not avoid Eruhaben’s gaze. Mila looked toward the older Dragon who was ready to die in this battle.</p>
<p>“Wait for me. I’ll be back with a solution.”</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>She quietly moved away before taking her hoe out of her pocket.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong.</p>
<p>The hoe was covered in beige-colored mana. It felt very warm.</p>
<p>She then looked toward a place… She was looking at the City Hall where Cale was right now.</p>
<p>She recalled a conversation she had with Cale.</p>
<p>‘Mila-nim, may I ask about your attribute?’</p>
<p>‘Of course, sir, how could I not answer teacher’s question?’</p>
<p>Cale had stoically stared at Mila who was calling him teacher and speaking respectfully to him before his expression turned odd at her response.</p>
<p>‘Connect together.’</p>
<p>‘…Excuse me?’</p>
<p>‘Connect together. That is my attribute.’</p>
<p>‘Could you please explain?’</p>
<p>‘Whether it is a broken blade of grass or branch… As long as it isn’t completely severed or destroyed into pieces, I am able to connect it back together and return it to normal.’</p>
<p>‘Human, that sounds so interesting! I wonder if that’s why she has an orchard.’</p>
<p>Mila had smiled at Raon, who was amazed.</p>
<p>‘Of course. It’s great because I can connect together branches that are damaged by the wind and rain. Teacher. This is not a healing ability. Mm…I would be able to put bones back together. But I am unable to cure illnesses. It is just an ability that is useful for helping the poor crops grow in a healthy manner.’</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes were open wide as he looked at Mila after hearing about this new kind of ability. As for Rasheel, who was standing behind Mila, he snorted that it was a stupid ability that didn’t let her attack. That had led to an argument between Rasheel, Raon, and Dodori.</p>
<p>Mila recalled what Cale had said to her during that loud ruckus.</p>
<p>‘Then, Mila-nim.’</p>
<p>Cale had asked with an odd expression on his face.</p>
<p>Mila recalled that face once again.</p>
<p>‘Yes. It was quite odd.’</p>
<p>Cale’s expression was hard to explain as he nonchalantly asked a question like it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>It had looked like the calm sea before the storm.</p>
<p>This was what Cale had asked.</p>
<p>‘Are you able to connect together things like plates?’</p>
<p>‘Plates? Of course.’</p>
<p>‘Not plates like that. Formless plates.’</p>
<p>‘Formless?’</p>
<p>Mila had tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>‘No, never mind Mila-nim.’</p>
<p>Cale had smiled at her and said that it was nothing. That was how the conversation had ended.</p>
<p>“Teacher, it was not nothing.”</p>
<p>Mila remembered what that swordsman named Choi Han had said to her before they left the Forest of Darkness.</p>
<p>Cale was currently bloody and unconscious after his body was covered in injuries from overusing his ability.</p>
<p>That was when Mila finally understood the meaning behind Cale’s odd gaze.</p>
<p>‘My power is not a healing ability.’</p>
<p>It could not heal illnesses.</p>
<p>However, it was able to do things that healing powers could not do from time to time.</p>
<p>She quickly and stealthily headed toward the City Hall as she caressed her hoe.</p>
<p>Her mumblings about what she had to do scattered with the wind.</p>
<p>“…Any open wounds I just need to connect together. His body’s plate that is broken from overusing his powers can be connected together as well. If his bones are broken, I can also connect those together.”</p>
<p>The ‘solution’ she had told Eruhaben about was Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>“I need to finish everything before Dodori gets here.”</p>
<p>Mommy Mila’s eyes were sparkling for a different reason.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>She could hear the monster stomp its feet.</p>
<p>Mila stopped for a moment and turned her head.</p>
<p>“That crazy monster bastard.”</p>
<p>The swearing she used to do more often when she was younger subconsciously popped out.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon had stretched out its eight white wings and shot up into the air.</p>
<p>Those wings were as large as Eruhaben’s wings and covered in a sturdy hide that looked difficult to pierce with most weapons.</p>
<p>“Now it looks like a fun fight.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben laughed as gold dust started to spread around him like bombs.</p>
<p>It looked as if a golden milky way had covered the sky.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon said something for the first time.</p>
<p>“…Kill……”</p>
<p>It sounded robotic.</p>
<p>“…Kill the strong intruder.”</p>
<p>“I’m the intruder?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben chuckled.</p>
<p>His eyes clouded over as well.</p>
<p>That mechanical voice…</p>
<p>And how it was still until it reacted to a strong individual…</p>
<p>The way it was talking about taking care of intruders…</p>
<p>‘It sounds like a guardian.’</p>
<p>It was similar to a guardian that protected a dungeon or an item.</p>
<p>He felt as if he would be able to figure out this Lion Dragon’s identity in the near future.</p>
<p>But that was not important right now.</p>
<p>Shhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The gold dust started to spread out from Eruhaben to cover the sky over Puzzle City.</p>
<p>He had a twisted smile on his face while looking at the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>“You’re the intruder, not me.”</p>
<p>The sky above Puzzle City was covered by Eruhaben’s true body and gold dust.</p>
<p>“Now that you’ve stepped into my domain, you will not be able to leave alive.”</p>
<p>“Kill. Intruder.”</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon darted forward toward Eruhaben.</p>
<p>The Gold Dragon surrounded by gold dust used his large body and slammed into the Lion Dragon without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaaaa– baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang–</p>
<p>An explosion that was much louder than anything earlier shook the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon’s shield and the Gold Dragon’s claws clashed and clashed again to kill each other.</p>
<p>Crack! Crack!</p>
<p>A strong gust of wind that started from the sky started to break the trees and old buildings on the ground.</p>
<p>The formidable attacks made some people have to grab into things around them to not fly away.</p>
<p>But one person…</p>
<p>“Ha, haha.”</p>
<p>Alberu laughed as he cast flight magic.</p>
<p>In this battle between two large creatures…</p>
<p>He truly would be dust in comparison.</p>
<p>But he had been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>This monster that was protected by its shield…</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman looked at the monster’s outstretched eight wings that were no longer covered because it was facing off against Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll start by making it fall from the sky.”</p>
<p>– …Currently calculating your chances of victory First, Alberu Crossman-nim’s wing attack has a 98% chance of success.</p>
<p>Alberu listened to Taerang’s voice as he looked at someone.</p>
<p>“Choi Han.”</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at the sky and then looked back at Alberu before responding.</p>
<p>“I will take care of the Electric Eel before you make that monster fall to the ground. Let’s take care of them one by one down at our level.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn shouted at that moment.</p>
<p>“I’m ready!”</p>
<p>Choi Han turned his head.</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooo–</p>
<p>Red mana burning like the sun was surrounding Rosalyn.</p>
<p>Crack, crunch!</p>
<p>Rosalyn was burning up even more intensely as even more highest-grade magic stones continued to break. She put her hand on the ground and shouted.</p>
<p>“Bind it!”</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>The ground split open and tree roots started to shoot up from all directions.</p>
<p>“Help the master!”</p>
<p>“Support the Tower Master-nim!”</p>
<p>The mages who would be a part of her Magic Tower in the future started to support her. All sorts of manas mixed together to make the tree roots grow exponentially in both size and number.</p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>The tree roots shot out toward the monster remaining on the ground as soon as Rosalyn shouted.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Sssss, ssssss!”</p>
<p>The two-headed snake… The tree roots headed toward this Electric Eel without stopping.</p>
<p>Rosalyn watched the tree roots with her eyes that were burning with red mana before starting to cast other spells. She would not accept any openings whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Summon water!”</p>
<p>“Where is the waterway that filled the fountain? Find the waterways! There should be five of them!”</p>
<p>Mages on one side were casting water-related spells, while mages on the other side were looking at the map to find the underground waterways.</p>
<p>Splash-</p>
<p>The water summoned by some of the mages headed toward a single direction.</p>
<p>They were headed toward the Whales.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Water surrounded Witira’s shoulder as if it was a cape. Her whip was starting to become even thicker.</p>
<p>The Whales were preparing to go berserk.</p>
<p>Choi Han watched all this before running toward the tree roots trying to bind down the monster.</p>
<p>“Lock!”</p>
<p>“I got it!”</p>
<p>Lock also jumped toward the tree roots after hearing his name.</p>
<p>Choi Han and Lock kicked off the tree root and burst forward.</p>
<p>“Please come!”</p>
<p>“Follow behind Lock!”</p>
<p>The berserk Wolves and Tigers followed behind them.</p>
<p>They were headed toward the two-headed snake… Their only enemy was the Electric Eel.</p>
<p>Choi Han recalled the fight he had on Earth and smiled.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Ssss!”</p>
<p>The yellow head and the blue head… The two snakes flinched after looking at the large tree roots and enemies charging toward them.</p>
<p>However, the yellow head’s yellow eyes soon flashed.</p>
<p>Sss.</p>
<p>The yellow head opened its mouth.</p>
<p>It looked as if an eerie noise would flow out of its mouth.</p>
<p>This was the yellow head’s ability, ‘noise.’</p>
<p>The two-headed monster believed that the enemies would fall down or at least stop after hearing this noise.</p>
<p>However, Choi Han, the person in front of everybody else, was smiling.</p>
<p>“…I was waiting for this.”</p>
<p>Choi Han cast his black Yong once again and shot up while Rosalyn cast the next spell she had been preparing.</p>
<p>Ooooooong-!</p>
<p>Red mana burst into the air once again, and a half-transparent barrier covered the yellow-headed monster’s face.</p>
<p>“—! —-!”</p>
<p>The monster screamed, but no noise would come out.</p>
<p>“Cough!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn coughed up some blood before smiling.</p>
<p>“This is the greatness of soundproof barrier magic.”</p>
<p>To put a soundproof barrier around a portion of a moving enemy… This was something that could only be done with extremely delicate mana control.</p>
<p>Rosalyn was probably one of the few humans, if not the only human, who could do that.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-!</p>
<p>However, that barrier was soon destroyed. The yellow head opened its mouth once again after seeing that the barrier was gone.</p>
<p>However, that short instant…</p>
<p>That extremely short period of time was all that Choi Han needed.</p>
<p>The yellow head’s eyes opened wide. Choi Han had pointed his sword toward the monster’s mouth while it had been distracted by the soundproof barrier.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh! Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue head shot water toward Choi Han and tried to slam into him in shock, but…</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>Lock’s shield blocked the attack.</p>
<p>Choi Han pushed his sword forward instead of thanking Lock and said the following.</p>
<p>“One Yong coming right up.”</p>
<p>Into the open mouth of the yellow-headed monster…</p>
<p>A black Yong sparkled violently as it left Choi Han’s sword and burst inside.</p>

<p>Inside the open mouth of the yellow-headed monster… The black Yong shoved its head inside.</p>
<p>Choi Han lowered his sword for the first time since the battle began.</p>
<p>“—-!”</p>
<p>As the yellow head stiffened up without being able to make any noise, the black Yong opened up its jaw and dug into the enemy’s body.</p>
<p>“—! —-!”</p>
<p>Baaaaaang- baaaaang–</p>
<p>The yellow head’s silent scream and the black explosion inside its body happened at the same time.</p>
<p>Its tongue it would use to screech…. Its fangs that were full of poison… Everything that could break was broken and the black Yong ripped apart as much as it could inside the monster’s body as well.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>The yellow head couldn’t even groan as its head limped down.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>Although its strong scales were still fine, black blood burst out of its mouth nonstop.</p>
<p>“Huufff, huff-”</p>
<p>The yellow head could only breathe heavily.</p>
<p>“Chhhh, rooooar, roooooooar–!”</p>
<p>The blue head was roaring as it intensely twisted its body.</p>
<p>Although half of their bodies were split, the rest of the Electric Eel was one body. The damages to the inside of the yellow head naturally affected the blue head as well.</p>
<p>“Rooooooooooooar—!”</p>
<p>The blue head’s roar shook the surrounding area.</p>
<p>It was so loud that even the people who had retreated to the third line of defense outside the city walls were shocked.</p>
<p>Choi Han kept his sword down as he looked toward the blue head and smirked.</p>
<p>“This is nice.”</p>
<p>It was nice to be able to attack both monsters with one attack.</p>
<p>The blue head glared at the enemy who had harmed its other half and its body as Choi Han smiled.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh! Ch!”</p>
<p>The blue head charged toward Choi Han with the completely out of it yellow head dangling on its side.</p>
<p>It would definitely kill this bastard who harmed it. The blue head’s blue eyes were full of rage. Choi Han could tell what it was thinking, even though they could not communicate.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Water swirled like a whirlpool around the blue head’s body.</p>
<p>As Choi Han looked at it rushing toward him…</p>
<p>“…Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Drip.</p>
<p>A strand of black blood dripped out of the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Hyung!”</p>
<p>Lock’s eyes opened wide in shock. He had seen Choi Han getting external injuries many times. However, he had never seen Choi Han receive any internal injuries.</p>
<p>This meant that Choi Han overdid it by continuously raising his aura to its maximum strength to summon the black Yong.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Choi Han groaned before nonchalantly wiping the blood away and raising his sword again.</p>
<p>“I!”</p>
<p>Lock frowned and immediately charged toward the blue head with his shield in front of him.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>The noise from Lock running on the ground was extremely faint compared to the sound of the Electric Eel’s large body moving.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn’t tell. He didn’t know that there were allies running behind him.</p>
<p>“I got this.”</p>
<p>Lock heard a voice that was as refreshing and gentle as the waves at the beach.</p>
<p>He flinched in response and saw someone rush past him.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Witira was running with her water whip wrapped around her arm.</p>
<p>There was a long, half-transparent cape on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Witira was ready to go berserk but had not been able to do so yet.</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh! Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>However, she smiled while looking at the monster charging toward her.</p>
<p>“Water created by a few people’s magic is not enough to go berserk.”</p>
<p>It could only help her enough to prepare to go berserk at any moment.</p>
<p>Whales needed water to go berserk.</p>
<p>They needed a significant amount of water.</p>
<p>It was difficult to expect such a large amount of water on dry land.</p>
<p>However, there were ways to get it.</p>
<p>Witira turned to look, not at the monster charging at her but at Rosalyn.</p>
<p>In that battle at the Breck Kingdom’s Gorge of Death…</p>
<p>Rosalyn had played an important role in that battle both as a former royal of the Breck Kingdom and as a mage.</p>
<p>The Whales needed to go berserk in that battle but did not have a lot of water to do so.</p>
<p>How had they done it back then?</p>
<p>An extremely large magic circle and a large amount of mana… Mages who could handle such things just needed to create water like a tsunami. However, Rosalyn and the other mages there did not have the strength to do that.</p>
<p>The thing that solved their problem was Cale’s Dominating Water. The wall of water that shot up like a giant wave served as the foundation for Witira and Archie to go berserk.</p>
<p>Witira and Rosalyn had seen how much Cale had pushed himself to make that happen.</p>
<p>They had won the battle, but they didn’t like how much Cale had suffered.</p>
<p>This was especially true for Rosalyn, who etched the memory of being unable to do something that could have been done with magic and prepared since then so that something like that would never happen again.</p>
<p>Witira looked at Rosalyn’s firm gaze and started speaking.</p>
<p>“We don’t need to worry about getting water when we have an Archmage with us.”</p>
<p>Archmage.</p>
<p>Witira gave that title to Rosalyn without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Rosalyn couldn’t hear her voice, but the moment she saw Witira smile…</p>
<p>“The magic circle is ready!”</p>
<p>“The magic stones are also ready!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn heard her subordinates report in as well.</p>
<p>And the final report…</p>
<p>“We found all the waterways!”</p>
<p>The moment the mage holding the map reported in for all of them… She stood in the middle of a newly drawn magic circle.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Please get started.”</p>
<p>The mage holding the map immediately shouted.</p>
<p>“Destroy the waterways!”</p>
<p>The plaza at the center of Puzzle City…</p>
<p>There were a total of five waterways underneath this area.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Sharp mana spears pierced through the five waterways.</p>
<p>Nobody was left in Puzzle City, but the water was still flowing.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>Water shot up from the waterways.</p>
<p>One of the mages put a magic stone at the edge of the new large magic circle and shouted.</p>
<p>“Pour the mana in!”</p>
<p>Oooooo-</p>
<p>The mana that came out of the magic stone seeped into the magic circle.</p>
<p>The mana gathered so quickly that the magic circle looked like a bomb that was about to explode.</p>
<p>Rosalyn was standing at the center.</p>
<p>She slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She became covered in red mana once more as she spoke to Witira.</p>
<p>“I will send you a tsunami.”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The five pillars of water shooting up from the waterways…</p>
<p>All of that water flew through the air and headed toward the magic circle where Rosalyn was standing.</p>
<p>She raised her hand the moment the water coming from different directions was about to gather as one above the magic circle.</p>
<p>“Become a wave.”</p>
<p>Splash–!</p>
<p>A giant strand of water shot up from the magic circle and gobbled up the five stands of water from the waterways.</p>
<p>They combined to become one large wave.</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>It started to move toward where Rosalyn was pointing.</p>
<p>It was moving toward Witira.</p>
<p>Witira smiled while looking at the large wave heading toward her.</p>
<p>If the water wall Cale created at the Gorge of Death let her feel the violent nature of the ocean because of its dominating power…</p>
<p>‘The wave is burning.’</p>
<p>The wave headed toward her was roaring like fire even though it was water.</p>
<p>It must be carrying the will of the mage who created this wave.</p>
<p>This wave that was full of mana was small compared to Cale’s water wall, but it was extremely strong because of the amount of mana it carried.</p>
<p>Witira’s heart started to beat wildly as she carried on the will of that wave.</p>
<p>Water and fire were different.</p>
<p>Water did not burn.</p>
<p>It just roared.</p>
<p>However, if this water carried the will of someone who wanted to burn up in this battle, there was no reason she couldn’t carry that will forward.</p>
<p>Witira reached out her hand.</p>
<p>The wave seemed to lower its head toward her for a moment. Witira walked on top of the wave.</p>
<p>“I’m coming too.”</p>
<p>Archie got behind her.</p>
<p>The wave covered Witira and Archie’s bodies.</p>
<p>The Whale tribe’s berserk transformation.</p>
<p>Their body did not get bigger. The half-transparent water just surrounded their bodies as if it was armor. However, this armor was what made the Whales the strongest of the Beast people.</p>
<p>As people started to get lost in their beauty…</p>
<p>“Chhhhhhhhhh! Chhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue-haired, blue-eyed Witira looked into the similarly blue eyes of the monster up above.</p>
<p>Witira licked her lips with excitement.</p>
<p>The water from the waterway underneath Puzzle City… And the water created by Rosalyn and the many mages…</p>
<p>It had turned into a wave, but it was not enough to become a tsunami.</p>
<p>That was why the last part was the large amount of water created by this monster.</p>
<p>“I really like that you are the enemy I need to fight.”</p>
<p>She would take it for herself.</p>
<p>“I like it as well! Kahahahahah!”</p>
<p>Archie had the same thought.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p>
<p>Witira, who now had a water armor and cape, as well as an armored Archie slammed against the blue head.</p>
<p>There was another loud explosion and the people watching to see the results noticed the water surrounding the blue head turning into a whip.</p>
<p>“Chhh? Chhh, chhhhh!”</p>
<p>The blue head’s eyes opened wide after seeing the water it shot out turning into a whip.</p>
<p>The monster looked into Witira’s cold eyes.</p>
<p>“I will make you suffocate.”</p>
<p>“Rooooooooar–!”</p>
<p>The monster roared in pain. The water whip slithered like a snake and started to tighten around the blue head and the entire Electric Eel’s body.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch!</p>
<p>The tree roots Rosalyn created were easily destroyed by the strength of the whip as well.</p>
<p>“Haha, Haha-”</p>
<p>But Rosalyn was laughing. The foundation that allowed Witira to use such strength was her magic too.</p>
<p>“Roooooooar!”</p>
<p>Boom-!</p>
<p>The blue head soon fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Grrr, chhhh.”</p>
<p>The blue head tried to get rid of the water it had cast, but it was impossible.</p>
<p>The water created by the monster was already under Witira’s jurisdiction now.</p>
<p>The monster needed to find a way to get out of this whip. However, it would not have the time to do so.</p>
<p>“Khahahaha! We just need to beat it up now!”</p>
<p>Archie and his fist that was covered in sparkling water armor appeared in front of the blue head’s nose.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>Archie’s fist slammed into the blue head’s forehead and there was a cracking noise as the horn on the blue head’s forehead instantly crushed into pieces.</p>
<p>Archie’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>“Kehehe! Hey monster bastard, did you know?”</p>
<p>Paseton shook his head after hearing Archie’s thuggish tone, but Archie was serious.</p>
<p>Archie continued speaking to the blue head that was struggling while being suffocated by the whip.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong your scales are…do you know what happens if you keep punching it? Then the organs inside all explode. Hmm? You want to know if I’m being serious? That’s what your gaze seems to be saying. Do you really want to know? Do you want me to tell you?”</p>
<p>Archie raised his fist.</p>
<p>“I’ll happily tell you. Kahahahahah!”</p>
<p>His fist struck down on the sturdy scales on the blue head’s face that was visible through the gap in the whip.</p>
<p>Pow, pow!</p>
<p>The scales did not break or rip. However, the shock from the punches shook the inside of the monster underneath the scales.</p>
<p>Archie noticed a shadow above him and turned his head.</p>
<p>“How about we do it together?”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be easier like this!”</p>
<p>The Tigers walked over with their loose sleeves fluttering in the wind. The Wolves awkwardly added on as well.</p>
<p>They were so big in their berserk transformations that Archie thought that it had suddenly turned to night instead of there being a shadow above him.</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Archie responded while smiling.</p>
<p>“Let’s beat it up together.”</p>
<p>That was how the blue head’s screams started.</p>
<p>Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow, pow!</p>
<p>“Roooooar, roooooar!”</p>
<p>However, that screaming did not last long. The blue head’s insides were a mess with its blood vessels popping and its organs exploding.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time to drag it out.”</p>
<p>They heard an unbelievable explosion the moment they heard Choi Han’s voice.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang- baaaaang!</p>
<p>They raised their heads to see a strong gust of wind created by the Gold Dragon and the Lion Dragon fighting against each other.</p>
<p>Only the black Bone Dragon was able to resist the storm to support the Gold Dragon.</p>
<p>It was an intense battle with gold dust flying around everywhere.</p>
<p>It helped them realize that the true enemy was over there.</p>
<p>Archie nodded his head at Choi Han before walking over to the blue head.</p>
<p>“R….. roooooar……”</p>
<p>Chhhh.</p>
<p>Archie opened the blue head’s mouth without much effort.</p>
<p>“Chhh. Chh.”</p>
<p>The monster coughed up blood with its mouth open. Choi Han watched this with a stoic expression before stabbing his sword that was covered in a bit of aura into the open mouth.</p>
<p>Puuk.</p>
<p>The sword pierced through the roof of the blue head’s mouth and reached all the way to its brain, making those angry blue eyes finally lose their gleam.</p>
<p>“We’re done over here too.”</p>
<p>Witira opened the yellow head’s mouth and Paseton stabbed a sword in there to finish off the other head as well.</p>
<p>Archie walked over to Choi Han, who was catching his breath, and started speaking.</p>
<p>“We took care of one easier than-”</p>
<p>Easier than they expected, such that they shouldn’t have worried so much.</p>
<p>However, Archie frowned without being able to say that after seeing Choi Han’s face. A small strand of blood was still dripping down from the corner of Choi Han’s mouth.</p>
<p>He then remembered what he had forgotten about.</p>
<p>‘We were able to fight at full strength because Choi Han went all out to hold this monster back until we arrived.’</p>
<p>Archie looked past Choi Han’s shoulder at Rosalyn.</p>
<p>The mages were all plopped down on the ground breathing heavily and although Rosalyn was still standing firm, she too was wiping blood off the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Everybody other than the Beast people was not in good condition.</p>
<p>Their strength and sacrifices had allowed them to fight like that.</p>
<p>Archie’s face stiffened up.</p>
<p>The Tigers and Wolves had the same expressions on their faces. It was because they were thinking that they did not do much while the others had strategized and fought hard against this monster.</p>
<p>“It means we just need to fight more from here.”</p>
<p>They heard Witira’s voice.</p>
<p>They turned toward the voice to see Witira and Lock standing there. The two people who were holding their whip and shield respectively raised their heads.</p>
<p>“We will step in once that Lion Dragon falls to the ground.”</p>
<p>The Beast people nodded their heads with stiff expressions still on their faces.</p>
<p>Choi Han nodded at the now fully grown Lock as if to tell him not to worry before grabbing his sword that was stabbed into the blue head.</p>
<p>The moment he was about to pull his sword out…</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Something hard was touching his sword.</p>
<p>‘What is going on?’</p>
<p>A confused Choi Han moved his sword to pull the hard thing out.</p>
<p>It was because it might be a variable that could negatively affect them.</p>
<p>But Choi Han gasped the moment he saw what came out with the sword.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>The round orb fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What is this?”</p>
<p>Archie looked at the orb that came out of the blue head with confusion, but Choi Han picked it up and answered his question.</p>
<p>“A cintamani.”</p>
<p>“A cintamani? I’ve never heard of that before.”</p>
<p>Everybody looked confused after hearing a word they had never heard before. But Choi Han recalled what had happened on Earth.</p>
<p>‘They said something like a cintamani came out after they caught the yellow head. I guess something like that came out here too.’</p>
<p>Choi Han asked Paseton, who was pulling his sword out as well.</p>
<p>“Is there an orb like this over there too?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? There isn’t one here.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Choi Han tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>‘I remember they said on Earth that the cintamani came out of the yellow-headed monster.’</p>
<p>Was this a bit different?</p>
<p>Choi Han decided it wasn’t a variable that could negatively affect them and thoughtlessly wiped the blood off the cintamani.</p>
<p>He needed to keep it and pass it on to Cale later.</p>
<p>– Huh?</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Choi Han flinched after wiping the cintamani with his sleeve.</p>
<p>He heard someone’s voice.</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice.</p>
<p>– Huh? Huh?</p>
<p>The person sounded anxious.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked toward the source of the voice.</p>
<p>He lifted his sleeve that was cleaning the orb away.</p>
<p>And inside the orb…</p>
<p>He could see a person.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Choi Han was truly bewildered as he stood in the middle of the battlefield.</p>
<p>– Huh?</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Both Choi Han and the person inside the orb could only repeat the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>It could not be helped.</p>
<p>Choi Han barely managed to say something.</p>
<p>“…Park Jin Tae?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>This was the former National Representative for Shooting and the ability user who used the gun with exploding bullets as his weapon.</p>
<p>He was someone on Earth.</p>
<p>– …You? You! You, you’re Choi Han-! Why are you inside the cintamani-?!</p>
<p>On the other side of the cintamani… Park Jin Tae was looking at Choi Han with an anxious expression on his face.</p>
<p>For the currently unconscious Cale…</p>
<p>The God of Death had said the following in a warm voice as Cale was leaving Earth.</p>
<p>– Human. Do not think that this is the end.</p>
<p>– You never know when you might be reconnected with people you know.</p>
<p>Fate is something even the laws of the world cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Cale had been unable to tell the meaning behind those words and had called it ‘bullshit,’ however… Fated individuals would always be connected together.</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at Park Jin Tae inside the orb and blankly said something.</p>
<p>“…This is driving me crazy.”</p>
<p>– …Holy crap. Lee Chul Min! Soo Hyuk hyung, no… Call Kim Rok Soo over!</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was feeling the same way.</p>
<p>Both Choi Han and Park Jin Tae were completely bewildered right now.</p>

<p>“Hyung, who is that?”</p>
<p>Lock moved his face toward the cintamani after seeing Choi Han’s anxious expression as he focused on it.</p>
<p>– Eek!</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min, who was doing the same thing on Park Jin Tae’s side, gasped and moved back after seeing the berserk Lock.</p>
<p>– …You-</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae opened his mouth but closed it back without being able to say much.</p>
<p>‘Where the hell is this bastard right now?’</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae was at a loss for words after seeing Lock and the area visible behind Choi Han’s shoulder.</p>
<p>One unranked monster, the Electric Eel, was dead and there were many humans and peculiar looking humans as well.</p>
<p>He recalled the day when Choi Han had disappeared.</p>
<p>‘What happened to that punk Choi Han?’</p>
<p>‘He left.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had seemed oddly different when he woke up again.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the original Kim Rok Soo that Park Jin Tae knew, nor was he the Kim Rok Soo who had acted as the commander. He was someone in between those two people.</p>
<p>But Kim Rok Soo was still Kim Rok Soo, and his actions weren’t very different from when he was acting as commander.</p>
<p>However, many people didn’t know what to say after hearing what Kim Rok Soo told them.</p>
<p>‘Most of the abilities I’ve used have disappeared. I can’t use them anymore. Some of my abilities have been sealed as well.’</p>
<p>He must have ended up that way after using too much of his powers. Most of the people understood it that way, and they were just relieved that Kim Rok Soo was still alive.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae, who had been one of those relieved people, had asked about Choi Han, who seemed to have disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one who had been curious. The others had been curious as well, but they didn’t dare to ask Kim Rok Soo who still needed time to recover.</p>
<p>‘Choi Han returned to where he belongs.’</p>
<p>‘…He belongs here, so where the hell did he go?’</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had smiled and mischievously responded to Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>‘Park Jin Tae, I didn’t expect you to feel that way.’</p>
<p>‘Fuck.’</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae could not ask anything else after hearing that. However, he did notice something.</p>
<p>‘Kim Rok Soo, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Choi Jung Soo. I’m sure the three of them know something.’</p>
<p>He felt that it was especially true for Choi Jung Soo, who trained like hell using the book Choi Han gave him as he left. On the other hand, Lee Soo Hyuk seemed a bit more aloof.</p>
<p>It looked as if the burden on his heart had been lessened.</p>
<p>“Park Jin Tae. Why are you holding the cintamani?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae flinched at Choi Han’s calm question.</p>
<p>He turned away from the cintamani and looked down at his hand. He was holding a cloth. It was a cloth to clean the cintamani.</p>
<p>– …I’m currently training my mind.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had stopped Park Jin Tae’s mental training via sparring and was now making him do all sorts of different things.</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>Choi Han chuckled.</p>
<p>“I suppose you do need to train that mind of yours.”</p>
<p>– …You little punk.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae frowned and glared at Choi Han, while Lock and the others beside Choi Han looked at him with surprised expressions.</p>
<p>Choi Han was usually calm and tended to be more affectionate. He was only snappy like this against his enemies, but he seemed shocked yet happy to see this person for this guy to be an enemy.</p>
<p>‘They’re similar.’</p>
<p>Lock had only seen two people inside the cintamani but realized that their physical appearances and hair color were similar to Choi Han’s.</p>
<p>The place inside the cintamani seemed to be different from this world, where black eyes and black hair were rare to be seen.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a different world.</p>
<p>‘Mm.’</p>
<p>Lock held back a groan and kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>“This is amazing. We are able to talk to each other.”</p>
<p>Choi Han was quite amazed. He was currently speaking in the language of Cale’s world and not speaking Korean, but they were able to communicate with both sides using their respective languages.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>– Bang!</p>
<p>The door behind Park Jin Tae slammed open and Lee Chul Min came in with someone.</p>
<p>– Huff, huff.</p>
<p>Lee Chul Min was breathing heavily, but the person behind him seemed completely fine. That person quickly walked over to the cintamani.</p>
<p>– Hey, Han. Why do you look like that?</p>
<p>It was Lee Soo Hyuk.</p>
<p>“We caught the Electric Eel on this side. There was a cintamani inside the Electric Eel and it connected like this.”</p>
<p>– …Ha.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk laughed at Choi Han’s calm response and nodded his head.</p>
<p>– Then what about Rok Soo?</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae’s expression twisted as if to ask what the heck Lee Soo Hyuk was talking about while Choi Han’s face stiffened up.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae flinched at Choi Han’s stiff expression.</p>
<p>“…He is not here right now.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk focused on Choi Han’s eyes.</p>
<p>– He must have gone unconscious again.</p>
<p>He hesitated before adding on.</p>
<p>– …It’s fine as long as he is still alive.</p>
<p>However, he noticed that Choi Han’s pupils slightly shook the moment he said that. Lee Soo Hyuk felt as if his heart was sinking.</p>
<p>– Is he in critical condition?</p>
<p>Choi Han seemed to hesitate after hearing that question.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see a strong gust of wind blowing toward Choi Han.</p>
<p>“Hyung! Dodge!”</p>
<p>Lock grabbed Choi Han, who seemed to be thinking about something, by the collar and pulled him back.</p>
<p>Choi Han raised his head.</p>
<p>Where he had been standing… Someone was falling there as if he had been slammed down.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>It was Alberu.</p>
<p>Choi Han walked toward him with shock.</p>
<p>“Your highness, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Alberu raised his hand to say that he was okay before smiling in pain.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t easy.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben had told him to get on his back, but it was difficult to even get close to Eruhaben, who was trading blows with the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>He felt like a shrimp in the middle of a battle between whales.</p>
<p>The strong gusts of wind and the aftershock of the explosive blows between the two behemoths just sent Alberu flying.</p>
<p>– Sorry.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was apologizing to Alberu for not being able to do anything about it but Alberu felt as if he should be the one to apologize.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t know I was this weak.’</p>
<p>Alberu was angry at himself for being unable to even get close to Eruhaben or the Lion Dragon to attack its wings.</p>
<p>He hid his thoughts and addressed Choi Han, who was helping him up.</p>
<p>“You already caught the Electric Eel.”</p>
<p>“We’ve caught it once before, so it was easy.”</p>
<p>“So I just need to do my part.”</p>
<p>Choi Han looked at Alberu with concern after hearing his calm voice. Alberu, who had turned away as if to pretend he had not seen Choi Han’s gaze, noticed the orb in Choi Han’s other hand.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Alberu subconsciously lifted his helmet a bit.</p>
<p>“What the hell? Park Jin Tae? Lee Soo Hyuk?”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Park Jin Tae were both shocked to hear this surprised yet happy voice.</p>
<p>– What the hell? How does that punk know who I am?</p>
<p>Alberu slightly frowned after hearing Park Jin Tae’s comment.</p>
<p>“Punk? How dare you say that to the future sun?”</p>
<p>– …Huh? Is this some crazy bastard?</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>Alberu chuckled despite the dire situation they were currently in. Choi Han shook his head while looking at Park Jin Tae.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk and Park Jin Tae still seemed confused, but Alberu looked at Choi Han, the cintamani, and the Electric Eel before smirking toward the orb.</p>
<p>“You don’t know who I am?”</p>
<p>– Should I know who you are?</p>
<p>Alberu nonchalantly commented after hearing Park Jin Tae’s retort.</p>
<p>“Alberu Crossman. How about now?”</p>
<p>– …Huh?</p>
<p>I definitely heard that name before.</p>
<p>Where was it?</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae tried his best to remember. Lee Soo Hyuk’s started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>– The Dark Tiger?</p>
<p>– Eek.</p>
<p>Park Jin Tae and Lee Soo Hyuk’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Alberu smirked at them before patting Choi Han on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Just wait. I’ll make that monster fall to the ground soon enough.”</p>
<p>Oooooo-</p>
<p>He was about to cast flight magic again before he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>– Hey, crown prince!</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s urgent voice. Alberu turned his head toward the City Hall.</p>
<p>– Dark Elf Tasha called me!</p>
<p>The Dark Elf, Tasha. She was Alberu’s aunt and currently leading the Dark Elf Battle Squad.</p>
<p>She also had the Elf warriors with her right now, and they were headed for the Endable Kingdom.</p>
<p>Tasha was headed there because they needed to figure out what Sayeru, the Bears, and Arm were doing once Cale and Raon had left, and if possible, to rescue any Dark Elves who were still alive after not being used as sacrifices.</p>
<p>She had a difficult task to fulfill, but they believed she wouldn’t be in too much danger as long as it wasn’t a full-on battle since the Dark Elves had formed an alliance with the Eastern and Western continents’ Elves.</p>
<p>However, it should have taken a long time to complete this task.</p>
<p>‘She already contacted him?’</p>
<p>Alberu had an ominous feeling about the fact that Tasha was contacting them so quickly.</p>
<p>That ominous feeling turned out to be right.</p>
<p>– She said they weren’t there! The Dark Elves imprisoned in the caged carriages were there but Sayeru, the priests, the Bears, and Arm… None of them were there!</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s mind turned into a complicated mess.</p>
<p>‘Where did they go?’</p>
<p>Where did so many enemies disappear to at once?</p>
<p>Were they headed to Puzzle City?</p>
<p>Alberu became anxious after hearing about this new source of headache.</p>
<p>‘We need to hurry and take care of this Lion Dragon.’</p>
<p>What he knew for sure was that this monster wasn’t the end.</p>
<p>There was still the sealed god, and he had a feeling that something else would happen after they took care of this monster as well.</p>
<p>Alberu’s heart started to beat wildly with nervousness. He heard Choi Han’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“Lock.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Choi Han stood next to Alberu and wrapped the cintamani in cloth before handing it to Lock.</p>
<p>“Take this to Cale-nim. You just need to go to City Hall. Raon will take care of things if you tell him, ‘Kim Rok Soo.’”</p>
<p>“Kim Rok Soo? Uhh, okay! I got it.”</p>
<p>Alberu just glanced at them while Choi Han smiled the way he smiles when he pretended to be all innocent. Alberu could see the dry blood on Choi Han’s lips as he smiled.</p>
<p>Alberu couldn’t believe what Choi Han was saying while looking like that.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it together, your highness. Your instructor can’t leave his student alone. I will cover you.”</p>
<p>He could see Rosalyn, who also had blood on her lips, walking over to him as well.</p>
<p>“Your highness. I will deal with the flight magic. I will help you pierce through that gust of wind as well.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn picked up the necklace full of highest-grade magic stones as if something like that was easy to do for her.</p>
<p>Alberu was so full of disbelief that he couldn’t even laugh.</p>
<p>If Rosalyn casts the spell to send him flying and casts a barrier to block that strong gust of wind…</p>
<p>And if Choi Han covers him from the front to block the aftershock of the enemy’s attacks…</p>
<p>Then the chances of Alberu piercing through that monster’s wings would go up.</p>
<p>A shadow appeared on top of Alberu, Rosalyn, Choi Han, and the others at that moment.</p>
<p>“You all seem to be forgetting about me.”</p>
<p>Mary descended to the ground.</p>
<p>She was with the black Bone Dragon Dragon half-blood whose gold eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p>“Get on my back.”</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood offered his armored back to Alberu, Choi Han, and Rosalyn.</p>
<p>Alberu laughed and started to speak.</p>
<p>“…I guess there’s no need to get on Eruhaben-nim’s back.”</p>
<p>On the sky covered with gold dust as if it was the Milky Way…</p>
<p>Three people headed to the battlefield in the sky on top of a black Bone Dragon.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The buzz cut Dragon Rasheel could not hide his shocked expression. He grabbed Dorph by the neck and shook him around.</p>
<p>The black wall by Dorph had disappeared at some point.</p>
<p>“Hey! Snap out of it! How can you already faint?! Hey! Hey! You damn Lion! Wake the fuck up!”</p>
<p>Pow, pow, pow!</p>
<p>‘Hurry and get back up!’</p>
<p>Rasheel continued to punch Dorph’s already bloody mess of a face.</p>
<p>“Oo… oo………”</p>
<p>He heard quiet groans from the unconscious Dorph each time, but Rasheel continued to punch him without stopping.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m going to punch you until you die if you don’t wake up! Huh? Do you want to die?”</p>
<p>He just launched vicious threats to Dorph.</p>
<p>Mercenary King Bud watched Rasheel with disbelief before shouting.</p>
<p>“Rasheel-nim! Could you please help us?”</p>
<p>“No! I’m only beating up one bastard!”</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>Rasheel then kicked Dorph’s stomach.</p>
<p>Bud seemed to be scared as he turned away only to see the other Lions who were peeking at Rasheel full of fear.</p>
<p>Bud mumbled while looking at them.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess we don’t really need the help.”</p>
<p>Chhhhhhhhh-!</p>
<p>Bud’s sword was glowing with a blue aura. His eyes that were as cold as his sword glanced around the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Lions were berserk, but not doing well. They were currently gathered in one area without any means of escape.</p>
<p>They were chaotic messes after their leader, Dorph, had gone unconscious.</p>
<p>“Surround them! Make it so that they can’t escape!”</p>
<p>“They can’t beat us with this kind of numbers advantage!”</p>
<p>Now that the Rangers who had gone to rescue the Vampires were back, a total of 500 Ranger Brigade members were attacking the Lions.</p>
<p>The tens of Lions couldn’t help but be pushed back by the numbers advantage, even while berserk.</p>
<p>“You bastards!”</p>
<p>“We will never forgive you!”</p>
<p>Even some of the still weakened Vampire warriors were helping them to attack the Lions.</p>
<p>Then there were the unexpected allies.</p>
<p>“Attack those villains who tried to harm his majesty!”</p>
<p>“Leave none of them alive! They are the enemy of our Sez Kingdom!”</p>
<p>The Sez Kingdom’s Knights Brigade, soldiers, and mages who appeared once the black wall had disappeared were helping the mercenaries.</p>
<p>Their three leaders were still unconscious. King Bakehe, the Knight Captain and the top Royal Mage would despair if they saw what was going on, but they were currently unconscious without showing any signs of waking up.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain of the Royal Knights Brigade who was leading the troops right now continued to show his anger toward the Lions and Cats.</p>
<p>“Such evil people!”</p>
<p>“Hohoho.”</p>
<p>“I am impressed by the desires of the Society of Peace. I can’t thank you all enough for safely returning our majesty to us.”</p>
<p>“Hoho, it was nothing. We just did what needed to be done, the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Gashan patted Dodori, who could not hide his anxiety on the shoulder before making it look as if he was taking care of the unconscious King Bakehe.</p>
<p>The Vice Captain of the Sez Kingdom’s Royal Knights Brigade couldn’t help but throw praises at this Society of Peace Gashan mentioned after seeing Gashan looking so hard at work to take care of his king.</p>
<p>Gashan was doing this to snap the king’s head off in case he woke up and the situation took a turn, but only Bud and a few others knew about his true intentions.</p>
<p>Bud watched this and thought that he could leave the cleanup to Gashan afterward. He then anxiously bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>‘We need to hurry over.’</p>
<p>He had heard about Cale’s condition from Dodori and Gashan. He could also tell what kind of danger the Roan Kingdom was in right now.</p>
<p>‘We need to get there as quickly as possible to help them.’</p>
<p>They needed to take care of things here properly before heading over.</p>
<p>Bud looked toward the forest.</p>
<p>“I guess there’s only one left.”</p>
<p>Mount Nex was fully covered by fog.</p>
<p>About a third of it was covered by red fog.</p>
<p>He looked back at the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Ha. The Cats are so quick.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t see the Molan household or the Cats.</p>
<p>The Cats had all quickly escaped into the fog once they realized they were in danger.</p>
<p>This was the same for the Cat tribe leader.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t know Cats become so quick when they go berserk.”</p>
<p>The speed of the berserk Cats was so quick that even he, a sword master, had trouble catching them.</p>
<p>They were so efficient running away without caring about the danger their allies, the Lions and Dorph, were in. Only the Molan household barely managed to chase them into the fog.</p>
<p>Bud could not hide his anxiety and concern.</p>
<p>The forest was too quiet.</p>
<p>He heard a low voice at that moment.</p>
<p>“It’ll be over soon.”</p>
<p>Beacrox was wiping blood off his greatsword as he said that.</p>
<p>“The fact that it is silent means that we are doing well.”</p>
<p>His father would be running through the fog right now.</p>
<p>On and Hong were trying to swallow the whole mountain with their red fog.</p>
<p>Beacrox could clearly imagine what his family was doing right now.</p>
<p>The image in his mind was almost a direct representation of what was going on.</p>
<p>Inside the fog-covered forest…</p>
<p>“Ugh-!”</p>
<p>A Cat that couldn’t even make much noise before its neck was pierced fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>The body didn’t even make much noise as it fell.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>Ron wiped the blood on his dagger with a leaf before looking forward.</p>
<p>“…Grrrrrr-!”</p>
<p>Inside the fog… The berserk Cat tribe leader was glaring at Ron.</p>
<p>Behind the Cat tribe leader was a red fog that was slowly extending its territory and approaching Ron and the tribe leader.</p>

<p>“Grr… you’re annoyingly persistent.”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader was trying to catch his breath while frowning at Ron.</p>
<p>“Huuuuuu.”</p>
<p>Ron’s breath was also slightly heavy. His face was calm but his back was full of sweat. The old man’s eyes observed the berserk tribe leader.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories about berserk Cats but this is my first time seeing it in person.”</p>
<p>Berserk transformations were different based on the attributes of the Beast tribe.</p>
<p>Some of them, such as Tigers and Wolves, grew bigger and their strength increased exponentially. There were also transformations like the Whale tribe’s where there were no physical changes but a medium was used to increase their strength.</p>
<p>The Cats had their own unique transformation as well.</p>
<p>‘First, their whole body becomes covered in fur.’</p>
<p>Their body didn’t grow bigger like the Wolves but there were some physical changes.</p>
<p>‘Most importantly, they become extremely agile and don’t make any noises in their movements.’</p>
<p>They moved very quickly and didn’t make any noise when their feet touched the ground as they moved. This berserk transformation was probably why the Cats were known for being stealthy.</p>
<p>The tribe leader smirked while looking at Ron observing him.</p>
<p>“Keke. You sound very tired.”</p>
<p>Ron didn’t respond to the tribe leader. It was the truth.</p>
<p>Ron had barely caught up to the tribe leader.</p>
<p>“So persistent. Such annoyingly persistent old bastards.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader commented while looking around.</p>
<p>“How they hell do none of you groan even after getting hurt? Your venomous aura should decrease with age but your eyes are all boiling with venomous aura.”</p>
<p>The reason Ron was able to catch up to the tribe leader…</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>It was thanks to the people from the Molan Household surrounding the tribe leader.</p>
<p>Whether it was their arm or leg… They were all bleeding with injuries here and there but none of them had released a single groan.</p>
<p>“…You pestering bugs.”</p>
<p>On the way here… Attacks that made the Cats who were running away with the tribe leader stop temporarily or forever had continued all around the forest.</p>
<p>They were all attacks by the Molan household.</p>
<p>They were so persistent in chasing the Cats that they forced the Cats to split up and escape in different directions.</p>
<p>Ron responded with a stoic expression on his face.</p>
<p>“You’re left all alone thanks to those so called pestering bugs.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader frowned.</p>
<p>The Cat that was taken down by Ron’s dagger just moments ago was the last one who had been escaping with the tribe leader.</p>
<p>Ron had heard Dodori shouting behind him the moment before he jumped into the forest.</p>
<p>‘Cale fainted! It’s serious!’</p>
<p>On and Hong had run off earlier than he did and did not hear it. Ron realized that there was not much time. He needed to take care of the enemies as quickly as possible before returning to the Roan Kingdom.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>Ron raised his hand and the people from the Molan household who had not made a single noise disappeared into the fog at his signal.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>The Cat tribe leader scoffed as if he found them ridiculous but still prepared for their attacks.</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>There was an eerie noise and the fog around them started to roar.</p>
<p>“Grrrrrrr. Did you really think you could survive after stepping into my domain?”</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s fog ability… Adding on his extremely improved speed and soundless movement from his berserk transformation…</p>
<p>Those two together made it so that coming into the fog domain of a berserk Fog Cat was pretty much asking to be killed.</p>
<p>However, he soon frowned.</p>
<p>“…These crazy bastards!”</p>
<p>The rest of the Molan household other than Ron who had disappeared into the fog moved away from the tribe leader.</p>
<p>The tribe leader quickly swung the dagger in his hand.</p>
<p>Claaaaang!</p>
<p>Ron’s dagger and the tribe leader’s dagger slammed into each other and made a terrible noise.</p>
<p>They were inside the tribe leader’s thick fog. However, the tribe leader could see Ron’s face clearly because he was the master of this fog.</p>
<p>Ron was smiling.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I said I was going to kill you, you bastard.”</p>
<p>“…Is that why you sent your damn subordinates elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader frowned.</p>
<p>Ron should not be able to see him inside this thick fog. But he was looking right at him. What was going on?</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader then saw a faint red light in his fog and urgently looked behind him.</p>
<p>He could see a red fog trying extremely hard to break into his fog domain.</p>
<p>Small amounts of it were able to push its way into his fog domain.</p>
<p>‘Those motherfucking mutant bastards!’</p>
<p>This was definitely On and Hong’s fog.</p>
<p>Not just that, this was poisonous fog.</p>
<p>That red fog must be telling this damn Molan patriarch about his location.</p>
<p>The tribe leader started sweating.</p>
<p>He had seen the fog that had covered about half of the mountain as he ran away earlier.</p>
<p>‘…How the hell can a twelve year old create such fog?! How can she be so similar to her father-?!’</p>
<p>On and Hong’s father, the former tribe leader, was extremely weak physically compared to the other Cats because he could not go berserk.</p>
<p>The Cats were also a tribe that had to fight. Stealthiness and movement were the two most important things when it came to assassination.</p>
<p>However, the former tribe leader’s fog ability was much stronger than anybody else his age.</p>
<p>“Hmph! Do you really think that the fog of an inferior punk will be able to surpass mine?!”</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>The fog roared again. His fog was quite thick fitting his title as the current tribe leader, making it so that they couldn’t even see the grass on the ground.</p>
<p>Forget that faint red fog, even dust could not make it into this domain.</p>
<p>The tribe leader, the only one who could see in this fog, started to move.</p>
<p>He made no noise even though his feet were stepping on grass.</p>
<p>Slaaash-!</p>
<p>However, a dagger came flying at him even as he was moving stealthily and efficiently.</p>
<p>‘How does he know where I am?!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader could see Ron’s dagger that was flying directly at his new location.</p>
<p>He quickly blocked Ron’s dagger.</p>
<p>‘Fuck!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader could not say anything and just changed directions. It was to aim for Ron’s side since Ron should not be able to see him.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>However, Ron twisted his body and blocked that attack with the dagger in his other hand.</p>
<p>There was a new dagger in his other hand that aimed for the tribe leader’s neck.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p>
<p>Inside the thick fog… The tribe leader and Ron’s battle continued.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader was astonished that Ron was able to accurately block his attack and launch another attack when he should be the only one who could see in the fog.</p>
<p>‘Holy shit, how?!’</p>
<p>Ron continued to pester away to take the tribe leader’s life.</p>
<p>‘This area only has my fog!’</p>
<p>The mutants’ fog was not here and this was completely his domain.</p>
<p>So how was this old bastard moving as if he could see?!</p>
<p>The tribe leader couldn’t even escape from these daggers aiming for him. He had to focus on Ron’s attacks that were getting even sharper.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Clang! Claaaaang!</p>
<p>The endless sounds of their daggers clashing ripped through the forest.</p>
<p>‘Holy crap! Why the fuck is an old man so strong?!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s forehead was dripping with sweat.</p>
<p>Dagger arts. Strength.</p>
<p>Ron was slowly starting to surpass the tribe leader in all aspects.</p>
<p>The Cats did not grow stronger when they went berserk. Their original strength remained the same.</p>
<p>‘Unbelievable!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s hand that was holding his dagger was hurting.</p>
<p>But he didn’t have time to pay attention to that.</p>
<p>‘How…how is he able to attack me when he can’t see-?!’</p>
<p>Extreme swiftness and silent footsteps… There was also the Fog Cat Tribe’s fog. The tribe leader had achieved victory over and over using these three things to take away the enemy’s sight.</p>
<p>But he had no answer since all three things were not working here.</p>
<p>Claaaaang!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>He finally could not help but groan while pushing away a dagger headed for him.</p>
<p>It was the moment the silence was broken.</p>
<p>“How?!”</p>
<p>He shouted while looking at Ron.</p>
<p>“How the hell did you do it?! Are you able to see me?! What magic did you use?!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader could see Ron smirking at him. The old man’s entire body was covered in sweat but he said a single word with a calm expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Breath.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Ron didn’t care about the tribe leader’s response and immediately started attacking again.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Claaaaang! Clang! Tang!</p>
<p>The battle started once again. Ron focused as much as possible for this fight.</p>
<p>In that last battle against the Cats at Sheritt’s Castle of Light…</p>
<p>Ron had been training to go up against the Fog Cat Tribe ever since that time.</p>
<p>Ron’s training had been simple.</p>
<p>‘Find the enemy’s opening.’</p>
<p>Ron was someone who became stronger in a different manner from Choi Han, Rosalyn, Beacrox and the others.</p>
<p>It wasn’t important for an assassin to be stronger than their target.</p>
<p>What mattered was how well they could aim for an enemy’s opening.</p>
<p>That was the important part.</p>
<p>Ron found the Cat’s opening.</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>Ron couldn’t help but make noises whenever he moved. But the Cat tribe leader made no noises.</p>
<p>However, the Cat tribe leader always made a certain noise.</p>
<p>It was the sound of his breathing.</p>
<p>He made noises breathing in and breathing out. Ron followed that noise and moved his dagger.</p>
<p>‘His breathing is slowly getting heavier.’</p>
<p>Ron had cleaned his dagger and sharpened his senses day after day. His aging body was trying to make his hearing get worse but Ron continued to remember a certain moment in the past that would force him to sharpen his senses once again.</p>
<p>As for the moment Ron recalled…</p>
<p>It was running away with the young Beacrox.</p>
<p>Running for survival… Running to save his son…</p>
<p>He was on the run, doing anything and everything to avoid the enemies. The scariest thing at that time was the noises of people breathing.</p>
<p>That symbolized that enemies who would kill him and his son were getting closer.</p>
<p>He remembered those days where he had to cover his mouth and his son’s mouth despite their heavy breathing while shaking in fear after hearing footsteps or breathing.</p>
<p>Finally, Ron was able to completely restore his senses to be as sharp as it had been back then.</p>
<p>Claaaaang!</p>
<p>“This motherfucking old bastard!”</p>
<p>Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat dripped down the side of Ron’s face and fell down from his chin.</p>
<p>He had used a lot of his mental fortitude to focus for so long.</p>
<p>He then smirked toward the tribe leader who should be looking at him.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit old so it would have been difficult if you got stronger after going berserk. I’m relieved you only got faster. I’ll be able to easily kill you.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s eyes roared with anger.</p>
<p>He accepted that he could not run away or hide in the fog and chose to put everything on the line to attack this old bastard.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>He used every ounce of strength to attack Ron.</p>
<p>Claaaaang! Clang! Tang!</p>
<p>Their battle continued again. The tribe leader sneered after seeing that Ron was extremely tired as well.</p>
<p>“Keke. Fine! Let’s keep fighting like this! You’ll be the first to die, you old bastard!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader could see a tree behind Ron.</p>
<p>He lifted his foot and kicked toward Ron.</p>
<p>Pow!</p>
<p>The tribe leader swung his dagger the moment Ron raised both arms to block his kick and Ron barely dodged that dagger before his back hit the tree.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was quite a loud noise and the tribe leader saw the slightly stiffened expression on Ron’s face before immediately moving his dagger toward Ron’s neck.</p>
<p>“Time to finish this!”</p>
<p>A benign smile appeared on Ron’s face as soon as the tribe leader said that.</p>
<p>“Who knows?”</p>
<p>It was so benign that the tribe leader subconsciously questioned what might be going on. Ron happily informed him.</p>
<p>“There are children who are learning everything I know.”</p>
<p>Ron had taught stealth techniques and everything he knew other than assassination skills to the children who had lived the life of runaways as he had experienced.</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>A very quiet noise reached the tribe leader’s ears.</p>
<p>It was above his head.</p>
<p>He heard it from the leaves on the tree.</p>
<p>He had to dodge Ron’s attacks that were at a higher level than he had expected and the sound of their daggers clashing had been so loud that… He did not notice someone who was stealthier than most assassins sneaking into the fog.</p>
<p>‘An intruder!’</p>
<p>The moment the tribe leader finally realized someone was in his domain…</p>
<p>The moment he saw that intruder land on the ground and start to move…</p>
<p>Slaaash-!</p>
<p>He heard something being slashed.</p>
<p>The tribe leader looked down after hearing the noise and could not move.</p>
<p>You, you-”</p>
<p>Something sharp had slashed his ankle and revealed the flesh underneath.</p>
<p>“You always have to be careful of what’s underneath your feet, nya.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader heard the voice of the younger of the inferior shits.</p>
<p>Hong, who had climbed across trees and stealthily approached him, smiled the same way Cale usually smiles.</p>
<p>Hong’s small but sharp claws that were full of poison left some not too deep yet not too shallow marks on the tribe leader’s ankle.</p>
<p>Drip. Drip.</p>
<p>Black poison was dripping from his claws.</p>
<p>“You shithead-, ugh!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader who tried to swing his dagger toward Hong stumbled as the world seemed to spin.</p>
<p>Hong moved his claws once more.</p>
<p>Slaaaash-</p>
<p>The marks opened even more and the black poison seeped in.</p>
<p>You, you-!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader plopped down on the ground and felt as if he was suffocating as he looked at the black poison.</p>
<p>Black poison.</p>
<p>This was most likely deadly.</p>
<p>At that moment… He heard On’s calm voice through the fog. Rustle. Rustle. On did not hesitate as she approached the tribe leader.</p>
<p>“10 minutes. You’ll die if you don’t get the antidote for that poison in 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>The tribe leader focused his gaze even as everything continued to spin and raised his head.</p>
<p>Ron was crouching in front of him.</p>
<p>“I guess you’ll die soon.”</p>
<p>The tribe leader frowned after hearing Ron’s calm voice.</p>
<p>‘Die? I’m going to die from this inferior shithead’s poison?’</p>
<p>It wasn’t even a strong attack. It was just enough poison to slash his ankle.</p>
<p>But he could not ignore what they just said.</p>
<p>The poison was so strong that he became so dizzy that he couldn’t even control his body as soon as it entered his body.</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s whole body was shaking.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Do you want us to let you live?”</p>
<p>The tribe leader shouted in anger at Ron’s nonchalant voice.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I would beg for my life?! I will never lower my head to those inferior little punks!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s eyes were going dark. His eyes were closing along with the dizziness.</p>
<p>He thought that he was going to die like this.</p>
<p>He could barely make out the silver Cat that was approaching him.</p>
<p>“Who cares if we can’t go berserk?”</p>
<p>On continued speaking to the tribe leader who was doing his best to keep his eyes open.</p>
<p>“We won in the end, nya.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>The tribe leader sneered at the little thing saying that she had won.</p>
<p>“You won? Keke. Kahahaha! You won?”</p>
<p>He determined that he couldn’t overcome this dizziness or prevent his eyes from closing.</p>
<p>“Yeah. We won nya. You jelly?”</p>
<p>The corner of the Kitten’s lips curled up into a sneer.</p>
<p>The tribe leader fumed in anger after seeing that smirk.</p>
<p>‘I, I can’t die like this!’</p>
<p>He could not accept dying while looking at this shitty kid smirking at him. He opened his mouth to speak. He shouted with every ounce of strength he had left.</p>
<p>“You guys will die in the end! Once the temple door opens, you guys will di-”</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>Darkness covered his eyes and the tribe leader could not open his eyes again. His body limped over.</p>
<p>On, Hong, and Ron just quietly looked at him.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The tribe leader’s fog completely disappeared.</p>
<p>On and Hong’s red fog gobbled up the rest of the Fog Cat Tribe’s fog on Mount Nex.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“…Shit.”</p>
<p>That made the last of the escaping Cats plop down in disbelief.</p>
<p>The fact that the tribe leader’s fog disappeared meant that the tribe leader had lost…which probably meant that he was dead.</p>
<p>Hong looked at the tribe leader’s closed eyes and started speaking.</p>
<p>“He fell asleep right away, nya.”</p>
<p>Huuuu. Huuuu.</p>
<p>The tribe leader was in a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Hong’s black poison was actually a sleeping poison.</p>
<p>“You fall asleep faster the more tired you are nya! This motherfucking tribe leader must have been very tired nya.”</p>
<p>Hong, who described the tribe leader with a term that would make Cale gasp if he had heard it, excitedly looked toward On and Ron.</p>
<p>Hong, who was about to tell them that they should quickly bind him up and take him back with them, flinched after looking at the two of them.</p>
<p>“…Temple?”</p>
<p>On tilted her head and mumbled to herself while Ron urgently grabbed the tribe leader by the neck and started running toward the rest of their allies.</p>
<p>On and Hong were shocked at his action and quickly chased after him but Ron did not have the luxury to wait for them.</p>
<p>‘A temple can only mean!’</p>
<p>The tribe leader had said ‘temple’ as what he believed were to be his last words before his death.</p>
<p>There was only one temple door for the Cats or the White Star’s side to open.</p>
<p>‘The sealed god!’</p>
<p>The sealed god, otherwise known as the God of Despair.</p>
<p>Their side did not know where that god was sealed.</p>
<p>Ron’s mind was quickly moving as he thought about it.</p>
<p>‘The summoning ritual is supposed to take place in Puzzle City.’</p>
<p>He combined the information he knew to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that the temple door of the sealed god will open in Puzzle City?’</p>
<p>Ron started to sweat for a different reason.</p>
<p>“I must inform them.”</p>
<p>He needed to quickly inform his allies, especially the ones in Puzzle City, about this new information.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaaa. Man, that shield sure is sturdy.”</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben looked at his front paw with a slightly fatigued expression.</p>
<p>His golden hide was slowly starting to crack as well. He observed his current condition before looking forward.</p>
<p>“…Kill… Kill the strong intruder……”</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon charged toward Eruhaben once more with its shield that didn’t have a single scratch on it.</p>
<p>‘It keeps saying the same thing. Is it really the guardian for something?’</p>
<p>Eruhaben thought for a moment before dodging the shield swinging toward him and attacking the Lion Dragon with his claw.</p>
<p>Continuing to keep the monster occupied…</p>
<p>Was the best Eruhaben could do alone.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack. Craaaaaaack.</p>
<p>Eruhaben’s hide continued to crack from his paw to the rest of his body.</p>

<p>Chapter 655 – Everything can be connected 5</p>
<p>The sharp claws that resembled eagle talons charged toward Eruhaben’s neck from behind the shield.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang!</p>
<p>There was a loud explosion and a golden barrier blocked the claw.</p>
<p>Pss-</p>
<p>The barrier instantly scattered back to dust while Eruhaben used the opening to aim for the now visible Lion Dragon’s arm with his claw.</p>
<p>Baaaaang—!</p>
<p>“Disgustingly quick.”</p>
<p>The spot where the Lion Dragon’s revealed arm had been was replaced with the white shield to nullify Eruhaben’s attack.</p>
<p>It had all happened in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>Two bangs and a strong gust of wind burst out every time the two creatures exchanged attacks.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>A man clenched one hand around the roof in order to prevent himself from falling off from the force of the impacts.</p>
<p>“Kehehe! Hehehe.”</p>
<p>The Milky Way created by golden dust… The large creatures fighting underneath it…</p>
<p>And the people and Beasts on the ground killing the other monster…</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooong–</p>
<p>The man looked toward his hand that was not holding onto the corner of the roof.</p>
<p>Clopeh Sekka. The video recording device that the man was looking at was glowing in multiple colors as it recorded everything that was happening.</p>
<p>“Kehehe. Yes, it should be like this.”</p>
<p>The corners of Clopeh’s lips curled up as high as possible.</p>
<p>His old-fashioned outfit was a mess because of the impact of Eruhaben and the Lion Dragon’s battle but his smile truly seemed fitting for a man who was called the Guardian Knight.</p>
<p>He let go of the hand holding onto the roof for a moment and grabbed the video recording device with both hands.</p>
<p>“…I spent so much money on this video recording device. I knew a day like this would come.”</p>
<p>His eyes were so full of joy that they looked crazed.</p>
<p>The others couldn’t see this but Clopeh’s video recording device looked different from the general video recording devices.</p>
<p>There were multiple devices hanging underneath it as well as quite a few highest-grade magic stones. There were even magic circles on it.</p>
<p>‘I had to work so hard to get one that works even without a mage by my side.’</p>
<p>This was a prototype video recording device that he had pushed the mages of the North to develop.</p>
<p>As long as mage activated the orb it could continue running without anybody controlling it.</p>
<p>The magic stones continued to infuse mana into it and the magic stones kept the device running.</p>
<p>Clopeh touched the video recording device.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>He pressed a small switch on the apparatus. (TL: I just can’t help using the terms we see in the official manhwa translation at least once).</p>
<p>– Finally!</p>
<p>A new screen appeared on the video recording device and Queen Litana’s face was visible.</p>
<p>– We finally managed to get in contact with someone!</p>
<p>This orb was both a video recording device and a video communication device in one.</p>
<p>There was a video communication magic circle on it as well.</p>
<p>Ooooooooong.</p>
<p>Mana was flowing out of an extremely expensive highest-grade magic stone and provided a stable connection.</p>
<p>– …Sir Clopeh, are you okay?</p>
<p>This was the first person she was able to contact. Litana was smiling but looking at Clopeh, whose hair was a mess, with concern.</p>
<p>“I’m okay, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Litana stopped talking for a moment before urgently speaking once again while looking at the faint smile on Clopeh’s face.</p>
<p>– Sir Clopeh, we contacted you because we were unable to contact the crown prince of Roan Kingdom!</p>
<p>Alberu could not pick up any calls as he was currently in a fierce battle. Raon had stepped in to facilitate contact with some kingdoms but there were many who were not included so far.</p>
<p>The Jungle. The Whipper Kingdom. The Breck Kingdom and others.</p>
<p>Most of the kingdoms of the Western continent were not included in Raon’s current flow of information.</p>
<p>– Saint Jack said that we could contact the Roan Kingdom through him but Mogoru was quite busy dealing with enemies as well.</p>
<p>Saint Jack had planned on gathering information to deliver to Raon but he couldn’t do it as much as he wanted because of the number of enemies Mogoru was facing. The other kingdoms were in similar situations.</p>
<p>However, some kingdoms were in different situations.</p>
<p>– We have gotten rid of a majority of our invaders.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the kingdoms that were strong enough to get rid of the invaders quickly.</p>
<p>There were two kingdoms like that.</p>
<p>First was the Jungle led by Litana and the second was the Whipper Kingdom with Commander Toonka.</p>
<p>– We heard from Saint Jack. He told us that you were currently in the Roan Kingdom, Sir Clopeh.</p>
<p>Litana had contacted Clopeh as soon as they were pretty much done dealing with the invaders and was relieved to make contact with him.</p>
<p>– How is it over there?</p>
<p>She could see that Clopeh Sekka’s eyes were calm without any changes after hearing her question.</p>
<p>He slowly closed his eyes before opening them back and starting to speak.</p>
<p>“It’ll probably be faster if you saw it yourself.”</p>
<p>His voice sounded both calm and reverent.</p>
<p>Litana could see the battlefield once the screen turned.</p>
<p>– That, that-?!</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>– …Dragon!</p>
<p>She could see a gold Dragon covered in a golden light.</p>
<p>– …Is that the monster?</p>
<p>She then saw the monster that looked to be easily dealing with the gold Dragon.</p>
<p>She was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Alberu Crossman had told her that the monsters that show up in Puzzle City might be able to destroy the entire continent.</p>
<p>She had believed him, but still had thought, ‘is that really possible?’ She still doubted whether they would really be that strong.</p>
<p>– …He was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Alberu had not been exaggerating.</p>
<p>Even though she was only looking through the screen, Litana couldn’t help but be fearful about whether she would be able to protect her kingdom if such a monster was to show up on her territory.</p>
<p>She then realized something and quickly asked.</p>
<p>– The others, what about the others?</p>
<p>She could only see the Dragon and the monster. She did not see any people around them.</p>
<p>“I shall show you.”</p>
<p>The screen slowly looked down.</p>
<p>– Ah.</p>
<p>Litana could see the large snake with two heads.</p>
<p>It was not as majestic as the monster fighting against the Dragon, but it looked majestic even when it was down on the ground.</p>
<p>Litana didn’t know what to say after taking a look at the dead monster and the destroyed area around it.</p>
<p>“Our allies caught it.”</p>
<p>She could only bite down on her lower lip as Clopeh calmly explained the situation to her.</p>
<p>She barely managed to speak.</p>
<p>– …Amazing.</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wide again as she made that comment.</p>
<p>– Huh?!</p>
<p>Clopeh’s eyes clouded over as well.</p>
<p>“As expected, Choi Han-”</p>
<p>There was an armored black Bone Dragon.</p>
<p>Choi Han, Alberu, and Rosalyn got on top of its back.</p>
<p>– Isn’t that Sir Choi Han and crown prince Alberu?</p>
<p>“That’s right. They plan on heading up to the sky to fight alongside the Dragon.”</p>
<p>Boom- boooooom!</p>
<p>The loud noises from the fight between two large creatures were hurting Litana’s ears through the call. Just hearing the noises was making her scared but Litana clenched her fists together as she watched the people heading into the battlefield.</p>
<p>She then realized something.</p>
<p>– …Where is young master Cale?</p>
<p>The person she expected to see first, the person who always stood in the front and showed the others his back no matter how much they tried to stop him, was not there.</p>
<p>“I heard that young master Cale is currently unconscious. Only two monsters were summoned thanks to his efforts.</p>
<p>– Ah.</p>
<p>Litana gasped and covered her face with both hands.</p>
<p>Seeing how strong these two monsters looked, she could tell that it must have been extremely difficult to prevent the other six from being summoned as well.</p>
<p>She could tell even without seeing what had happened.</p>
<p>She then heard Clopeh’s voice.</p>
<p>“He will be back soon.”</p>
<p>Clopeh’s eyes were full of an odd fiery passion.</p>
<p>‘Yes, the moment the hero returns… That is when the real legend will begin!’</p>
<p>Litana firmed her resolve while looking at Clopeh’s passionate gaze that showed that he had not given up yet, without knowing Clopeh’s true inner thoughts.</p>
<p>– Soon.</p>
<p>She stood up to turn the video communication device off.</p>
<p>– We will head to Puzzle City soon.</p>
<p>The call ended as soon as she said that.</p>
<p>Clopeh looked at the screen for a moment before moving his hand again.</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooong–</p>
<p>Another place… The Whipper Kingdom kept calling him as well.</p>
<p>He was certain that the person calling him must be Commander Toonka.</p>
<p>“I guess the Jungle and the Whipper Kingdom will be here right away.”</p>
<p>Clopeh was speaking nonchalantly but was making sure he was recording everything that happened on the battlefield without missing anything.</p>
<p>All emotion disappeared from Clopeh’s face.</p>
<p>“A legend only becomes a legend when people keep talking about it. They must not forget.”</p>
<p>Everything that happened here must remain a story that was passed down in this kingdom and this continent for a very long time.</p>
<p>Clopeh’s video recording device recorded everybody on the battlefield at least once even without Cale there.</p>
<p>In the free city that would be created in between the Mogoru and the Roan Kingdom in the future… The city that would be famous for its Magic Tower and Alchemy Tower will have a building that would be just as famous as those two towers.</p>
<p>That building is the Henituse Museum, the largest museum in the world that the Henituse Duchy would fully fund to create.</p>
<p>The item that would be located in the most central region of that museum would be this video recording device currently in Clopeh Sekka’s hand.</p>
<p>Numerous people will come visit the Henituse Museum to see this video recording device.</p>
<p>Clopeh had a stoic expression on his face as he held that video recording device in his hand.</p>
<p>“It’d be extremely unfair if nobody knew about how hard everybody worked.”</p>
<p>He looked toward the Bone Dragon and the three heroes who were shooting up into the air.</p>
<p>He then peeked toward the Puzzle City City Hall.</p>
<p>That was where Cale Henituse was right now.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The door to the City Hall office Cale was in right now burst open.</p>
<p>Baaaaang!</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes opened wide after turning his head toward the door.</p>
<p>“Hmm? It’s Dodori’s mom!”</p>
<p>“Hi Raon. Just call me auntie. I’m Sheritt unnie’s close younger sister.”</p>
<p>“Okay auntie!”</p>
<p>Dodori’s mom Mila had her hoe in her hand as she looked at Raon with a warm expression on her face before it instantly changed.</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, Raon… what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I’m very busy right now!”</p>
<p>She walked over to Cale and Raon.</p>
<p>Mila’s grip tightened on the hoe after seeing that Cale was obviously in a serious condition. However, she couldn’t help but flinch after looking at Raon who was right next to Cale.</p>
<p>“…Raon?”</p>
<p>Raon was rummaging through Cale’s shirt’s inner pocket.</p>
<p>“I’m looting my human right now!”</p>
<p>Raon openly admitted to looting Cale before taking off Cale’s outerwear and shaking it up and down.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>Cale’s spatial pocket bag and one other item fell out of the outerwear. Raon quickly grabbed that item.</p>
<p>“Found it!”</p>
<p>Raon was holding the golden top’s whip in his front paw.</p>
<p>Raon tightly clenched the golden top’s whip with both paws and shook it intensely.</p>
<p>“Wind Elementals!”</p>
<p>Raon was listening to the messages on the video communication device and realized that there was one extremely important piece of information that was missing.</p>
<p>That was why he had urgently looked for the golden top’s whip.</p>
<p>“Can you hear my voice? I am the great and mighty Raon Miru! I can’t hear you guys! But if you can hear me!”</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes were burning up with anger.</p>
<p>“The White Star! Please find out where that stupid white thing is right now! And please let me know where he is however you can do so!”</p>
<p>The White Star.</p>
<p>They needed to figure out where that bastard was right now.</p>
<p>This monster would not be the end.</p>
<p>They said they were going to conduct the summoning ritual for the sealed god as well.</p>
<p>They needed to know the White Star’s current location if they wanted to plan for the future.</p>
<p>“That should be one of the most pivotal pieces of information for the human right now! So please help me!”</p>
<p>Raon desperately shouted while holding the golden top’s whip.</p>
<p>Sadly, Raon could not hear the voices of the Elementals even while holding the whip.</p>
<p>However, a faint breeze flew outside the terrace.</p>
<p>Chhhhh-</p>
<p>The curtains shook because of that breeze. Raon noticed that small movement and his eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>“It’s on you guys now, Wind Elementals!”</p>
<p>Raon made up his mind.</p>
<p>‘Once we find the White Star…’</p>
<p>His dark blue eyes were burning up even more.</p>
<p>‘I will make it so that he can never touch my human or my family ever again.’</p>
<p>Oooooong– oooooong–</p>
<p>Black mana fluctuated around the young Dragon as if to respond to his determination.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>However, that moment did not last very long.</p>
<p>“Please move.”</p>
<p>Cale was lying on the bed. Mila walked over and lifted Raon, who had been rummaging through Cale’s outerwear while sitting right next to him, and moved him to the ground.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Raon looked at Mila with confusion at her suddenly moving him but Mila pointed to the video communication devices floating in the air.</p>
<p>The video communication devices were currently turned off. Everybody was busy fighting and couldn’t leave them on at all times so they would only contact Raon as needed.</p>
<p>“Can you move the video communication devices to the corner for me? They might get in your auntie’s way as she works.”</p>
<p>Smile.</p>
<p>Mila gently smiled.</p>
<p>“I came to heal Dodori’s teacher.”</p>
<p>“W, what did you just say?!”</p>
<p>Raon jumped up while holding the golden top’s whip and the spatial pocket bag.</p>
<p>Mila pretended not to see the teardrops forming at the corners of Raon’s shaking eyes and patted his head.</p>
<p>“I need to focus. Can you please help me?”</p>
<p>“I, I got it! O, of course I’ll help!”</p>
<p>Raon quickly dragged the video communication devices to a corner and made it so that they could not see the bed.</p>
<p>Mila watched for a moment before turning back toward Cale.</p>
<p>“…Haaaaa…. haaaaa…….”</p>
<p>Cale was breathing very lightly and weakly.</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to hurry.”</p>
<p>“Auntie! Can I he-</p>
<p>Mmph!”</p>
<p>Raon stopped talking and quickly covered his mouth. His round eyes opened even rounder.</p>
<p>‘T, the hoe is glowing!’</p>
<p>The hoe in Mila’s hand…</p>
<p>Swoooooooooosh–</p>
<p>A gust of wind came out from the hoe and filled the whole office.</p>
<p>However, beige-colored mana that was thicker than the wind consumed the entire area. Raon turned his head.</p>
<p>“H, human!”</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack-</p>
<p>Cale’s entire body was starting to crack.</p>
<p>His body was cracking as if he was a ceramic plate that was starting to break.</p>
<p>“Raon. You don’t need to be shocked.”</p>
<p>Raon looked toward Mila after hearing her gentle voice.</p>
<p>He forgot that he was shocked and observed the expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Our teacher really seems to have suffered a lot.”</p>
<p>Mila observed the cracks appearing on Cale’s body with an extremely sad expression on her face.</p>
<p>“The plate is something that is inside a human’s body.”</p>
<p>Cale had asked if it was possible to connect an intangible thing such as a person’s plate.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason you can’t connect it if you turn it from an intangible to a tangible item.”</p>
<p>Mila thoroughly inspected the cracks on Cale’s body.</p>
<p>There was not a spot on his body that didn’t have a crack.</p>
<p>This showed that Cale’s plate was in an extremely dangerous situation right now.</p>
<p>“Forget waking up, his plate is going to melt at this rate.”</p>
<p>She motioned to Raon.</p>
<p>“Raon, do you want to come here and take a look?”</p>
<p>She smiled at him.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get rid of all of these small cracks now.”</p>
<p>She’ll make it so that he didn’t have a single scar.</p>
<p>She planned on connecting everything until Cale was slick and smooth.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to do and could take a toll on her body for using so much of her ability.</p>
<p>However, she needed to do this no matter what.</p>
<p>‘…Eruhaben.’</p>
<p>She needed to carry on the ancient Dragon’s will.</p>
<p>“Now then, shall we get started? We need our teacher to wake up as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! Everything you said is right, auntie!”</p>
<p>Mila, who saw the hope in Raon’s eyes, continued to smile as she reached her hand out toward Cale’s cracked body.</p>
<p>Beige-colored mana flowed out of her finger looking like long threads.</p>
<p>Those threads started to touch Cale’s body that was covered in cracks.</p>
<p>Every spot that was cracking started to become connected again.</p>
<p>“Ha… haaaaa…….”</p>
<p>Cale’s light breathing continued to echo through the room while Mila bit down on her lips without letting Raon see after seeing that Cale still couldn’t wake up.</p>
<p>– Oo! The plate, the plate is finally starting to connect together!</p>
<p>– Wow, I didn’t know Dragons had this kind of ability. I think this Dragon is the strongest Dragon.</p>
<p>– This is a jackpot, a total jackpot!</p>
<p>The ancient powers cheered while feeling Mila’s power seeping into Cale’s body.</p>
<p>The Super Rock shouted in a low voice.</p>
<p>– Cale, Cale! Can you hear us?</p>
<p>He continued to call out to Cale who was still unconscious.</p>
<p>Cale needed to wake up as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>However, Cale could not hear the Super Rock’s voice right now.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect this at all.”</p>
<p>The unconscious Cale realized that he was not in the real world as soon as he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He was in the same room he had been in when he first opened his eyes in this world.</p>
<p>He was in Cale Henituse’s bedroom.</p>
<p>He continued to lie on the bed and turned his head to the side.</p>
<p>The reason he could tell for sure that this wasn’t the real world was right there. A man who was sitting on chair noticed his gaze and started to speak.</p>
<p>“Kim Rok Soo, you’re finally up?”</p>
<p>Cale observed the man calling him Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>It was team leader Kim Rok Soo in his mid-thirties. Team leader Kim Rok Soo was looking at Cale with an odd expression on his face.</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth as soon as he looked into those eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you Cale Henituse?”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo in his mid-thirties had a twisted smile on his face.</p>
<p>“You recognized me right away.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo, who gestured like a prim and proper noble, something that the original Kim Rok Soo in his mid-thirties would ever do, nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I am Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>The two souls that had switched places were looking at their respective bodies.</p>

<p>Chapter 656 – Everything can be connected 6</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo who was in Cale Henituse’s body…</p>
<p>And Cale Henituse who was in Kim Rok Soo’s body…</p>
<p>The two of them could not take their eyes off of each other for a while.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse.”</p>
<p>The first to speak was Kim Rok Soo, who was currently using Cale Henituse’s body.</p>
<p>“How am I able to meet with you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I was working the night shift and fell asleep for a moment to see that you were in this bed. But you see…”</p>
<p>The real Cale Henituse, who was making a kind of smile the original Kim Rok Soo would never make, mischievously asked.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you planning on living in that body?”</p>
<p>The sudden question that was asked mischievously felt quite heavy. The real Cale Henituse shrugged his shoulders and added on.</p>
<p>“I plan on living the rest of my life in this body. That’s why I plan on throwing away the name of Cale Henituse and living as Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>The real Cale Henituse’s eyes were calm. They weren’t shaking at all.</p>
<p>The real Kim Rok Soo quietly looked at the person who was in his real body before opening his mouth.</p>
<p>“…So you want me to call you Kim Rok Soo?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Why? You don’t want to? Don’t you plan on finishing your life as Cale Henituse as well? Then you should throw away the name of Kim Rok Soo now.”</p>
<p>“Pffft.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo inside Cale Henituse’s body… No, the person who had made up his mind to become Cale Henituse nodded his head and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Sure. We’ll do as you said, Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“Good, Cale Henituse. Now our outer appearances match our names.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at Kim Rok Soo, who was laughing and making gestures that he would never have made, and nonchalantly added on.</p>
<p>“I guess you’ve really been happy.”</p>
<p>He recalled the moment he met with Lee Soo Hyuk and got the ‘Embrace’ ability.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk had handed Cale the ability and told him about the real Cale Henituse as he disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Oh, by the way, the original owner of your body is living well too. He’s happy. That is why Jung Soo, I, and everybody is happy.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had a bright smile that suited a twenty-year-old person and not someone in his mid-thirties.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I met someone I wanted to see for a long time.”</p>
<p>Cale felt quite odd facing Kim Rok Soo, who was smiling in a way he had never smiled when he had been Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“Who was the person you wanted to see?”</p>
<p>“My mother.”</p>
<p>Cale was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>It was someone who had felt distant to Cale because she was not mentioned much in [ The Birth of a Hero ]. Duchess Violan felt more like a mother to him.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, Cale had never heard anything about Cale Henituse’s birth mother during his time at the Henituse Estate.</p>
<p>It was pretty much taboo to talk about Cale’s birth mother in that house.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo shrugged his shoulders and continued speaking after seeing the confused look on Cale’s face.</p>
<p>“Cale Henituse, my mother reincarnated in the world you used to live in, the world I live in now.”</p>
<p>“…She reincarnated on Earth?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Earth 1. That’s the world Team Leader Kim Rok Soo in his thirties is in.”</p>
<p>Cale learned that his original world was Earth 1. He also recalled that Alberu’s Unbreakable Spear Taerang came from Earth 3.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that the sealed god’s test was on Earth 2?’</p>
<p>Cale pushed that potentially true but unverified thought to the side to focus on Kim Rok Soo’s words.</p>
<p>“My reincarnated mother lost her parents when she was very young because of an unranked monster’s attack and was left all alone. I’m trying hard to become her family.”</p>
<p>A bitter yet proud smile was on Kim Rok Soo’s face. Cale thought for a moment before asking.</p>
<p>“If she reincarnated, she should be younger than you, no?”</p>
<p>“Ha. She currently calls me uncle.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo shook his head as if he still couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>But the fact that he did not seem lonely made Cale understand why the real Cale Henituse made up his mind to live as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo sat up and looked toward Cale, who was leaning on the head of the bed.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you the details, but I don’t know how much time we have so I’ll stop this story there.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Cale shared his honest sentiments.</p>
<p>“I want to hear the details, but I’m kind of in a rush right now.”</p>
<p>He was worried about what might have happened in Puzzle City and how his friends would be fighting while he was unconscious.</p>
<p>“But I’ve been here a few times to know that I can’t get out of here whenever I please.”</p>
<p>Cale could never leave this place on his own accord the few times he had been here.</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t know. I still have a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo nodded his head as if he got some good information before hesitating for a moment and then adding on.</p>
<p>“…The family is all well?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo smiled differently after hearing Cale’s nonchalant but firm response. His sorrowful smile made Cale a bit emotional.</p>
<p>That was why he added on.</p>
<p>“Everybody is doing well. Father and mother are healthy. Lily is learning to use the sword. I want to make Basen be the territory Lord. But for now, he is just helping out with the administration of the territory.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo scratched his forehead with his index finger.</p>
<p>“Cale, don’t you think that Basen should be the next territory lord?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to do it. Lily or Basen can do it if they want. Basen seemed almost willing to do it when I saw him last time.”</p>
<p>Cale looked disgusted at the thought of becoming the territory lord, and Kim Rok Soo looked at Cale Henituse’s expression that he would have never made if he was still in his body and started to speak again.</p>
<p>“His personality is a perfect fit for the territory lord. I guess he still doesn’t think that the position should be his though.”</p>
<p>Cale stared at Kim Rok Soo when he heard that.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo flinched before realizing something and quietly laughing.</p>
<p>“Basen… Yes, you’re curious about Basen, right? You’ve probably been thinking about his age. We’re only three years apart. You probably thought it was weird. It wasn’t mentioned in The Birth of a Hero after all.”</p>
<p>“The Birth of a Hero? You know about the book?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I was in your room when I opened my eyes and the book was there.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo answered as if it was nothing before debating for a moment and looking at Cale.</p>
<p>“When I first spoke to Basen…”</p>
<p>It had been less than one month since Basen came to the Henituse County with Countess Violan.</p>
<p>“I said these things to that kid at that time.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo recalled that moment and repeated the words he said to Basen to Cale.</p>
<p>“Basen. You are part of the Henituse household. Remember that. No matter where you go, your family name is Henituse. Got it? Don’t you remember what father said? Listen to me unless you are an idiot. Tell people that the Henituse blood flows through you. Tell them that no matter what.”</p>
<p>Basen had responded back saying he couldn’t do that, and the young Cale had responded like this.</p>
<p>“Shut the hell up. Do as I said. Otherwise, you won’t be able to live in this house. Do you think that the cousins and the collateral family will leave you alone? Are you going to be dumb?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Cale made a noise as he quietly listened.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo gently grabbed Cale’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t know whose blood flows through Basen Henituse’s body, but that kid is my younger brother, Lily’s older brother, Count Deruth’s son, and Countess Violan’s son. He’s definitely someone with the mindset of Count Henituse’s family.”</p>
<p>Cale looked at the emotions flowing through Kim Rok Soo’s eyes before closing his eyes for a moment and then opening them back.</p>
<p>He recalled Basen’s face in his mind when he closed his eyes. Even if their hair color was different… He could see the weak yet stubborn face that resembled the pale Cale’s face than Deruth’s or Violan’s.</p>
<p>“Basen is my dongsaeng as well.”</p>
<p>“……He is. What else do you need other than that?”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo removed his hand from Cale’s shoulder while looking at Cale’s expression that seemed to be saying that there was no need to respond to him. He then added on.</p>
<p>“You can ask Countess Violan about the details. You’ll probably need to chat with her if you want Basen to be the territory lord.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo shook his head with nostalgic eyes, as if he was thinking about the past.</p>
<p>“…Haaaa. No matter how much I acted as trash and the cousins wanted to kick me out, the Countess and Basen wouldn’t budge. You’ll need to convince Countess Violan if you don’t want to be the territory lord.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale let out a small gasp. Kim Rok Soo looked at him with confusion as Cale sternly corrected him.</p>
<p>“It’s the Henituse Duchy now. It’s no longer a County.”</p>
<p>“Wow. That’s amazing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It is. We’re quite an amazing household.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had a bright smile on his face as he watched Cale nod his head. Cale frowned.</p>
<p>“…Hey.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“…You… Don’t the others say anything when you smile like that in my body?”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo touched the corners of his lips as if he was wondering what the issue was.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with my smile? They were all happy that their team leader-nim let them go home early.”</p>
<p>“…Are you doing your job properly?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m going to make sure to save this world I’m living in right now. I’ll make it so that the people around me can live in peace.”</p>
<p>Cale closed his mouth after hearing Kim Rok Soo’s response. He had the same desires as the real Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>This world where he was living as Cale right now… He wanted to protect this place. He would definitely protect this place.</p>
<p>“Ah, but is my smile really weird?”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was still touching the corners of his lips.</p>
<p>“I think it gives off a mature feel and makes me look charming.”</p>
<p>Cale almost scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Ho. You’re talking about a mature feel with my face-”</p>
<p>He felt as if he would get a headache for a different reason. He had never imagined meeting the real Cale Henituse, but he definitely did not expect to hear such bullshit now that he somehow did meet him.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo responded as if there was no problem.</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m over forty years old after all.”</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Cale’s gaze turned sharp as he looked toward Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“…Why are you forty?”</p>
<p>Cale had opened his eyes inside the 18 years old Cale Henituse’s body.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo looked right into Cale’s confused eyes and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“The moment Choi Jung Soo died, the God of Death offered him a deal.”</p>
<p>He was asked whether he wanted to stay alive and be transported to a different world or to save Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>The God of Death told Choi Jung Soo to make the decision, and Choi Jung Soo chose his death.</p>
<p>“The God of Death offers you a deal at the moment of your death or if you are in extreme danger that could potentially lead to your death. When I was forty… Umm, basically, the God of Death offered me a deal when I was about to die and I accepted it.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo. The real Cale Henituse had accepted the deal with the God of Death.</p>
<p>“The conditions the God of Death offered me were simple.”</p>
<p>Cale could finally see the remorse deep inside Kim Rok Soo’s eyes that was clearly different from Kim Rok Soo’s bright smile.</p>
<p>That emotion was similar to Cale’s own emotions.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo continued speaking to the one person he could share the conditions of his deal with.</p>
<p>“As soon as I returned to the moment I met Choi Han, the starting point that could change the fate of our world, I would go into the body of a person named Kim Rok Soo in a different world. That was the condition of the deal.”</p>
<p>The God of Death had also told him that his mother had reincarnated into this Kim Rok Soo person’s world and was living a lonely life.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I accepted that deal?”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo put his hand against his forehead as if he had a headache. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes that were full of remorse could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>“Where should I start… Hmm…”</p>
<p>He was silent for a bit before finally starting to speak again.</p>
<p>“I hate Harris Village.”</p>
<p>“Harris Village?’</p>
<p>Cale recalled the information about Harris Village after unexpectedly hearing about it.</p>
<p>The Forest of Darkness was one of the Forbidden Regions.</p>
<p>Harris Village was the village separated from the forest by a single wall. It was where Choi Han first met people of this world after finding his way out of the Forest of Darkness and where the Tigers, Wolves, and Cale’s friends resided right now.</p>
<p>Choi Han left Harris Village and headed for the Henituse Lord’s Estate after the people of the village were massacred by Arm.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s eyes were still closed as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“My mother said that she was going to visit Harris Village. There was something she needed to bury there. I found it odd that my mother needed to go to a village she had no connections with, a village that was just one of many in our territory.”</p>
<p>His voice was calm, but the things he was saying were quite shocking.</p>
<p>“My mother left for Harris Village even though it was pouring rain and the wind was strong. I was quite worried because her body had always been weak. And then…”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo stopped for a moment as if it was difficult to say before continuing with a stoic expression on his face.</p>
<p>“She ended up seriously injured because the carriage tipped over on her way back due to the storm. She received treatment back home after that but unfortunately, she passed away.”</p>
<p>Cale felt as if he could hear the roaring wind from that day despite never having heard it.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was calm.</p>
<p>“But the carriage accident was not the reason my mother passed away. It wasn’t that bad of an accident. Nobody other than my mother got hurt either. But everybody thinks that my mother passed away because of the injuries from the accident.”</p>
<p>He sighed while keeping his eyes closed.</p>
<p>“I only learned about the real reason for her death after meeting the God of Death. My mother…”</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment and opened his eyes to look at Cale.</p>
<p>“I think that my mother expected things would end up like this.”</p>
<p>As if he was opening a chest that had sunk deep down inside a lake… Kim Rok Soo started to share these old stories with the person who was living as Cale Henituse in his place.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo spoke with sorrow visible on his face.</p>
<p>“My mother possessed an ancient power.”</p>
<p>‘…What?’</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t hide his shock this time.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse’s birth mother possessed an ancient power. He had never expected that.</p>
<p>The Birth of a Hero…</p>
<p>The story of someone who was neither the main character nor a supporting character, the story of an extra in the story was being shared.</p>
<p>However, it was also the story of someone who just lived her life, even if it wasn’t mentioned in the story.</p>

<p>“I’m the only one who knows that my mother possessed an ancient power.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo chuckled.</p>
<p>“Maybe it was because I was young, but I really liked how my mother said that it was a secret just between the two of us.”</p>
<p>Cale opened his mouth to untangle the mess inside his head.</p>
<p>“Which ancient power did she have?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo thought about it for a moment before standing up. He moved away from the bed Cale was leaning on and slowly walked around the bedroom.</p>
<p>“My mother possessed a wood attribute ancient power.”</p>
<p>Cale thought about the wood attribute ancient power in the Henituse territory.</p>
<p>‘The Indestructible Shield.’</p>
<p>It was the first ancient power Cale got that surrounds his heart now and was used quite frequently by him.</p>
<p>It was the power that was sleeping underneath the black tree that grew where the glutton priestess had died.</p>
<p>The black tree had turned white and transferred the power to Cale when he woke it up.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s not the Indestructible Shield.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo seemed to have noticed Cale’s thoughts as he instantly said it was not that power. He then smiled after noticing Cale’s gaze.</p>
<p>“I read The Birth of a Hero and it mentioned the Indestructible Shield. I knew you would have gotten that power for yourself. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I took it.”</p>
<p>“Awesome. I had a feeling you would do that.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>He then stood in front of the window with the closed curtains. He was standing in front of a large window that usually allowed the sunlight to reach all the way to Cale’s bed.</p>
<p>“Cale, do you know about the annual rings of a tree?”</p>
<p>“The rings you see when you chop down a tree?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Cale didn’t ask why Kim Rok Soo was suddenly asking about annual rings.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo touched the curtain as he continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Looking at the annual rings of a tree lets you know the approximate age of it. Each circle represents one year. Annual rings look different based on where the tree is growing, the nearby environment, and weather.”</p>
<p>A wood attribute ancient power.</p>
<p>“My mother said that she could see the annual rings of all living things.”</p>
<p>“Annual rings.”</p>
<p>Cale said those words once out loud. His expression then turned odd. Kim Rok Soo then added on.</p>
<p>“She said that she could see the entire annual rings of a person from birth to death.”</p>
<p>Cale Henituse’s mother had a wood attribute ancient power.</p>
<p>That power allowed her to see a living being’s birth to its death.</p>
<p>“But you see…”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo turned to look at Cale.</p>
<p>“My mother sat me down and told me something at one point.”</p>
<p>He recalled a memory from when he was very young. It was a conversation that he somehow could not forget, despite how long it has been.</p>
<p>“My dear Cale. Sometimes, there are people whose annual rings are warped. In that case, it is highly likely that that person has a peculiar experience with time.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo recalled how his mother had caressed his red hair and how his little fingers had played with her just-as-red hair as he said that out loud.</p>
<p>“Cale, you are a child who will have a peculiar experience with time.”</p>
<p>Cale brushed his face with both hands. Kim Rok Soo just continued to speak in a calm voice.</p>
<p>“My mother said that after looking at my entire annual rings. But I couldn’t understand what she meant at that time. I only understood it when I turned forty years old.”</p>
<p>He had received an offer from the God of Death as he was about to die at the age of forty.</p>
<p>“But you see, Cale Henituse…”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s voice sunk low.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve seen this power before. Doesn’t it remind you of someone you know?”</p>
<p>Cale kept his mouth shut and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo whispered while looking at him.</p>
<p>“You should have a record of experiencing a power similar to my mother’s.”</p>
<p>Cale had started to recall information in his mind related to wood attribute ancient powers since Kim Rok Soo first mentioned it.</p>
<p>He was recalling information from the book, [ The Birth of a Hero ]…</p>
<p>Then he recalled the records of the strong individuals with wood attribute ancient power in the Mercenaries Guild’s Directory…</p>
<p>Finally, he recalled memories of any person who used wood attribute ancient powers.</p>
<p>Cale slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I have indeed seen a similar power once, as you mentioned.”</p>
<p>Before Cale got the ancient White Star’s earth attribute ancient power…</p>
<p>He had led the White Star and Bear King Sayeru to one of the Forbidden Regions, the desert with the Dark Elves’ Underground City.</p>
<p>Cale had released fake information about how the ancient White Star’s earth attribute ancient power was in the other abandoned Underground City in the desert.</p>
<p>The White Star ran into Cale in that abandoned Underground City and took quite a lot of damage.</p>
<p>“The White Star-”</p>
<p>Cale recalled something the White Star did in that memory.</p>
<p>“The White Star touched a dead tree.”</p>
<p>Smoke had come out of the White Star’s hand as he caressed a dead tree in the Underground City.</p>
<p>“That bastard knew from a single touch when that tree had died.”</p>
<p>He knew that, although the tree looked very dry; it had only died in the past week. He had figured it out almost instantly.</p>
<p>“The White Star frequently said that Choi Han and my time is warped.”</p>
<p>The things the White Star had said to Cale in the past brushed through his mind.</p>
<p>‘Time is warped for that swordsman.’</p>
<p>‘Both Choi Han and you have your time warped, like I do.’</p>
<p>‘But even though I can tell that your time is warped, I couldn’t tell how it was warped.’</p>
<p>‘Possession? Who are you that is inside Cale Henituse’s body? From body to body… You moved around while preparing. You’ve been preparing for a very long time. You continued to live while jumping from body to body like that.’</p>
<p>Of course, the White Star incorrectly assumed that Cale was someone like him who possessed different bodies for a very long time. But at least the White Star seemed extremely certain that Choi Han, Cale, and his time were warped.</p>
<p>“I suspected that the White Star’s wood attribute ancient power might be related to time or that he had a different time attribute ancient power.”</p>
<p>He had brushed aside the fact that the White Star observed the tree with some kind of smoke.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t expect it to be annual rings.”</p>
<p>Cale stopped there and did not say anything else.</p>
<p>What he would have said next was…</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that the White Star has Cale Henituse’s mother’s power?’</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p>‘Was the White Star responsible for the carriage accident and mother’s death?’</p>
<p>He could not say those things out loud.</p>
<p>Cale frowned and kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t get the wrong idea.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Kim Rok Soo after hearing his voice. There was a faint smile on Kim Rok Soo’s face.</p>
<p>“The White Star was not responsible for mother’s death.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale quietly gasped.</p>
<p>Hearing Cale’s sigh of relief helped Kim Rok Soo understand who taught those company employees who worked so hard to take care of him when he first arrived in Kim Rok Soo’s body and could not adjust properly.</p>
<p>‘It’s because he’s like this that I can tell him everything.’</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo started to speak again.</p>
<p>He didn’t know when he would get a moment to talk with Cale like this ever again.</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought about what the future would have looked like in The Birth of a Hero?”</p>
<p>Cale could not answer that question so easily now.</p>
<p>Cale had experienced too many difficult things in the past 2+ years to just answer that Choi Han would have taken care of everything.</p>
<p>“When I was forty…”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo continued to speak.</p>
<p>“The Roan Kingdom was razed to the ground. The Henituse County was ruined as well. I was the only one left alive in our family.”</p>
<p>Cale gasped in shock.</p>
<p>Just hearing about it made it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>It made him recall the test he had to go through on Wind Island to get the golden top’s whip.</p>
<p>It was a future Cale never wanted to see. Kim Rok Soo was talking about that future.</p>
<p>“After taking over the Eastern continent, the White Star’s first target on the Western continent was the Roan Kingdom. More specifically, it was Puzzle City. He started from Puzzle City, then went to the northeast region, and then the southeast region. I don’t know why he started with Puzzle City as his first target.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo didn’t know, but Cale knew.</p>
<p>‘It was probably so that he could do the summoning ritual for the sealed god in Puzzle City.’</p>
<p>He could predict what the White Star would have been thinking about.</p>
<p>“King Zed Crossman died in the battle against the White Star, while crown prince Alberu Crossman fought many battles against the White Star to recover the Roan Kingdom’s eastern areas. Choi Han, Rosalyn, and Lock helped Alberu with that.”</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“That war took close to twenty years?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It continued until I turned forty. The Roan Kingdom protected the palace and its western territories and continued to fight against the White Star while he invaded and conquered the Whipper Kingdom, Breck Kingdom, and other areas. We were extremely persistent. We truly looked like a kingdom that had survived through many things for a very long time.”</p>
<p>A war that would continue for about twenty years…</p>
<p>Cale clenched his fists thinking about how ruined both the Eastern and Western continents would have been.</p>
<p>The story that happened after volume 5 of The Birth of a Hero was one that Cale didn’t want to happen.</p>
<p>The smile was gone on Kim Rok Soo’s face and was replaced by fatigue from the long period of war.</p>
<p>“The Roan Kingdom continued to recruit people as we needed soldiers to fight against the White Star and his subordinates. I signed up for it.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo looked down at his arm.</p>
<p>He had been happy to see all the scars on this body when he first woke up in it.</p>
<p>The owner of this body must have suffered a lot too. He has scars all over his body as I did.</p>
<p>Such thoughts helped him start to like this body.</p>
<p>“I needed to get revenge. I needed to get revenge on the White Star who destroyed our territory and my family. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to kill that bastard, but I thought I could only die in peace if I could even leave a damn scratch on him.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was looking up into the air.</p>
<p>“And I finally got the chance.”</p>
<p>The corners of his lips slightly went up.</p>
<p>“The strong individuals throughout the Eastern and Western continents gathered together with Choi Han at the center. Crown prince Alberu rallied together the survivors from the kingdoms that fell while opposing the White Star and the kingdoms that were still fighting against him as well.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s heart still beat wildly when thinking about that time.</p>
<p>“We headed for Puzzle City after hearing that the White Star was preparing for something in Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>That was the start of the Great Battle.</p>
<p>“It was such an intense battle. So many people died. I was lucky to last quite a while in it, but it was only because I was trapped underneath ally corpses.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s eyes were full of an odd fiery passion.</p>
<p>“It was then! That’s when I saw it.”</p>
<p>His gaze turned toward Cale.</p>
<p>“The White Star grabbed Choi Han’s arm with his hand that was releasing smoke. He then said the following.”</p>
<p>Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s heart was beating wildly.</p>
<p>He recalled the things he heard the White Star saying as he laid there being crushed underneath ally corpses.</p>
<p>“Time is warped oddly for you.”</p>
<p>He had realized it at that moment.</p>
<p>“That bastard has my mother’s power.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had then made eye contact with the White Star, who was wearing a mask that covered everything above his nose.</p>
<p>“The White Star found me and shot a fire toward me. That was how I ended up in danger of dying.”</p>
<p>“…Is that when you made the deal with the God of Death?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo stopped there and took a breath. His hand that was holding the curtain was already full of sweat.</p>
<p>“I learned about how my mother died while making that deal with the God of Death.”</p>
<p>The conditions the God of Death offered the real Cale Henituse was that as soon as he returned to the moment he met Choi Han, the starting point that could change the fate of our world, he would go into the body of a person named Kim Rok Soo in a different world.</p>
<p>“It was because my condition was to learn the truth about my mother’s death as well as saving my territory and family.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo recalled his conversation with the God of Death.</p>
<p>‘If you go into the body of the person you are about to possess, that will be enough to change the fate of this world. That is all I can tell you.’</p>
<p>He did not share this part with Cale Henituse.</p>
<p>Instead, he told him the truth about his mother’s death.</p>
<p>“My mother had gone to Harris Village to secretly hide a portion of her ancient power.”</p>
<p>Cale couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>“You can transfer an ancient power while you are alive?”</p>
<p>Ancient powers were supposed to remain in the place where the user died.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s possible.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo had a sad smile on his face.</p>
<p>“As long as that person is willing to break their plate.”</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Cale gasped.</p>
<p>Every person had a ‘plate.’</p>
<p>Ancient powers were stored in this plate as well. Cale’s plate was large, but quite weak.</p>
<p>Cale Henituse’s mother had broken her own plate to secretly bury a portion of her ancient power in Harris Village.</p>
<p>Cale barely managed to say something.</p>
<p>“…If a person’s plate breaks-”</p>
<p>“They die.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo calmly answered, but Cale could see the understanding and sorrow in his eyes. But neither of those emotions could subdue the resentment clearly visible in Kim Rok Soo’s eyes.</p>
<p>These were probably the feelings Kim Rok Soo had for his mother.</p>
<p>He noticed Cale’s gaze and buried those emotions before starting to speak about something else.</p>
<p>“The first thing I did when I woke up in your room was reading The Birth of a Hero. This is a hypothesis I came up with while reading it.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo was making it clear that it was his thoughts and may not be true.</p>
<p>“You know how everybody dies in Harris Village, which leads to Choi Han heading out? The White Star would have needed to go to Harris Village at least once to get my mother’s power.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale had been thinking about that as well. Kim Rok Soo shared his suspicions.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it possible that the White Star got my mother’s power from Harris Village while Choi Han was out? Then he left his subordinates to take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>‘Arm’ delivers the dead mana from the black swamp inside the Forest of Darkness to the mermaids in The Birth of a Hero.</p>
<p>The mermaids use that dead mana in their war against the Whale tribe, leading Choi Han to help the Whales fight.</p>
<p>A lot of different pieces of information popped up and then sank back down in Cale’s mind. Kim Rok Soo noticed Cale’s face stiffening with thought and quickly added on.</p>
<p>“I might be wrong. My suspicions might be completely wrong.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head and quietly sighed.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo let go of the curtain and walked over to Cale.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what I will tell you now is the important part. What is the White Star doing right now?”</p>
<p>Cale answered without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“He’s aiming for Puzzle City.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo’s face stiffened up as he commented.</p>
<p>“I guess there is a reason the God of Death let the two of us meet.”</p>
<p>Cale noticed the reason as well. He got up from the bed and stood in front of Kim Rok Soo. The two of them looked at each other and Cale asked a question.</p>
<p>“That wood attribute ancient power… Where is the rest of it?”</p>
<p>He said that Cale Henituse’s mother had buried a portion of the power in Harris Village.</p>
<p>That meant that the rest was still elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Cale.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo quietly whispered.</p>
<p>“It was weird that the White Star killed me. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>He recalled the moment he potentially died and realized something.</p>
<p>“That bastard knew that time was warped for Choi Han, but didn’t know that it was warped for me. What could that mean?”</p>
<p>Cale calmly answered.</p>
<p>“That means he can only see the past. Time wasn’t warped for you at that time.”</p>
<p>For the forty years old Cale Henituse…</p>
<p>His time had not been warped just yet. His time only became warped when he made a deal with the God of Death after that.</p>
<p>“That’s right. But my mother’s power even saw my ‘future’ where time would get warped for me.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Chhhhhhh-</p>
<p>The curtains started to move on their own.</p>
<p>The curtains moved away from the large window and they could see outside.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo started speaking after looking outside the curtains.</p>
<p>“Hey. What the hell did you use my body to do?”</p>
<p>They could see the inside of the Puzzle City City Hall office through the window.</p>
<p>The whole room was full of beige mana. Cale’s body was full of cracks as he lay on the bed and Mila was about half-way done with putting him back together.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo stared at Cale in shock, and Cale just avoided his gaze.</p>
<p>“Ahem. Hem.”</p>
<p>“Ho.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo shook his head from side to side.</p>
<p>The window slowly started to open at that moment.</p>
<p>Screeeech-</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew in from the outside toward Cale and Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>“I guess it is about time to say goodbye.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo offered Cale his hand.</p>
<p>“Cale, go to mother’s grave.”</p>
<p>Cale shook his hand. They could both feel each other’s body heat that proved that they were both alive.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo continued to speak with a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>“There should be an item with half of the power near the tomb.”</p>
<p>Just like the Sound of the Wind’s top…</p>
<p>Just like the pebble for the Scary Giant Cobblestone…</p>
<p>Some sort of item would be there waiting for someone to come find it.</p>
<p>The man who decided to live as Cale and not Kim Rok Soo from now on answered the man who would continue living as Kim Rok Soo from here on.</p>
<p>“Live peacefully.”</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo smiled and responded.</p>
<p>“It looks like you will need to struggle a little longer, but anyway, live well. Please take care of my family.”</p>
<p>“Please take care of my team members.”</p>
<p>Both men let go of each other’s hand with a small amount of sorrow visible in their eyes.</p>
<p>Cale headed toward the window. Kim Rok Soo headed for the bedroom door.</p>
<p>“I guess I go out through the door and you go out through the window?”</p>
<p>“I guess so. It’d be nice to chat more, but I’m kind of busy.”</p>
<p>“Me too. Why the hell do I need to work the night shift so often? Haaaaa. I need to become the CEO of your company and get rid of the night shift.”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Kim Rok Soo turned the doorknob. Cale felt a bit nostalgic looking at his office through the door. But he turned away.</p>
<p>He pulled open the window.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>A gentle breeze rushed past his face.</p>
<p>He stepped on the window ledge and said goodbye to the other him behind him.</p>
<p>“Stay safe, Kim Rok Soo.”</p>
<p>“You too. Stay safe.”</p>
<p>Cale jumped out the window while Kim Rok Soo opened the door all the way.</p>
<p>The two of them headed out into their respective worlds.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“…Oo…oooo……”</p>
<p>Cale subconsciously started to groan.</p>
<p>“Auntie! Our human seems to have woken up!”</p>
<p>“No! I’m not done putting him together yet! Raon, honey, knock him back out!”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Auntie, I don’t think that’s right!”</p>
<p>“Mm. I guess that’s a bit too much, huh?”</p>
<p>Mila, who had told Raon to knock Cale out, gently addressed Cale, whose eyelids were fluttering.</p>
<p>“Teacher, are you awake? You can open your eyes.”</p>
<p>This was the thought on Cale’s mind as soon as he came back to this world.</p>
<p>‘…These scary Dragons.’</p>
<p>He slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>And at that moment…</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>“Huff, huff. Young master-nim!”</p>
<p>Lock rushed into the office while holding the cintamani that was somewhat wrapped in cloth.</p>

<p>Chapter 658 – Everything can be connected 8</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff.”</p>
<p>Lock, who was breathing heavily, froze in the spot. He felt as if the ground underneath him was falling apart and even forgot about breathing.</p>
<p>“Y, young master-nim-”</p>
<p>Rosalyn had told him on his way here that Cale was unconscious. He expected Cale to be pale and covered in blood, as he had been in previous battles.</p>
<p>Lock didn’t even want to think about it, let alone see it, but ran here as quickly as possible at Choi Han’s request.</p>
<p>And the reality he saw was…</p>
<p>“…S, something like this-”</p>
<p>He never even imagined it would be something like this.</p>
<p>Lock’s hands that were holding the orb were shaking.</p>
<p>On the bed within the office…</p>
<p>Cale was lying on that furniture that didn’t seem to belong in here.</p>
<p>He was pale.</p>
<p>His clothes were covered in dark red patches from blood.</p>
<p>Dry blood and dust were all over his face and body.</p>
<p>“W, why is your body, w, what is going on?”</p>
<p>He saw the cracks all over Cale’s body.</p>
<p>Cale had cracks all over as if he was a cracked marble. There were also large and small injuries all over his body.</p>
<p>Cracks and injuries…</p>
<p>Just seeing these things made it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>“I want to know as well. What is going on?”</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Mila with a stoic expression.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I am currently connecting together the pieces of your plate. Please don’t move.”</p>
<p>She pointed to the left side of Cale’s body. Something was happening on half of his body.</p>
<p>“See, look over here. The cracks and injuries on the left side are almost completely connected with a beige thread, right?”</p>
<p>Those spots were indeed connected by the beige thread, Mila’s mana, and slowly fusing together.</p>
<p>“I started with the left side because the side with the heart is more important. Teacher, please wait about thirty more minutes. I should be done by then. Getting it started is the hard part, and then it goes quickly.”</p>
<p>She smiled and Cale nodded his head before turning toward Lock.</p>
<p>“I’m currently being healed.”</p>
<p>“No, young master-nim- Y, you can’t c, call this healing-”</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Lock frowned as Cale ignored his stuttering words and asked something to him.</p>
<p>“Whether I am okay or not is not the problem right now!’</p>
<p>He had had so many things he wanted to say and was about to say them when he looked toward Raon.</p>
<p>Raon’s eyes were still teary, but Raon was smiling and fluttering his wings without knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Raon as well.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Raon was sniffling before he shouted toward Cale who was asking him if he was okay and observing him from head to toe.</p>
<p>“H, human, you’re a poopy dumbo!”</p>
<p>“…What dumbo?”</p>
<p>Cale looked stupefied.</p>
<p>Raon shouted once more toward Cale who looked stupefied but still thoroughly observed his eyes and expression.</p>
<p>“Human, you are a! Poopy! Dumbo!”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Cale debated for a moment before looking at Mila’s doleful smile and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I guess I did act a bit like a poopy dumbo this time.”</p>
<p>“Human! I’m relieved that you know! You are a poopy dumbo! So!”</p>
<p>Raon stuffed his face on the bed right next to Cale since he did not dare to get any close while Cale was being connected together and shouted again.</p>
<p>“So, just trust me and leave everything to me from now on! I took very good care of things right now too!”</p>
<p>Raon’s wings fluttered.</p>
<p>Raon shouted once more with his voice muffled because his face was buried on the bed.</p>
<p>“I, if you do something like this ever again!”</p>
<p>Raon’s two front paws that were clutching onto the sheets were shaking.</p>
<p>If Cale used that power ever again…</p>
<p>“Human, I’m going to imprison you inside my castle! Of course, I will feed you! I will give you meat every meal! But I will make it so that you can’t ever leave your bed!”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Raon flinched after hearing Cale’s response. He sounded…happy.</p>
<p>Raon jerked his head up in shock and there was a giant puddle of tears where Raon’s face had been.</p>
<p>“H, human! Y, you like the thought of being imprisoned in the castle so that you can’t do anything other than eat three times a day?!”</p>
<p>‘…Uhh…mm. Yes, I do?’</p>
<p>Cale thought about a slacker life.</p>
<p>But Cale could not respond, ‘yes,’ because Raon’s eyes seemed to be on fire as he rapidly shouted more things.</p>
<p>“Human! What about farming? I agreed to plant apple trees with the gentle Beacrox! I’ll make you apple pies! And what about our plan to travel the world? I want to travel the world!”</p>
<p>Cale’s pupils started to shake.</p>
<p>‘Traveling the world.’</p>
<p>Those words gave him the chills for some reason, but he decided to play along with Raon.</p>
<p>“We need to do whatever you guys want to do.”</p>
<p>“Human, that’s right! It’ll be fun to do everything together!”</p>
<p>As Cale was quietly taking in Raon’s bright smile…</p>
<p>– Cale, you’re up?</p>
<p>– Oh, holy shit! He’s finally awake!</p>
<p>– The Dragon is restoring his plate too! He should be okay now!</p>
<p>– This Dragon is really amazing! It’s a total jackpot! I’d even be willing to buy an expensive meal for a Dragon like this!</p>
<p>Cale chuckled while listening to the wowed voices of the ancient powers.</p>
<p>“Umm, young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Lock slowly walked over to Cale’s side. Lock was looking at how the cracks on Cale’s body were slowly being fused together by the beige mana.</p>
<p>“Umm, Choi Han hyung told me to deliver this to you.”</p>
<p>Lock still did not forget what he came to do.</p>
<p>Lock removed the cloth from the orb.</p>
<p>“Choi Han hyung called this a cintamani. It came out from the monster. This is that-”</p>
<p>“A cintamani?”</p>
<p>Cale’s expression brightened a bit. He didn’t know how long he was out for, but it seemed that they killed at least one of the unranked monsters without Choi Han, Raon, or Mila getting injured.</p>
<p>Shhh.</p>
<p>The cloth was completely removed and he could see the orb.</p>
<p>– Can we talk now?</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It was a chaotic situation right now.</p>
<p>Now that the cloth covering the screen was gone, the person who was silent finally started to speak.</p>
<p>“What the…?”</p>
<p>Cale started to frown.</p>
<p>“…Am I still out of it?”</p>
<p>“No! Human, this is the real world! Don’t faint again!”</p>
<p>He seemed to be back to reality based on what Raon just said.</p>
<p>Cale turned back toward the orb Lock was holding.</p>
<p>“By the way, human! What is that?”</p>
<p>– Is…that really you?</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was sitting on a chair looking at him through the orb. Behind him were Kim Rok Soo and Choi Jung Soo, with Park Jin Tae who was pushed to the back doing his best to peek this way.</p>
<p>“…Ha!”</p>
<p>Cale was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“…The cintamani had this kind of ability?”</p>
<p>He recalled what the God of Death had said to him.</p>
<p>‘Human, do not think that this is the end.’</p>
<p>‘You never know when you might be reconnected with people you know.’</p>
<p>‘Fate is something even the laws of the world cannot fathom.’</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“This damn God bastard……”</p>
<p>He sounded upset but a corner of his mouth curled up.</p>
<p>The three people on the other side of the orb changed expressions after hearing him.</p>
<p>– …It really is you.</p>
<p>They were smiling or crying… Actually, it was hard to tell what kind of emotions they were feeling.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo had been covering his mouth from the moment he saw Cale, but now he was wiping his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk was smiling gently, but his eyes were focused on observing Cale through the orb.</p>
<p>As for Kim Rok Soo…</p>
<p>– …Ha.</p>
<p>He was sighing in disbelief with a somewhat similar yet different expression from Cale.</p>
<p>Choi Jung Soo mumbled in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>– How you were fighting here… I guess that’s how your daily life is over there. Or maybe it is even worse?</p>
<p>He wasn’t really talking to anybody and just looking up into the air as he said that.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked at Cale, who looked completely different unlike Choi Han, but started to speak while looking into those same eyes he had seen before.</p>
<p>– Rok… It must be quite hard over there.</p>
<p>He didn’t dare to call him Rok Soo.</p>
<p>He had not been able to see anything at first because he was busy looking at Cale, but he could see a young Dragon and two other people who looked like things he would only see in his imagination.</p>
<p>He couldn’t call Cale that name in front of them when he looked completely different.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, Choi Jung Soo, and Kim Rok Soo.</p>
<p>The three of them didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Mila, Raon, and Lock were all curious as well but just did their parts as they didn’t dare say anything either.</p>
<p>Mila just focused on finishing her connecting together and looked toward the orb with an odd expression on her face.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p>
<p>“These are the people who were in the world I went to during the sealed god’s test.”</p>
<p>“Human, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>Cale had never told the others any details about the sealed god’s test.</p>
<p>Cale’s shocked allies on this side turned to look at his other allies inside the orb.</p>
<p>“How many days has it been over there?”</p>
<p>– Not that long.</p>
<p>“As I expected.”</p>
<p>Cale remembered that the time here was about three times faster than the time there and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I guess the cintamani is serving as a medium for us to be able to contact each other.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, who was looking at Cale speaking calmly as if he was not in any pain at all despite having cracks and injuries all over his body that seemed to be healing, slowly started to speak.</p>
<p>– I see. It seems-</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaaaa– baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang–</p>
<p>They heard a loud noise outside the terrace.</p>
<p>Cale turned his gaze.</p>
<p>“Open the curtains.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t look out through the terrace window because the curtains were closed.</p>
<p>Mila had closed the curtains almost all the way with just a small gap for Raon to go in and out in order to focus on using Connect Together instead of what was going on outside.</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>
<p>Raon flinched after hearing Cale telling him to open the curtains again.</p>
<p>Cale continued to speak to Raon.</p>
<p>“I won’t push myself past the limit like that ever again. I promise.”</p>
<p>Raon channeled his mana after hearing the word, ‘promise.’</p>
<p>Chhhhh-</p>
<p>The curtains opened and they could see what was going on outside.</p>
<p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
<p>The sky was filled with a golden light.</p>
<p>A large Gold Dragon and a white monster with a lion’s mane were fighting.</p>
<p>Golden dust and the Gold Dragon relentlessly attacked the white monster’s shield, causing these loud explosions.</p>
<p>“Human-”</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, you see-”</p>
<p>“Teacher, I shall explain things for you.”</p>
<p>Cale continued to look out the window despite all of the voices talking to him. His eyes were taking in every inch of the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“It looks like we need to save our chat for later.”</p>
<p>He looked up toward the orb.</p>
<p>“See you later.”</p>
<p>– …I wish that we could help.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk nodded his head with a bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things he wanted to say and a lot of things he wanted to hear, but the situation on Cale’s side was too terrible for a long chat.</p>
<p>– We won’t bother you.</p>
<p>“Instead, please watch.”</p>
<p>– What?</p>
<p>“…This is a monster you may end up having to face in the future.”</p>
<p>Cale then asked Raon for a favor.</p>
<p>“Raon. Can you hold onto this orb for a while? Make sure to show them the battle.”</p>
<p>“I got it, human!”</p>
<p>Raon was someone who knew Cale’s secret. He was someone Cale could trust with anything and everything.</p>
<p>Cale looked at the others and continued speaking. His eyes had turned cold once again.</p>
<p>“Could you please explain what happened?”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii– piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii–</p>
<p>A video communication device located in the corner was giving off the emergency signal.</p>
<p>Raon jumped in shock and picked up that video communication device. This was the video communication device connected to their allies who were at the Eastern continent’s Sez Kingdom right now.</p>
<p>“Human, I’ll connect it!”</p>
<p>The video communication device was connected immediately and Ron’s frowning face appeared on the screen. He was covered in sweat as if he had been running as fast as he could.</p>
<p>– Raon-nim-</p>
<p>He called out for Raon before stopping for a moment after seeing Cale’s condition and then blinked once.</p>
<p>He then started to speak with a calmer expression on his face.</p>
<p>– Young master-nim, I have something to tell you.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to ask how Cale was doing.</p>
<p>Ron was feeling anger and sorrow at Cale’s terrible appearance, but relieved and happy that he was awake.</p>
<p>– I heard a piece of information from the Cat tribe leader.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Cale looked at Ron, who seemed to be having trouble looking calm, unlike his usual self.</p>
<p>– He said that we will all die when the temple door opens.</p>
<p>The temple door.</p>
<p>Cale’s face stiffened the same way Ron’s stiffened as he said that. He looked at the others in the room. They all realized that it was their turn and quickly started to share information they knew.</p>
<p>Cale heard about everything that happened while he was unconscious and closed his eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>“…Young master-nim.”</p>
<p>Lock flinched after looking at Cale, who seemed to be distressed, and took one step forward.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Mila forced herself to stop scowling and focused more on her Connect Together. She was almost done with the right side as well now.</p>
<p>“Human…….”</p>
<p>The moment he heard Raon’s shaking voice…</p>
<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>Cale let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>“Human, what is it?”</p>
<p>“What did you say Eruhaben-nim told you about the monster?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben had been telling Raon some information about the monster every so often as he fought.</p>
<p>Cale asked about the information Raon had just told him about.</p>
<p>“He said that the shield is extremely sturdy and that it seems stronger than most Dragons. He also said that he hasn’t discovered any special abilities yet either.”</p>
<p>“Not that.”</p>
<p>“…Not that?”</p>
<p>Raon tilted his head before clapping his paws together and shouting.</p>
<p>“Guardian……!”</p>
<p>This unranked monster, the Lion Dragon, kept talking to Eruhaben.</p>
<p>‘…Kill… Kill the strong intruder……’</p>
<p>It was as if it was a guardian that was protecting something.</p>
<p>Lock chimed in with a gasp.</p>
<p>“…The temple door.”</p>
<p>There was nobody in this office who didn’t know that monster’s true identity now.</p>
<p>Lock continued to speak as if he had organized his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Young master-nim, does that mean that this monster is the guardian protecting the temple of the sealed god? The temple doors will open if this bastard dies?”</p>
<p>“It is highly likely.”</p>
<p>He turned toward Ron who was still visible on the screen.</p>
<p>“Take care of things and slowly come back.”</p>
<p>– …Excuse me?</p>
<p>Ron seemed shocked after hearing Cale telling him to come slowly, but Cale just looked away from him.</p>
<p>“Raon.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, hmm?”</p>
<p>Raon, who was debating whether it was okay to kill this Lion Dragon monster and what they would do if they killed it and the temple doors opened, was shocked at Cale’s calm voice and looked toward him.</p>
<p>Cale had to lay still because Mila was using Connect Together on him and could only motion toward his jacket that Raon had taken off with his chin.</p>
<p>“Take out the cracked jar from my spatial pocket bag. Be careful.”</p>
<p>He then turned toward Mila.</p>
<p>“Mila-nim, you can also connect together a crack on a jar, right?”</p>
<p>“…Teacher, I’m already working very hard.”</p>
<p>Mila suddenly got chills on her back as Cale stared at her.</p>
<p>‘…What is this feeling? Why do I feel like I’m going to have to work until I can’t even stand up anymore?’</p>
<p>Mila was ready to give everything she had, but she had the chills for some reason. She just decided there was no need for that and responded.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what kind of jar it is, but do you think I won’t be able to connect together a jar when I can even connect together a person’s plate?”</p>
<p>This was a time where everybody needed to do everything they could.</p>
<p>“I will do it after I finish connecting together your plate, teacher.”</p>
<p>Cale nodded his head with gratitude at Mila’s response and looked back toward Raon.</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>Cale heard the sound of a gun, which was unfamiliar to the people of this world but very familiar to him.</p>
<p>He looked out the window again.</p>
<p>He could see the large black Bone Dragon and the three people on top of it.</p>
<p>There was a person who was channeling fire that was as bright as the sun…</p>
<p>A person swirled in a violent black aura…</p>
<p>And a person who was pointing a gun at the monster.</p>
<p>Cale started to smile. Raon was about to shout that it was Cale’s scammer smile before he smiled brightly after hearing what Cale said.</p>
<p>“Raon. Let everybody know that I’m awake.”</p>
<p>“I got it human!”</p>
<p>Raon nodded his head so vigorously that his chubby cheeks were shaking before channeling his mana.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In the middle of the fierce battle…</p>
<p>– The human is awake! He told me to let you know that he was awake!</p>
<p>Eruhaben, Alberu, Choi Han, Rosalyn, and the others… Everybody Raon contacted looked shocked but happy.</p>
<p>“…That little punk.”</p>
<p>Alberu lowered his gun for a moment. He exchanged glances with Rosalyn, Choi Han, and the Bone Dragon.</p>
<p>They were all doing their best to suppress their emotions.</p>
<p>They heard Raon’s voice again.</p>
<p>– The human said to tell you.</p>
<p>Raon’s voice was happy and bright. Raon really enjoyed these moments of delivering Cale’s messages. His excited voice reached everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>– We are starting a plan right now.</p>
<p>Raon repeated Cale’s words, word for word.</p>
<p>– There is only one goal for this plan.</p>
<p>Alberu turned toward the office.</p>
<p>Rosalyn had her fiery mana surrounding her as she closed her eyes to focus on Cale’s words that Raon was sending to her.</p>
<p>– Our goal is to get rid of the White Star and the sealed god at once.</p>
<p>Choi Han’s face no longer looked calm as the corners of his lips started to curl up slowly, as if he couldn’t decide whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>– But first, we must drag the White Star in.</p>
<p>Craaaaaaack.</p>
<p>The Gold Dragon ignored the cracks on its skin and focused on Raon’s words.</p>
<p>His gaze was still directed at the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>– The first step to do that…</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben thought it was funny that he was feeling relieved at hearing the voice of a human who was significantly younger than him as he waited for what Cale had to say next.</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>– Goldie gramps! Pretend to be dead!</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>‘…What did I just hear?’</p>
<p>Eruhaben’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“Ho.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>As Alberu, Rosalyn, and Choi Han all responded to what they had heard… They heard Raon’s bright voice again.</p>
<p>– Goldie gramps, at least pretend to faint!</p>
<p>Raon was being serious.</p>
<p>– The human told me. He said that the White Star must be nearby watching everything! Goldie gramps! Hurry! Hurry up and play dead! Hurry up and pretend to be dead! Make it look like you were hit by the Lion Dragon’s shield and fainted or something!</p>
<p>Eruhaben could not quietly listen anymore and made a single comment.</p>
<p>“…What the hell?”</p>
<p>Eruhaben, who was frowning as much as possible, started to laugh as if he couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“Ha, haha-”</p>
<p>‘They suddenly want me to pretend like I fainted or like I died?’</p>
<p>Such an unbelievable thing…</p>
<p>“…I guess that little punk really did wake up.”</p>
<p>Eruhaben could truly feel that Cale Henituse was awake.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Ahahahahaha! Goldie gramps has to act dead? I hope his acting is better than Choi Han’s!</p>
<p>What will happen next?</p>

<p>Chapter 659: I guess I do have to step in? 1</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben stopped moving for a moment because he was feeling both joy and disbelief.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon pointed its shield and sharp eagle-like talons toward Eruhaben with no visible expression on its face. The claw behind the shield looked ready to twist Eruhaben’s neck off at any moment.</p>
<p>“Ho, hoho-”</p>
<p>Eruhaben didn’t care as he laughed in disbelief.</p>
<p>‘He wants me, while fighting in my true form, to act dead?’</p>
<p>It was more unbelievable the more he thought about it.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was not the only one feeling that way.</p>
<p>“…I’m going to go crazy. Hehe.”</p>
<p>A quiet mumbling and laughter flew out of the helmet.</p>
<p>Rosalyn and Choi Han made eye contact with each other while turning to look at Alberu, who was laughing with his head down. Rosalyn brushed back her messy hair as she spoke.</p>
<p>“What should we do?”</p>
<p>Choi Han responded without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Cale-nim has his reasons for all of this.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn was thinking the same thing. The two of them looked back at Alberu after confirming that they were both feeling the same way. At that moment…</p>
<p>“Kekeke-”</p>
<p>The place where the three people were currently standing on…</p>
<p>The armored black Bone Dragon’s large body was moving up and down. An oddly joyful Dragon half-blood’s voice could be heard.</p>
<p>“Yes, it should be like this. This is the Cale Henituse I know.”</p>
<p>Nobody could say anything against that.</p>
<p>Alberu finally raised his head and looked toward the City Hall.</p>
<p>“As expected of my dongsaeng.”</p>
<p>He continued to look at where Cale should be right now as he spoke to the others.</p>
<p>“Based on how Raon-nim’s voice is extremely bright, Cale Henituse should have woken up completely.”</p>
<p>Not only was Cale completely woken up, but his mind was also moving faster than it had ever moved before.</p>
<p>‘…He truly is a fearless teacher.’</p>
<p>Mila was observing the cracks on Cale’s body fuse together but couldn’t help but look at the clearheaded Cale in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Teacher, we are going to reach the final stage of Connect Together in a little bit. It’s going to hurt a bit at that point.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you for letting me know.”</p>
<p>‘I can deal with a little bit of pain.’</p>
<p>Cale brushed Mila’s words aside. Unfortunately, Cale and Raon did not know Mila very well. If Dodori was here, he would be saying, no, he would be shouting, ‘The ‘little bit’ my mom is talking about is enough pain to pierce a hole through a mountain!’</p>
<p>Cale was thinking through things one by one without knowing what kind of pain he would experience in the final stage of Connect Together that would soon arrive.</p>
<p>‘…The White Star used his head quite a bit.’</p>
<p>Cale was thinking that the White Star was quite smart about his course of action this time.</p>
<p>If the information Ron heard from the Cat tribe leader was correct…</p>
<p>The doors to the temple of the sealed god would open once they kill this guardian.</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Eruhaben and their allies who did not know that had no choice but to kill this unranked monster that appeared in Puzzle City.</p>
<p>This Lion Dragon was a different opponent, even with everybody on their side charging against it together. Cale’s side would suffer quite a lot of damage trying to kill this monster.</p>
<p>The White Star just had to take care of the weakened enemy after Cale’s side killed the Lion Dragon and opened the temple doors for him.</p>
<p>“It’s killing two birds with one stone for the White Star.”</p>
<p>There was a reason the White Star had not appeared.</p>
<p>Cale’s forces would put all of their efforts toward taking care of the Lion Dragon only if he wasn’t there.</p>
<p>‘That’s why I’m certain he is watching from somewhere.’</p>
<p>The White Star… Was definitely around Puzzle City.</p>
<p>He would be doing something similar to Cale, who was watching the scene through the office terrace window. That bastard should be watching what was happening, waiting for the most opportune moment.</p>
<p>He would have no problem waiting as long as he needed to do so since he has already waited a long time through numerous lives.</p>
<p>‘So I need to make it impossible for him to wait.’</p>
<p>Cale needed to make the White Star anxious. He needed to make it so that the results the White Star was looking for would not appear.</p>
<p>Only then would the White Star show himself.</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Raon and motioned with his eyes.</p>
<p>Raon nodded his head, and Cale started to speak.</p>
<p>“I heard that the Lion Dragon just maintained a defensive position without attacking anybody until Eruhaben-nim appeared.”</p>
<p>Those words were delivered to their allies on the battlefield in Raon’s voice through his magic.</p>
<p>Cale’s points were delivered to Eruhaben’s mind in Raon’s voice as well.</p>
<p>– Ron Molan contacted me about the ‘temple door.’</p>
<p>The temple door.</p>
<p>Guardian.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>The sealed god.</p>
<p>All of those pieces of information were quickly delivered to Eruhaben, Choi Han, Mary, Rosalyn, Alberu… It started with them and then some others as well.</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p>Alberu scoffed while Rosalyn’s eyes clouded over.</p>
<p>“So we are going to make him tag in instead?”</p>
<p>Some of them heard Cale’s message once again.</p>
<p>– That is why we are going to pretend as if we have lost to the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>– It is highly likely that the Lion Dragon will stop attacking as soon as Eruhaben-nim pretends to be dead. It is possible that it could attack again, but we can proceed with a different plan at that point.</p>
<p>– But if the Lion Dragon stops attacking after Eruhaben-nim is defeated as we expect…</p>
<p>Alberu opened his mouth at that moment.</p>
<p>He heard Raon’s voice at the same time.</p>
<p>“It’ll be an endless stalemate.”</p>
<p>– It should turn into a stalemate.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon would focus on defense, as it had done earlier.</p>
<p>The Roan Kingdom’s forces would not be able to easily attack because the ancient Dragon had fallen.</p>
<p>It would be an extremely tense situation that could go on for days without ending.</p>
<p>– The bastard who would be the most anxious about that stalemate is…</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked toward the Lion Dragon that was observing him and started to speak.</p>
<p>“The White Star.”</p>
<p>– That damn White Star bastard.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood started to speak.</p>
<p>“The antsiest bastard will step up.”</p>
<p>That was exactly what Cale was thinking.</p>
<p>– We need to make it so that that damn White Star bastard fights against the Lion Dragon.</p>
<p>Everybody’s eyes clouded over as they heard Raon’s voice.</p>
<p>They were able to imagine the rest at this point.</p>
<p>Alberu raised his gun again.</p>
<p>“While we look to be in despair after ‘losing’ to the Lion Dragon, we will make the White Star, who needs to quickly open the temple, fight the difficult battle against the Lion Dragon.”</p>
<p>He then started to smile.</p>
<p>Once both the Lion Dragon… and the White Star…</p>
<p>Once they are both tired and weary…</p>
<p>– In that final moment… We just need to take everything away from them.</p>
<p>The Lion Dragon’s life… The White Star’s life…</p>
<p>And even the sealed god’s existence.</p>
<p>They were hearing Raon’s voice, but it oddly felt as if they were hearing Cale’s relaxed and nonchalant voice.</p>
<p>“How entertaining.”</p>
<p>The moment Alberu said those words…</p>
<p>Swiiiiiish— Swiiiiiiiish—-!</p>
<p>A strong gust of wind started to roar around them.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Even Archie, who was watching from the ground, had to cover his eyes with his arm and step back as he was suppressed by the strength of the wind.</p>
<p>“…T, that is?!”</p>
<p>The golden dust that had covered the sky over Puzzle City as if it was the Milky Way started to gather in one spot.</p>
<p>There was a large golden whirlwind with Eruhaben at the center.</p>
<p>Archie walked over to Witira. (TL: Author likes to use descriptors like ancient Dragon Eruhaben, and this sentence was ‘Whale Archie walked over to Future Whale Queen Witira,’ but I’m just going to drop those filler words. Good? Good. K thx 🙂 )</p>
<p>“It looks as if Eruhaben-nim is preparing a big attack. This looks like it is going to be no joke.”</p>
<p>Witira just nodded her head with a stiff expression on her face.</p>
<p>‘Sorry.’</p>
<p>She apologized to Archie internally, as she knew that he had not heard Cale’s message from Raon and was being honestly surprised at Eruhaben’s actions.</p>
<p>‘Raon-nim must have forgotten about Archie.’</p>
<p>Witira looked away from Archie, who looked quite innocent as his eyes were sparkling with anticipation about the ancient Dragon’s attack.</p>
<p>But Archie was not the only one with such feelings of anticipation.</p>
<p>“…Ah! Finally!”</p>
<p>Outside of Puzzle City’s walls…</p>
<p>The soldiers and knights waiting there could feel their hearts beating wildly.</p>
<p>Swooooooosh-!</p>
<p>The golden dust whirlwind swirled together, making extremely fierce noises that could not be compared to any noise it had made until now.</p>
<p>The Ancient Dragon at the center of the whirlwind had his wings spread wide as he observed the monster.</p>
<p>Anybody could tell that the Dragon was about to attack with everything it had.</p>
<p>“I think that the aftershock of the attack will be intense! Captain-nim, should we make the soldiers retreat farther back?”</p>
<p>“The city walls are sturdy! Don’t retreat! Move the shield bearers to the front!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>Everybody started to move quickly to prepare for this strong attack.</p>
<p>“Please! Dragon-nim, please get rid of that monster!”</p>
<p>“Look at that whirlwind! It looks like he’ll do it this time!”</p>
<p>The soldiers could not hide their anticipations.</p>
<p>“…My goodness, I can’t believe the mana is so dense.”</p>
<p>“The level of cohesion is quite amazing!”</p>
<p>The mages at the Puzzle City plaza who had followed Rosalyn over could not even gulp as they had chills all over their bodies from the intensity of the Dragon’s mana.</p>
<p>“It’s his final attack.”</p>
<p>One of the mages commented, and nobody could object.</p>
<p>That was the thought on everyone’s minds.</p>
<p>‘The attack to finish this battle or at least to have some kind of positive results is about to start.’</p>
<p>“…Intruder…kill……”</p>
<p>As for the Lion Dragon that was feeling this strong power from the closest point… The monster raised its shield with one hand while pointing its sharp eagle-like claws toward Eruhaben with its other hand.</p>
<p>The gold-eyed Dragon responded to it.</p>
<p>“Like hell you can kill me.”</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon then charged toward the Lion Dragon with the golden whirlwind around him.</p>
<p>Choi Han started to speak.</p>
<p>“Should we help?”</p>
<p>Alberu shook his head at Choi Han’s question.</p>
<p>“No. Not you.”</p>
<p>“He’s right. You should stay out of it.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn stopped Choi Han as well. Choi Han had stepped backward with a stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Your highness, should we at least pretend?”</p>
<p>“Sounds good.”</p>
<p>Alberu, Rosalyn, and the Dragon half-blood rushed forward.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was in front of the Lion Dragon. The Dragon half-blood was behind it.</p>
<p>Eruhaben and the Dragon half-blood… As the two slightly different shades of golden eyes made eye contact… Eruhaben caused a large explosion that shook the entire area.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh! “Shields, raise your shields!”</p>
<p>“Shit, hurry up and cast a shield!”</p>
<p>It looked as if a piece of the sun was exploding in the sky above Puzzle City.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang- baaaaang–! Baaaaang!</p>
<p>The explosions seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>The wind, dust, and loud explosion made it difficult for anybody to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>“This is the Dragon’s true powers……?!”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! This is fucking crazy!”</p>
<p>There was not much they could say. It was difficult to watch the clash between these two behemoths, as it made it seem as if the battle until now had been a warm-up.</p>
<p>Archie started to frown.</p>
<p>“…Fuck! I can’t see anything!”</p>
<p>There was a bright light when the golden dust exploded that nobody could see the Lion Dragon and Eruhaben’s battle properly.</p>
<p>Baaaaang! Baaaaang—!</p>
<p>They could only tell that the fight was still going on because the golden dust continued to explode without stopping.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>The golden dust surrounding the ancient Dragon and the monster suddenly split.</p>
<p>The whirlwind ripped as if it had been sliced open by a sword.</p>
<p>What came piercing through the whirlwind was a large white shield.</p>
<p>The shield shined so brightly and looked as if it would never break.</p>
<p>“N, nooooo!”</p>
<p>“No way!”</p>
<p>The soldiers covered their mouths in shock.</p>
<p>The knights and mages could not even breathe properly.</p>
<p>They each had bad feelings about this.</p>
<p>The shield slowly started to break apart the whirlwind.</p>
<p>They could see a bit of the Lion Dragon’s face now. There were still no changes at all to its expression, and people felt fear and got chills all over their bodies while looking at the stoic expression on the monster’s face.</p>
<p>Tang-!</p>
<p>They heard something head toward the shield at that moment.</p>
<p>The black Bone Dragon along with the crown prince, Rosalyn, and Choi Han on its back charged through the opening in the whirlwind caused by the Lion Dragon to attack it.</p>
<p>It was dangerous to charge into a battle between two such strong individuals.</p>
<p>“Ah, your highness!”</p>
<p>“Tower Master-nim–!”</p>
<p>The others clenched their fists as they watched more people looking like they were giving everything they had to attack the Lion Dragon as the ancient Dragon had done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the shield did not break.</p>
<p>Tang, tang!</p>
<p>All of the bullets were blocked by the shield.</p>
<p>Crackle–!</p>
<p>The burning petals of flame could not scorch the shield even a little bit.</p>
<p>The swordsman who had continued to attack with the black Yong earlier in the battle was a step behind them, kneeling with his head down.</p>
<p>“Ugggh!”</p>
<p>The black Bone Dragon was sent flying as its armor crashed into the shield.</p>
<p>An ominous feeling swept through the allies when they saw that happen.</p>
<p>Their worst fears turned into reality.</p>
<p>The monster grabbed the shield with both hands and swung it towards the front.</p>
<p>Baaaaaang—–!</p>
<p>The golden gust of wind was suppressed by the shield and ripped into pieces.</p>
<p>The monster used its eight Dragon wings to charge forward through the exploding golden light.</p>
<p>And finally…</p>
<p>“N, no—-!”</p>
<p>The monster saw a heavily breathing Dragon at the end of the whirlwind as someone screamed in despair.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff.”</p>
<p>The Dragon was breathing heavily, as if it had poured out every ounce of mana it had.</p>
<p>Crack. Crackle.</p>
<p>Mana could not gather properly around the Dragon. There was only one thing such a great and mighty existence could do when it no longer had the strength to even gather mana.</p>
<p>As the remaining bits of the golden whirlwind crashed into the shield…</p>
<p>This great and mighty existence… The Dragon crashed into the Lion Dragon along with the golden light.</p>
<p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p>
<p>Golden light exploded once more and dyed everyone’s sight white once again.</p>
<p>As that instant of whiteness disappeared and they could see…</p>
<p>They could see the white monster standing firmly in the sky like a knight, and then they looked down.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>The great and mighty existence was falling down.</p>
<p>The monster was in the sky.</p>
<p>The Dragon was crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>The Dragon’s eyes were closed, its wings were limp, and nobody could say anything as they watched this majestic Dragon fall.</p>
<p>They were shocked and astonished.</p>
<p>As those two emotions swept over Puzzle City…</p>
<p>Boom-!</p>
<p>The Dragon plummeted to the ground.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Once the falling Dragon slammed down…</p>
<p>A man whose face and body were covered by a robe reached his hand out to touch the mask on his face that covered everything above his nose.</p>
<p>“I guess an ancient Dragon who is close to death was not strong enough?”</p>
<p>There was a video recording device in his hand.</p>
<p>He watched a person bleeding out from what seemed to be his entire body as he ran toward the altar.</p>
<p>The video of Cale Henituse was playing on the recording device on repeat.</p>
<p>This man was naturally the White Star.</p>
<p>He quietly observed the video recording device he received from Bear King Sayeru as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“…There is no way Cale Henituse would be able to fight in such a condition, so we can consider him out of action for now.”</p>
<p>He then turned toward where the Dragon had fallen.</p>
<p>“The somewhat reliable ancient Dragon looks like that.”</p>
<p>The White Star raised his head. The monster in the sky just stood there without attacking.</p>
<p>“…I guess I should just keep watching for now.”</p>
<p>The White Star slowly stepped back and hid himself.</p>
<p>While he was doing that… Someone else, Cale to be specific, gasped while watching the plummeting ancient Dragon.</p>
<p>“Wow. I guess some acting skills do come with age!”</p>
<p>Clap, clap, clap.</p>
<p>Raon clapped next to him.</p>
<p>“You truly are amazing Goldie gramps!”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Translator’s Comments</p>
<p>Acting skill comes with age? Does that mean Choi Han will eventually be able to act as well? He’s already old!</p>

<p>Chapter 660: I guess I do have to step in? 2</p>
<p>Raon was clapping while Mila was calmly focusing on her task at hand. Cale was lying on the bed, looking toward the window and snickering.</p>
<p>Lock just blankly looked out the terrace window.</p>
<p>“H, he’s acting, right? It’s fake?”</p>
<p>His voice was shaking.</p>
<p>The fallen Eruhaben…. The sight was too shocking to call it an act.</p>
<p>‘My heart is beating wildly even though I know it’s fake.’</p>
<p>Lock tightly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>“Lock, don’t worry! Gramps wasn’t hurt by the Lion Dragon’s attack!”</p>
<p>Cale looked at Ron with an odd gaze for a moment.</p>
<p>‘…He shouldn’t be able to see anything because it’s so far away. How is he so sure Eruhaben-nim wasn’t hit?’</p>
<p>Cale questioned Raon’s response, but Raon just smiled brightly, as if he didn’t question anything at all.</p>
<p>Lock couldn’t help but smile after seeing Raon’s bright smile.</p>
<p>“Lock, you start moving according to the plan as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, young master-nim!”</p>
<p>Lock watched Cale, who was reaching the final stages of Connect Together, as he responded vigorously.</p>
<p>“I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, sir, I understand.”</p>
<p>Lock barely managed to lift his feet and left the office after hearing Cale say that he was okay.</p>
<p>Cale watched Lock leave for a bit before looking back out the window.</p>
<p>The fallen Dragon’s large body…</p>
<p>A portion of a building was unfortunately destroyed because of the Dragon’s fall. Dust and smoke rose up like clouds because of the aftershock.</p>
<p>This sight brought shock to everybody except the few who knew the truth.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Some of the mages plopped down on the ground.</p>
<p>The shield they had cast to block the aftershock of the Dragon and monster’s fight was long gone, and all that the mages could see was the fallen Dragon…an existence that was said to be the king of magic.</p>
<p>“I, I can’t believe that he…so futilely-”</p>
<p>Although the battle had been fierce and intense, it oddly felt as if it had all been futile.</p>
<p>The reason behind it was simple.</p>
<p>“…It really is a monster.”</p>
<p>The Dragon had fallen, but the monster was fine.</p>
<p>The monster was quietly observing the fallen Dragon without a single scratch on its shield.</p>
<p>The Dragon had not managed to harm the enemy even a little.</p>
<p>That fact was making the others feel as if it had been futile.</p>
<p>“…Something that even a Dragon couldn’t do-”</p>
<p>‘We have to do it now?’</p>
<p>The mages could not get themselves to say that part.</p>
<p>But there were others who were feeling even more scared than they were feeling.</p>
<p>“W, what just happened? Did the Dragon really fall to the ground?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know! I can’t see anything!”</p>
<p>They were the soldiers waiting outside the city walls.</p>
<p>The soldiers definitely saw the Dragon falling down. But they could not accept what had just happened.</p>
<p>They heard the noise of the Dragon crashing to the ground, but they could not accept it since the tall city walls prevented them from seeing what had happened.</p>
<p>The number of people quietly whispering slowly increased, getting louder and amplifying their anxiety as well.</p>
<p>“Quiet-!”</p>
<p>The soldiers flinched and shut up after one of the knights shouted.</p>
<p>The knight would usually scold the soldiers more for their actions, but he too was swept up with fear and astonishment that he couldn’t scold the anxious soldiers.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain stepped forward at that moment.</p>
<p>“All of you stay in position! Do not lose focus!”</p>
<p>There was a video communication device in his hand.</p>
<p>Although he was shouting sternly, his back that was covered by his armor was full of sweat.</p>
<p>‘…Your highness.’</p>
<p>He recalled the short conversation he just had with Alberu and continued to shout.</p>
<p>“As long as we do not attack first! That monster will not attack us!”</p>
<p>The soldiers looked up at the monster in the sky.</p>
<p>This monster really was just quietly observing the ancient Dragon.</p>
<p>“So, do not be afraid!”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain started to walk as soon as he shouted toward the soldiers. The lower-grade knights followed right behind him.</p>
<p>They whispered to him.</p>
<p>“Captain-nim, then what should we-?”</p>
<p>“Are we just waiting?”</p>
<p>The Knight Captain nodded his head with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>“First of all, we have no plans on attacking first. The decision has been made that we need to first figure out the monster’s weakness and get a better grasp of the current situation. His highness as ordered us to wait.”</p>
<p>He then gave the knights an order.</p>
<p>“So make sure that the soldiers are not overwhelmed by fear.”</p>
<p>“…We are just going to stay in place for now, sir?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. His highness’s order is to wait and buy us some time in a stalemate. Inform the soldiers about the situation as well.”</p>
<p>The knights responded with a salute and called their subordinate knights and the ones leading the soldiers.</p>
<p>The message that they were stalling for time started to be distributed.</p>
<p>It made people scared but also relieved that they were not fighting right now.</p>
<p>The fallen Dragon… The struggling heroes…</p>
<p>And finally, the absence of their Commander, who was like a symbol of victory.</p>
<p>The soldiers were feeling relieved that they were not fighting right away.</p>
<p>The Knight Captain looked around at them and thought about Alberu Crossman.</p>
<p>‘Your highness. I have delivered the message to the soldiers as you have ordered.’</p>
<p>Buy some time.</p>
<p>The order was to let as many people know that as possible. The Knight Captain looked back toward the city after dutifully completing the crown prince’s orders.</p>
<p>The black Bone Dragon was urgently descending.</p>
<p>It was headed toward where the Dragon had fallen.</p>
<p>“How do we heal it?”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we go over and take a look first?”</p>
<p>Inside Puzzle City… The people immediately headed over toward the fallen Dragon once they snapped out of shock.</p>
<p>The Dragon seemed to be their ally, so they should check on its condition. The mages who had both respect and wariness for the Dragon started to move to be as close to the Dragon as possible.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>They raised their heads after hearing a shout above them.</p>
<p>Crown prince Alberu Crossman kicked off the black Bone Dragon’s armor and descended to the ground.</p>
<p>Boom-!</p>
<p>There was a small rumbling once he landed on the ground.</p>
<p>Alberu seemed to be urgently running to the Dragon.</p>
<p>“All of you move back as his highness ordered!”</p>
<p>Rosalyn followed behind him.</p>
<p>“We don’t know what kind of changes there will be to the mana around a Dragon that is in danger! Do not approach unless we say so!”</p>
<p>The mages flinched and stopped trying to follow her.</p>
<p>What Rosalyn said seemed reasonable enough.</p>
<p>Even if they wanted to get closer because of their curiosity, they could not go against Alberu, the magically talented crown prince who had the highest position here, nor against Rosalyn, who had pretty much been solidified as the Tower Master.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there was a big reason they did not dare to get closer.</p>
<p>They could see the Dragon’s extremely faint breathing once they had gotten a bit closer.</p>
<p>“…What a mess.”</p>
<p>The mages said that toward the Dragon, a creature whose level of magic they would never be able to reach.</p>
<p>The Dragon scales that were said to be one of the strongest things in the world had so many cracks in them.</p>
<p>They looked like the cracks on a land dried out by drought. The crack started from the Dragon’s claw and spread throughout its upper body and a portion of its wings.</p>
<p>Its radiant golden hide seemed darker and gloomier as well.</p>
<p>“…Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>Rosalyn subconsciously stopped walking after seeing Eruhaben’s condition.</p>
<p>She could finally see Eruhaben-nim’s current condition that she had not been able to see because of the Lion Dragon and the golden dust.</p>
<p>She was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>She knew that Eruhaben’s fall had been an act.</p>
<p>But seeing Eruhaben’s condition let her know that if Eruhaben had fought some more, that fall could have ended up becoming real.</p>
<p>She got a headache.</p>
<p>She had thought that someone might die in this war.</p>
<p>She even prepared herself, thinking that she might die as well.</p>
<p>But she felt suffocated thinking that someone who was pretty much, no, was her master, might have died.</p>
<p>“Eruhaben-nim.”</p>
<p>She heard Alberu’s voice at that moment.</p>
<p>Alberu had taken his helmet off and revealed his blonde hair and blue eyes as he walked up to Eruhaben.</p>
<p>He had a very stiff expression on his face.</p>
<p>‘I was wondering how to keep up the act and play along since the White Star would be watching.’</p>
<p>He thought it was quite laughable that he had debated about how to react to Eruhaben’s dead act.</p>
<p>‘He really was prepared to die.’</p>
<p>Eruhaben looked like hell right now.</p>
<p>Alberu finally realized that this heavy breathing was not completely fake.</p>
<p>Shhhhh.</p>
<p>His hand touched Eruhaben’s cracking hide.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Eruhaben-nim?”</p>
<p>Alberu’s low voice cracked a bit. It sounded so bad that the others who were watching couldn’t help but gulp.</p>
<p>“Huff. Huff.”</p>
<p>The ancient Dragon could not respond.</p>
<p>Even though they all knew that Dragons were majestic creatures, they couldn’t help but look at the heavily breathing Dragon with cracks on its hide with pity.</p>
<p>– Crown prince.</p>
<p>But the moment Alberu heard Eruhaben’s calm voice in his mind…</p>
<p>– Do I just stay here like this?</p>
<p>The Dragon peeked open one of its eyes and stealthily looked around.</p>
<p>– Apparently, there is nothing I can’t do.</p>
<p>As Eruhaben was praising his acting skills…</p>
<p>“Haaaaaaaa.”</p>
<p>Alberu’s gaze changed.</p>
<p>– …Why are you looking at me the way you usually look at Cale?</p>
<p>Eruhaben, who had only opened his eyes enough to see Alberu who was right in front of him, was almost at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Alberu didn’t care and put his hand on Eruhaben’s forehead. He then mumbled in a sad voice.</p>
<p>“…He’s completely out of it. He does seem to be conscious, but he keeps speaking nonsense.”</p>
<p>– What?</p>
<p>“Shit! Eruhaben-nim, you cannot die! Please stay awake!”</p>
<p>– …Ho.</p>
<p>Eruhaben got the chills after hearing Alberu’s desperate voice.</p>
<p>‘What chilling acting skills.’</p>
<p>Alberu would make most theatre actors look bad.</p>
<p>But this was to be expected. Alberu was someone who had protected his position without the help of his mother’s family while hiding the fact that he was quarter Dark Elf. He would not be alive if he was not a skilled actor.</p>
<p>Eruhaben was being amazed internally when he heard Alberu whisper extremely quietly.</p>
<p>“Please, just stay here and pretend you are unconscious.”</p>
<p>– Got it.</p>
<p>Alberu then raised his voice.</p>
<p>“His breathing! Eruhaben-nim’s breathing is getting even weaker!”</p>
<p>Eruhaben just laid there without doing anything. Alberu took care of everything.</p>
<p>“Your highness! May I take a look?”</p>
<p>Rosalyn snapped out of her thoughts and moved to help Rosalyn.</p>
<p>Alberu left Eruhaben in Rosalyn’s care and turned around. He then gave an order to the first mage he made eye contact with.</p>
<p>“Contact a nearby temple right away!”</p>
<p>He was probably urgently looking for a temple in order to heal the Dragon. Multiple mages immediately took out video communication devices and started casting the spell.</p>
<p>But Alberu shook his head and started talking to himself as if it was not enough.</p>
<p>“This is not enough. The Saint, I need to contact the Saint-nim.”</p>
<p>Saint Jack. Some people around him nodded their heads after Alberu mentioned Jack.</p>
<p>Healing a Dragon… Maybe the Saint would be able to do that.</p>
<p>“I should personally go there.”</p>
<p>Alberu noticed Lock approaching him at that moment.</p>
<p>“Your highness.”</p>
<p>Lock bowed and respectfully greeted Alberu. Alberu quickly put his hand on Lock’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I hope that the Tiger tribe and the Wolf tribe can stand guard around the Dragon-nim.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your highness! We will protect him so that nobody can approach him!”</p>
<p>Lock looked toward a Wolf elder who nodded his head and the Wolves started to surround Eruhaben.</p>
<p>“I leave it to you.”</p>
<p>Alberu quietly whispered as he walked past Lock, and Lock whispered back.</p>
<p>“Please don’t worry. We will make it so that nobody can get close and find out Eruhaben’s condition.”</p>
<p>Lock hesitated for a moment before adding on.</p>
<p>“…The Young master-nim…”</p>
<p>Alberu turned toward Lock.</p>
<p>“The young master-nim, no, never mind, your highness. Please, just go take a look.”</p>
<p>Lock did not say anything else. Alberu didn’t ask anything else and just looked over Lock’s shoulder to the ancient Dragon who had his eyes closed.</p>
<p>– Don’t worry about me. I have some time to rest now.</p>
<p>Alberu did not feel any relief after hearing the ancient Dragon’s words.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, your highness. We can save him.”</p>
<p>A corner of his mouth went up after hearing Lock’s voice that was full of confidence.</p>
<p>It was because he knew where Lock’s confidence was coming from.</p>
<p>Alberu stopped looking at Eruhaben and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The black Bone Dragon… The Dragon half-blood and Choi Han were up in the air.</p>
<p>Choi Han wanted to come down as well, but someone needed to look as if they were staying guarded against the Lion Dragon. For the White Star and for their allies…</p>
<p>Choi Han nodded his head at Alberu that it was okay to hurry up and go. Mary was on one of her flying skeleton monsters as she moved toward the black Bone Dragon.</p>
<p>The Dragon half-blood, Mary, and Choi Han.</p>
<p>The three of them should be able to prepare for any urgent situations that may arise.</p>
<p>“I should hurry.”</p>
<p>He headed toward the City Hall as if he was rushing to contact Saint Jack.</p>
<p>He was planning on chatting with Cale about their plans.</p>
<p>“Your highness-”</p>
<p>Someone stopped him as he moved.</p>
<p>“…Duke.”</p>
<p>It was Duke Deruth.</p>
<p>His face had an unknown sense of nervousness. Alberu looked at him with pity, however…</p>
<p>“I hope you can wait here.”</p>
<p>He could not have Deruth come with him.</p>
<p>The cintamani… That orb that was connected to Earth was with Cale. Furthermore, Cale’s body was in a mess.</p>
<p>He could not take Duke Deruth who had come all the way here for his son.</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to see him soon.”</p>
<p>He could only console him with such words.</p>
<p>Duke Deruth nodded his head. The nervousness disappeared and an indomitable will seemed to fill his gaze.</p>
<p>“I will be waiting, your highness.”</p>
<p>Alberu nodded his head to thank Deruth before heading for the office.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Cale looked toward Mila.</p>
<p>“Teacher, it’s the last part now.”</p>
<p>The cracks all over Cale’s body were all mended with beige mana.</p>
<p>“Auntie! Does that mean that the human will be all better?”</p>
<p>“Only his plate will be fused together so he still should take it easy.”</p>
<p>“Auntie, you’re amazing!”</p>
<p>Raon’s chubby cheeks twitched as if he was happy. Raon looked toward Cale.</p>
<p>“Human! What are you going to do once this is done?”</p>
<p>Raon was curious about the next part of the plan.</p>
<p>Cale nonchalantly responded as he looked at two orbs.</p>
<p>“Time to go home.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Home?”</p>
<p>Both Raon and Mila looked confused, but Cale had somewhere he needed to go during this stalemate.</p>
<p>‘Cale Henituse’s mother’s grave.’</p>
<p>He needed to go there. He had a feeling that a hint would be waiting for him there.</p>
<p>He organized his thoughts and looked at the two orbs… The cintamani and the video communication device as he started to speak.</p>
<p>“Are you not turning it off?”</p>
<p>Ron responded with a benign smile.</p>
<p>– Yes, young master-nim. I am not turning it off.</p>
<p>Lee Soo Hyuk, Kim Rok Soo, and Choi Jung Soo were sitting in a row with Park Jin Tae peeking from behind them as Lee Soo Hyuk responded for the group through the cintamani.</p>
<p>– I don’t know how to turn it off.</p>
<p>Both of their voices were gentle, but their gazes were quite vicious.</p>
<p>Cale felt iffy, but he didn’t have the time to talk about it. He then turned toward Mila.</p>
<p>“Teacher, it’s going to sting a bit.”</p>
<p>“Please go ahead.”</p>
<p>Mila smiled gently as if telling him not to worry before she took a step away from Cale.</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>Beige-colored mana swirled around her.</p>
<p>Raon left the two orbs and stepped back as Cale closed his eyes. Mila peeked at Raon before standing right in front of him to make it unable for him to see.</p>
<p>Raon was about to say he wanted to see as well but shut up after feeling the mana swirling in the office.</p>
<p>“Raon. Stay still. This is an important moment.”</p>
<p>How would he dare to move during an important moment? He could not interrupt Cale’s healing because of his curiosity. Raon curled his body up and remained as still as possible. He wanted to make sure that his actions would not impact Mila’s mana. He wanted to make sure he would not get in her way at all.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Cale had a small smile on his face as he laid there with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>A warm and gentle aura started to spread through his body. He could tell where it started from.</p>
<p>The cracks all over his body… This aura had started from the beige-colored mana that had filled those cracks.</p>
<p>Like the morning sunlight or the bright sun in the middle of a winter day… Cale felt relaxed as he felt this warm aura fill his body.</p>
<p>– Finally!</p>
<p>– Cale, your plate will be connected soon!</p>
<p>– What an amazing Dragon!</p>
<p>The ancient powers could not hide their joy.</p>
<p>Cale was happy as well.</p>
<p>Slam-!</p>
<p>The door opened at that moment.</p>
<p>“Mm!”</p>
<p>Alberu had rushed over as quickly as possible. He hesitated and didn’t know whether to go in or not after seeing the beige mana that filled the room.</p>
<p>He then saw Cale’s current condition.</p>
<p>Beige-colored mana was covering Cale’s body as if they were spider webs. The peacefully smiling Cale opened his eyes as Alberu started frowning.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>
<p>Cale’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“……!!!”</p>
<p>He tried to take a breath.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>That warm ray of sunlight suddenly changed.</p>
<p>The warm beige-colored mana that had filled the gaps in those cracks suddenly turned into sharp daggers and stabbed him all over.</p>
<p>His entire body was starting to burn up, and he felt intense pain.</p>
<p>A pain that was even incomparable to the pain he felt when he used his ‘Instant’ ability filled his entire body.</p>
<p>“…Uhh, ugh-!”</p>
<p>Cale could not speak.</p>
<p>He had never felt this kind of pain before. This pain was impossible to describe with words.</p>
<p>His limbs were shaking while his forehead and entire body were being covered with sweat.</p>
<p>Oooooo– oooooo–</p>
<p>Mila’s mana that was covering the office was making rumbling noises.</p>
<p>Cale was at the center with his face completely pale as he struggled to handle the pain.</p>
<p>The three people inside the cintamani, Ron, and Mercenary King Bud who were watching as representatives through the video communication device…</p>
<p>Alberu, who was frozen like a statue outside the door…</p>
<p>An even Raon, who noticed the serious situation but could only look around since he was covered by Mila and couldn’t see Cale…</p>
<p>None of them could say anything.</p>
<p>Slowly… The beige-colored mana slowly seeped into Cale’s body, healing the cracks and injuries in the process.</p>
<p>Cale’s body was healing, but Cale was in so much pain that he could not make any noises.</p>
<p>Unlike Raon who could not see, the adults could not say anything because of what they saw.</p>
