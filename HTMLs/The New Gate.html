<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>The scene was a lavishly decorated room. In this exaggeratedly luxurious chamber, two young men could be seen.</p>
<p>One sat on an ornate chair, a glass of wine in hand. His intricately decorated clothing suggested that he was a member of monarchy or nobility, and on his hand was a ring with a large ruby sparkling.</p>
<p>A longsword with a gemstone-studded scabbard was propped against the man’s chair. An expert would have noticed that it was the unupgraded version of the Ancient-grade weapon 『Excalibur』.</p>
<p>The man’s name within the game was Aldo.</p>
<p>“So, where’s that guy fighting now?”</p>
<p>“It appears that as of yesterday, part of the Houzand continent has been liberated. At present, roughly 40% of the continent has been liberated.”</p>
<p>The other man answered, while kneeling before the first. Based on his dark green hooded mantle and easy-to-move-in boots, his job appeared to be a hunter rather than a magician.</p>
<p>His name within the game was Robin Hood.</p>
<p>“Tch, his clearing speed really dropped this past month. What’s he wasting time for? He’s supposed to be a maniac whose only talent is playing games!!”</p>
<p>Aldo shouted while pounding his fists on the chair. His brownish blonde hair became slightly disheveled.</p>
<p>“Considering the increase in difficulty, I would not consider it to be strange that his clearing speed decreased, sir.”</p>
<p>“Player skill means being able to do something about that, right!? Hmph, even with all the money and time they waste, this is all they can do, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Aldo clearly looked down on players. The reason was that he was not a “pure” player himself.</p>
<p>The avatar Aldo used had been created and provided by the management. It used data from an event monster, Arthur Pendragon.</p>
<p>Its stats were 800 on average, and its equipment -while of basic rank- was all Ancient-grade.</p>
<p> It was something completely excessive for a THE NEW GATE beginner.</p>
<p>(The last dungeon too was usually conquered only in parties… he really has no idea how incredible it is to clear it solo.)</p>
<p>Robin mumbled to himself. Having played normally, he fully understood how incredible Shin’s feat of clearing the dungeon on his own was.</p>
<p>Unlike Aldo’s avatar, Robin’s avatar was an ordinary one. He had focused his stat points on AGI and DEX and specialized in reconnaissance. His fighting style was mainly attacking from a distance with his bow and poison.</p>
<p>Even so, while he could sneak into dungeons, he did not think of challenging bosses. He had no chance of winning.</p>
<p>“Hey, Hagiwara!! Are you listening??”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, my apologies. I am. However, even if we wanted him to hurry up, it would be all for naught if he ends up dying.”</p>
<p>Robin gave a serious answer, keeping his annoyance at being called with his real name to himself. Aldo insisted that they should just push him harder, but anyone would understand that such a method would not increase the dungeon clearing speed.</p>
<p>Aldo and Robin’s relationship, simply put, was that of superior and subordinate in a company.</p>
<p>Aldo was the son of a patron of THE NEW GATE, who provided the game’s management with capital. Thus, Robin was once again forced to listen to Aldo boast about the avatar that the management had prepared for him.</p>
<p>Aldo had overheard Robin talk to other players about the game in the company and coerced him into becoming his attendant.</p>
<p>Robin never regretted his carelessness more than that time. How liberating would it be if it was only the death game trapping him. His stress level was high enough to make him think such ridiculous thoughts.</p>
<p>“Hmph. Bring him here then. If he’s a gamer, I’m sure dangling some kind of clearing reward in front of his eyes will make him work harder.”</p>
<p>“Would it not be easier for us to just let him proceed as he wants?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting sick of waiting. I want to return to the real world. Do you know how many months have passed since this situation started!? I can’t even enjoy a woman with this body. The alcohol just gets you halfway drunk, and the cigarettes are terrible too. Who could put up with this crap!!”</p>
<p>Aldo became irritated while talking, and pounded on his chair again.</p>
<p>Robin gritted his teeth, barely managing to avoid shouting,<i>“You go and clear dungeons too then!!”</i> to the man on the throne, and let out a small sigh without Aldo noticing.</p>
<p>“I will try to talk to him, but please remember that I can’t do anything if he refuses.”</p>
<p>“Do SOMETHING! Or you’re getting demoted! No, fired!!”</p>
<p>“U-understood, I will go convince him!!”</p>
<p>Robin left the room, cursing and lamenting his relationship with Aldo under his breath.</p>
<p>He wanted nothing more than to tell Aldo to go do it himself, but he could not afford to go against him now. In the real world, Aldo was a high-ranked executive whose word had great importance within HR, while Robin was nothing but a rank-and-file employee.</p>
<p>Surviving in this world was important, but so was keeping his career in the real one.</p>
<p>He had a family to sustain; for their sake, Robin had no choice but to swallow his pride.</p>
<p>“But there’s nothing I can do about this…”</p>
<p>Robin had heard much about Shin, who stood on the frontlines of dungeon clearing.</p>
<p>In the first month after the Death Game began, it was even possible to visit Tsuki no Hokora, but now, it had changed locations and no one knew where it was. The only options were to find him in a city and talk to him, or to ask an information broker.</p>
<p>“I want to see Rie and Emi…”</p>
<p>Whispering the names of his wife and daughter, Robin’s silhouette was lost within the town’s crowds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Aldo was now alone in the room, still indignant.</p>
<p>He gripped his wine glass with a bit more strength, and shattered it. Thanks to the room’s self-cleaning function, the spilled wine and glass fragments sparkled and disappeared.</p>
<p>“Shit!! And after I managed to use my connections to play easily!! What the hell’s this death game!!”</p>
<p>Aldo still didn’t regard the game world as reality. Despite his high level stats and equipment, he had left dungeon clearing and boss fighting to others, so he had no idea that fighting on the frontlines meant to stake one’s life.</p>
<p>He had only ever fought low-level monsters, such as slimes and goblins. Because of the stats difference, even if he received an attack, the damage would be zero, while the damage he inflicted was completely overkill.</p>
<p>Such one-sided beatings would have never made him think that the risk of death was very real.</p>
<p>“Okay then, what to do until he comes back… hm?”</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a bell signaled the arrival of guests. The maid he had created as a support character had already gone to greet them.</p>
<p>Aldo’s menu displayed two individuals.</p>
<p>One was a savage-looking man in dark brown armor. The armor and its decorations were riddled with cuts and damage that increased his wild appearance even more. His hair and beard were unkempt. He looked just like the boss of a band of thieves or mercenaries.</p>
<p>The other was a handsome-looking man in silver armor. With blonde hair tied behind his head, and with features normally only seen on TV or in magazines, he has the appearance of a knight, completely contrasting with his companion.</p>
<p>Looking at their strangely realistic faces, Aldo thought that they might have used the full scan avatar feature, which replicated the players’ real appearances.</p>
<p>No matter how one looked in real life, however, they wouldn’t stand out much in the game world. Handsome or beautiful characters were a dime a dozen, to the point that some players even deliberately twisted their looks.</p>
<p>The menu screen displayed names, levels, and jobs of the two men.</p>
<p>“Gargalla and Vlad? Never heard of them before. Both level 255. Jobs are Magic Swordsman and Dragon Knight, huh? They seem to have pretty good gear, I guess they’re game maniacs too.”</p>
<p>Players could pay real money to obtain equipment, but such gear came with the penalty of never matching the players’ level and stats.</p>
<p>Aldo’s 【Analyze】, also provided by the management, showed that neither Gargalla nor Vlad’s equipment had such penalties.</p>
<p>(“Shall I let the guests inside?”)</p>
<p>“I guess they’ll suffice in killing some time. Yeah, let them in.”</p>
<p>Aldo chose “YES” from the “Authorize entrance? YES/NO” window that appeared on his menu. A short while later, the two guests entered the room led by the maid.</p>
<p>“I thank you for allowing us to visit you. My name is Vlad, pleased to make your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Gargalla.”</p>
<p>“No need for useless greetings. What do you want?”</p>
<p>Aldo replied in rude manner to Vlad’s smiling greeting and Gargalla’s cold self-introduction. It was hardly proper behavior to welcome guests, but Vlad did not seem offended in the least.</p>
<p>“I saw Mr. Robin leave here with a rather serious expression, you see. I was wondering if we could assist you, good sir.”</p>
<p>“You should have just asked Robin then.”</p>
<p>“I thought talking with the person giving orders would be quicker. Besides, I might be more useful in case of secret orders, you see.”</p>
<p>A friendly grin appeared on Vlad’s lips.</p>
<p>Secret orders. Aldo’s eyes narrowed at these words.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t be alarmed. I apologize for gathering information without permission. But my comrade and I share the same goal as you.”</p>
<p>“My goal?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. You wish to go back to the real world quickly, yes? And for that, you want that man, who’s taking his sweet time, to hurry up. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>Aldo did not think it strange that another man thought the same thing as himself. On the contrary, he thought that it was absurd that other players didn’t say anything to Shin.</p>
<p>Hearing the words “go back to the real world”, Aldo was now convinced that he understood the reason why Vlad had shown up.</p>
<p>“And you people are able to do that?”</p>
<p>“We can. We have reached a rather high level, if I may say so, and therefore if we contact him as “dungeon clearing partners”, I doubt he will ignore us. And if he does, we have other ways to force him to listen to us. Gargalla here is an expert in such methods.”</p>
<p>What Vlad alluded to were unsavory methods. As Aldo glanced at Gargalla, the latter cracked a slight grin.</p>
<p>“I’m a specialist in that field. Plenty of experience, yeah?”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s expression brimmed with confidence.</p>
<p>Normally Aldo would not have had the guts to dirty his hands with illegal activities, however having been trapped and unable to log out for such a long time, what little patience he had quickly ran out.</p>
<p>Aldo thus nodded without hesitation, sparing no thought to the fact that this would pass the burden to someone else.</p>
<p>“Leaving this to just Robin will accomplish nothing so I’ll be counting on you two as well. And so, what do you want from me?”</p>
<p>Even if their goals were the same, Aldo didn’t believe the two guests wouldn’t ask for a reward.</p>
<p>The two guests’ smiles widened at his words.</p>
<p>“Please let us take care of the dungeon clearing affair. As for the reward, I would like you to procure some weapons. Of course, that is after we succeed in spurring that man to action.”</p>
<p>“Hm? You have yours already, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“It is embarrassing to admit, but there are few blacksmiths capable of forging rare weapons. And that man is the most skilled of them all. I also do not have a death wish. I apologize for such a rude request, but could you please accept it?”</p>
<p>Vlad gave a courteous, deep bow, which pleased Aldo very much.</p>
<p>“So be it. But it will only be done if you succeed, remember that.”</p>
<p>“I am very grateful. We will act right away, so if you will excuse us.”</p>
<p>Vlad bowed again, then headed towards the exit of Aldo’s home.</p>
<p>“Wait! I have not heard that man’s request yet. I don’t want to listen to any illegal requests later. So, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ah, me.”</p>
<p>Gargalla turned only his head back and smiled defiantly.</p>
<p>“I just want to fight against Shin. Not his current half-assed and slacked self, but when he’s really serious..”</p>
<p>Gargalla said nothing else and followed Vlad outside.</p>
<p>“….tch, creepy fellow.”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s smile had given Aldo chills.</p>
<p>Outside Aldo’s home, Vlad quickly hid his face with a helmet. Gargalla then caught up to him.</p>
<p>“Hah, to think that he’ll let us handle the case with an explanation like that. Having a superior like that would surely be tough on the subordinates.”</p>
<p>“Damn right.”</p>
<p>Vlad knew about the relationship between Aldo and Robin. They had visited while Robin was absent precisely because he had collected this information.</p>
<p>His words of understanding towards Aldo’s plight concealed Vlad’s disdain for the man. Gargalla also shared similar sentiments.</p>
<p>“That Aldo too, if he acted himself, the dungeon clearing would surely become at least a bit faster. That avatar is such a waste on him. If only there was an avatar exchange function available, I’d make very good use of it.”</p>
<p>“Right, the guy inside is total shit. Nothing remotely interesting ‘bout him.”</p>
<p>Someone with a powerful avatar, equipped with Ancient grade equipment, that had not participated in clearing any dungeons.</p>
<p>For players who were earnestly striving to clear the dungeons, Aldo was an infuriating existence.</p>
<p>He could have at least been more helpful with clearing the dungeons that were currently being conquered.</p>
<p>Instead, Aldo spent his days doing nothing, entrusting even the smallest tasks to Robin.</p>
<p>Vlad had concealed his feelings in Aldo’s presence, but he despised him. Gargalla, on the other hand, found him utterly boring.</p>
<p>“Well, since we’re going to use him, the dumber he is, the better.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, for your actual job.”</p>
<p>Vlad was a scammer in real life. Because of this experience, he knew that Aldo planned to use him and Gargalla.</p>
<p><i>I would never be cheated, I could never be used by others.</i> Vlad had seen through the fact that Aldo was rife with such groundless confidence.</p>
<p>“Well then, time to start then. My<i>just</i>duty is to set him free, after all.”</p>
<p>“As creepy as always, man.”</p>
<p>“I’m not seeking your approval.”</p>
<p>With those words trailing behind, Vlad disappeared into the bustle of the city.</p>
<p>“Haha, a High Human…! I hope this will be a lot of fun…”</p>
<p>Gargalla then walked away, in a different direction than Vlad.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Shin, ominous shadows were drawing closer.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 1 – Part 4</p>
<p>Shin had been tasked with caring for Luca; they knitted and took naps together, surprising everyone around them with how well they got along.</p>
<p>Marino and Emil would sometimes drop in to check on them, but Luca was never unmanageable.</p>
<p>Although she was a bit shy at first, by the afternoon she had completely opened up to Shin.</p>
<p>“What can I say? It’s pretty surprising.”</p>
<p>Holly, a female player, expressed her surprise upon seeing Shin interact with Luca. As one of the advanced players who collaborated with the orphanage, she was also on friendly terms with Shin. Soft-spoken and serene, she was especially popular with the younger children.</p>
<p>“Eh? What is?”</p>
<p>“Well, kids like Luca are pretty hard to care for if you’re not used to it, you know? Especially for a man, like you. Or so I thought anyway.”</p>
<p>It was now an hour past noon, signalling nap time for the children.</p>
<p>Lying down together with them, Shin watched over the sleeping Luca.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that could be because I have a little sister too.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry into your real life circumstances.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right. I have two brothers, one older and one younger, and a little sister. Looking after our little sister is our duty, right? My brothers and I took turns taking care of her. Compared to Luca, however, my little sister was quite the handful as she was always wandering off.”</p>
<p>Perhaps due to similar ages, Shin’s little sister was most attached to their little brother. Despite that, Shin was relatively experienced in taking care of children because of her.</p>
<p>“You said it before, right? That your brothers never played THE NEW GATE?”</p>
<p>Marino, who was caring for the other children, noted that she had heard about the topic before.</p>
<p>“My little sister did. But luckily she wasn’t involved in this mess.”</p>
<p>“If she had, I bet you would have rushed to look for her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sure she could survive easily, so I wouldn’t really be worried.”</p>
<p>“Is she really strong too?”</p>
<p>“Frankly speaking, yes, very much so. Not only are her level and stats high, but she also has high movement speed.”</p>
<p>Shin’s little sister also played THE NEW GATE, and because of her ability, had become rather famous. The two siblings had kept their distance within the game, so few knew of her connection to Shin.</p>
<p>“She can make even you say something like that? Is she as powerful as my husband?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well you could say that I’m biased since she’s family, but my sister is probably superior, as far as player skill is concerned. Though, Shadow’s player skill is amazing too.”</p>
<p>Shadow was Holly’s husband and also famous for his skill.</p>
<p>Shin’s words surprised Marino.</p>
<p>“Better than Shadow? Your little sister is amazing too, then, in a different way from you. Are your other brothers this special too?”</p>
<p>“No, they don’t even play THE NEW GATE, after all.”</p>
<p>All of Shin’s siblings loved videogames, comics, and animation, but his oldest brother was busy with work and did not partake much in such pastimes anymore. Shin’s little brother liked comics more than videogames, so the only one to play the same games as Shin was his little sister.</p>
<p>She wasn’t that interested in comics or animation either. Even within the same family, likes and hobbies were all different.</p>
<p>“Hn…”</p>
<p>Shin looked back towards Luca, who shifted slightly in her sleep, and realized that her right hand had somehow started gripping his left. She was still asleep though.</p>
<p>“Looks like she wants to keep you close even while sleeping.”</p>
<p>“My, I’m afraid you won’t escape easily, big brother.”</p>
<p>Marino smiled and Holly lightly teased Shin.</p>
<p>With an embarrassed laugh, Shin’s gaze turned towards the hand Luca was holding. He could have escaped her grip all too easily, but he did not feel like moving away anytime soon.</p>
<p>“Holly and I will take care of the other kids, so Shin will stay with Luca. Is that ok?”</p>
<p>“Of course. And Shin, when Luca wakes up, be at her side, ok? This morning she threw a fit because you weren’t there.”</p>
<p>This was what Teppei and Ryohei had mentioned when Shin and Marino arrived at the orphanage.</p>
<p>Luca had lived alone for about 2 months after her brother and his party disappeared. There was no one she was familiar with among the people around her, so she was deeply afraid of losing someone she knew, as Emil had told Shin in secret.</p>
<p>Emil had slept with her the previous night, but had woken up early to prepare the children’s food, leaving Luca alone in the process. There was no one with her when she woke up, so Luca started loudly crying.</p>
<p>“OK, got it. If I have to go somewhere, I’ll let someone know first.”</p>
<p>There were other players in the orphanage other than Emil, Marino and Holly. Shin was acquainted with them all, so he wouldn’t have trouble calling someone if necessary.</p>
<p>The game world did not require using the toilet so unless there was an emergency, Shin would have no trouble staying with Luca until she woke up.</p>
<p>“OK, I’ll leave her to you then.”</p>
<p>“Take good care of her, all right?”</p>
<p>Shin watched them head off, then looked again at Luca’s face and her hand, still holding his. He then added a little more more strength in his grip.</p>
<p>As if in response to that, Luca’s expression became more serene.</p>
<p>Luca opened her eyes around thirty minutes later. Naptime was always half an hour, so apparently her body had memorized it.</p>
<p>She was still in a daze at first, but when she saw Shin next to her, she felt slightly embarrassed to have her sleeping face exposed, despite her very young age.</p>
<p>“Afternoon is free time, right? What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Making children work too much felt wrong, so either mornings or afternoons in the orphanage were always free activity times. Today, they all did as they pleased after waking up from their afternoon nap, given that they had already worked in morning.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the energetic group Shin had “fought” in the morning would help with simple jobs in the afternoon.</p>
<p>“I want to take a walk.”</p>
<p>“Outside then? Well, staying cooped up inside all day would be boring after all.”</p>
<p>The orphanage was pretty vast, but even going slowly it would only take a minute to walk a lap around it.</p>
<p>In town, it was generally not possible to reduce players’ HP and kill them. But as was the case with everything else, there were exceptions due to which the orphanage made sure that when the children ventured outside, they were always accompanied by someone who could hold their own in battle.</p>
<p>“No good?”</p>
<p>“No, a change of pace would be nice, after all. Wait a moment, let’s try asking Emil.”</p>
<p>Shin contacted Emil via chat, and was asked to do some shopping as well. He agreed and raised a thumb in Luca’s direction.</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>
<p>Luca raised her little thumbs, excited.</p>
<p>Thanks to the item box, there was no need to physically carry things. If anything happened, Shin could react immediately, so there would be no problem.</p>
<p>Shin heard from Emil that the other children would stay within the orphanage grounds, so he and Luca left right away.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re going out?”</p>
<p>The two bumped into Marino as they were opening the orphanage doors. Shin explained that he was going out for a walk with Luca and to do some shopping.</p>
<p>“She’s always been inside lately, now that you mention it. Yes, I also think it’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>Marino agreed with a smile, when Luca suddenly grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>“Luca?”</p>
<p>“Marino come too?”</p>
<p>Marino looked at Shin, silently asking him if something had happened.</p>
<p>Shin shook his head.</p>
<p>“Hmm, okay, I’ll ask Emil. If she allows it, I’ll come with you guys.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>Unlike Shin, Marino was one of the orphanage’s central members because she often helped out there. She couldn’t just leave without a word.</p>
<p>Marino went quiet for several seconds to use the chat, then raised her thumb just like Shin had previously done.</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>
<p>Luca repeated the same gesture again.</p>
<p>“OK, let’s go. Luca, don’t let go of Marino’s hand, okay?”</p>
<p>Shin had Luca take Marino’s left hand, so she would not get lost in a crowd.</p>
<p>“The other hand is yours then, Shin.”</p>
<p>In response, Marino put Luca’s right hand on Shin’s.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Okay!!”</p>
<p>With both her hands being held, Luca beamed with joy. Shin and Marino smiled at each other.</p>
<p>After leaving the orphanage, the trio first headed to the grocery street to procure meat and vegetables. The street was crowded with players who had agricultural jobs, offering the products they grew to other players coming to buy ingredients for dinner.</p>
<p>“—–yes, please give me the usual. Ah, but I need one more of that meat.”</p>
<p>Shin had been entrusted with the shopping, but Marino carefully selected what to buy. She always shopped like this for the orphanage, so the store owners treated her with familiarity and also responded well to her bargaining.</p>

<p>“Big sis Mari, wow…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t your bargaining skill already active when you start shopping? You’re also using a real negotiation skill.”</p>
<p>Shin and Luca were impressed by Marino’s skill.</p>
<p>“—-agh, I can’t just say no to you, can I! Consider this a thank you for always buying my goods! I’ll give them to you for 70. Now get lost!”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>
<p>“By the way, are those two with you, missy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are, why do you ask?”</p>
<p>The owner looked at Shin and Luca, then grinned and whispered to Marino.</p>
<p>“Well ya see, shopping while holding hands with a kid… doesn’t that resemble a couple of newlyweds? You’re gonna make single dudes like me green with envy, darnit!”</p>
<p>“N-Newlywhat!? What are you saying!?”</p>
<p>Marino stuttered in response, unable to say the full word.</p>
<p>“Anyone would think so, little lady. But yeah okay, enough jokes for today.”</p>
<p>“You can’t just joke about things like this!!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t really hate it though, didja. You were grinning, missy!”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Marino abruptly hid her mouth with her hands. Incidentally, Shin heard everything.</p>
<p>He came closer, thinking it was time to lend Marino a helping hand, when the owner’s expression turned deadly serious.</p>
<p>“I’m not an information broker or anything, but you’re a precious customer, so I gotta tell ya. Make sure the little girl don’t hear.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Shin gently pressed his hands on Luca’s ears, who had tilted her head after hearing the man’s words.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll be quick. They say that a bunch of PKs started being active again lately. Ever heard of “Ouroboros’ Hollow?” Even some advanced players have fallen victim to them. We’ve been told to keep alert.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the name, yes. Their members all have pretty high stats, or so I heard.”</p>
<p>“Ouroboros’ Hollow” was composed solely of PK players.</p>
<p>The players who were only acting out that role in the game and had no intention of truly killing had long left the guild. The ones who remained were actual murderers.</p>
<p>The guild that killed players for fun had now turned into a true assassins’ guild.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what they’re thinking, but some of em’ even target small kids. Which yer’ orphanage has a whole bunch of. Better stay on your toes, ya hear me?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for giving us such important information.”</p>
<p>Marino thanked the concerned owner.</p>
<p>As the man had said, the orphanage was a prime target, because of the weakness of the players inside and the grave consequences such an act would cause. It was also a fact that there were those who preyed on the weak with no particular reason.</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it, missy. It’d be really sad for a face I know to disappear…ah, you can let her go now.”</p>
<p>After the owner’s words, Shin took his hands off Luca’s ears.</p>
<p>“You finished talking?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sorry for covering your ears all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“….no, I have been defaild*…you must take responsibility!”</p>
<p>(T/N: defaild* Defiled was misspelled on purpose, Luca is supposed to not know what she’s saying)</p>
<p>To Shin’s apology, Luca put her hands on her hips and puffed up her chest in protest. The gesture itself was quite comical, in complete contrast with the very serious tone of her objection.</p>
<p>“Hey hey man, what are you teaching to a little girl like that…?”</p>
<p>“Like I would!! Really though, where did you learn that…?”</p>
<p>“Teppei said it’s a good thing to say to boys. It isn’t?”</p>
<p>“Of course it isn’t. It’s better not to use those words much.”</p>
<p>“? ….okay.”</p>
<p>Luca didn’t actually know the meaning of what she had said, so she honestly nodded.</p>
<p>“Well then, guess I’ll have a little “talk” with Teppei once we get back.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Better inform Emil too.”</p>
<p>“You’re smiling, but not happy…?”</p>
<p>Marino and Shin’s lips were smiling, but their eyes weren’t, which confused Luca quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, nothing to worry about, Luca.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re going to take care of everything. OK then, shopping’s done, so let’s go for a little walk. Have a nice day, sir.”</p>
<p>“Sure, you lot take care!”</p>
<p>They bade farewell to the shop owner, then Marino held Luca’s hand as the trio walked on.</p>
<p>As Kalkia was one of the hometowns, players had set up all sorts of shops.</p>
<p>Commodity stores with healing medicines and everyday goods, open-air stands with handmade equipment, eateries with waiters running around taking orders. The great variety of shops and people made it entertaining just to look at them.</p>
<p>Luca, happily walking between Shin and Marino, enjoyed the sights too.</p>
<p>“We’ve been out a while already, better go back.”</p>
<p>Fun times go by quickly. When Shin checked the time, it was already past 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>THE NEW GATE included a season system too; seasons would change roughly each month. The current season was autumn, so the sun would set early. It was already noticeably darker compared to noon hours.</p>
<p>“We go back, already?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If it gets dark everyone will worry.”</p>
<p>Luca seemed disappointed, so Shin promised that he would take her on a walk again.</p>
<p>When they returned to the orphanage, the children who had left to help with work had come back too. Some girls who noticed Luca’s return invited her to play with them.</p>
<p>Marino would often sleep over at the orphanage, but because she would stay at Shin’s place for a while, Marino went to report to Emil.</p>
<p>Waiting for Marino to come back, Shin was at the orphanage’s gates, lost in thought while looking at the sky.</p>
<p>There, one man approached him.</p>
<p>“Excuse me sir…could you tell me if you really are Mr. Shin?”</p>
<p>“….yes, I am, and you are?”</p>
<p>Shin turned towards the man. He quickly activated【Analyze】, which displayed the man’s name as Vlad, his level 255.</p>
<p>“My apologies. My name is Vlad. I hoped to visit Tsuki no Hokora and happened to see you here, so I took the liberty to approach you directly.”</p>
<p>Vlad’s polite speech and demeanor did not seem particularly suspicious.</p>
<p>“Is that so. What exactly brings you to me then?”</p>
<p>“I am actually in the middle of clearing another dungeon, and the area before the boss contains some very powerful poison. I thus wanted to ask if you possibly could share some recovery items. The parties involved in this clearing effort are composed of members from the guilds “Savage Lions” and “Yatagarasu”, led by Lao of the Explosive Legs corps. I have heard that you are acquainted with Lao, so if necessary you could contact him.”</p>
<p>The strength of the poison probably made it impossible for the players to cure it fully using their skills.</p>
<p>Shin asked about details of the area and quickly figured out what the man was referring to.</p>
<p>“That must be Bloodred Poison. It’s true that very few players in the whole game can recover from that, I think it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Bloodred Poison was a particular negative status with far worse effects than normal Poison. Players with INT less than 900 could only mitigate its effects through skills. This status also lasted for a considerably long time, so defeating a boss while under its effects was hardly doable.</p>
<p>“Understood, I will prepare some recovery items for you, but wouldn’t it have been faster if Lao just sent me a message via chat?”</p>
<p>“Lao is now heading to the dungeon. He did not want to burden you, but the other leaders decided that prolonging the mission would be difficult because of scarce resources and the members’ morale diminishing. As such, I have been entrusted with delivering the message.”</p>
<p>Lao said that he would have contacted Shin if the current dungeon clearing mission failed, at least according to Vlad.</p>
<p>He had approached Shin now probably because there was a high chance of failure at present.</p>
<p>“I shall take my leave then. I thank you for your assistance.”</p>
<p>Just as Vlad had turned to leave, Marino came out of the orphanage.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait, Shin.”</p>
<p>“No, you came just at the right time.”</p>
<p>Shin welcomed Marino with a smile.</p>
<p>“Er, did I interrupt you?”</p>
<p>“Please do not worry, as I was about to leave. Farewell, then.”</p>
<p>Vlad gave a small bow and left.</p>
<p>“Tch, I had heard of her, but…what’s with that woman!?”</p>
<p>After leaving Shin, Vlad slipped in the crowd, then quickly turned into a back alley.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help blurting out his annoyance and was relieved to see that no one was around to hear.</p>
<p>“Filthy player trash parasitizing Shin…should just go die already…”</p>
<p>Vlad continued cursing with a menacing tone that he had completely concealed when talking to Shin.</p>
<p>A member of Rokuten, the strongest guild, and the only player who had achieved max stats.</p>
<p>Vlad could barely imagine how much time, money, and dedication it took to achieve such a level.</p>
<p>“Aah, but to cleanse the trash heaping around him is my noble duty. Gahaha, it’s supposed to be a chore, so why do I feel so excited?”</p>
<p>Shin was a player that Vlad admired. The glorious sight of Shin sweeping through the opposing team by himself in a guild vs guild battle had moved Vlad’s heart, despite the fact that it was just a game.</p>
<p>When he first started playing he focused on raising his level and stats, but now that his avatar was stronger, he only spent his efforts on things related to Shin.</p>
<p>“The strongest shine the most when they are alone at the peak. The cursed star that shines the brightest within Rokuten…I shall bring back your true brilliance.”</p>
<p>An insane laugh echoed in the alley, without reaching any ears.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 1 – Part 5</p>
<p>“Hey, who was that person?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? He’s from a party that’s currently clearing another location. It’s a bit of a nasty place, you see. He came to request some recovery items. I know the leader, so I’ll ask him for details.”</p>
<p>“I see….”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You’re making a weird face.”</p>
<p>Marino’s expression had drastically changed; she now looked concerned as she stared in the direction Vlad had gone.</p>
<p>“Something wrong with that man?”</p>
<p>Assessing Marino’s gaze, Shin guessed that Vlad was the reason of her worry.</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure, but, he was glaring at me with a really cold look.”</p>
<p>“He glared at you?”</p>
<p>Shin frowned. He could not think of a reason why anyone would resent Marino.</p>
<p>Despite it being widely known that she worked in the orphanage everyday, there were whispers that she received preferential treatment as Shin’s lover. Such groundless resentment was already a thing of the past.</p>
<p>“I guess we should be careful.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’d do anything in these parts though.”</p>
<p>In the city, a Player’s HP could not reach zero under normal circumstances. No matter how high another player’s stats or what skills they used, it would be impossible for them to kill a player within a city.</p>
<p>In the game, some burglar players targeted stores, but it was only stores set up outside of the protected city limits by players such as Shin. The town was a safe location for all players.</p>
<p>“Normally, yeah. There haven’t been any monster invasion events lately, so I’m a bit worried. During such events, even in the city…”</p>
<p>It’s possible to kill.</p>
<p>He didn’t say it outright, but that was what Shin feared the most. Monster invasion events were the reason why towns were not absolute safe havens for players.</p>
<p>During an invasion event, if the town defenses were breached and the monsters penetrated inside, the rule preventing players’ HP from being reduced below a certain threshold value was removed. In other words, during such events, it was possible to PK even in town.</p>
<p>It was a fact that became largely known after the invasion event that happened two weeks after the start of the death game. This event had generated several casualties.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be okay, don’t worry. Even if an invasion event starts, we just need to make sure the town’s defenses hold up.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, that’s true…”</p>
<p>After the first invasion event, many players and guilds invested heavily in protecting the towns. Clearing dungeons was, of course, important, but without a place to return to, it was ultimately meaningless.</p>
<p>Thanks to the upgraded town defenses, monsters had successfully invaded towns only during that first event. It was not strange for Marino to say that there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>“I’m more worried about you, Shin. You’re clearing dungeons by yourself, so no one would be there to help in case it was necessary.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m always making sure it’s safe enough to go on. I didn’t max my stats for nothing, ya know?”</p>
<p>Not even Shin would go face bosses without scouting first. Based on the strength of the Gigantes Moss, the last boss he fought, he answered rather optimistically that there were no problems yet.</p>
<p>“Even if you say so, I’m still worried! Listen well now, in the next dungeon, and the one after that, and the one after that too, you absolutely must come back safe and sound, okay!? If you die I’m joining you as soon as I can, got it!?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Marino was dead serious. She grabbed his lapel and looked straight into his eyes, while hers brimmed with tears.</p>
<p>“O-okay, I’m sorry. I don’t want to die either. I’ll always come back!”</p>
<p>Struck by Marino’s seriousness, Shin made his promise. Hearing her say that she would join him in death, he couldn’t ignore her plea.</p>
<p>After Shin confirmed the promise, Marino slowly backed away from him, albeit still pouting and angrily glaring at him.</p>
<p>“You mustn’t die, okay? We’re all going back together, all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. I keep my promises.”</p>
<p>“…no matter what, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we made some good friends after all. It’ll be nice to meet in real life too.”</p>
<p>“…yes.”</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied with Shin’s answer, Marino affectionately squeezed his hands tightly.</p>
<p>“…let’s go home.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Relieved to see Marino smile, Shin started walking again. With fairly bad timing, though, the silhouette of a person appeared before them.</p>
<p>“Found you at last. I am truly sorry, but could you spare some time for me?”</p>
<p>“…you are?”</p>
<p>Protecting Marino behind his back, Shin confronted the man.</p>
<p>“My name is Robin. I came with a request for you, Sir Shin.”</p>
<p>The player who introduced himself as Robin bowed his head to Shin.</p>
<p>“A request? What is it?”</p>
<p>“I know this will be really rude of me to say, and I apologize in advance. But could it be possible for you to increase the speed of your dungeon clearing?”</p>
<p>“My dungeon clearing?”</p>
<p>Robin raised his head, showing his distressed expression. Seeing this, Shin sensed something different from this man compared to other players who had irresponsibly urged him to hurry up in clearing the dungeons.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute!! Shin is doing his best, you know!”</p>
<p>“Wait, Marino. He seems different from the others so far.”</p>
<p>Marino had witnessed such scenes many times in the past and was ready to fly off the handle at the man, but Shin talked her down, continuing to talk with Robin.</p>
<p>“Believe me, I am going as fast as I can…did something happens?”</p>
<p>“My…superior in real life told me to make you hurry up. I’m truly sorry, I know very well that the dungeon clearing parties are staking their lives, but if I oppose him my real life will be in jeopardy…to be honest, I can’t stop worrying when I think about how my family might be doing right now. My superior told me to urge you, and won’t listen to reason…”</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>There were other players with situations like Robin. Shin was still a student and did not have a family to nurture.</p>
<p>Even so, thinking about his life after returning to reality worried him. While trapped in this world, there was no way of knowing how the real one was changing.</p>
<p>Because of this, Shin could understand Robin’s feelings, at least to an extent.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. As I already said to others, there are new traps and unknown monsters in the dungeons that weren’t there before. Boss fight patterns are changing too. I’m trying to clear them as fast as I can, but it’s just not possible to proceed as quickly as I could with beginner or intermediate level dungeons.”</p>
<p>“….yes, of course. I’m sorry for approaching you out of the blue like this.”</p>
<p>Uttering these final words, Robin left. His distressed expression persisted until the end.</p>
<p>“Will that person be okay?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s been four months since we were trapped in this world… There are a plenty of people like him who are worried sick about the real world.”</p>
<p>There were no counselors or similar professions in this world. Some people stood back up on their feet, supported by others, while others fell into despair.</p>
<p>“There are many like him who want nothing more than to return to the real world and then there are people like PKs, who want to stay here forever.”</p>
<p>Marino commented with a difficult expression as they went back.</p>
<p>“That’s true…well, everyone’s different. What else can we say.”</p>
<p>“Yes…you’re right. Everyone has different circumstances…”</p>
<p>Marino’s expression was still clouded, but a bit clearer than before.</p>
<p>After returning to Tsuki no Hokora, Shin took a bath, as per Marino’s suggestion.</p>
<p>Dipping in the hot bath gave him some relief. He felt that it wasn’t an illusion and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>While Shin was in the bath, Marino prepared dinner. The menu was white stew and salad.</p>
<p>She deftly cut the ingredients and brought them to a boil, displaying the skill of someone used to cooking.</p>
<p>“Going back to reality…huh…”</p>
<p>Focused on cooking, Marino spoke her thoughts out loud. In reaction to hearing her own words, her movements came to a halt.</p>
<p>“Huh…? What was I…thinking about?”</p>
<p>What she had heard were her own words, but she felt like they had come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>When she realized the truth, she also fully noticed her real feelings. When she heard about the PKs, she was supposed to be angry. But at the same time, she thought “Yes, I can see that”.</p>
<p>“This is weird. Why do I….”</p>
<p>Marino knew that, like the PKs, she also harbored a certain dislike towards the idea of returning to reality. In fact, Robin’s desire of returning had not moved her heart in the slightest.</p>
<p>“This is just strange. I wanted to go back too, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Too weird. This couldn’t be.</p>
<p>The emotions swelling in her own chest confused Marino.</p>
<p>That very moment, something disrupted her field of sight.</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>She thought she heard a thud-like sound, from far away.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Her body wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>Just like a sudden scene change, she saw the floor, the racks, then her own arms dropping down.</p>
<p>“Aah…”</p>
<p>Then, she finally understood what was happening to her.</p>
<p>She had forgotten a long time ago and tried not to think about it since.</p>
<p>She thought that things would continue like this forever.</p>
<p>“So… Time’s almost up.”</p>
<p>The end was drawing near. The time limit drew closer.</p>
<p>“A little more. Just a little more…”</p>
<p>She tried to move her arms.</p>
<p>They moved, as if it was a dream that they didn’t just moments ago. She could now stand by herself. It was another attack, probably.</p>
<p>“…I have to tell him. I can’t cause any more problems for Shin.”</p>
<p>Words which didn’t come from her heart. The words of a good girl who always did what she was told.</p>
<p>Disappointing the person who loved her was terrifying.</p>
<p>But all she could leave him with were items and equipment; she felt that she had no right to be with him, that Shin would probably leave her. A girl with just a little time left to live…was nothing more than dead weight.</p>
<p>“But I don’t want to leave him…”</p>
<p>Even if her mind understood, she couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>Marino’s reason and emotions completely opposed each other.</p>
<p>“I finished bathing!”</p>
<p>Shin’s voice reached her.</p>
<p>Hearing the voice of her beloved, Marino made her decision.</p>
<p>After bathing and eating dinner, there was not much to do.</p>
<p>For entertainment and ways to kill time, THE NEW GATE only offered some minigames, the chance of listening to the in-game local news, which consisted of an indistinguishable mess of lies and truth, or just checking the information exchange bulletin board.</p>
<p>Just as Shin finished browsing the bulletin board he always checked, Marino entered his room.</p>
<p>There were many other rooms and plenty of beds available. Despite that, the two would sometimes sleep together, so it was not strange for Marino to come in.</p>
<p>“….Marino?”</p>
<p>However, Shin noticed that there was something unusual about her.</p>
<p>Marino, now in pajamas, hesitatingly sat down on the bed. She took Shin’s big pillow and hugged it tightly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Are you feeling sick?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m okay now.”</p>
<p><i>I’m okay now</i>. Shin felt something off with those words. He imagined that what had happened on their way back from the orphanage still occupied her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m going to bed soon, what will you do?”</p>
<p>“I will too. We have to work hard…tomorrow too, right?”</p>
<p>With a slightly forced smile, Marino slipped under the covers. When Shin lay next to her, she timidly gripped his arm.</p>
<p>“Marino?”</p>
<p>It was not strange for her to cuddle like this. But this time she seemed tense, unnatural.</p>
<p>“Can we…talk a little?”</p>
<p>Marino spoke while pressing her face against Shin’s arm.</p>
<p>She was going to talk about something very important. Shin quietly consented.</p>
<p>“…Shin, do you think you want to go back to reality soon?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah…I think that I want to go back. But, though I know it feels wrong to say, I also think that my current lifestyle is pretty fun. We don’t know who we are in the real world, and…I mean, I’m not asking for you to tell me. But in the real world I couldn’t sleep with you. So while deep down, I feel that I want to go back, a part of me also enjoys this life.”</p>
<p>Shin could feel like this because his level and stats weren’t reset, and because of the items and equipment he had retained.</p>
<p>“…..yeah.”</p>
<p>Marino trembled a little to Shin’s answer.</p>
<p>“Life for me feels really fulfilling now. I wake up in the morning, work, prepare dinner. You return and I welcome you back home…I sleep feeling your warmth close to me. Such a life makes my heart beat faster…gives me happiness…everyday.”</p>
<p>Marino’s grip tightened. It felt like she would not let go anymore.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mari—-”</p>
<p>“Listen to me, Shin.”</p>
<p>Marino stopped Shin mid-sentence and raised her head.</p>
<p>She had probably been crying as there were traces of tears. It silenced Shin.</p>
<p>“My real name…is Masaki Rino. I’ll turn 19 this year.”</p>
<p>During their whole time together, Marino had rarely talked about her real life circumstances.</p>
<p>She didn’t have to say that she didn’t want to talk about it for Shin to understand. He knew her well enough to.</p>
<p>That is why he felt he had to ask, after Marino suddenly revealed such information.</p>
<p>“…is it okay for me to know?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I want Shin to remember.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then I’d also like you to remember my real name. I’m Kiritani Shinya, a 21-year-old university student…”</p>
<p>Shin also revealed his real name. He hadn’t said it in a long time.</p>
<p>“I said it at the orphanage too, but when the death game ends, why don’t we all meet up and go out drinking or something? We could book Holly and Shadow’s place or something.”</p>
<p>“…yes, I’d love to.”</p>
<p>Marino was now smiling next to him, but there was something strange with her today.</p>
<p>Shin had made her laugh many times before, that’s why he knew.</p>
<p>Her words suggested that they would never meet in real life, that their relationship was limited to this world.</p>
<p>“Marino…no, Rino. Can you tell me what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“The real me…is sick. The doctor said that it’s a disease with no known cause or treatment.”</p>
<p>Marino explained that the reason why her time within the game was limited and she never spoke about real life was because of this. She did not know when her condition would worsen, so she thought it would not be good to get too close to other people.</p>
<p>“Why did you get closer to me, then? I know this is just a virtual world, but you did tell me a lot about yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…I wonder why?”</p>
<p>Her voice felt calm now. Even if her words were in question form, she seemed to know the answer already.</p>
<p>“I can say this now, but…at first, I had no intention of getting too involved. There was no way I could get a boyfriend in real life, so I wanted to try what it felt like being in a relationship, even if virtually. You’re the first one that approached me in this world, so I chose you. That was the only reason, really.”</p>
<p>There was no real reason. So said Marino, but her sighs made it also feel like she was just trying to convince herself.</p>
<p>“Yes, that was the only reason, and yet…”</p>
<p>The words expressed her feelings of surrender towards what had happened against her will.</p>
<p>“Talking, adventuring, winning and losing with you…before I realized it, I was always thinking about you. I didn’t realize that I was falling in love, until a nurse pointed it out. I have never even met you in the real world, and yet…”</p>
<p>Marino said that she really didn’t understand.</p>
<p>“The me in the real world could die at any moment. I sometimes wondered what would happen to the me here if the real me died. Then once, I wondered…how good would it be if time just continued on like this?”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“It won’t. If I die in the real world, the me here will just disappear. I know it. Despite that…I can’t help hoping. My attachment to the real world, my desire to go back, is very weak.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Shin did not say anything. He had plenty of reasons to want to return to the real world.</p>
<p>But he could understand Marino’s feelings. Shin also found the current world pleasant to be in after all.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I just wanted to tell you that I’m sick, but I ended up blabbing about stuff I didn’t even…I guess I’ll go sleep in the next room tonight.”</p>
<p>Maybe she felt bad towards the now silent Shin. Marino got out of the bed and headed towards the door.</p>
<p>But he would not let her go.</p>
<p>“Aah!”</p>
<p>Shin firmly grabbed her thin arms and pulled her towards him. He pulled her rather abruptly, so Marino’s body fell towards him, putting her in his arms.</p>
<p>“Er, ehm…”</p>
<p>Marino was confused by the sudden development. She didn’t understand what Shin’s actions meant.</p>
<p>“I’ll come to you.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Even in the real world, I’ll stay with you, Rino.”</p>
<p>In the original world, Shin was just a university student. He couldn’t cure Marino’s disease.</p>
<p>There was but one thing he could do: to be by her side.</p>
<p>Not out of compassion. Not out of pity.</p>
<p>He wanted to be with her. Even if there was little time left for her, he wanted to spend it together.</p>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>“I’ll be with you, until the end.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how Marino would react to his words.</p>
<p>Logical or not, those were Shin’s real feelings.</p>
<p>“But I’m…a real burden of a woman, you know? I’m spoiled, Shin…Shinya, if you talk with other girls I get jealous right away. I also don’t have much time left to live. Don’t you understand that I’m going to die, leaving nothing but my selfish feelings? You’ll just waste time with me, Shinya…”</p>
<p>Responding to Shin’s declaration, Marino nervously listed off all of her faults.</p>
<p>Despite her words, however, her arms were now around Shin, her forehead pressing against his chest. Movements that expressed her intention of never letting him go. Shin responded by gently patting her head.</p>
<p>“Hey, should I believe your words or your actions?”</p>
<p>“…You know it already. Dummy.”</p>
<p>Marino raised her head a little and replied while glaring at Shin. The room was barely lit, but Shin did not fail to notice Marino’s flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>“If you don’t say it, I can’t be sure though, hmm…”</p>
<p>“You…tease. And I was so decided and all.”</p>
<p>Still glaring, Marino went silent for a few seconds, then whispered.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be separated from you. Not in this virtual world, nor in the real one.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I promise. Even if this world ends, I will come meet you, Rino.”</p>
<p>The two then slept together in the same bed.</p>
<p>Wrapped in a peaceful sense of happiness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 2 – Part 1</p>
<p>The monsters were restless.</p>
<p>On the other side of the mountain facing the hometown was an area players rarely set foot in.</p>
<p>In this area characterized by nothing but its vastness, all sorts of monsters had gathered without fighting one another.</p>
<p>Snake-type monsters. Tiger-type monsters. Bird-type monsters and humanoid-type monsters as well. There were even Chimera-types, fusions of several monsters.</p>
<p>Normally, such a high density of monsters would cause a reduction in numbers as they attack one other. However, a certain player’s presence prevented this.</p>
<p>Atop this area’s highest hill stood a lone player.</p>
<p>This player, Hameln, sighed while looking down on the monsters.</p>
<p>“So this is the maximum that low-grade items allowed me to gather. Causing an artificial invasion event is difficult indeed.”</p>
<p>Even while uttering such a line, his charming features showed the mischievous smile of a boy who had just performed a successful prank.</p>
<p>Hameln was 170 cemels tall and had typical Pixie tattoo-like marks on his face. He wore a gentleman-like attire, adorned with accessories here and there, complete with white gloves and a long stick held in one hand. The top hat on his head completed his gentleman-like appearance, but his demeanor was contradictory to that of any true gentleman.</p>
<p>A pack of monsters of all types. Controlling it in order to unleash it on a hometown was not something a sane person would come up with.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Just as Hameln pondered over his next course of action, he noticed that a monster icon disappeared from the map.</p>
<p>Two icons were breaking through the monster horde. Considering that the level of the gathered monsters was 300 at most, it was something any somewhat experienced player could have done.</p>
<p>“They’re probably thinking that they’ve found a nice hunting ground? Or perhaps they have come to exterminate the monsters because they consider them dangerous.”</p>
<p>Hameln activated 【Clairvoyance】 and 【Through Sight】.</p>
<p>His now expanded field of sight revealed a man wielding a glaive with a 1-mel long blade and another brandishing a broadsword with a very jagged blade, severely lacking in practicality.</p>
<p>The former, who was wearing silver armor, was named Vlad. Hameln’s 【Analyze】displayed his job as Dragon Knight.</p>
<p>The latter, wearing brown armor, apparently possessed higher stats; only his name, Gargalla, could be displayed.</p>
<p>“Oh my, he noticed me from such a distance?”</p>
<p>Hameln was genuinely surprised at feeling Gargalla’s eyes on himself.</p>
<p>It was well-known that some players sometimes felt mysterious sensations unexplainable by reason, such as “I felt someone watching me” or “I can feel someone’s killing intent”.</p>
<p>To be able to pinpoint the direction after only being in the line of sight for about 10 seconds, however, was something pretty exceptional.</p>
<p>Still in Hameln’s field of vision, Gargalla grinned. They adjusted their course towards the hill Hameln was on, blowing away the monsters in their way like pebbles.</p>
<p>“Heavens, their course changed. Maybe they’re the same type as I am?”</p>
<p>Hameln grimaced, lamenting the development of the situation.</p>
<p>The instant Hameln saw Gargalla’s smile, he felt that deep inside they were very similar.</p>
<p>He felt more displeasure rather than familiarity toward Gargalla, a perfect example of the inability to tolerate someone just because of how similar that person was to oneself. In short, it could be said that those who were very similar in this regard abhorred one another.</p>
<p>With this ambiguous sensation in his heart, Hameln observed as Gargalla drew closer to his position.</p>
<p>“Hey there. Gotta thank you for not hightailing it.”</p>
<p>“No need for thanks. I simply wished to confirm something.”</p>
<p>After roughly five minutes, Gargalla had reached Hameln’s hill.</p>
<p>Some time later, Vlad reached as well. They had arrived at different times, although neither showed signs of exhaustion.</p>
<p>“You’re slow, man!! Raise the pace, will ya??”</p>
<p>“Dragon knights are meant to be with dragons…please don’t ask for the impossible.”</p>
<p>Vlad darted an annoyed glance at Gargalla’s mocking tone. As he had implied, Dragon Knights could show their full capabilities only when accompanied by their dragons. In fact, when they were by themselves their stats decreased.</p>
<p>Naturally, it would have been very difficult to catch up to Gargalla, who had superior stats and equipment.</p>
<p>“Haha, ah, apologies for all the ruckus man. Let me tell you straight out, we didn’t come to fight or anything. Though it looks like doing so could be fun.”</p>
<p>“I will take that as a compliment. Now then, what brings you here?”</p>
<p>Hameln, who was just observing the two in silence, finally prompted Gargalla to speak.</p>
<p>“You’re the tamer who uses monsters to attack people outside of towns, right? There’s something ya gotta help us with. This guy here will tell you all the juicy details.”</p>
<p>“First you leave me behind and now I have to do all the explaining?”</p>
<p>Vlad voiced his dissatisfaction, but Gargalla, looked in the opposite direction while ignoring him.</p>
<p>Hameln, thinking that the newly-arrived duo was a pretty hilarious combination, was holding back his laughter.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, please continue your bickering later. So, what exactly did you want from me? Though, I can feel that you probably share the same sentiments.”</p>
<p>“My apologies for showing you such an embarrassing scene. We wish to request for you to use monsters to attack a certain town. I am sure you have also grown bored of crushing small settlements, yes?”</p>
<p><i>I see, they sure did their homework</i>. Hameln was honestly impressed to hear what Vlad already knew about him.</p>
<p>With the items Hameln could find, there was a limit to the amount and levels of monsters he could gather. He enjoyed observing how people fought against adversities and lately often thought about wanting to cause something more spectacular.</p>
<p>“I must admit, that is quite the enthralling proposal.”</p>
<p>“I am truly happy to hear such words.”</p>
<p>“With my current gear, however, all I can procure are monsters such as the ones you broke through just now. To attack a hometown fortified by player defenses, their fighting power is severely lacking.”</p>
<p>Just based on the level, as soon as advanced players joined in the fray, the assault would be quelled in no time. It was also clear by how easily Gargalla stomped through the monster horde earlier.</p>
<p>“The only reason for that, though, is item quality. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I’m not sure how you know that, but yes, you are correct. Just as average iron cannot create Ancient-grade weapons, high-grade items are necessary in order to produce good results. Well, quite obvious, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Some low-grade items were sometimes necessary, in a “secret trick” sort of way, but generally if one wished to have rare gear and skills, equally precious materials or items were needed. Those, however, were extremely rare and difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We have come to meet you precisely because there is something we would like you to take a look at.”</p>
<p>Vlad flashed a very confident smile to Hameln. It was meant to show friendliness and affability, but Hameln simply found it very suspicious.</p>
<p>“What will you do after making me cause a monster attack? It depends on the town too, but I’m sure you are aware that most of them are heavily fortified and defended.”</p>
<p>“We know, to an extent, what the conditions for the start of a monster invasion event are. Mr. Hameln, we wish for you take part in it and take control of the monsters.”</p>
<p>Hameln’s eyes narrowed. Using monsters to attack cities was something he was very interested in too.</p>
<p>Many players theorized about the conditions for the creation of such events, hoping to defend their bases better, but they had not been fully revealed.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am more interested in these conditions than the items…but I suppose I will not ask. I would like to know your goals though. Some are interested in the invasion itself, but you two do not look like you would care for that.”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, our goals are different. Well, we both have different ones, actually.”</p>
<p>PKs using invasion events to hunt for players rarely shared common goals. What they had were only their respective desires.</p>
<p>For Vlad, it was the desire of getting rid of the “player trash” around Shin.</p>
<p>For Gargalla, it was the desire of dueling strong players to the death.</p>
<p>Some just wanted to go on a rampage, while others still treated the current situation as a game, engaging in very dangerous endeavors.</p>
<p>“I see. I used to think of myself as someone pretty strange, but I see that I have good company.”</p>
<p>Hameln spoke without breaking his smile.</p>
<p>“It is quite normal to use whatever means possible in order to achieve one’s goal. Is it not?”</p>
<p>“It’s what they call being loyal to your desires for me.”</p>
<p>Neither one of the three cared in the slightest about the possible victims. Even while thinking that the other two were abnormal people, they could keep cooperating. Likely because they did not have any interest in each other.</p>
<p>“That’s good enough. Unleashing a monster attack on a town where a High Human resides sounds quite appealing. So, about the items and the day of execution?”</p>
<p>“It will depend on your monsters. How much time do you need to gather them?”</p>
<p>Vlad inquired as he handed the item he had brought to Hameln.</p>
<p>“With this item, I certainly should be able to gather monsters of a relatively high level. I would need about one week.”</p>
<p>Hameln made his decision after observing the item given to him, the 『Putrefaction Nectar』. The 『Putrefaction Nectar』 was dropped by Queen Rafflesia, a Trent-type advanced monster. Queen Rafflesias were monsters of considerably high levels in the 800-850 range and attacked in circular patterns using their roots and vines.</p>
<p>Huge flowers, roots and vines attacking in waves, branches lashing from the stem. It was difficult to decide whether it was a flower or a tree, but on the other hand it was undoubtedly a level 3 monster that players needed extensive skill to defeat.</p>
<p>The 『Putrefaction Nectar』 could be used to create the 『Tempting Beeswax』 and 『Hungry Beast Ambrosia』 items using a Tamer skill. The former allowed one to temporarily control monsters, while the latter, once materialized, allowed one to attract monsters up to level 700.</p>
<p>“One week, is it. Can we set it for 10 days from now then? Even if we know the conditions, we cannot just do it anytime we want.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Hameln nodded while pondering what could be involved in these conditions. There was too little known information, though, preventing him from reaching any conclusion.</p>
<p>“You are interested in the conditions, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, but I suppose it is better not to ask.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, we came to you to seek your cooperation, after all. Telling you won’t be a problem.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You would reveal it so easily?”</p>
<p>Hameln thought it to be very important information and was puzzled to see Vlad agreeing to talk about it so easily.</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem. It’s just a matter of time until they are found…no, I should say that while they are not made public, some players already found out.”</p>
<p>After this premise, Vlad started talking.</p>
<p>The monster invasion event creation condition, as far as Vlad knew, was either that the number of players in a town, or the number of players going outside from a Hometown, had to exceed a certain value.</p>
<p>The more players that were in a town, the greater the event manifestation probability, as well as monster numbers and levels would increase.</p>
<p>The progress of the dungeon clearing had spread the players wide, so the first condition had become difficult to fulfill, thus decreasing monster invasion events. When they manifested, it was always because of the latter condition.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see. I can understand the first, but the second seems rather difficult to find to me. Did you find the answer on a stone inscription maybe?”</p>
<p>When game events ended, stone inscriptions with their creation conditions appeared as unique items. Some recurring events, like monster invasions, were exceptions to this rule, but from Vlad’s explanation Hameln supposed that it was the reason.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is exactly as you guessed. It seems that it is dropped rarely, in areas seldom frequented by players. ”</p>
<p>“Not even major guilds are aware?”</p>
<p>“Those, other than us, in charge of large numbers of people…like prominent members in major guilds probably know already. The stone inscriptions do not come in singles after all. With many people the probability of finding them rises as well. We too are employing spies to prevent information leaks, but there is no way of absolutely preventing information from spreading, thus I suppose it is better to consider it to be already known. Even if it was, there might be several reasons why such information is not revealed at large.”</p>
<p>Knowing the conditions could have made it possible to prevent the event from manifesting. But no guilds had ever shown such intentions, nor was such information ever revealed publicly. At most, there were some unreliable rumors, nothing else.</p>
<p>Major guilds had their own philosophy. This is what Hameln gleaned from Vlad’s words.</p>
<p>“Hehe, humans are truly never boring. Yes, I shall lend you my help. A large-scale monster invasion in a hometown, used by PKs to infiltrate the town. I do feel like I am going to see something unprecedented.”</p>

<p>Just imagining it all was beyond exciting. Noticing that Vlad and Gargalla were grinning just like he was, Hameln’s smile widened.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>A few days after their meeting with Hameln, Vlad and Gargalla went to visit Aldo.</p>
<p>Aldo’s home was located in Kalkia; it had not been just a coincidence for Robin to meet Shin on the latter’s way back from the orphanage.</p>
<p>“We’re going to see that guy again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because thanks to the items Shin gave us, another dungeon has been cleared. After all, that too is one of our accomplishments.”</p>
<p>“Even if Shin didn’t do it himself? Will the man really accept this?”</p>
<p>“He will. These kind of people just love to interpret things in the way most benefiting to them.”</p>
<p>It’s just hilarious how ridiculously dumb they are. After adding this comment, Vlad knocked on Aldo’s door.</p>
<p>Aldo’s home, located in what could be called a quiet, luxurious neighborhood, was a mansion that towered above even the other high-end homes of the area.</p>
<p>The same maid NPC that had welcomed them last time appeared. Aldo seemed to be at home; soon after the maid went to report their arrival, they were allowed inside.</p>
<p>“Any developments?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Just a few days ago, we have obtained his cooperation and another dungeon has already been cleared. As proof, there is the public statement from the Savage Lions, one of the guilds which was already involved in the clearing.”</p>
<p>“Oh oh, you surely produce results quickly. Unlike that Robin.”</p>
<p>Aldo was alone in his home. Vlad had planned to just take his reward and leave the rest for a time when Robin was not present, but now decided to take the chance to do it all, grinning deeper.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Thus, I must ask…knowing full well that this might sound impudent, I would like to receive the promised reward. I promise, of course, to continue pouring every last effort into dungeon clearing.”</p>
<p>“So be it. You showed results, I suppose you deserve compensation.”</p>
<p>With an arrogant attitude, Aldo took a bunch of cards from his item box and flung them at Vlad.</p>
<p>Vlad barely managed to catch the flying cards. The cards’ holder name had been erased, so they did not bounce away when he caught them.</p>
<p>Looking at their names, Vlad was very surprised.</p>
<p>“『Excalibur』, First Rate Potions and Ethers? These would be worth a fair amount of money. Are you sure you can give them to us?”</p>
<p>Vlad had gathered information about Aldo, but would have never thought that he would give Ancient-grade weapons away.</p>
<p>“Even in heaps, this world’s currency is worthless. I have too many of those items too. Use them well.”</p>
<p>Aldo could not see what there was to be surprised about and Vlad thanked him with a wry chuckle. This man really did not understand anything.</p>
<p>“We shall strive to do our utmost. By the way, I do not see Mr. Robin anywhere. Is he at work?”</p>
<p>“What is your business with that useless fool?”</p>
<p>“Well, as he apparently hasn’t produced results yet, I was thinking of having him help us.”</p>
<p>“What could a man who can’t even call someone even do?”</p>
<p>Aldo’s lack of any expectations from Robin was evident.</p>
<p>“I heard that he has contacted Shin, but has been refused. As an apology, I was thinking of having him approach the man again. Not for a cooperation request from the clearing team, but because the life of someone dear is in danger. That would surely spur him to clear dungeons even faster. Things would become much easier for us too if he was mentally cornered enough to get rid of his hesitations.”</p>
<p>Vlad explained his plan of using Robin to further press Shin, without his smile ever leaving his lips.</p>
<p>“Hah, you’re some villain.”</p>
<p>“My deepest gratitude for such praise.”</p>
<p>“That works for me. His uselessness has started to become unbearable after all. Do as you please.”</p>
<p>Aldo mercilessly cut off Robin, as if ordering a broken tool to be disposed of.</p>
<p>Witnessing such a display of humans being objectified, Vlad thought that this man must be seriously mentally cornered, and put away the other lines he had prepared to convince him.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Then I shall start preparations immediately.”</p>
<p>After expressing their thanks to Aldo, the two returned to the hometown.</p>
<p>“Are we going to wait for that Hood guy now?”</p>
<p>Gargalla, who had not spoken a word during the meeting, finally talked to Vlad with a tone full of despise.</p>
<p>“Yes. He should be at his limits, so we have to make sure he acts on the designed day. I am sure he is desperate himself, so I don’t think it will be difficult.”</p>
<p>“Amazing how you get all these ideas though. I have it easy since all I have to do is watch, but it’s a pain for sure.”</p>
<p>“Despite that, you are quite helpful.”</p>
<p>“If your plan works out, I can fight him going all out, that’s why. If you fail, I’ll crush you, end of story.”</p>
<p>Gargalla clearly stated that his reason for cooperation was only their common goal.</p>
<p>Vlad responded by looking at Gargalla with a somewhat bored annoyance.</p>
<p>“You cooperate because we share the same goal, I know that already. But there is one thing I must say.”</p>
<p>“What’s that now?”</p>
<p>Gargalla snapped back and Vlad looked at him again, this time with a stone-like expressionless face.</p>
<p>“If he goes all out on you, you’re going to die, you know?”</p>
<p>Vlad expressed his, albeit twisted, absolute trust in Shin and his abilities.</p>
<p>If the plan succeeds Shin will likely come to kill the perpetrators, Vlad and Gargalla, without hesitation. That eliminated any chance of Gargalla winning.</p>
<p>“I’ll be trying to kill him. Nothing strange about getting killed.”</p>
<p>Gargalla smiled broadly, expressing how he would enjoy that too.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 2 – Part 2</p>
<p>The day before Vlad’s meeting with Hameln, Robin wandered aimlessly through Kalkia at dusk as Aldo’s words continuously echoed in his mind.</p>
<p><i>If you can’t produce any results, you’re fired.</i></p>
<p>It was something Aldo could do. After all, Robin had witnessed it in the past.</p>
<p>Despite that, Robin didn’t do anything for the man about to be fired. He could not do anything, afraid he too would meet the same fate.</p>
<p><i>When the times comes for me to be fired, no one will mourn for me, just like that time</i>, Robin thought.</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Robin.”</p>
<p>“….Who are you?”</p>
<p>Robin had been walking with his gaze down, in desperation. A man’s sudden approach made him suspicious.</p>
<p>“My name is Vlad. I was actually requested by Mr. Aldo to urge a player named Shin to quicken his dungeon clearing. I learned that you were given instructions to do the same thing, so I was thinking that we could work together.”</p>
<p>Vlad explained the situation in a polite, courteous tone.</p>
<p>Maybe Vlad too was an employee of the same company? Robin briefly pondered over this, but he didn’t want to think about it any deeper.</p>
<p>“You too…terrible, isn’t it…?”</p>
<p>It was really terrible. How many times he had wondered,<i>if only my boss wasn’t someone like that…</i></p>
<p>“You seem quite distressed, is something the matter? You do not appear to be affected by status ailments, though.”</p>
<p>Despite Vlad’s worried question, Robin turned and walked away.</p>
<p>“…Please, leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do. You’ll be discarded like this, you know? Here and in reality as well.”</p>
<p>Robin abruptly turned around.</p>
<p>“Have you come to laugh at my misery!?”</p>
<p>His honest feelings erupted out. His voice was louder than expected.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not. In fact, I truly respect you for what you must have been through until now. I have a proposal, Mr. Robin, so would you hear me out? If you accept, I can erase the source of your troubles and dispel your worries, you know?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>It took a moment for Robin to understand what Vlad meant.</p>
<p>Erase the source of his troubles.</p>
<p>That meant—</p>
<p>“You’ll kill him for me?”</p>
<p>Robin’s words clearly included a hint of hope.</p>
<p>“No, but…he’s strong. His avatar contains a cheat, coded in by management…most of his stats are over 800. His equipment is full of Ancient-grade gear too, stuff that you rarely get even if you pay. There is also barely any chance to kill him since he is always cooped up at home…”</p>
<p>“There is…a chance.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Vlad put a hand on Robin’s shoulder and whispered something into his ear. Robin stood still for several seconds.</p>
<p>“If you help me, I will erase him without fail. One of my comrades is in the same class as he is, you know. Excluding differences in stats, a greenhorn with a strong avatar is no match for someone who has actually fought in this world. You understand, don’t you? I heard that he doesn’t even remember all of his skills, right?”</p>
<p>“…yes, that’s right. He hasn’t even fought properly here.”</p>
<p>He can kill? That man?</p>
<p>Without Aldo around, Robin would not be forced to pester Shin. There was no need to kowtow to anyone. No need to run errands for others. No need to be mocked for playing a game. To run around everywhere looking for items. To venture into dangerous areas. To be avoided by the players working at the frontlines to clear dungeons.</p>
<p>If they returned to reality, Robin would surely be fired if Aldo was around. He would be fired without a just cause, so he would not receive any retirement bonus either.</p>
<p>“If so…”</p>
<p>“What do you think? Isn’t it an attractive proposal?”</p>
<p>Vlad’s voice easily slipped into his ears.</p>
<p>Attractive. Yes, it was very attractive. Even if it was a demon’s whisper.</p>
<p>“…what do you need from me?”</p>
<p>“Hehe. Just something, yes, something very simple.”</p>
<p>Vlad’s lips emitted a clear, bright laugh.</p>
<p>His smile was evil in a way Robin had never seen in his life.</p>
<p>“I want you to do just one thing. If you can do just that, my comrades and I will handle the rest.”</p>
<p>Smiling throughout, Vlad told Robin what he wanted him to do.</p>
<p>“That’s—-”</p>
<p>Robin was shaken by what Vlad told him.</p>
<p>“One person will be erased. What, you thought you could keep your hands clean?”</p>
<p>“But…that’s…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. You just have to bring them. There is no need to hurt the child. I’ll say it again, you just have to bring them. That will be enough.”</p>
<p>Vlad’s gentle voice continued.</p>
<p>“My comrades and I will do everything. You simply have to call one person. Is that a sin? The person you call will just walk into something unfortunate. We will be the ones to act. You will share none of the blame.”</p>
<p>“I’m…not to…blame..?”</p>
<p>A false pardon.</p>
<p>Robin did not want to look at reality. He did not express his doubts.</p>
<p>“Yes. You wish to return to the real world, free of concerns, right? You wish to meet your family, don’t you? Won’t you help us then, just a little?”</p>
<p><i>I want to see my family.</i></p>
<p>That thought made him decide.</p>
<p>For the current Robin, nothing except his family really mattered.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>The morning following the night Shin slept while embracing Marino. Shin woke up feeling someone wiggling in his arms.</p>
<p>“…..ah.”</p>
<p>As he opened his eyes, Shin found Marino’s face right before his, at breathing distance.</p>
<p>Noticing that Shin was awake, she tried to retreat.</p>
<p>Before she could, though, Shin’s arms moved. He hugged Marino tightly before she could jump out of the covers. Holding the back of her head, he pulled her towards him.</p>
<p>“Eeh!? Hey, wait, mmhn!?”</p>
<p>Without letting her resist, Shin went in for a kiss. After a moment, Marino stopped resisting.</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>After the kiss, Marino seemed to lose all of her energy and just stared into space. Seeing her so defenseless, Shin thought to play a prank on the girl, but she returned to her senses before he had a chance to do so.</p>
<p>“W-Whuat are you doing, all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Marino was not only stuttering but also out of breath, her cheeks flushing red.</p>
<p>“What? You wanted to kiss, right? So badly that you tried it while I was sleeping.”</p>
<p>“W-Well, that’s true, but…it couldn’t be helped! I was looking at you sleep and couldn’t hold back.”</p>
<p>Marino spoke while poking Shin’s chest. Shin, on the other hand, couldn’t stop grinning.</p>
<p>“No problem then. At least none for me. Rather, you can continue. Snuggle all you want.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough!!”</p>
<p>Shin opened his arms to encourage her, but Marino scampered out of the room. Shin lay down again, thinking that he probably teased her too much.</p>
<p>What Marino had said the night before about her illness was on his mind.</p>
<p>In reality, they were probably sleeping in a hospital bed. If anything happened, the doctors and nurses would likely come running. Marino was already sick, so she would be assisted even more.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what continuously sleeping could do to the body. It was possible that Marino’s life expectancy was constantly shortening. Thinking about it, he felt an urge to immediately look for a new area and clear it.</p>
<p>“….calm down. Rushing ahead without thinking is the worst choice in a dungeon.”</p>
<p>Shin jumped up from the bed and took a deep breath. Even during the game, he had sometimes picked the wrong skill and died just before clearing a dungeon. In this world, that would be utterly reckless to do.</p>
<p>Shin reprimanded himself not to lose his cool, but he couldn’t help feeling restless. The life of the first person he had ever loved was at stake. He could not manage to stay completely calm.</p>
<p>Then, he heard someone knock. As Shin responded, the door opened a little.</p>
<p>“Breakfast is ready.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m coming.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized to the still blushing Marino and stood up. When he passed by her, he stroked her hair without thinking.</p>
<p>“Ehm, what?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, just felt like stroking your hair.”</p>
<p>“….that’s fine, then.”</p>
<p>Marino looked embarrassed but also a little happy.</p>
<p>Looking at her, Shin felt his restlessness dissipate.</p>
<p>(I have to make it in time.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, his drive was even stronger.</p>
<p><i>I will return alive with Marino</i>. Such emotions burned brightly within Shin’s heart.</p>
<p>The heart could influence the body. Even though Shin’s body was supposed to be mere data, he now felt pumped and full of energy as if it had been strengthened.</p>
<p>“H-Haven’t you had enough? You’re patting me too much!”</p>
<p>“Hey, it feels really good to touch, so…”</p>
<p>He felt uneasy, but also stronger, thanks to her.</p>
<p>He could only do everything in his power now.</p>
<p>“Ok then, time for breakfast!”</p>
<p>“Hey! Don’t go off by yourself!”</p>
<p>Shin laughed wryly as Marino hurried after him.</p>

<p>“OK, shall we go? …is what I want to say, but…”</p>
<p>“Meow? What’s wrong, meow?”</p>
<p>Shin’s words elicited a response from an all-too-sweet female voice.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Shin was all ready to go to a dungeon, but he wasn’t alone; Catnip was standing next to him. She was wearing her cat ears maid costume, just like she did at the shop.</p>
<p>The only difference from her normal shop attire was the Baghnakhs equipped on her hands. Because of Catnip’s appearance, these platinum gray-colored claws looked just like a cat’s. Their grade was middle Mythology, their completely not cute name being 『Stray Cat Fever』.</p>
<p>“So, what’s with the getup?”</p>
<p>“Shimeow, you’re going to a new dungeon, meow? I want to come with you, meow!”</p>
<p>As players unlocked new areas, they would be the first to add those locations to their maps. As some time had already elapsed since Shin had liberated this area, a good degree of additional exploration had already occurred.</p>
<p>Since Shin hadn’t completely explored the area he had unlocked, he had to fill in his map with information purchased from information brokers. Using information provided by those players who had fully explored the region, Shin had a completely updated map of the area.</p>
<p>“Er, yes I am going, but…were you waiting for me all this time?”</p>
<p>The daily activities of players varied depending on their mood. Shin was proactive in clearing areas, but even he would not visit them every day. Even if one waited beside the teleport point, there was no guarantee of meeting.</p>
<p>“Marimeow told me. She said that you’d definitely go to a dungeon, so I’ve been waiting since this morning, meow.”</p>
<p>Marino had completely seen through Shin’s intentions.</p>
<p>“You keep saying things like that, and your fanclub will start sending assassins after me…”</p>
<p>“Hehe, meow! No blushing, meow!”</p>
<p>“I’m honestly not joking, you know?”</p>
<p>Shin subtly tried to make Catnip aware of the presence of the fanclub members behind her, but to no avail. Was it on purpose or was this just how she was? Catnip was smiling broadly, but Shin couldn’t help feeling tense.</p>
<p>“….ok, setting aside whether or not we are going together for a moment, why are you the only one here? What happened to your usual party members? They wouldn’t like to know that you are coming with me by yourself, which is frankly quite scary too.”</p>
<p>“Ah…actually, when they went looking for ingredients the other day, they were attacked by PKs, meow.”</p>
<p>As far as Shin knew, Catnip’s area for collecting ingredients was close to the hometown. It would have been a big risk for the PKs too.</p>
<p>Shin remembered what he had heard from the grocery stand owner; PKs had started becoming more active lately.</p>
<p>The other people in the store did not seem to notice, but Shin switched to chat and relayed this information to Catnip.</p>
<p>“(Sorry, meow…I got a little scared. But like I said now, I’m going to avoid going outside as much as possible now. But if I do that, we’ll run out of ingredients, meow…so please let me come with you. Think of it as helping me out, meow.)”</p>
<p>“(If that’s the reason, no problem at all.)”</p>
<p>Exploring areas was not necessarily any less dangerous than venturing into dungeons, but considering the known monsters’ levels and the field’s conditions, there would be no problems in bringing Catnip along.</p>
<p>Shin, too, had not always explored alone, even after the death game started.</p>
<p>The only problem could be that Shin and Catnip had different goals.</p>
<p>“(I mainly explore unmapped areas, though. You’re going to collect ingredients, right? Wouldn’t it be prudent to go with some other players?)”</p>
<p>“(Not really, meow. In the unmapped area now, there is a place I used to frequent before the death game, meow. I’m not sure how it’s changed neow, but I might be able to find the items I’m looking for there, meow.)”</p>
<p>If the area was as she remembered, Catnip’s knowledge would surely help Shin. If the area had changed, they would simply proceed as in exploring a normal unmapped area.</p>
<p>“(Anyway, staying by your side is the safest route, meow. With your support characters, you could flip any boss on their backs, meow.)”</p>
<p>“(Why would I even flip them on their backs!? Well yes, I suppose I could protect you without a problem, but…)”</p>
<p>Catnip was an advanced player herself; she wouldn’t just be riding Shin’s coattails.</p>
<p>“(Your store is an oasis for all players after all. I’d be happy to contribute too. OK, I was thinking of leaving right now, what will you do?)”</p>
<p>“(I can go anytime too, meow. The party members know already, so no worries, meow)”</p>
<p>Shin nodded, albeit wondering if they were really convinced of Catnip’s need to accompany Shin alone.</p>
<p>Being seen teleporting together would surely spark a never-ending series of trouble, so Shin said that he would wait at a specific place and teleported to Tsuki no Hokora first. They also decided on a time, to avoid missing each other.</p>
<p>In Tsuki no Hokora, Shin added four of his five support characters to the party.</p>
<p>High Lord Filma and High Dragnil Shibaid in the front, High Elf Schnee as mobile unit. Lastly, the High Pixie Sety in the rear. Girard possessed a fighting style similar to Catnip, so Shin decided to let him hold the fort this time.</p>
<p>After checking the members’ equipment and items, Shin set the AI strategy to focus on defense. The AI could not make complicated decisions like players would, so this setting was for insurance.</p>
<p>“As long as I make sure our HP doesn’t go below a certain level and they support us, we should be OK. All frontline members can use taunt skills too.”</p>
<p>If necessary, Shin would have his support characters use their aggro-gathering skills and act as decoys while he and Catnip would flee. That was one reason to bring them along. Shin had never used this strategy before, but many players were saved because they used it</p>
<p>He had no intention of stepping in overly dangerous areas, but anything could happen in an unmapped zone or dungeon. One could never be too safe.</p>
<p>“OK, It’s about time.”</p>
<p>Shin went again to the hometown, then teleported to the area for the exploration.</p>
<p>The teleport point reminded him of a stone cathedral, it was an orthodox type. In order to avoid inconveniencing the other players, Shin waited for Catnip a short distance away.</p>
<p>About 5 minutes later, exactly at the specified time, Catnip teleported in.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait, meow.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t wait long, really. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin and Catnip headed towards an unmapped zone. The thick woodland area outside the teleport point made it difficult to observe one’s surroundings. Shin decided to have Schnee go on ahead to scout the road as they proceeded.</p>
<p>“How is it? We just arrived, but is it as you remember?”</p>
<p>Shin asked while checking his detection skills.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell yet, meow. But the atmosphere of this woodland is the same, meow.”</p>
<p>The cathedral-like teleport point was exactly the same as she remembered, Catnip added.</p>
<p>“….Schnee has already found monsters. A level 388 Sneak Boar. That’s exactly the type you mentioned, Catnip. This info hasn’t been released to the public yet.”</p>
<p>Shin checked the information received from Schnee through the menu. Information about monsters appearing in unmapped areas was publicly available, but the Sneak Boar was not listed in it.</p>
<p>“Really, meow? But I knew about that, meow. It’s a rare monster that’s not found easily, meow.”</p>
<p>“I see we can expect great things from you, miss Catnip.”</p>
<p>Overconfidence was a taboo, but knowing what monsters could appear would let them prepare with suitable countermeasures.</p>
<p>“I hope the monster I’m looking for comes up too, meow.”</p>
<p>Shin ambushed the Sneak Boar, quickly felled it, and checked the item dropped.</p>
<p>Catnip was looking for Sugar Unicorns, monster that dropped sweet-type items.</p>
<p>If she could find some she could make new creations for her store, so Catnip eagerly searched for the monster.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, you did say that you would have become a pastry chef if you hadn’t become an idol, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup, meow. I think it’s nice to have a lot of dreams. I’m also doing my best, meow.”</p>
<p>Catnip flexed her muscles, a proud look on her face. She was probably trying to show her biceps, but her thin arms just made her pose look cute.</p>
<p>“What about you, Shimeow? Is there something you want to do, meow?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, well…I’m in university now, but I’m not exactly striving for this one thing I want to do…I like games, but if I was asked if I wanted to make one, I’d probably say no…”</p>
<p>“I see, meow. What about Marimeow? Has she ever talked of such things?”</p>
<p>“Ah…..well, Marino…”</p>
<p>“I know about her disease, meow.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Shin was not sure how to reply. Catnip surprised him and said something unexpected. Shin was so stunned that he froze for an instant.</p>
<p>“Only people very close to her know, meow. As far as I know, only I, Holmeow and Milmeow know about it.”</p>
<p>More people knew about Marino’s condition than Shin expected. Incidentally, Holmeow was Holly, but Shin didn’t know who Milmeow was.</p>
<p>“I just heard about it recently, though.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be helped, meow. Some things are difficult to say to those truly dear to you, meow. Marimeow was really worried, thinking about if and how to tell you.”</p>
<p>Some things were easier to say to other girls or adults. Catnip added this conclusion.</p>
<p>“Really.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, meow. Shimeow, not being the first shocked you, meow?”</p>
<p>“Gh, right where it hurts…”</p>
<p>“But not telling was the right choice, meow. If you knew right away, you would have rushed in the dungeons without thinking about your safety, meow.”</p>
<p>Catnip looked straight at Shin, not smiling anymore.</p>
<p>“….I can’t deny that.”</p>
<p>Players were now used to the situation and could retain a certain calm in their hearts. But that was not the case in the early stages of the death game. Obsessed about returning to reality, some players relentlessly urged Shin to clear the dungeons.</p>
<p>Thinking back on that period, Shin realized that Catnip’s guess would very likely have turned true.</p>
<p>“Things were really hectic then.”</p>
<p>“Yup, meow. When I opened my shop, some told me that I was being disrespectful, meow.”</p>
<p>Doing things unrelated to going back was “evil”. Such a mood reigned over the players at the time.</p>
<p>“Few say that now, though. A few days ago I had someone come up to me and say it…but he had his company’s boss here, who keeps nagging him about that. Looked like he had it pretty tough.”</p>
<p>“The people that rely on others without doing anything themselves either shut themselves in their homes or just wait, meow. But having company relations reflected in-game is just the worst, meow…”</p>
<p>Shin had no intention of answering to the summon, but felt compassion towards Robin’s situation. After hearing about the man’s circumstances, Catnip’s expression turned sour.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Catnip, there’s a monster pack ahead.”</p>
<p>Trying to return the conversation to the right track, Shin opened the menu and saw a message about the appearance of a monster pack, composed of 4 units. Maybe thanks to Catnip’s earnest wishing, it was a pack of Sugar Unicorns.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to your new creations, Catnip.”</p>
<p>“Meow!? Did you find them, meow?”</p>
<p>“They’re 4 in all. Let’s catch them all.”</p>
<p>Shin ordered Schnee to standby and changed equipment in order to boost item drops.</p>
<p>The card he pulled out changed to a black bow with thunder-like decorations. It was the Ancient-grade longbow 『Surging Thunder Bow』. Its shots consumed MP, and one could adjust the attack power by regulating how many MP were consumed.</p>
<p>The finely crafted arrows were imbued with lightning, the target hit had a high of probability of being subjected with the Hi-Paralyze status.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop their movements. You give the final blow, Catnip.”</p>
<p>“Leave’em to me, meow.”</p>
<p>Shin ordered the support characters not to interfere and prepared to fire 『Surging Thunder Bow』.</p>
<p>A half-transparent blue line appeared in his line of sight; it was a support function for aiming.</p>
<p>Then, Shin activated the Bow-type Martial skill 【Multi Arrow】. Blue lines stretched towards each of the 4 Sugar Unicorns.</p>
<p>As Shin released the bowstring, lightning-like arrows zig-zagged through the trees, towards their targets. Splitting in midair, they all cleanly struck the monsters.</p>
<p>Without wasting time, Catnip jumped towards the collapsing monsters.</p>
<p>The 『Stray Cat Fever』 Catnip equipped emitted an orange glow.</p>
<p>“【Greedy Claw】, meow!”</p>
<p>Orange-colored arc-like effects extended from 『Stray Cat Fever』’s four claws.</p>
<p>Unable to dodge, the Sugar Unicorns were crushed by Catnip’s 4-hit consecutive attack and vanished.</p>
<p>“Item drop increase, meow!”</p>
<p>Catnip’s words confirmed that 【Greedy Claw】’s effect had activated.</p>
<p>Most weapons had skills with Greedy in their names, which had the chance of increasing item drops from defeated enemies.</p>
<p>“Looking good, meow!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Hopefully we can find the dungeon too.”</p>
<p>The duo continued to explore the area’s unmapped parts. They met monster packs several more times after the Sugar Unicorns.</p>
<p>“Shimeow, isn’t there something strange here?”</p>
<p>“You’re right. The monster encounter rate is too high.”</p>
<p>After the game had become VR-compatible, a too large number of monsters would be impossible for players to deal with, so the number of monsters appearing in a designated area had been reduced. Because of this, it was rare to encounter several monster units in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>“Could it be an event, meow?”</p>
<p>“There was no announcement, though. I would understand if they were bug-types, but…”</p>
<p>Bug-based monsters like ants and bees would appear in great numbers close to their nests. But the monsters Shin’s party had been fighting were mostly animal or human-like.</p>
<p>“I have a bad feeling about this. It’s dangerous to go on when we don’t know what could happen. Let’s go back for now.”</p>
<p>“Agreed, meow.”</p>
<p>As they turned back, carefully checking monster presence in the surroundings, Shin’s map showed a player icon.</p>
<p>“Catnip, stay alert. There’s a player coming this way.”</p>
<p>“I see it on my map too, meow. They’re alone, meow?”</p>
<p> A single icon was heading towards them. It proceeded straight on, ignoring the monsters around it.</p>
<p>It was probably using a concealment-type skill or item. Shin prepared for a confrontation and switched weapons to his 『True Moon』.</p>
<p>“My my, I am sorry, did I make you wait?”</p>
<p>After about 1 minute, a player appeared before Shin.</p>
<p>It was a young man with gray-silver hair and dark purple eyes. His waist-length hair was tied behind his neck. He talked to Shin with a pleasant expression and an innocent smile.</p>
<p>——-Hameln – Level 255 – Tamer</p>
<p>Shin’s 【Analyze】 saw through the concealment skill and revealed the man’s name.</p>
<p>“Do you have business with us?”</p>
<p>Shin asked the question while keeping a hand on 『True Moon』’s hilt. He also commanded Schnee and the others to be ready to battle.</p>
<p>Hameln was infamous for being a MPK – a PK that used monsters. He was said to possess very high stats.</p>
<p>During a guild’s PK extermination in the past, it was said that he had killed the whole group of players that had come to hunt him down. It would be foolish not to be cautious when such a person appeared.</p>
<p>“Oh, I would have never thought of seeing you in these parts, so I came to give you some advice, being the worrywart I am.”</p>
<p>“Advice?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Right now, groups of monsters are advancing towards all hometowns, to invade them. Trouble could arise if you don’t go back right now, you know?”</p>
<p>Shin and Catnip’s faces grew very tense due to the unexpected information. But if something like that was to happen, it would have been announced.</p>
<p>“….despite that, I haven’t heard anything from my acquaintances.”</p>
<p>Even saying so, Shin felt that it was more likely to be not a bluff, but the truth.</p>
<p>Hameln was a MPK, a specialist in gathering monsters. Shin knew about Tamer skills to an extent, but not completely. It was plausible enough that Hameln could orchestrate a mock invasion event with items or skills that Shin didn’t know about.</p>
<p>“The chaos and panic prevented them from contacting you, I suppose. A short while before the invasion started, some PKs have been rampaging within major guilds, you see. Haha, I too wish to go see if the defense lines will hold this time.”</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me this?”</p>
<p>“I’m interested in seeing how you will act. Whether you will defend the town, go hunt the PKs, or prioritize your loved ones’ safety. Which will you choose, sir hero?”</p>
<p>With the same innocent smile, Hameln asked his question to Shin.</p>
<p>“Shin, I’ll handle Hameln, you go back to the hometown!”</p>
<p>“Catnip?”</p>
<p>Catnip dropped her cat-like speech and urged Shin to return quickly, while glaring at Hameln.</p>
<p>“This guy always comes out after things have already started happening. He wouldn’t lie about the invasion, Kalkia’s already under attack!!”</p>
<p>“But even so—”</p>
<p>“This is not a normal event!! There’s Marino in Kalkia. The orphanage’s kids too. Set your priorities straight!!”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t say anything back.</p>
<p>He can’t protect everything. If he doesn’t focus on what he really wants to protect, he risks losing everything.</p>
<p>That was something Shin learned during the death game.</p>
<p>“(—-I’ll leave Schnee and the others here. Use them as decoy if necessary.)”</p>
<p>Shin related this to Catnip via chat, to not let Hameln hear, and poured MP into a crystal. Thanks to its effect of transporting the player to the nearest teleport point, Shin vanished.</p>
<p>“Hmm, he prioritized his loved ones, as expected. Well, this is entertaining too.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t try to stop him? Must be feeling very confident.”</p>
<p>Catnip, in her fighting stance, asked the question to the pondering Hameln, his chin resting on his hand.</p>
<p>“Dear, I do not have the slightest intention of doing anything to you either. I like Lucky Cat’s sweets too, after all.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get in the way of business then!”</p>
<p>Catnip kicked the ground and closed in on Hameln, swinging her claws. Hameln stopped her wind-slicing strike with his stick.</p>
<p>“My apologies. Watching people fight against absurd situations is what entertains me the most, you see.”</p>
<p>“Sicko!”</p>
<p>Continuous blows from both hands. Surprise strikes, kicks. Catnip’s relentless attacks were stopped by Hameln spinning his stick, sometimes parrying, sometimes deflecting, composure never leaving his face.</p>
<p>Pixies did not have exceptional STR or AGI, but Hameln possessed high stats thanks to the resurrection bonus, enough to bridge the stat gap between Pixies and Humans, Catnip’s race.</p>
<p>Catnip was not weak by any means, but the game system all too evidently expressed their difference in ability.</p>
<p>“Oops, I see that his support characters are on a whole other level. It would be a bit too tiring to face you all, thus I suppose I will take my leave. I came to replenish on items, after all. Let us meet again, then.”</p>
<p>Hameln used a summoned monster as a shield against Schnee’s attack from the rear and promptly left.</p>
<p>Catnip tried to chase him down, but was deterred by smokescreens and other summoned monsters. Schnee and the party, following Shin’s orders of protecting Catnip, did not follow Hameln but fought against the monsters.</p>
<p>“Please, make it in time…”</p>
<p>After defeating the monsters, Catnip headed to the teleport point with Schnee and the other support characters, praying.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 2 – Part 4</p>
<p>It happened just after Marino saw Shin off and started helping at the orphanage.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for making you accompany me.”</p>
<p>“No, escorting is one of our duties. Nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>As the person in charge had forgotten to stock up on ingredients, Marino brought Luca, who had begged to tag along, with her to town.</p>
<p>Being escorted by Shadow, Marino shopped around while holding hands with Luca. Though, the shopping itself did not take much time.</p>
<p>“Go for a walk! Walk!”</p>
<p>Walking outside the orphanage was thrilling for Luca. It also helped that Shadow had the good idea of taking a slightly longer route.</p>
<p>“(It would be nice to let the other kids go out too, other than when they help out with our jobs)”</p>
<p>“(That’s true. Most of the kids secretly play together outside anyway)”</p>
<p>Marino noted while chatting with Shadow that only the smaller children like Luca needed protection. Since there were so few of them now, it wouldn’t be too troublesome to organize supervised outings for them.</p>
<p>Just as Marino thought of inviting other children next time, the alarm signaling a monster invasion blared throughout Kalkia.</p>
<p>“Looks like monsters are coming. Let’s hurry back to the orphanage.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Luca, that’s all for today’s walk. Let’s go back to the orphanage before the scary monsters arrive, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The guilds are protecting the town.”</p>
<p>Marino tried talking as brightly as she could to comfort Luca, who was frightened by the alarm. All defenses, since the first failed monster repulsion, had succeeded. Thanks to such results, the nearby players were not too shaken.</p>
<p>“See, the people around us are also calm, right? Let’s go back to everyone now.”</p>
<p>Marino tried to walk as calmly as possible, so Luca would not panic. Even then, she had to periodically slow down at times after noticing her pace had started to quicken.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I would like a word with you…”</p>
<p>Then, as if aiming for that timing, Robin appeared.</p>
<p>Afraid of the slowly approaching Robin, Luca hid behind Marino.</p>
<p>“We’re in an emergency situation. Save that for later. ”</p>
<p>Shadow stood between Marino and Robin. He glared at Robin sternly, ready to react in case of any suspicious movements.</p>
<p>“I have no business with you. I came to talk with the young lady. Please stay out of this.”</p>
<p>“I refuse. There are monsters approaching the town right now. Everyone’s returning to their homes. Come again after the threat passes.”</p>
<p>Shadow spoke with a firmer tone. He would not allow any exceptions.</p>
<p>“I have to take the girl with me. You’re in the way!!”</p>
<p>Robin suddenly shouted, spread his mantle and threw a ball the size of a golf ball.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Without losing his cool, Shadow pierced the flying ball with a knife.</p>
<p>The ball was easily severed in two, emitting a large quantity of white smoke at the same time, making it impossible to see.</p>
<p>“Shadow!!”</p>
<p>“I’m alright, I can see. Please look after Luca.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Marino gripped Luca’s hand again. Being a seasoned fighter, Shadow would not be confused by a mere smokescreen. Or so Marino had assumed, when suddenly, a shadow appeared behind her.</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Marino quickly turned around, only to find a pair of glowing eyes just beyond the smoke. Judging by the height and size, they couldn’t belong to a player.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>Marino was standing there in a daze when Shadow’s scream of pain reached her ears. Looking in his direction, Marino saw something cut through the fog and blow Shadow away.</p>
<p>“Monsters!? The defenses have been breached!? Tch, I’ll hold them back here, take Luca and run!!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes!!”</p>
<p>Since Marino could not use 【Through Sight】, she was unable to see what was going on due to the smoke. However, hearing the sounds of clashing blades and seeing the light of the sparks through the smoke, she could guess.</p>
<p>Not much time had passed since the alarm was sounded, but one could hear screams and monster roars in the distance.</p>
<p>As the chat system was restricted during invasion events, Marino could not contact Shin for help.</p>
<p>“Marino…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Shadow is strong, he won’t lose to some monsters. It’s dangerous here, so let’s go back quickly.”</p>
<p>Marino beamed the best smile she could muster at Luca and started walking away. Luckily she found a building’s wall, so they could proceed along it to an area unclouded by the smoke.</p>
<p>“OK, we’re finally in the main stre—-!?”</p>
<p>After desperately running through the back alleys, they arrived in the large street Marino often passed.</p>
<p>What she saw there however, was a scenery completely different from the one she was used to.</p>
<p>“What is…this…”</p>
<p>Most of the stores and stalls that lined the street were engulfed in flames. The screams of fleeing people could be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Some buildings were partially destroyed due to the fighting, while the undamaged ones were struck by players being flung around.</p>
<p> “We have to get away…”</p>
<p>Borderline paralyzed, Marino’s body could move only because of the warmth coming from Luca’s hand.</p>
<p><i>I can’t let go of her hand. I have to protect her.</i></p>
<p>Such feelings supported her trembling knees.</p>
<p>“Just a little more, be patient dear.”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>Holding Luca’s hand, Marino continued walking along the walls, careful not to let the monsters spot her.</p>
<p>However, on a battlefield where monsters and players were engaged in furious battle, it was impossible to pass by unnoticed without stealth abilities.</p>
<p>A sudden explosion shook the building next to her; it had been caused by a 5-mels large dinosaur-like monster, which had smashed through the building to reach the main avenue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17071 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MarinoAndLuca.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>Marino instinctively protected Luca with her body.</p>
<p>Fragments of the destroyed building rained all around them. These fragments were of unknown materials and could have much more offensive power than one would expect. One of them, unfortunately, ended up striking Marino’s back.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>Thanks to an item she received from Shin, Marino’s HP did not decrease. But due to the difference in mass between Marino and the fragment that hit her, they both were flung into the air spinning across the ground several times before stopping.</p>
<p>“Lu…ca…”</p>
<p>Marino stood up right away and searched for Luca.</p>
<p>In this world, as long as an avatar still had HP left and was not affected by status conditions, even if struck by an attack that would normally cause a large wound, it could still move.</p>
<p>Marino looked at her surroundings and found Luca who, like her, was trying to stand back up.</p>
<p>It was too soon to feel relieved though.</p>
<p>Luca had already been caught by Robin, who had appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Marino thought she managed to lose him but Robin, who had a scouting-type job specialization, had easily tracked them. His expression was eerily cold and distant, ill suited considering the current situation, with monsters rampaging around town.</p>
<p>“You’ve made me waste enough time.”</p>
<p>“Why….?”</p>
<p>“You’re protected by Shin’s items. Because you won’t just follow me quietly, I had to resort to this, you know?”</p>
<p>His former polite speech was no more.</p>
<p>He had apparently discovered the fact that Marino had received a protective item from Shin.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want the girl to be hurt…you know what to do, right?”</p>
<p>“…yes. So let her go right now!!”</p>
<p>Marino removed the protective item and put it on the ground. Robin took the item and tied Marino up.</p>
<p>“Ma, Marino…”</p>
<p>The freed Luca, while afraid, stretched a hand towards Marino. But Robin had loaded Marino on his shoulders, far from Luca’s hands.</p>
<p>“I’m alright. Go back to the orphanage Luca!!”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Robin’s paralyzing poison robbed Marino of her ability to move.</p>
<p>Carrying Marino on his shoulders, Robin looked at Luca.</p>
<p>“Give Marino back.”</p>
<p>“If you want her back, tell the player called Shin to come to this place.”</p>
<p>Robin threw a small piece of paper to Luca.</p>
<p>Luca desperately lunged at the piece of paper, to prevent it from flying away. When she finally managed to grab it, Robin and Marino had already disappeared.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on here?!”</p>
<p>In front of the chaos of roaring monsters and screaming players, Aldo stood dazed and confused. As he rarely left his home, he had no idea why there were monsters rampaging in the town, nor why the players were taking damage. Actually, few players knew the town defense corps had been attacked by PKs and that non-event monsters had infiltrated the town.</p>
<p>“S-Shit!! What equipment should I use!?”</p>
<p>Thanks to his avatar’s abilities, Aldo could tell the monsters’ names and levels. With his high stats and powerful gear, it would not be too difficult for him to protect himself.</p>
<p>Due to his lack of knowledge of the game, however, he didn’t know what weapons or effects would be useful. It took him around 10 minutes to realize that the basic equipment of Arthur Pendragon, the basis for his avatar, was the strongest available.</p>
<p>When he finally finished equipping it and started thinking about what to do next, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>“Hyah!?”</p>
<p>His home’s ceiling suddenly collapsed. Something must have fallen on it. The booming sound and the falling debris made Aldo scream in surprise.</p>
<p>“Hey there. Still alive?”</p>
<p>“A person!? W-what? What are you doing, you bastard!?”</p>
<p>Realizing that the person speaking to him was one of the two visitors who had come to his home just a couple days before, Aldo forgot the terror he had just felt and furiously yelled at the man.</p>
<p>He had no idea what the man was thinking, but to think that he would do something so insane.</p>
<p>“What am I doing? What any other PK does, man.”</p>
<p>Paying little attention to the destruction, Gargalla walked closer to Aldo, a savage smile on his face.</p>
<p>“What are you saying?! What’s going on here?!”</p>
<p>“Hey now, are you for real? You didn’t see the monsters busting through town? You were holed up in your house in this situation? Just because you have 【Wall】 and 【Barrier】 up…man, you’re so done.”</p>
<p>While looking at the man with contempt, Gargalla lifted his main weapon, different from the one he had carried during his visits to Aldo’s home.</p>
<p>It was the lower Ancient-grade 『Giant Slayer』, a battleaxe with a black handle and flame-like patterns.</p>
<p>It was a weapon that increased in power the larger the difference in stats between the user and the target: a weapon designed to literally slay those greater than the user. The stronger the opponent was, the more powerful it became. However, because it did not work on those weaker than the user, it could easily lead to a disadvantage if it wasn’t used with attention.</p>
<p>For the current situation, however, there could be no better weapon.</p>
<p>Aldo, who was a total beginner with nothing but high stats going for himself, could never hope to match someone who, despite his stats being lower, had grown stronger through PvP battles.</p>
<p>“In order to get here, I had to deal with many persistent and hard-to-kill monsters, so I’m feeling damn stressed right now. Your avatar is better though, so I really hope you’ll let me have some fun!”</p>
<p>As he finished uttering these words, Gargalla attacked the armored Aldo with his battleaxe. The latter did not expect in the least to be attacked and received the blow squarely, without defending in any way.</p>
<p>With a metallic sound, like iron pipes striking against each other, Aldo flew across his home, bursting through the wall and landing on the adjacent block’s moat.</p>
<p>“Gh…what are…you…”</p>
<p>Thanks to his stats and equipment the blow wasn’t fatal, but the suddenness of the situation had left Aldo unable to think straight. He tried to push the rubble away and get up, only to notice a blade swinging down towards him.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>A critical hit, and Aldo’s helmet was removed from his head. Overwhelmed by confusion, Aldo didn’t even realize that his head was completely uncovered now.</p>
<p>“Hey, hand over all your items, now. It’d be a shame to have them all disappear, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh…?”</p>
<p>Aldo’s mouth could only utter a lame reply. Gargalla hit the man’s dazed face with a strong punch, to help him regain awareness of the situation.</p>
<p>“Hyeeh?!”</p>
<p>Grasping the situation, Aldo quickly scattered the items in his possession.</p>
<p>“T-This is all I have! It’s all here!! So please don’t—-”</p>
<p>“No more use for you then.”</p>
<p>Gargalla stepped on Aldo to keep him pinned to the ground, then swung down his axe.</p>
<p>“NO—”</p>
<p>Leaving no time for last words, the booming strike wiped out Aldo’s upper body. After a few moments, his lower body disappeared too.</p>
<p>“So pathetic it was almost depressing.”</p>
<p>Receiving a blow from 『Giant Slayer』 on his helmet-less head was enough to ensure that Aldo would die. In THE NEW GATE, critical parts like the neck and the heart were set as the players’ weak points. The head and heart were especially weak; hitting them could cause instant death.</p>
<p>Gargalla confirmed that Aldo had disappeared from under his feet and relaxed his stance, sighing.</p>
<p>Before the instant death strike brought Aldo’s HP to zero, the damage caused by previous strikes was not too high. The avatar’s stats should have been high enough for any mid-level player to not be killed so quickly and easily.</p>
<p>While he was not expecting much, Gargalla still felt his frustration mounting.</p>
<p>“…hmm, might as well add some more reasons here to fuel him up.”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s lips formed a grin, with an evil streak that would have made anyone present shiver.</p>
<p>After collecting the dropped items, Gargalla checked the direction and started moving towards the orphanage.</p>
<p>Shin reached the orphanage around the same time Luca did.</p>
<p>Seeing Luca teeter back on her own, Shin felt even more worried. The monster invasion event limited chat use temporarily, so he still didn’t have a grasp on the situation.</p>
<p>“Luca!”</p>
<p>“Shin…Shin!!!”</p>
<p>Luca’s eyes were filled with large tears. Shin grabbed her as she was about to fall, and the little girl broke out in tears.</p>
<p>Hearing her cry, Emil rushed out of the orphanage.</p>
<p>“Luca!!”</p>
<p>Seeing that she wouldn’t stop crying, Emil’s expression became clouded.</p>
<p>Shin had a bad feeling about the situation.</p>
<p>“First of all, let’s go inside. Thanks to your barriers the monsters haven’t come inside, Shin.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Let’s go, Luca.”</p>
<p>Shin took Luca in his arms and was about to walk towards the orphanage, when Luca -who had regained some composure in her sadness- thrusted a piece of paper in front of Shin’s eyes.</p>
<p>The piece of paper she had gripped desperately, so as not to lose it, showed the coordinates of a location within Kalkia.</p>
<p>“This is…?”</p>
<p>“They took Marino away…all because I said I wanted to go on a walk…!!”</p>
<p>Luca kept crying, her face warped by the tears. Despite her young age, she was tormented by the guilt of having caused Marino’s kidnapping.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, I’ll go save her. Luca, you wait here with Emil and the others.”</p>
<p>Shin wiped Luca’s tears and entrusted her to Emil.</p>
<p>“Marino…will be okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Shin flashed the biggest smile he could, so that Luca would not worry. After patting her head, he turned his back to her and walked away.</p>
<p>As soon as he exited Luca’s field of view, the mild expression peeled off Shin’s face. More than someone who was going to save somebody, he looked like a man who was going to start a massacre.</p>
<p>Shin started running towards the location signaled by the coordinates, the anger he felt clearly visible on his face.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 2 – Part 5</p>
<p>About 10 minutes after Shin’s departure, Gargalla arrived at the orphanage.</p>
<p>Holding 『Giant Slayer』 high, he maintained his running speed as he raced along the roof-tops and jumped up.</p>
<p>『Giant Slayer』’s blade, boosted by the acceleration, was then swung down on the orphanage’s barrier.</p>
<p>The skill-boosted blow made the barrier shudder. Shin’s 【Barrier】 and 【Wall】 could withstand most blows without problems, but a strike from an advanced player wielding an Ancient-grade weapon would not leave it unscathed.</p>
<p>Each blow triggered a counter of magic attacks, but Gargalla swept them away with his battleaxe. As the barrier was located within the city, the magic attacks’ power was limited too.</p>
<p>“Damn, this is one tough barrier!! But… There we go!!”</p>
<p>【Barrier】 and 【Wall】 finally started showing cracks; seeing concrete effects of his attacks, Gargalla shouted in joy.</p>
<p>“Maybe High Humans aren’t that good at defense?”</p>
<p>THE NEW GATE included few defensive skills, and normally offensive skills tended to have higher proficiency levels.</p>
<p>The skill Gargalla used had the effect of causing additional damage to barrier skills or armor. If one kept attacking and no one reinforced the barrier, it would eventually break down.</p>
<p>“Hey! What do you think you’re doing!?”</p>
<p>“Whaat?”</p>
<p>Gargalla turned towards the voice and saw a woman.</p>
<p>“Whoa, now you look pretty strong, don’t you.”</p>
<p>【Analyze】 could not display her stats. Gargalla, though, possessed a rare ability. By looking at the player’s stance, he could determine their fighting prowess. This unusual talent was what allowed him to survive for so long.</p>
<p>“You’re on the High Human’s side too?”</p>
<p>“You mean Shin, yes? What are you trying to do anyway?”</p>
<p>Saying so, the female player -Holly- took out her short wand. In an instant, she activated a defensive skill and created offensive magic on standby in mid-air.</p>
<p>“Damn, you’re fast. A normal player needs more time to activate so many skills…you’re VR-compatible, yeah?”</p>
<p>Gargalla mentioned the term used to refer to those who adapted to the relatively new VR environment faster than its creators expected. It was not a discriminatory term, but since such players could activate skills faster than others and control their avatars more efficiently than average players could, some whispered behind their backs that they were cheaters.</p>
<p>Gargalla did not mean to discriminate. In fact, his tone betrayed his heightened expectations. Holly responded by unleashing her magic; fire bullets, wind blades, and more flew towards Gargalla.</p>
<p>Gargalla dodged the ones which would explode, thus creating a larger area of effect, and knocked away the single-target ones with his battleaxe.</p>
<p>“A magician attacking from the front!? Now this is fun!!”</p>
<p>Holly unleashed several magic spells in a wave-like formation, and Gargalla gave up on dodging, instead charging straight towards Holly.</p>
<p>He activated a skill that enveloped his body in a red aura and gave him an explosive acceleration.</p>
<p>Axe-type Martial skill 【Dreadnought】.</p>
<p>This skill prevented all damage to the user for a few seconds while they were moving, making it one of the most dangerous among all charging-type martial skills.</p>
<p>It was often used in party battles to blow away the opposing front lines and attack the rear.</p>
<p>“Haahaa!!”</p>
<p>Gargalla charged close to Holly, repelling her magic attacks, and swung his axe down.</p>
<p>For Holly, an experienced rear fighter, Gargalla’s skill was nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>Rear line fighters who could use powerful magic were, along with healers, the first targets in party battles. Thus, they were well aware of the skills used to break through the front lines and attack them. 【Dreadnought】 was especially famous for its effect, and several countermeasures existed.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that too many times already!”</p>
<p>The instant the battleaxe was supposed to rend Holly’s body, her figure smoothly -but very quickly- bent and moved away.</p>
<p>She did not move far enough to escape the battleaxe’s range, but the blow that was supposed to crush her just blew her away.</p>
<p>Holly spun in mid-air and landed gracefully; her HP had been reduced by about 10%. Normally, one third should have been shaved off.</p>
<p>“You’re good. Haven’t seen many rear fighters like you.”</p>
<p>“I can’t be happy even if I’m praised by the likes of you.”</p>
<p>The skill Holly used was the Wind-type Magic skill 【Feather Step】, which generated wind around the user’s body, to raise movement speed and lower received damage. It allowed acrobatic movements, but few managed to master it.</p>
<p>“Why not? Gotta accept compliments when you get’em!”</p>
<p>Looking genuinely excited and happy, Gargalla swung at Holly again.</p>
<p>In response, Holly created an elemental wall of ice and earth to stop Gargalla, increasing the distance between them in an instant. Her wand, pointed at Gargalla, emitted a thin purple bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>In the short time Gargalla would have needed to break down the wall, she had prepared the most powerful spell at her disposal.</p>
<p>“Blow him away!!”</p>
<p>Thunder erupted from the wand.</p>
<p>Gargalla was rushing towards Holly, but had jumped to the side when he saw her wand light up.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>The thunderbolt was supposed to blow past him, but changed directions in midair, following the man.</p>
<p>Gargalla barely managed to block it with his battleaxe. Despite managing to defend himself from Holly’s powerful strike, he wasn’t smiling anymore. He did not think that Holly had used a wall-type obstacle just to prepare an easily detectable attack with some homing properties from the front. His battle instinct told him not to let his guard down, and it was right.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>The second after Gargalla parried the purple lightning, thunder struck from above. That was the magic skill used by Holly.</p>
<p>“Kah, you really are tough!”</p>
<p>Not caring about his diminished HP, Gargalla charged towards Holly again. He had lost a mere 30% of his total HP.</p>
<p>Gargalla was a heavy fighter type, focused on STR and VIT. He was thus prepared to counter light and thunder magic, which excelled in speed.</p>
<p>“….!!”</p>
<p>Even if her enemy was drawing closer, Holly kept calmly launching magic spells. A close combat bout between a mage and a magic warrior, however, would have a clear victor.</p>
<p>Even if she was VR-compatible, using attacks focused on speed meant that each blow was light. Some of the most powerful spells needed time to be charged.</p>
<p>Gargalla had seen through this, so he gave up on using skills and simply charged forward, ready to take damage.</p>
<p>Despite the barrage of spells, Gargalla swung the battleaxe, destroying Holly’s wand; however, its blade didn’t stop there. Along with the wand, the axe tore through her robe and rent her body asunder.</p>
<p>“Darling, I’m sor—”</p>
<p>Holly’s last words were silenced by the booming sound of the second swing of the battleaxe.</p>
<p>The first swing had cleaved Holly’s torso in two, while the second had crushed her head. The second blow was a critical hit with instant death properties.</p>
<p>Within the smoke and dust, a small white visual effect sparkled. When the view became clear again, nothing remained.</p>
<p>“OK then, next up the kids and the guards…hm?”</p>
<p>Gargalla was planning to bring down the entrance and break in, but looking at his map made him furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>The internal structure of all buildings, except public ones and the ones he was affiliated to, could not be seen from outside. The interior of buildings was treated like a different area.</p>
<p>The only way to see inside the buildings was to actually go inside and map them.</p>
<p>The map did not display any players, the buildings simply stood silently. All Gargalla could hear was the occasional scream or noise of crumbling buildings.</p>
<p>“I see, so that woman came out alone to buy them time to flee.”</p>
<p>If they really meant to defeat him, it would be ridiculous not to confront him in a group.</p>
<p>“Sure pulled the wool over my eyes. Guess I’ll just go back to Vlad and—!?”</p>
<p>A shadow suddenly appeared right behind Gargalla as he was about to turn back. The blade swung by the silhouette cut through his armor, but Gargalla managed to jump out of the way before receiving damage.</p>
<p>Gargalla still had not regained his balance, but the silhouette continued to attack fiercely. With a sound effect like shearing through the air, the attacker’s blade rushed towards Gargalla.</p>
<p>“Wooohhh!!!”</p>
<p>Gargalla, while using hs battleaxe as a shield, released the Flame-type magic skill 【Fireball】towards the ground, using the wind caused by the blast to gain distance from his opponent.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the black-haired man, Shadow, appeared from the smoke and dust. His armor was in pieces, his HP less than half. Proof that he had broken through the monster hordes to get here.</p>
<p>“What’s this now? We’ve got a parade of interesting people today!!”</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Gargalla was overjoyed to witness the arrival of another strong fighter, while Shadow prepared his weapon, nothing but wrath on his face. The hate seething within had completely changed the usually mild-mannered man.</p>
<p>“YOOOOOUUUU!!!!”</p>
<p>Shadow’s daggers swung at the same time as he screamed. It was a continuous attack based on the ninja’s superior speed and was boosted by skills. The advanced player’s attacks targeted Gargalla’s weak points as if sucked in by them.</p>
<p>“What, you’re way sloppier than I expected.”</p>
<p>The light streak-like slashes were blocked by Gargalla’s weapon and armor. He had regained his balance and now faced Shadow head on; receiving his blows diagonally cut their offensive power by half. It was an alternative use of the skill 【Parry】, used to deflect attacks.</p>
<p>Gargalla’s armor was inferior to his battleaxe in grade, but it still was a high quality item, dropped by monsters in a dungeon. As long as he didn’t receive it head on, it would not be destroyed by a single blow.</p>
<p>“WOOOOOOHHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear me…? I said, YOU’RE SLOPPY!!”</p>
<p>Shadow attacked while howling like a furious beast, and Gargalla roared back.</p>
<p>Shadow’s attacks were fast, but nothing more; because of the fury clouding his judgement, they lacked all the technique they originally had.</p>
<p>As a PK that had fought other players to the death many times, Gargalla would not overlook such a thing. He blocked the slashes with his gauntlets, let the armor’s defensive power take the less powerful blows and drew closer to Shadow.</p>
<p>Gargalla kicked the ground to accelerate, then delivered not a swing with his trusted battleaxe, but a shoulder tackle making full use of his high STR and VIT. An orange-colored effect enveloped his body.</p>
<p>Barehanded-type Martial skill 【Shoulder Bomb】.</p>
<p>It was a counter-type skill often used by players who, like Gargalla, focused on defense more than speed.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>Shadow was wary of the battleaxe, but in his enraged state he had failed to consider the possibility of a full body tackle. The dagger he instinctively pulled up as a shield was blown away by Gargalla’s armor, leaving Shadow’s torso open to the vicious blow from Gargalla’s armor-clad shoulder. Shadow was blown away several mel, crashing into the orphanage’s wall.</p>
<p>The reinforced wall cracked and partly collapsed, as clear proof of the power of Gargalla’s tackle.</p>
<p>“G…wah…”</p>
<p>Shadow, crawling on the ground, desperately tried to stand again. Because of 【Shoulder Bomb】’s effect, however, he was now affected with paralysis and could not even stand.</p>
<p>His anti-status effect equipment, along with his armor, had their durability reduced to zero by Gargalla’s attack and disappeared. His HP was now less than 20%.</p>
<p>“The mage woman that was here before you was so much better.”</p>
<p>His words got a reaction from Shadow. With an expression that in the real world would have likely been shedding tears of blood, Shadow reached towards his dagger with his barely moving arms.</p>
<p>“You’ve got more killing intent at least. If you had fought me together, it would have been fun, I bet.”</p>
<p>Sighing at this lost opportunity, Gargalla raised his battleaxe while looking at the writhing Shadow. Even if lamenting in pain, the killing intent had not vanished from his eyes.</p>
<p>Gargalla never spared promising players, even if there was hope for a future bout. Even if fighting at full power would have proved an enjoyable experience, if they couldn’t escape their fate at the time, he delivered the coup de grace without hesitation. That was one of the rules he imposed on himself.</p>
<p>“So long.”</p>
<p>The battleaxe came down.</p>
<p>The dully shining blade was about to sever Shadow’s neck—when, with a clanging sound, it was knocked away.</p>
<p>“What the?”</p>
<p>He looked at Shadow closer and noticed a half-transparent film covering his body.</p>
<p>“Tch, it’s over then. Earlier than I expected.”</p>
<p>The film was a town-only automatic skill that prevented all damage to players, 【Law of Order】. The fact that it was active again meant that the monster invasion event had ended.</p>
<p>Gargalla only realized when he saw it that he couldn’t hear the monsters roaring anymore.</p>
<p>“Guess I got too much into it. Well, nothing else I can do now.”</p>
<p>Even Gargalla couldn’t hurt other players now that the hometown had recovered its functions. There was no point in staying there anymore, so he left.</p>
<p>With Shadow’s eyes full of killing intent fixated firmly on his back, Gargalla left while grinning evilly.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 2 – Part 6</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Marino had been kidnapped, Shin rushed straight to the specified location.</p>
<p>He didn’t even spare a thought about the monster invasion event being a coincidence or not.</p>
<p>Using one of the monsters prowling the streets as a foothold, Shin jumped on the roof of a building. Any bird monsters trying to blow him away would get swept away with skills, but Shin ran forward without even glancing at the items they dropped.</p>
<p>What filled his heart and morphed his expression was worry.</p>
<p>The piece of paper Luca had showed coordinates and Marino’s condition. What worried Shin was that Marino’s life was in danger.</p>
<p>The paper said that Marino was affected with “Bloodred Poison”. If that was the truth, he had to reach the specified location as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal Poison status, which would leave at least 1 HP, the Bloodred Poison would continue consuming the player’s HP until it was healed or enough time passed. The continuous damage it caused was also much higher than regular Poison; with Marino’s HP, she would not survive long.</p>
<p>“Please let me make it in time…”</p>
<p>Even though Kalkia was a medium sized hometown, it was rather wide. There were houses for tens of thousands of players, after all. With monsters in the way, not even Shin could traverse it quickly.</p>
<p>He had shortcut skills to speed up movement, but because of the restrictions imposed by the invasion event, they could not be used at the moment.</p>
<p>“Out of the way!!”</p>
<p>A dinosaur-like bipedal monster, Dynorex, poked its face in from the main road, but Shin blew its head away with a punch and secured a path. While the monster decomposed in a myriad of polygons, Shin had already shifted his attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>“HYAAAHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>That moment, several silhouettes appeared from behind the monsters, targeting Shin.</p>
<p>The assailants were not one or two. It was clearly an organized group of PK’ers aiming to kill Shin. All of them, flashing twisted grins and readying their weapons, launched magic spells.</p>
<p>“Tch, of all the times…!”</p>
<p>Shin ignored the spells that would be automatically erased and rendered the PKs powerless with non-lethal skills.</p>
<p>There were also advanced players among them, however; many of them could not be stopped with just one blow. Shin would have never succumbed to them as long as he was careful, but he did not have a single second to waste.</p>
<p>“Better enjoy the party while it lasts!!”</p>
<p>“Shut the hell up…I said get out of my way!!”</p>
<p>Shin had no time to deal with the PKs, but now even the monsters were gathering around him.</p>
<p>One on one, it would have been nothing to worry about, but if attacked in swarms like that, even Shin could not solve the situation quickly.</p>
<p>With both monsters and players attacking, the buildings crumbled because of the fighting. Magic arrows and bullets flew in from everywhere.</p>
<p>Each one of them seemed to exist just to be an obstacle on his path.</p>
<p>“OUTTA THE WAY!!”</p>
<p>Warmth, kindness, and hope gradually slipped away.</p>
<p>In their place, worry, fear, and rage gradually filled his heart.</p>
<p>Just as if another person began to inhabit his body, the more time passed, the more the person called Shin changed.</p>
<p>All obstacles between him and his destination were an eyesore. An irritation.</p>
<p>His emotional change influenced his body too.</p>
<p><i>Blow away the rubble with magic and create a path</i>—just as Shin formulated this plan, a PK appeared before him.</p>
<p>Shin could not react because of the now narrower field of view, but his body instinctively swung 『True Moon』.</p>
<p>“Gah!!”</p>
<p>『True Moon』’s blade struck the PK’s chest, as if drawn towards it. It crushed the PK’s armor and pierced through to his back. A critical hit. The PK’s HP dropped to the red zone.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an instant death slash, but because of lingering damage the PK would last only a few more seconds. But despite being in mortal danger, the PK did not recover or leave and continued grappling with Shin.</p>
<p>“Haha, now you’re a murd—”</p>
<p>Unable to finish his sentence, the PK exploded in a shower of polygons.</p>
<p>But there was no need for him to finish his sentence. The word he had been about to pronounce was “murderer”.</p>
<p>“………screw off.”</p>
<p>Shin regained his balance in midair and landed on a building.</p>
<p>He had taken a life. A human life.</p>
<p>But after committing one of the so-called taboos for humanity, what Shin found himself saying…were not words of regret.</p>
<p>—<i>Why are you in my way?</i></p>
<p><i>I did what I could to avoid killing you, but you came to die regardless.</i></p>
<p>—-<i>what will you do if I am late because of you?</i></p>
<p>—-<i>what will you do if I get there and nothing is left?</i></p>
<p>Dead players leave nothing behind.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>Fear—-the strongest emotion that Shin felt in this world was fear.</p>
<p>Many had high expectations of him. He was afraid of betraying them.</p>
<p>He fought with players other than himself. He was afraid that misusing his power could end up with him killing others.</p>
<p>Monster attacks decreased his HP gauge. He was afraid to see death creep closer and closer.</p>
<p>What was now filling Shin’s chest was the fear that Marino would die because she was involved with him. It terrified him more than betraying or killing someone, more than his own death.</p>
<p>“Guess I…don’t need to hold back anymore, right?”</p>
<p>Even if he held back, trying not to kill the PKs, they would use that against him. If he missed and hit a monster, he would have to defeat that monster completely too. Both monsters and PKs were trying to kill him without a care for his thoughts.</p>
<p>“You’re coming to kill me, so I can kill you too, right? There’s no reason to leave PKs alive, is there?”</p>
<p>These questions served the purpose of removing Shin’s self-imposed bonds and worked as an ultimatum to the PKs.</p>
<p>What returned to him were not words, but blades ready to kill.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The approaching blade was met by Shin’s 『True Moon』.</p>
<p>After a very brief resistance, the PK’s longsword snapped. 『True Moon』 did not stop, cutting through the opponent’s armor and cleaving it in two along with the body it adorned.</p>
<p>“Khah….”</p>
<p>The PK, his body severed in half, left a guttural laugh behind as he vanished in a burst of polygons.</p>
<p>Shin looked at his arm, which had swung the blade to the end, and thought.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this way is definitely faster.”</p>
<p>He finally felt free from the annoyance he experienced before and hopeful about making it in time. There was no trace of guilt in him for the life he had just taken.</p>
<p>Humans are not shy of sacrificing others for the sake of their loved ones.</p>
<p>The people present there were also unworthy of any pity or pangs of conscience, even if they were sacrificed.</p>
<p>“(Don’t get in my way. If you do, you die.)”</p>
<p>A single phrase to express everything Shin felt.</p>
<p>Cutting down the PKs that, relentless, came to attack him, Shin checked the shortest path to his destination. He released a magic skill that traveled on a straight path and rushed behind it, as to chase it.</p>
<p>No matter who or what blocked his path, he would slash, crush, break, and kill. For Shin, the PKs were now equal to the monsters invading the hometown.</p>
<p>“I’m coming.”</p>
<p>Faster, faster.</p>
<p>Using the wind caused by the magic skill’s blasts and the enemies’ attacks, Shin accelerated towards the destination. His avatar could not exceed the current speed, but using other elements allowed him to go faster.</p>
<p>His feelings towards killing had changed, but his concern was not completely dispelled.</p>
<p>Maybe because he now knew about her illness, he couldn’t stop picturing a suffering Marino in his mind. He kept trying to ignore such thoughts as he pushed forward.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes after he left the orphanage, Shin arrived at the specified location. It had taken him around two times the normal time to reach it.</p>
<p>There he found three people. Robin, Vlad…and Marino.</p>
<p>“Did I…make it in time…?”</p>
<p>Maybe she had recovered with items or skills, or she wouldn’t have any HP left. The status ailment appeared to be still affecting her, as Marino’s status clearly showed the words 【Bloodred Poison】. She still had about 40% of her HP.</p>
<p>After confirming Marino’s condition, Shin stopped for a moment. He made sure that no one was hiding nearby to ambush him and activated 【Hiding】, preparing to rescue Marino.</p>
<p>Just then, however, Vlad pulled out his blade and pointed it at Marino’s neck.</p>
<p>“I know you’re there!! Come out!!”</p>
<p>Robin, who was next to him, shouted. They had sensed his approach, apparently.</p>
<p>“I-If you don’t come out, I don’t know what will happen to her!!”</p>
<p>As to stress Robin’s words, the tip of Vlad’s sword pressed harder on Marino’s skin. Marino’s HP, which were already lower than half, decreased a little more.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Shin felt something black and thick, like tar, swell in his chest.</p>
<p>It was different from the feeling of cutting down the PKs and monsters standing in his way. It was something clearer, a vivid desire for murder.</p>
<p>“I’m right here!!”</p>
<p>After activating several magic skills, Shin appeared before Vlad.</p>
<p>“Yes…now I’m finally free of him!! Now I just need to go back to the real world and everything will be alright!! Hahaha!! Hahahahaha!!!”</p>
<p>In utter contrast with the expressionless Shin, Robin was rejoicing. Shin did not know what was the reason behind this outburst of happiness, but it was hardly the time to think about that.</p>
<p>Marino, immobilized by paralysis, implored Shin to forget about her through her expression. But he would never grant such a request.</p>
<p>“I came, just like you wanted. Now let Marino go.”</p>
<p>“Shut up!! Now you just need to clear the game and everything will end!! Go back to clearing dungeons!! Noooowww!!!”</p>
<p>Robin’s clearly abnormal reactions started to concern Shin. Responding emotionally would be meaningless in cases like this.</p>
<p>Shin turned his eyes towards the smiling Vlad.</p>
<p>As he did, Vlad put a hand on Robin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Sir Robin, please calm down, or…”</p>
<p>“Ah…yes, I got it…”</p>
<p>Vlad appeared to be superior in the relation between the two; Robin quieted down like a put out fire.</p>
<p>“What’s your goal?”</p>
<p>“My goal, you say. Let me see. I suppose it would be this very situation.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Shin was confused, but Vlad retained his smile.</p>
<p>“You are strong. Among the players present in this world, you are worthy of the title of strongest. Despite standing on such a peak, you would have me allow such trash to associate with you?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>He was basically saying that Marino was useless for someone like Shin.</p>
<p>Vlad’s gloating expression clearly showed that he fully understood how these words disgusted Shin. Shin could understand such a way of thinking.</p>
<p>”I couldn’t care less about your selfish nonsense! Give me back Marino!”</p>
<p>Shin ran forward even before finishing his sentence. He ignored the obviously inferior Robin and targeted Vlad, whom he believed to be the main culprit.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ground around the spot where Marino was lying swelled upwards, forming a barrier as to protect her and projecting spikes made of soil in four directions at the same time.</p>
<p>The branch-like protruding spikes knocked Vlad’s -who had quickly dodged- sword away and pierced Robin -who failed to react in time- in the right shoulder and left thigh.</p>
<p>Shin had activated the Earth-type magic skill 【Earth Branch】, which was usually created around the user, around Marino instead.</p>
<p>Shin had not gone closer right away after being called out because the skill required a certain time before activating when used at long distances.</p>
<p>After temporarily separating the two from Marino, Shin went on to attack Vlad. He could not rest easy after just knocking his sword away.</p>
<p>There should not be any other players in hiding, but Shin focused on the grip on 『True Moon』, thinking of getting rid of such a troublesome opponent as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you’re skipping the hostage and coming straight at me?”</p>
<p>In response to Shin’s charge from the front, Vlad took out another sword. That same moment, a shadow appeared above Shin.</p>
<p>The creature that had pulled in its wings and suddenly started descending was an Elder Green Dragon. At level 701, it was a monster only advanced players could dare to face.</p>
<p>Vlad’s main job was Dragon Knight. It was unusual for him to be fighting without a dragon, but it appeared that he had kept him on standby at a certain distance.</p>
<p>Shin glanced at the flying dragon and concluded it wouldn’t be a threat. Based on the speed of its fall, Shin would lock blades with his opponent faster.</p>
<p>Shin’s 『True Moon』 swung towards Vlad. But an instant before their blades clashed, a yellow effect enveloped Vlad.</p>
<p>The effect that struck 『True Moon』 emitted a loud, hard sound and shattered. Thanks to that Vlad could block Shin’s weakened blow without losing his balance, albeit while carving a track on the ground with his feet.</p>
<p>“YOU…!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s voice brimmed with anger. He noticed that the shattered effect came from the item that originally protected Marino. The item that Shin had given to Marino for self-defense now sparkled on Vlad’s neck.</p>
<p>“As expected of a High Human. I would have been in real trouble if I had used my normal weapon.”</p>
<p>Vlad then jumped away from the clash. Shin tried to reduce the distance again, but the flying Elder Green Dragon unleashed its wind breath to oppose him.</p>
<p>As monster breath was an attack that possessed both physical and magical properties, even with high magic resistance Shin could not fully negate it. The damage itself was minimal, but the breath blocked his sight and made it difficult to attack.</p>
<p>In addition, there was something else clearly bizarre about Vlad.</p>
<p>(This is weird. Why does he have two of them?)</p>
<p>Shin was looking at the weapon Vlad was wielding.</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, some items had limitations in the number that players could equip at the same time. The sword that Vlad equipped on each hand, 『Excalibur』, was one of them; a player could only equip 1 at any given time.</p>
<p>“Never mind that now.”</p>
<p>It was not the time to think about that. What was needed now was to cut down Vlad as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ancient-grade weapons had far higher durability than others, so destroying them would prove difficult. Shin activated another magic skill.</p>
<p>The thunder lance and light bullets, launched with no chanting and thus little to none preparatory movements, left afterimages in the air.</p>
<p>It was a blow that Vlad could not avoid as long as he hadn’t focused heavily on AGI. It weakened as it closed in on Vlad, however, and ultimately took off just 10% of his HP.</p>
<p>“You raised your resistance with items, huh?”</p>
<p>“Correct. Thunder and light cannot be dodged easily, so I prepared adequate countermeasures.”</p>
<p>He had not been affected by the thunder skill’s paralysis either. He had prepared countermeasures against status ailments too, evidently.</p>
<p>“Haha! To cross swords with the strongest is not bad at all either!”</p>
<p>After nullifying Shin’s magic, Vlad leapt in the air and rode on the Green Elder Dragon’s back. As dragon rider, he could unleash the full potential of his job, dragon knight.</p>
<p>Vlad and the Green Elder Dragon’s stats rose, as the emerald-colored blade of light 【Effect Blade】 appeared around 『Excalibur』’s blade. It was an effect that extended weapon reach if the player used weapons other than long ones while riding.</p>
<p>“Here I go!”</p>
<p>He had probably used a skill. Everytime Vlad swung his blade, emerald green slashes flew towards Shin. Shin planned to blow them away with 『True Moon』 and shoot down the flying opponent with magic.</p>
<p>Thunder and light could not cause decisive damage, so Shin shot fire-elemental magic towards the sky. He let his MP do the talking and shot bullets of fire in all directions.</p>
<p>He combined fast and slow bullets in order to fill Vlad’s surroundings with a barrage of fire.</p>
<p>“That’s quite haphazard.”</p>
<p>Looking at the balls of fire gathering all around him, Vlad chuckled dryly.</p>
<p>Because of the dragon’s large body, he needed a wide enough space to maneuver. Expecting this, Shin placed his fire bullets at an altitude slightly higher than Vlad and his dragon’s current position.</p>
<p>An advanced dragon such as the Elder Green Dragon would not flinch even if hit by fire bullets. But because of Shin’s high INT, the offensive power of each bullet was ridiculously high.</p>
<p>Vlad did not try to force his way through the fireball hail, as he probably understood that if even just one hit the dragon’s wings, they would crash immediately. Even a powerful dragon cannot fly freely once its wings are rendered useless. In that case it would simply turn into a large target.</p>
<p>“Time to die.”</p>
<p>All fire bullets were detonated at the same time. They did not strike directly, but the swelling blast they caused ravaged Vlad and his dragon. At the same time of the explosion, Shin ran towards Marino.</p>
<p>While riding the dragon, Vlad’s movements were severely limited even within the blast. In this situation, he could not act quicker than Shin as the latter went to heal Marino’s status condition.</p>
<p>The most important thing was to rescue Marino, not defeat Vlad.</p>
<p>Ignoring Robin, who had been blown away by the blast of wind caused by the explosion, Shin rushed towards Marino.</p>
<p>The moment before he could touch Marino, held in a slightly higher position by 【Earth Branch】, Shin saw her disappear and be replaced by a scorched Elder Green Dragon.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Shin swallowed his breath. He had an idea about the phenomenon he had just witnessed, however, and immediately checked his map. Marino’s response came from next to Vlad.</p>
<p>“【Position Shift】, huh…”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly.”</p>
<p>From the smoke caused by the explosion appeared Vlad, in tatters, carrying Marino at his side.</p>
<p>【Position Shift】 was a skill exclusive of Tamers and Dragon Knights, which allowed the player to swap locations with their monster partner. It was also applicable to party members, but Shin had not thought that Vlad and Marino could have formed a party and gritted his teeth at his own carelessness.</p>
<p>“Making her join my party was child’s play. It is not time for games anymore, though. The finale is upon us.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There must be a reason why we took a hostage, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“You want me to hurry up with the dungeon clearing, right?”</p>
<p>Hearing what Robin had said, Shin thought that the reason must have been that.</p>
<p>“Haha, oh please. If we just meant to urge you to act quicker, there would be no point of doing this here and now. As for the hostage-taking too, luring a player outside the Hometown would allow us to attack them without restrictions too.”</p>
<p>“What do you want, then!?”</p>
<p>“I said it right at the start. To take out the trash. But just assassinating her would have risked to simply depress you, so we created a bit of a show. I know how attached you are to this woman. If she was killed in front of your eyes, what would happen to you, I wonder?”</p>
<p>“You bastard…”</p>
<p>The tone of Shin’s words was chilling.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s it! That’s the real you. Not soft or dull, but a blade sharpened to perfection. Yes, that’s the face I wanted to see!!”</p>
<p>Vlad’s laugh almost sounded insane.</p>
<p>Marino opened her mouth, as if trying to say something, but could not utter anything because of the paralysis still affecting her.</p>
<p>“Yes, this is the finale!!”</p>
<p>“You won’t!!”</p>
<p>As Vlad raised his sword, Shin activated a magic skill. He had prepared more than one before the conflict.</p>
<p>Blue flames raged up from the ground and surrounded Marino.</p>
<p>“Gwah!!”</p>
<p>Burned by the flames suddenly appearing at his feet, Vlad let Marino go. Shin noticed it and immediately ran to her. Marino’s HP were already below 20%; there was no more time.</p>
<p>Because of the passage of time, Marino’s paralysis was almost gone; she stood up and ran towards Shin too.</p>
<p>The flames were now gone. Being in Vlad’s party and considered an enemy of Shin’s, Marino had been damaged too. Shin had chosen the magic considering this possibility too.</p>
<p>“SHIN!!”</p>
<p>“MARINO!!”</p>
<p>“Kah!!”</p>
<p>Vlad chased after Marino. But Shin’s acceleration, even if not boosted, would let him reach her first.</p>
<p>No one could get in the way now. Not monsters nor PKs.</p>
<p>He would protect Marino and defeat Vlad. Tell Luca that Marino was all right, so she wouldn’t worry.</p>
<p>That’s what Shin thought. That’s how it was supposed to go.</p>
<p>If only Marino still had some time left.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Marino uttered a soft sigh. Like a marionette with her strings cut, she collapsed on the ground. Her hands fell too, unable to grab Shin’s.</p>
<p>“It appears that this was inevitable.”</p>
<p>Vlad had been the first to reach Marino. His burnt hands had not let go of 『Excalibur』, and its blade had pierced Marino without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Marino’s avatar, even if pierced by 『Excalibur』, still existed. Strangely enough, even after being struck by an Ancient-grade weapon, she still had HP left.</p>
<p>“Did you do something? But as long as things are like this, it matters little.”</p>
<p>Shin was now closer to Marino, but not close enough to be next to her in one leap.</p>
<p>In front of his eyes, Vlad mercilessly thrusts『Excalibur』again.</p>
<p>To his surprise, however, the sword could not pierce Marino.</p>
<p>“!? This can’t be!”</p>
<p>Maybe because of the impact, Marino’s body shook every time Vlad struck it. His sword, however, was repelled each time, with a metallic-sounding effect.</p>
<p>Immediately after Vlad had started attacking, the words “CONNECTION ERROR” appeared over Marino’s avatar.</p>
<p>“Tch!!”</p>
<p>Apparently not seeing the newly displayed words, Vlad continued thrusting obsessively.</p>
<p>“STOOOOOOOOOPP!!!!”</p>
<p>With a scream, Shin’s sword attacked Vlad. Even if his sword wasn’t actually hitting her, in Shin’s eyes Vlad was cruelly skewering Marino’s body.</p>
<p>Swung with enough power to break it, 『True Moon』 clashed against 『Excalibur』 with a high-pitched sound.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>Because of its stats, 『True Moon』 could not go as far as shattering 『Excalibur』. The offensive power of this attack, however, could not be merely blocked; Vlad was thrown backwards by the impact, sent crashing into a nearby building.</p>
<p>“Marino!! Hey, Pull yourself together!!”</p>
<p>Shin chose to go to Marino instead of continuing to attack Vlad. When he held her, her eyes opened just slightly and met his.</p>
<p>Something was off. Shin was right in front of her, but Marino didn’t see him.</p>
<p>“Ah…ah…I…”</p>
<p>She appeared to still be conscious; while her eyes swayed left and right, she was trying to say something.</p>
<p>“Aah…so this…is it…”</p>
<p>“Marino?”</p>
<p>“I’m…so…sorry….sor…”</p>
<p>“Why!? Why are you apologizing!!”</p>
<p>Marino’s lips continued uttering broken apologies. Not wanting to know what they could mean, Shin held Marino more tightly. She would not answer anymore, however.</p>
<p>“Finally…I…decided”</p>
<p>A hazy expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home…”</p>
<p>Marino continued.</p>
<p>“Every…one…toget…her…not…game….real…”</p>
<p>“….Marino?”</p>
<p>Marino’s words, spoken while she was looking at something not of this world, finally trailed away.</p>
<p>“Hey, answer me.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“We’re going back together, right!?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Luca is…yeah, Luca’s crying. She’s crying a lot, I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Hey…answer me already….!”</p>
<p>Marino did not respond. It was as if she had frozen after uttering her last words and did not move an inch anymore.</p>
<p>“ERROR. Player output cannot be detected. Please verify connection.”</p>
<p>An emotionless system message was returned instead.</p>
<p>“ERROR. Player output cannot be detected——”</p>
<p>Shin could not understand what the system message meant.</p>
<p>“ERROR. Player output cannot—–”</p>
<p>No, he didn’t want to understand.</p>
<p>“ERROR. Player—–”</p>
<p>Because that…</p>
<p>“ERROR—–”</p>
<p>Meant nothing but….</p>
<p>“ERR—–”</p>
<p>Marino had died.</p>
<p>“SHUT THE HELL UUUUUUPP!!!!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s emotions had crossed the limit.</p>
<p>If he didn’t let out such overwhelming feelings, he could go crazy.</p>
<p>Player output not detected. That meant that there were connection troubles or the player had died in the real world. Looking at how Marino acted until a moment ago, it was too convenient to consider a broken connection as the cause.</p>
<p>“Haha, well, it did not go exactly as expected, but I suppose that was fate.”</p>
<p>The sound of falling rubble reached Shin’s ears. If Shin had looked in the direction of the sound, he would have seen Vlad standing back up. As price paid for receiving 『True Moon』’s attack, he had lost an arm.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was waiting for those eyes. People with something important to protect…they are so frail. Now, this very moment, you are perf—”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Vlad to finish talking, Shin’s sword arm moved. Thanks to the Movement-type Martial skill 【Ground Shrink】 he moved instantly next to Vlad and slashed towards his neck.</p>
<p>Vlad could not even react to Shin’s movements.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17088 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ShinBerserk.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Surprised by the metallic sound ringing near his neck, Vlad stood dumbfounded, as Shin silently brandished his 『True Moon』.</p>
<p>Slashes like flashes of light struck sudden death points such as forehead and heart, while others were aimed at Vlad’s legs to stop him from moving.</p>
<p>All of them, however, were repelled by the skill protecting the hometown. Not even Shin could do something in such a situation.</p>
<p>“Ku…hahaha. Looks like time’s over. I’m looking forward to your future feats.”</p>
<p>Even after being blown away by the impact, Vlad left these words before teleporting away.</p>
<p>Shin looked at him leave, then sheathed 『True Moon』. After a few moments, he let out a small sigh and turned towards Marino.</p>
<p>“….sorry for dropping you.”</p>
<p>Shin hugged Marino again and apologized. His expression was no more filled with bloodlust and now looked peaceful.</p>
<p>Before his unnatural smile, a new message appeared.</p>
<p>“F-type Avatar number 193405. Will you acquire? YES/NO”</p>
<p>In the death game, empty avatars were apparently treated as items.</p>
<p>Shin read the message and slowly chose YES. Marino’s body turned into a card and was deposited in Shin’s item box.</p>
<p>Shin teleported to an area with a hill with a nice view. It was a small area Shin had obtained ownership of in an event.</p>
<p>“You liked this place, didn’t you.”</p>
<p>Flowers of many colors bloomed on the hill.</p>
<p>The sky over the hill was clear and sunny throughout the day, the weather there would never be cloudy or rainy.</p>
<p>Shin laid Marino’s avatar card down in a spot perfect for resting in peace. He activated a skill and the card sank into the ground, with a small gravestone being formed in its place.</p>
<p>The skill used by Shin was usually used by Tamers to make graves for their monster partners.</p>
<p>Monsters did not die if their HP reached zero, but in certain events parent monsters would give birth to progeny and die.</p>
<p>That was the only reason skill existed, and many players ignored it even did.</p>
<p>Shin could have kept the card with himself, but chose not to.</p>
<p>Not cremation, not burial. Carrying a body with him seemed wrong to Shin, even within a game.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Shin stood before Marino’s gravestone. Despite the warm wind blowing around him, Shin felt cold to the core.</p>
<p>The cold had probably frozen even his tears, who wouldn’t flow no matter how much he waited.</p>
<p>“….I’ll come to see you.”</p>
<p>After an unspecified amount of time, Shin whispered.</p>
<p>We will be together even after the death game. Even if that wish could not be granted, he will make her last words come true.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>Marino’s last words. Shin didn’t know who she had said them to. Even so, he wanted to make them become reality.</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>After serenely whispering again her last words, Shin’s expression changed completely. Or rather, all emotion disappeared from it.</p>
<p>“There’s someone in the way.”</p>
<p>Obstacles to the path leading back to reality. Obstacles to those who lived their lives earnestly.</p>
<p>“So please give me just some time.”</p>
<p>Shin’s equipment changed. From anti-monster equipment to anti-player equipment. To equipment meant to kill.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep my promise after I erase them all.”</p>
<p>Shin turned his back to Marino’s grave.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a coincidence that the teleportation point to the Hometown, hidden by trees, was now in the shade. Or maybe it reflected the state of mind of its owner.</p>
<p>Shin’s silhouette as he teleported, his facial features twisted in a grimace, made it seem like he was disappearing into total darkness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 3 – Part 1</p>
<p>This monster invasion event created more casualties than any previous such event.</p>
<p>Starting with PKs disguised as town defense corps, it culminated in an invasion of monsters with much greater numbers and levels than usual.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of many players, the assault could be dealt with in a relatively short time, but many players with production-related jobs as well as those who had chosen to stay in the city had lost their lives. Many players just stood speechless before the stores and homes that were reduced to piles of rubble.</p>
<p>The bad news, however, continued.</p>
<p>A high-ranked member of the guild that was in charge of the town’s defenses had been killed by one of the PKs that went on a killing spree during the monsters’ rampage. There were also many casualties among the members closest to the guildmaster, meaning that the clearing of the dungeons would surely go slower.</p>
<p>Both production-type and fighting-type jobs had suffered incommensurable damage.</p>
<p>And the same thing happened at the orphanage too.</p>
<p>Because of the barrier’s destruction thanks to Gargalla, the orphanage had lost its protection and had been severely damaged due to the battles between players and monsters.</p>
<p>Emil’s expression after returning from the temporary shelter was dispirited. The children, too, stopped in their tracks as they arrived on the premises.</p>
<p>“Holly…”</p>
<p>Despite knowing how futile it was, Emil looked for Holly, who had remained behind to buy time for her and the children to escape, and stepped closer.</p>
<p>Soon, she found a man leaning against one of the orphanage walls – Shadow.</p>
<p>“Shadow!! You’re safe! I was worried, you know?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Even after the monsters had been wiped out, Emil could not make a chat connection with Shadow.</p>
<p>Shadow barely glanced towards Emil, but showed no other response.</p>
<p>“Did Holly…die…?”</p>
<p>“….yeah.”</p>
<p>His answer left no doubts. Emil could not say anything more.</p>
<p>Even though she had already a suspicion of Holly’s death before asking Shadow, she still had to ask to make sure. When a player in the friend list died, their names changed from white to semi-transparent.</p>
<p>“Shadow? Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>Emil tried to stop Shadow, who stood up and started walking away, silently. He was clearly very different than usual.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Hey, listen when—-”</p>
<p>Emil grabbed Shadow’s shoulders as he walked away and forcefully turned him towards her. The sharpness of the light in his eyes, however, left her speechless and unable to move.</p>
<p>Emil herself was a competent fighter. She had fought alongside Holly and Shadow before and knew the severe expression he had when fighting.</p>
<p>However, she had never seen an expression like this on his face before.</p>
<p>The chill she felt while looking at him froze her.</p>
<p>“….take care of the kids.”</p>
<p>Saying only this to the immobile Emil, Shadow left in the opposite direction of the children.</p>
<p>His ragged equipment and unstable pace, coupled with the atmosphere surrounding him, made him seem like a ghost.</p>
<p>“—–”</p>
<p>Chilling whispers came out of Shadow’s mouth.</p>
<p>Unable to say anything or think of any other response, Emil could only watch him leave.</p>
<p>”(I’m going to kill him, no matter what.)”</p>
<p>As he walked away, Shadow left a short message, filled to the brim with fierce killing intent, which to Emil felt more like a roar.</p>
<p>After burying Marino, Shin teleported back to Kalkia and went to check on the orphanage. The barrier he had put up to protect it would have easily stopped the monsters that invaded Kalkia; it was supposed to be one of the few safe locations in the city.</p>
<p>What he was greeted with, however, were the cries of the children in front of the broken down building.</p>
<p>“The barrier…is gone?”</p>
<p>Shin had a bad premonition because of this anomaly and examined the partly destroyed building. Doing so, he then found Ryohei and Teppei sitting against a door.</p>
<p>“Ah, Shin…”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>The ever-energetic Teppei looked now completely spent. Shin looked from Teppei, looking down quietly, to Ryohei, who, in a barely audible tone, whispered: “Ms. Holly’s dead.”</p>
<p>“…I see. Where’s Shadow?”</p>
<p>“Dunno. He’s not here, at least.”</p>
<p>Shin simply repeated, “I see.” He then opened the orphanage’s door. There, he saw Emil along with the older children trying to calm down the endlessly crying younger ones.</p>
<p>“Shin!!”</p>
<p>Emil noticed Shin coming in and quickly approached him. Maybe because of the heavy atmosphere the orphanage was enveloped in, her expression looked tense too.</p>
<p>“You’re all right.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…kind of”</p>
<p>She had reached him, but seemed to not know what to say.</p>
<p>“I heard…Holly died.”</p>
<p>“…yeah. You…well, I don’t know what to say..”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about choosing words, please. She didn’t have much time left anyway.”</p>
<p>If the kidnapping incident didn’t happen, Marino might be still alive. There was the concrete possibility that a major stress had caused the attack.</p>
<p>It was pointless to think about that now, though. Even if players who died in the death game would wake up in the real world, this didn’t include Marino.</p>
<p>This kind of small hope didn’t exist either. Her death was something definite.</p>
<p>“….where’s Luca?”</p>
<p>“Look, she’s over there.”</p>
<p>Emil pointed at Luca, sitting and hugging her knees. When she noticed Shin coming closer, she clearly gasped and ran up to him.</p>
<p>“Marino!?”</p>
<p>Luca’s gaze looked to Shin and then to the rest of the room, probably looking for Marino.</p>
<p>“…..sorry.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Luca stopped. She didn’t understand why Shin was apologizing.</p>
<p>Shin had no intention to hide anything, though. He knew that telling a small child like Luca about Marino’s death was cruel, but he didn’t want to lie.</p>
<p>“I…couldn’t protect Marino. Marino’s…..she’s not with us anymore.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking Luca in the eyes. She was silent for a while.</p>
<p>As she understood Shin’s words, however, tears filled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Marino’s…not with us?”</p>
<p>“We can’t see her anymore…?”</p>
<p>“…yeah.”</p>
<p>Shin answered in a soulless voice. Every time he did, Luca’s expression twisted more.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>The moment tears filled her eyes, Luca’s rejection of being separated spilled out.</p>
<p>Not a moment later, she started crying loudly while calling Marino’s name. Her voice was so loud, so filled with sadness, that the other crying children were surprised and stopped crying.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know how to console poor Luca, who was wailing while still hugging him.</p>
<p>He had failed in his promise of protecting Marino, but Luca didn’t blame Shin.</p>
<p>Luca’s tears and crying contained nothing but sheer, utter sadness.</p>
<p>“Sorry…”</p>
<p>Shin’s whisper was drowned out by Luca’s wailing.</p>
<p>He didn’t move until Luca, tired of crying, fell asleep.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“Are you going?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please take care of the children.”</p>
<p>Shin placed Luca on a bed, then told Emil that he wouldn’t be visiting the orphanage for a while.</p>
<p>Emil didn’t try to stop him: she just looked on at him, worried.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s fine for me to say something like this, but don’t you go die. I’m sick of seeing people I know disappear.”</p>
<p>Shin smiled to reassure Emil and turned his back to the orphanage.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not going to die————-I’m going to kill.”</p>
<p>His last whisper did not reach anyone’s ears.</p>
<p>As he left the orphanage, Shin entered a deserted alley and concealed his figure with a long hooded robe. It was the superior Ancient-grade 『Hollow Shade Tatters』, with all bonus points spent on concealment.</p>
<p>Just like the name indicated, it looked just like a tattered old robe, but it had the effect of making the wearer undetectable by 【Analyze】 or other search-type skills, as long as the wearer had 100 or more DEX than the caster.</p>
<p>If Shin wore it, the number of current players who could detect him could be probably counted on one hand.</p>
<p>Hiding within 『Hollow Shade Tatters』, Shin silently proceeded through the alley.</p>
<p>After about five minutes, he came upon a wooden door. It looked like a restaurant’s backdoor, a perfectly normal sight for a back alley. Using an appraisal skill on it, however, revealed that it possessed a sturdiness unthinkable from its appearance.</p>
<p>Shin opened the door, which was actually made in a material sturdier than even Orichalcum, to enter in a dimly lit bar with soft music playing in the background.</p>
<p>The bartender was a man around 40 years old with ash gray hair slicked back. The atmosphere in the bar was calm and collected. The bartender was just as Shin heard and was the information broker he was looking for.</p>
<p>At a glance, the interior looked like a famed bar only true connoisseurs would know, but most clients were hiding their features with masks or capes. There was no board outside to signal the presence of a bar either.</p>
<p>This was a bar where all guests shared a common goal.</p>
<p>“Gimlet.”</p>
<p>The bartender came closer to his seat and Shin ordered a cocktail after placing a coin on the counter.</p>
<p>The bartender took the coin, looked at the red coin under it, then at Shin again. After staring at the new visitor for a few seconds, he took out lime and a bottle of gin to start preparing the cocktail.</p>
<p>While the bartender was preparing the drink, Shin received a voice chat call.</p>
<p>“(Are you a hunter? Or a hound?)”</p>
<p>The call had come from the bartender in front of him.</p>
<p>“(Hunter.)”</p>
<p>Shin answered the question in one word.</p>
<p>“(…your name.)”</p>
<p>“(Shin.)”</p>
<p>The bartender’s shaker stopped for a second, only to move again immediately, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. Here’s your gimlet.”</p>
<p>The bartender, who had prepared the drink in silence, offered the glass to Shin.</p>
<p>A piece of paper could be seen poking out from the coaster under the cocktail glass.</p>
<p>Shin downed the drink and took the piece of paper. Pretending not to notice the bar’s occupants eyes on him, he quickly left.</p>
<p>Shin exited the alley and arrived into a crowded street, then entered the first eatery he could find, ordered something, and finally opened the piece of paper. The piece of paper was wrapped a small, 1-cemel square card that contained a set of coordinates pointing to somewhere in Kalkia.</p>
<p>“It disappears after you open it, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin memorized the coordinates, but before he could discard the piece of paper, it had already vanished in a myriad of tiny polygons. The small card was still in his hand. While honestly admiring the intricacy of that method, Shin checked the presences in the surroundings, but did not find any relevant responses. No one was tailing him, apparently.</p>
<p>Shin wolfed down the food he had ordered and immediately headed for the location pointed out by the coordinates.</p>
<p>The location, near a teleportation point, looked just like any other two-story general store.</p>
<p>Shin knew, however, that the appearance was just camouflage. The store was lined with items, but other than the clerk no one was inside.</p>
<p>Shin took a random item and brought it to the register. When he paid, he handed the card to the clerk too.</p>
<p>“….please go inside.”</p>
<p>The clerk was surprised an instant after seeing the card and reading Shin’s name, but quickly returned to his former blank expression.</p>
<p>Shin proceeded in the back of the store, as the clerk had told him to. The corridor led to a room used for negotiating with customers. The clerk silently pushed a table aside and lifted a large floor tile, which revealed a set of stairs leading downwards.</p>
<p>“Please proceed by yourself.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Shin acknowledge the clerk’s statement and descended the stone stairs.</p>
<p>The barely lit stairs formed a spiral; following them for a while led to a sturdy-looking door just like the one at the bar’s entrance. Shin touched the handle and the door opened surprisingly easily.</p>
<p>All the players in the room beyond the door expressed their surprise at Shin’s arrival, either through their expressions or gestures.</p>
<p>“So you came too.”</p>
<p>Just as Shin was thinking what to do, a man wearing the same tattered cloak spoke to him.</p>
<p>Shin turned towards this familiar voice and found Shadow. Shin had heard from Emil that he had gone missing after the monster invasion event. Finding him here meant that the reason behind his disappearance was the same.</p>
<p>“I imagined you would be here.”</p>
<p>Holly had died to buy time for the orphanage children to escape from the PKs’ attack. It was not strange then for Shadow to be here, a base of the PKK guild “Avidya”.</p>
<p>When “Avidya” was first formed, it was apparently a community for players whose companions had been killed by PKs to exchange information, but now it was composed of members who exchanged information and raised funds and others who actively hunted down PKs; a guild specialized in tracking and killing PKs.</p>
<p>As long as one followed the two rules: no betrayal and no hesitation of getting one’s hands dirty, anyone -women and children included- was allowed to join.</p>
<p>Of course, there were players who, like Shin, belonged to other guilds too.</p>
<p>The players who had created a guild with close friends, but were now alone, were many too.</p>
<p>As players could not belong to more than one guild at the same time, they were not official members but assisted the guild with information gathering, fundraising as external supporters, or as field troops.</p>
<p>The question the bartender asked Shin meant if he was a Hound (rear support) or Hunter (field trooper).</p>
<p>Whether one was allowed to join the guild or not, however, depended on the guildmaster’s judgment. If a player was refused they would never receive any information from “Avidya”, no matter how much they pleaded.</p>
<p>“If you ever get information about a man named Gargalla, tell me.”</p>
<p>Shadow spoke with a hate-drenched tone Shin had never heard from him before.</p>
<p>“He’s the one that…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I will have my revenge.”</p>
<p>In the guild, players used their information, money or fighting power as currency to have others exact revenge for them or to obtain information on who they wanted to take revenge on.</p>
<p>Advanced players like Shin and Shadow would surely join the field troops. Even if facing against opponents they didn’t know or never met before, as long as they were PKs they would swing their blades without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Then if you learn anything about a man named Vlad, please let me know.”</p>
<p>Shin’s information network had not found anything about Vlad’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>PKs were originally all experts at hiding. Vlad was especially skilled; when Shin had met him in front of the orphanage Vlad had mentioned the name of the Savage Lions’ Lao, leader of the Explosive Legs corps, but the latter said that he knew no Vlad.</p>
<p>Apparently traitors had infiltrated the “Savage Lions” and Lao was now busy with finding the rotten apples.</p>
<p>“Hey there, you’re the new guys the guildmaster talked about?”</p>
<p>After talking with Shadow, Shin was thinking of asking around for the method to gather information, when a man with black bandages covering most of his face approached him.</p>
<p>Shin immediately activated 【Analyze】, but because of the building’s restrictions the skill did not display any information. The store apparently also functioned as guild house. In a guild house, all skills other than combat ones had their usage restricted.</p>
<p>“….yes, no mistake about that. Should we say our names?”</p>
<p>“Nah, we don’t use character names here. Members generally identify themselves using numbers. I’m called Six, I’m kind of in charge of the field troops. Your number will be One, the guy there gets Three. Use that from now on.”</p>
<p>“Do the numbers mean anything?”</p>
<p>“This is where field troopers gather. Numbers here obviously mean power rankings, right? …well, normally I’d have you show me how good you are, but you two are pretty famous. Especially this guy here, I bet it’s rare to find players who never heard of you.”</p>
<p>The man speaking to Shin and Shadow had clouded eyes, but it did not seem to be because of greed or other desires. Based on what he said, he seemed to know about Shin too, despite the 『Hollow Shade Tatters』 concealing him.</p>
<p>“My face is hidden, though.”</p>
<p>“You said your name to the bartender, didn’t you? He’s our guildmaster, Garanagal.”</p>
<p>The guildmaster himself was in charge of evaluating new members.Thinking about it, the bartender’s piercing gaze had that much intensity in it.</p>
<p>“There must be a One and Three already, no? If you keep changing names every time someone new joins, no one will know who’s who anymore.”</p>
<p>“No worries there. The rankings don’t change easily, and if they do we get noticed. One and Three were empty slots anyway. There are plenty of our members who went to attack a PK lair and never came back, after all.”</p>
<p>The two empty slots apparently belonged to two members who had left this world. Before doing so, however, they had apparently taken down a great number of high-ranked members of the PK guild “Ouroboros’ Hollow”. Six added that while they had failed in slaying the guildmaster, the guild’s scope of activities will likely decrease.</p>
<p>“So where can we get information about PKs?”</p>
<p>“Ask the woman over there. Her name’s Calmia.”</p>
<p>Six pointed at a woman wearing a light purple veil and Arabian-like clothing, who smiled as Shin and Shadow looked at her. Among all the players wearing equipment geared towards fighting other players, the high skin exposure of her attire stood out exceptionally.</p>
<p>On the table in front of Calmia was a crystal sphere the size of a bowling ball, which made her look like a fortune teller.</p>
<p>“I know little of the rules here. If you say we are field troopers, does it mean we’ll move following your orders?”</p>
<p>“Nah, that only happens when there’s a large-scale battle. Generally we move in small numbers to surround and beat down small groups, but that’s what the members with low fighting prowess do. For guys like you, others would just be in the way, I’d wager. Our Two, Four and Five are the same too.”</p>
<p>In simple terms, do as you like. Shin wondered if it was okay for the rules to be so loose, but it was the best situation he could have hoped for. He could leave the information gathering to them and just go around cutting down targets.</p>
<p>As Shin was pondering such thoughts, Six formed a fist with his hands, which seemed to shake slightly.</p>
<p>“All strong players went to capture dungeons and won’t cooperate with people like us. I don’t mean to say that I’m happy about your misfortunes, but I am excited that strong people like you joined us. Now I can finally…have my revenge too.”</p>
<p>Six’ voice was trembling too. Looking around, Shin saw other players exhibiting similar reactions.</p>
<p>In this world existed an absolute standard of strength, the player’s stats. This meant that strong players were untouchable by many others, a source of endless frustration for weaker ones.</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Six and, together with Shadow, went to Calmia’s table.</p>
<p>“You’re the new One, then. Six probably told you, but my name is Calmia. I organize all the information the hounds send us. If there’s anything you want to know, just ask.”</p>
<p>Calmia’s calm, poised tone matched her alluring avatar very well. She had apparently been allowed to join Avidya thanks to her information management abilities.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would also use her good looks to infiltrate enemy territory. Of course, for someone with little fighting power like her to penetrate PK-controlled areas meant that there was no guarantee she could come back alive.</p>
<p>“Differently from the much rarer hunters, there’re plenty of substitutes for the hounds. Plus there’s no such things as truth serums in this world, so unless I talk, there’s no way to know the information I hold. I would die before spilling anything, of course.”</p>
<p>Calmia’s smile vanished from her lips when she answered Shin’s question if it wasn’t dangerous for an information broker to join infiltration missions.</p>
<p>Others could fill in Calmia’s function. Even if she disappeared, there would be no real damage to the organization as long as she didn’t spill anything.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, she wouldn’t hesitate to become expendable. It was clear that she, too, was prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>“Now that we’re done with the self introductions, I’d like to know about PK locations. Places where a lot of them gather are preferable. If you have a list, give me one and I’ll just start picking them off from the top.”</p>
<p>“…I suppose I should have expected that you’d say something like this.”</p>
<p>PKs usually held bases outside hometowns. Because of that they often fought against monsters and had high levels and stats. Shin plainly stated that he wanted to face and defeat multiples of such opponents at the same time, which prompted Calmia’s incredulous reply.</p>
<p>“After I start hunting I won’t be able to come back here for a while. How can we keep in touch?”</p>
<p>“Just register me as a friend and call me through private chat. I’ll attach the list to a message card and send it to you. What is your friend there going to do?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to go with Shin. Gargalla and Vlad were together, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. There are several witnesses…no, I suppose I should say victims. We have the information. They belong to the guild “Ouroboros”. It seems that Gargalla is one of the top members of the guild. Vlad’s an expert in sneak attacks, on the other hand. Cheating and luring others, apparently sometimes he doesn’t even get his hands dirty.”</p>
<p>“….I see.”</p>
<p>Shin would have wanted such information earlier, but it was too late to think about that now.</p>
<p>“That’s more than enough. Shin, will you lend me a hand?”</p>
<p>“Of course. He’s the one that attacked the orphanage, after all. I meant to hunt him down after I was done with Vlad.”</p>
<p>Vlad was a higher priority, but Shin thought that Gargalla required more caution. He had destroyed his barrier, after all: Shin expected that he would be stronger than Vlad, who he had faced in battle.</p>
<p>“These two are rather famous, but we don’t have much useful information about “Ouroboros” itself. I’ll tell the Hounds to gather information about them as top priority. Also, this is the list of PK guilds’ bases and members that we are aware of at present. You two will probably be all right, but not everything will be as the list says, so make sure you stay sharp all the time..”</p>
<p>“We know that well. We won’t let even one escape.”</p>
<p>“They’re all going down.”</p>
<p>“I was talking about your own safety….but I guess that’s too late.”</p>
<p>Shin and Shadow thought that Calmia meant to say not to let a single PK escape, and replied accordingly. Hearing such replies, she couldn’t help laughing bitterly.</p>
<p>We are valuable advanced players for Avidya. She wouldn’t want us to die easily, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>After leaving the store Shin and Shadow checked the list right away. They would crush PK bases starting from the closest one and proceeding in order.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, then. Will you change weapons?”</p>
<p>“No, please just give me a boost. The only weapon I’m going to use is this…the weapon I got from her.”</p>
<p>Shin proposed to offer Shadow a stronger weapon, but the latter refused with a stiff expression. Even if it could lead to his death, he didn’t want to use any other weapon.</p>
<p>“Please take this, then. It will surely come in handy when fighting against Gargalla.”</p>
<p>Shin gave Shadow an armband decorated with red gemstones, which had the effect of preventing instant death by leaving the wearer with 1 HP if they were hit with a blow that would reduce their HP from more than 30% to zero.</p>
<p>The item would just prevent death when a large amount of damage was inflicted in one blow and would not prevent instant death caused by blows to the head or heart, which ignored remaining HP.</p>
<p>Shin would have preferred to give Shadow items that prevented instant death in all its forms, but he could not equip them because of lacking stats. THE NEW GATE’s system allowed players to avoid accidental death more and more as their level increased.</p>
<p>Shin made sure Shadow equipped the armband, then they headed to the first location reported by the list.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 3 – Part 2</p>
<p>It happened one night.</p>
<p>In the guildhouse of the PK guild “Liberacion”, a boy and a girl were surrounded by guild members.</p>
<p>The boy had a horn sprouting from his forehead and scales on his skin, while the girl had peculiar patterns on her body; judging from such visual traits, the boy was a Dragnil and the girl a Pixie.</p>
<p>While venturing outside looking for ingredients, they were suddenly surrounded by players and caught with no room to escape.</p>
<p>Now, in the area built within the guildhouse, the boy -called Masakado- was forced to fight against monsters. His opponent was a level 398 bug-type monster, a Stag Mantis, which was a cross between a stag beetle and a mantis, boasting four scythes and a pair of pincers.</p>
<p>Masakado’s level was over 200, but he had already resurrected a few times, so his stats were, on average, just a bit higher than 300. These were numbers rather worrying if facing against a Stag Mantis.</p>
<p>Even more worrying was the fact that the key to draw out his power as a Magic Swordsman, his sword 『Rune Blade』 had been snatched by the PKs. His sub job was Fist Fighter, but the most he could do now was avoid the monster’s attacks.</p>
<p>“Come on, come on! Run faster or you’re gonna die!”</p>
<p>“Serves ya right for acting all cool trying to protect the girl!”</p>
<p>“Looks like we’ll have a winner pretty soon!”</p>
<p>The PKs watching the fight from outside the arena yelled and jeered.</p>
<p>As long as the girl who was with him, Hilamee, was taken hostage, Masakado could not try anything. The only way out available to him now, was defeating the Stag Mantis.</p>
<p>“Shit!!”</p>
<p>Masakado swore and leapt away. Less than one second later, a scythe about the same size as he was, pierced the ground where he had been standing.</p>
<p>Bug-type monsters excelled at physical attacks and defense. Masakado, as he was now, would surely be killed if he received even just a few blows.</p>
<p>“——!? ——!!”</p>
<p>Hilamee was trying to say something, but the gag on her mouth prevented her from formulating actual words.</p>
<p>“Why did this…”</p>
<p>The long game of tag against the superior monster had started shaving off Masakado’s powers of concentration. When would it end? Even if he really defeated the Stag Mantis, would they be saved?</p>
<p>He was supposed to be thinking of a way to rescue Hilamee and escape, but his overworked mind ended up thinking of things completely unrelated.</p>
<p>He was almost at his limit. Masakado started thinking of a last resort attack on the Stag Beetle.</p>
<p>“—-eh?”</p>
<p>In front of Masakado’s eyes, Hilamee floated in midair. Precisely speaking, the PK that had captured her thrown the bound girl in the ring.</p>
<p>Hilamee’s body struck the ground, rolled a few times and stopped. The Stag Mantis was right next to her.</p>
<p>“You bastards!!”</p>
<p>“C’mon boy, go save her or she’ll be in danger!”</p>
<p>“Damn you…!!”</p>
<p>Masakado jumped at the Stag Mantis. The monster’s attention was focused on Hilamee, so Masakado’s jumping kick hit its head cleanly, causing the monster to stagger.</p>
<p>However, Its HP barely decreased and the monster soon regained its balance.</p>
<p>“Gah!?”</p>
<p>The back of the monster’s scythes, which it had swung wide to get rid of the annoyance that had hit it, landed squarely on Masakado’s abdomen. Due to the differences in physique and stats, Masakado was blown away. He crashed against the ground, his body grating against the floor of the arena.</p>
<p>The HP gauge displayed at the edge of Masakado’s line of sight had decreased by around 30%. In addition, the status display indicated he had been poisoned.</p>
<p>“—–! —–!!”</p>
<p>Hilamee tried to shout again. Uncaring, the Stag Mantis raised its four scythes in her direction.</p>
<p>The female pixie was a Mage with low defense. If she was struck by all four scythes, her HP gauge would surely be annihilated.</p>
<p>“Damn you…look at meeeeeeee!!!”</p>
<p>Masakado used a taunt skill to force the monster to turn towards him. However, the Stag Mantis had already started its attack motions, and did not even look at him.</p>
<p>A few more seconds and Hilamee would die. He wouldn’t last much longer either. Just as a feeling of hopeless surrender was about to envelop Masakado’s heart…</p>
<p>“—that wasn’t a bad choice.”</p>
<p>The voice of a man, a voice he had heard before, suddenly resounded. At the same time, the guildhouse shook violently.</p>
<p>“Woooohhh!?!”</p>
<p>“What!? What the hell’s going on!?”</p>
<p>The vibration, strong enough to lift the ground up, caused confusion among the PKs.</p>
<p>A pale blue ball suddenly appeared in the center of the arena; the next instant, thunder and lightning ran across the ring.</p>
<p>The booming thunderclap caused Masakado’s sight to go black. It was the rare visual status effect caused by strong flashing of light or thunder, 【Blind】.</p>
<p>No matter how much he squinted, Masakado could not tell what was happening around him. The PKs’ screams, however, echoed clearly in his ears.</p>
<p>“Shadow, please take those two.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Hey, stay quiet.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>The confused Masakado was forcefully grabbed by someone. There were two people next to him apparently. Judging from their conversation, a man called Shadow had just lifted Masakado on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Masakado instinctively fought back when he was grabbed, but stopped moving after Shadow dashed away. The speed at which he moved, far higher than Masakado’s, would have caused him to fall if he struggled.</p>
<p>Shadow moved one step forward, paused for a second, then dashed away again.</p>
<p>Several seconds later, he leapt high in the air.</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>He heard a lament right next to him. He could swear it was Hilamee’s voice.</p>
<p>“Stay still.”</p>
<p>After they landed, Shadow urged them to stop struggling and jumped even higher. As with the first jump, they landed somewhere high and then jumped to a farther high place.</p>
<p>“I’m going to heal you. Quiet.”</p>
<p>Masakado nodded quietly. He was saved from certain death at the “hands” of the Stag Mantis. He did not know what Shadow and his companion had in mind, but he had no reason to oppose them.</p>
<p>The status effect 【Blind】 disappeared and Masakado could finally see again; he immediately looked around for Hilamee.</p>
<p>“You’re safe…I’m glad.”</p>
<p>Hilamee had just been freed from her mouth gag. The man that was now untying the ropes binding her hands was probably Shadow.</p>
<p>He was a young man clad in ninja-like equipment. Masakado’s 【Analyze V】 barely revealed any information about him, but judging from his earlier movements, he was surely an advanced player.</p>
<p>“Use this and go back to town.”</p>
<p>Shadow threw a crystal to the two. Masakado frantically caught it and realized it was imbued with teleportation magic.</p>
<p>“I-is it really alright? This looks really expensive…”</p>
<p>For Masakado and Hilamee, who had been robbed of their possessions, it was a very welcome gift.</p>
<p>Teleportation magic had ranks too; the low rank allowed teleportation from outside fields and town buildings, the middle rank able from dungeons too, and the high rank also allowed from unique locations. The ranks were signaled by colors: low rank was brown, middle rank silver, and high rank golden.</p>
<p>There were some areas where teleport crystals could not be used, but the place where they were now was just a field. Using a golden crystal would be nothing but wasteful.</p>
<p>To teleport from a field to the town, a brown crystal was more than enough. Crystals imbued with high-rank teleport magic were rare, so for Masakado it must have looked terribly valuable.</p>
<p>“You’ll be in our way if you stay. Shut up and go. We can’t save you again if they come after you.”</p>
<p>Shadow then quickly dashed back to the PK guildhouse.</p>
<p>“Hey, that’s…”</p>
<p>Hilamee, finally free, pointed at the guildhouse. The structure was still being rocked by explosions, bursts of light blazing all around it, illuminating the night sky to the point that it was as bright as noon.</p>
<p>Human silhouettes could be seen jumping out every once in awhile. They were holding brown or golden crystals, suggesting that they were trying to teleport away.</p>
<p>Not one of them, however, managed to successfully make their escape.</p>
<p>One was burnt to a crisp by a blue flame that blazed through the guildhouse walls, another was skewered by a black spike arising from the ground, others suddenly turned into ice statues and shattered.</p>
<p>Masakado, or maybe Hilamee, held their breath. They had been told to return to their town, but the scenery of the guildhouse being destroyed and the PKs vanishing before their eyes froze them where they stood.</p>
<p>If the guildhouse looked like that from outside, things had to be even more chaotic inside.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, darkness enveloped the two. They took a few seconds to notice that there were no more explosions or bursts of light from the guildhouse.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Finally, light descended again.</p>
<p>A pillar of light, large enough to cover the whole guildhouse, and powerful enough to blow away the surrounding trees and rocks.</p>
<p>“Is that…a skill…?”</p>
<p>Masakado had difficulty believing that there existed a skill that could produce such immense power. He could barely make out the shadow of the guildhouse, but that too disappeared soon.</p>
<p>As the light pillar vanished, literally nothing stood in its wake.</p>
<p>Buildings vanished when their durability ran out. Everyone knew that much, but seeing something disappear without a trace like that filled them with something akin to horror. Needless to think how the PKs inside must have felt.</p>
<p>“Hey…someone’s coming.”</p>
<p>Hilamee pointed at two human silhouettes coming their way. One was the man that had saved them, the other was a player that Masakado and Hilamee both knew.</p>
<p>“That’s…Mr. Shin…right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I mean, he should be…”</p>
<p>Few did not know Shin’s name, his face, and reason behind his fame.</p>
<p>Masakado and Hilamee had been saved by Shin already in the past too. They knew that he wasn’t the kind of person to unleash utter destruction like that.</p>
<p>Looking at the place where the guildhouse once was, only a scorched patch remained. The scene they had just witnessed clearly showed what had happened there.</p>
<p>Shin had exterminated the PKs, all the players inside the guild. That was something the Shin that Masakado knew would have never done.</p>
<p>Masakado and Hilamee didn’t know what had happened to Shin. As such, they didn’t understand.</p>
<p>They neither knew the reason why he was there, nor why his equipment was different.</p>
<p>Or why his expression seemed void of all emotion, an expression they had never seen before.</p>
<p>“Ah, er, Mr. Shin…?”</p>
<p>Shin must have noticed their presence, but did not react to them in the least. Masakado gathered his courage and spoke to him, but there was no answer. Not even a glance in his direction.</p>
<p>Shadow, walking next to him, did not say anything either.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Shin and Shadow kept walking away; Masakado could not say anything more.</p>
<p>“What in the world happened to him….?”</p>
<p>Masakado’s confused words were lost in the night, not reaching Shin’s or anyone’s ears.</p>
<p>That night, 24 players disappeared from THE NEW GATE’s world.</p>
<p>It was the start of an unprecedented cleansing that raged on with storm-like fury.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you again. Your achievements are getting more and more talked about, you know.”</p>
<p>Calmia chuckled while looking at Shin.</p>
<p>Almost one month had passed since Shin started his PK hunt. Even if he had kept his identity and figure hidden, the news that Shin was going around killing PKs spread quickly.</p>
<p>The pace was too fast, the massacre too one-sided. Too subtle for a major guild, while for a smaller guild not suffering any casualties would have been impossible. On the other hand, some players whispered that a certain person had not shown themselves in the dungeon clearing frontlines recently.</p>
<p>As Shin’s disappearance and the start of the PK hunt happened roughly at the same time, the rumors eventually became that Shin had started performing a “PK cleansing”.</p>
<p>The rumors became more and more believable as witnesses, rescued by him, started reporting what they saw.</p>
<p>“They’re more on their guard now. It’s a pain.”</p>
<p>“Is that something the man who crushed dozens of PK guilds would say? Thanks to your rampage, it’s been a mess here these days, everyone crying and laughing…”</p>
<p>Normally, avenged players would not show their emotions openly, out of respect for others whose aggressors were still unpunished. But now, the numbers were too great, as were the expectations for the future, so Avidya’s guildhouse looked more or less like a banquet hall.</p>
<p>They praised and hailed Shin as a hero for destroying PK guilds with his powerful skills.</p>
<p>Others, like Shadow, did their part too, but the scale of destruction caused and people killed were too different for them to be mentioned.</p>
<p>“There are some players who disapprove of your ways though. I don’t think the major guilds will actually move, but they might attempt something, so be careful.”</p>
<p>Calmia looked worried. Shin nodded without any particular change in his expression.</p>
<p>Yes, even if he was killing PKs, murderers, his actions were judged in many ways.</p>
<p>Many said that revenge was meaningless, that he would just become the same as them, they lost their respect for Shin. Some of them started calling him “God of Death”.</p>
<p>“No problem. The only large guild remaining is “Ouroboros” anyway. I won’t let the smaller ones go though, I have no intention of stopping now that I’ve come so far.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I can give you this information then.”</p>
<p>“At last…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, at last we have found Ouroboros’ hideout. Gargalla has been seen too. Vlad doesn’t seem to be around though. Based on the information we have, he hasn’t returned to the guild and is acting on his own.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered Vlad’s gloating expression. It was still etched clearly in his memories.</p>
<p>Maybe he was observing Shin from afar. That’s how deep the obsession he felt emanating from Vlad.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Vlad will be there, but it seems that they will have a large gathering three days from now. You’ve been destroying PK guilds one after the other, so they might be meeting to develop countermeasures. The most skilled PKs still alive will likely be there, do be careful.”</p>
<p>“Got it. But having targets gather like that is pretty helpful for me. Being ambushed by high-class PKs would be pretty nasty.”</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself too hard, okay? Some people try suicide attacks against PKs, but if everyone did that no one would be left…”</p>
<p>“I’m not as admirable as that. That’s the last large-scale PK guild; I’m going to make it leave the stage with a bang.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke what he truly felt.</p>
<p>He had no intention of losing his life while killing the PKs; he loathed the idea of dying alongside them even more than being killed by them.</p>
<p>He would use all means available. Only the PKs needed to disappear. That was the method Shin adopted.</p>
<p>“Maybe I should keep this for myself…but in a way, I feel like I have to tell him, hmm…”</p>
<p>After obtaining more details, Shin left Avidya’s guildhouse and went to the meeting point with Shadow.</p>
<p>Unlike Shin, Shadow was hell-bent on killing Gargalla, even at the cost of his own life. Shin thus was thinking of carrying out the next mission alone.</p>
<p>“…no, that won’t work.”</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought, the conclusion he reached was always to tell Shadow.</p>
<p>If Shin hadn’t lost Marino, he might have tried everything he could to stop Shadow.</p>
<p>Shin’s position, though, was the same as Shadow’s. To exact vengeance with your own hands. No one could stop that feeling.</p>
<p>Even if death would follow vengeance, they would not stop. The opinions of others meant nothing. It was only about what the person themselves thought, that was the only question.</p>
<p>“It’s snowing.”</p>
<p>Shin looked up at the sky and saw pure white snow starting to fall.</p>
<p>When Shadow heard about Gargalla’s whereabouts, a twisted smile appeared on his lips.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 3 – Part 3</p>
<p>“Things under your nose are the hardest to find, as they say.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The hometown’s underground…they said it would be made into a dungeon in the next update. I didn’t even think that it actually existed.”</p>
<p>Shin and Shadow were walking in a large space located under Kalkia. It was not an underground waterway. Instead, it was a series of small and big rooms connected by corridors of various sizes.</p>
<p>Ouroboros’ hideout, as Calmia’s information network had found out, was in this underground space.</p>
<p>Being a section still not implemented in the game, there were no bosses or monsters roaming about, nor any treasure chests or traps.</p>
<p>The entrance wasn’t easy to find either, so it would be difficult to find if one wasn’t aware of its existence.</p>
<p>“Looks like they bothered setting up some traps though.”</p>
<p>Shin and Shadow passed without activating traps that would have likely meant sudden death for players with stats around 400. During their PK guild extermination missions, they had gained deeper knowledge of anti-player traps.</p>
<p>The two proceeded through the corridors with silent footsteps. The information they had only covered the entrance and a bit farther. It was possible for monsters and traps to be present in the depths of the underground space.</p>
<p>“Someone’s there.”</p>
<p>They spotted a humanlike silhouette in the corridor ahead. Shadow hid, just in case, while Shin moved closer to check it.</p>
<p>The silhouette’s name was displayed in red characters; definite proof that it was a PK. Next to the name, there also was a snake biting its tail -Ouroboros’ logo- clearly visible.</p>
<p>The PK was coming from underground and heading outside, unaware of Shin’s presence. When the PK passed next to him, Shin placed a tracker, usually used with monsters, without being noticed.</p>
<p>The guild’s executives, with the guildmaster above all, had to be eliminated first.</p>
<p>When guild members died, the guildmaster alone would be notified of their demise immediately. Other members could also know if they looked the dead member up, so being noticed early would increase the number of escapees.</p>
<p>In unusual groups, like PK guilds, the guildmaster often had particular charisma, so if they escaped there was the risk of them creating a similar organization again.</p>
<p>Shin and Shadow kept exploring further, putting tracking markers on PKs as they passed them.</p>
<p>“There are more and more people around here. Looks like we hit the jackpot, but they’re acting strangely.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, looks like they’re fighting.”</p>
<p>On Shin’s map, the markers in one specific section were moving wildly.</p>
<p>There was some kind of commotion going on, even in the few seconds that Shin looked at the map, several marks symbolizing players had disappeared.</p>
<p>At first they thought that another member of Avidya had attacked the hideout, but the other members were hunting down PKs that didn’t belong to any guild or survivors from guilds they had crushed.</p>
<p>Even if they did attack, Shin would have been informed beforehand.</p>
<p>“Could there have been a mutiny or something?”</p>
<p>“Could be. It happened in other guilds, after all.”</p>
<p>Most PKs shared common interests or ways of thinking. But because of that, in some cases they could turn their blades against their own comrades.</p>
<p>Among all PKs, some had lost to hopelessness after Shin and Shadow started their hunt, while others had gone on rampages in their own guilds.</p>
<p>“We’ve infiltrated easily enough, but a careful guildmaster might manage to flee.”</p>
<p>“Let’s split up. Use the commotion as a lure and look for whoever is the guildmaster. I’ll go that way, you take the opposite direction, Shin.”</p>
<p>Shadow proposed to go in the direction of the commotion.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if I went that way?”</p>
<p>If the guildmaster was there, Shin could blow him away along with the fighting PKs with his magic.</p>
<p>“No, if the guildmaster comes to quell the commotion, I’ll ambush them. It would be a lot worse if they avoided the commotion and left here. If it’s about chasing people, you are faster and have a wider detection field too.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time for debate. Shin had no reason to stubbornly oppose Shadow’s proposal, so he nodded and ran off.</p>
<p>A few minutes after separating from Shin, Shadow reached the location where the PKs were fighting. He used all the concealment-type skills he could to make sure he was not found.</p>
<p>He had used the support items Shin had given him along with everything his Ninja job had, so the fighting PKs had not noticed his approach at all.</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>“Shit…why…”</p>
<p>Hidden in the shadows, Shadow observed the fighting going on in front of him.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t interfere. Having the PKs kill each other would make his burden lighter, after all.</p>
<p>“Don’t go shitting your panties there, ladies.”</p>
<p>The speaker was the cause of the commotion. With a sigh, the man swung his giant axe. Thanks to the combination of centrifugal force and his own muscles, the sword-wielding fighter he opposed was cleaved in two along with his weapon.</p>
<p>“This is the last major guild. If you don’t do something, the High Human will come get you, ya know? So why do I have to hear people talk about running away?”</p>
<p>The man’s name was Gargalla. The despicable man who murdered Holly. An opponent to kill at all costs.</p>
<p>Every time Gargalla swung his battleaxe, the PKs surrounding him disappeared. Shadow did not let his emotions take over and attack. That had caused him to fail previously.</p>
<p>“(Shin, I found Gargalla.)”</p>
<p>Shadow connected a chat to Shin and surprised himself by how calm he sounded.</p>
<p>“…..really..”</p>
<p>“(Yeah, I’m sorry but let me do this. If anything happens, the rest is up to you.)”</p>
<p>“(………)”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t answer. Shadow knew, however, that he wouldn’t give up on finding the enemy to come to his location.</p>
<p>“I…I have to kill him.”</p>
<p>Shadow quietly breathed out.</p>
<p>Unlike the time when rage and hate had clouded his mind, he was now coolly analyzing Gargalla’s movements.</p>
<p>“You all sound pretty damn boring now!!”</p>
<p>Another one, another PK left this world. Be it saints or vicious criminals, all players disappeared the same way when they died. Nothing remained.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Shadow kept observing Gargalla.</p>
<p>While fighting, Gargalla would sometimes turn his back to Shadow. Every time he did, Shadow registered a red effect blinking on Gargalla’s neck.</p>
<p>That was the sign meaning an attack would result in instant death. It appeared when the system judged the opponent to have shown an opening, an effect of the Ninja skill 【Blink of the Death God】. “Opening” stood for the lag time after attacking or activating a skill, when the player was defenseless and attacks could hit more easily.</p>
<p>The blinking light was reflected in Shadow’s eyes several more times, but he did not move.</p>
<p>Advanced players would sometimes show openings on purpose, and 【Blink of the Death God】 could not differentiate between voluntary and involuntary ones. A player that had just gained the skill would rely too much on it and attack, only to be counterattacked.</p>
<p>The possibility of Gargalla having noticed his presence was low. But Shadow, who had fought against him, knew how honed Gargalla’s battle instinct was.</p>
<p>Thus he waited for the best chance to strike.</p>
<p>“You want to go down fighting, don’t you. Why run when someone stronger is coming to get you, then!”</p>
<p>The number of PKs fighting against Gargalla could now be counted on one hand. With another couple swings from his battleaxe, they would all probably disappear.</p>
<p>Shadow attacked when Gargalla had raised his axe to cut down the last remaining PK.</p>
<p>“—–!!”</p>
<p>As if he appeared out of thin air, Shadow snuck behind Gargalla. The blade in his hands precisely aiming for the man’s neck.</p>
<p>“Ngh!?”</p>
<p>Gargalla reacted to the silently approaching blade in a surprising way. The attack had come from his blind spot, but despite that, he jumped in the other PK’s direction, barely escaping the clutches of certain death.</p>
<p>Shadow’s blade had slashed Gargalla’s neck, but thanks to the last-second dodge he had managed to keep his head attached to his body.</p>
<p>In real life such a cut would have severed an artery, but the result in the game was only a loss of around 10% of Gargalla’s HP. The 【Bloodred Poison】 status inflicted by Shadow’s dagger, however, gnawed at Gargalla from within.</p>
<p>Before confirming the consequences of his attack, however, Shadow had concealed himself again.</p>
<p>“…this wasn’t one of the people here.”</p>
<p>Gargalla had an idea of who could have so splendidly enacted the Ninja hit-and-hide strategy.</p>
<p>“Ooh, yeah, now I get it. I did hear that there was a fierce ninja with the people going around killing PKs.”</p>
<p>Gargalla flashed a vicious smile. He bashed the other PK, who was scampering away, with his battleaxe and examined his surroundings.</p>
<p>He couldn’t use recovery items. If he tried to, Shadow would strike when the opening generated.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>In the now completely silent room, only the sound of something burning could be heard.</p>
<p>Then the sound of something suddenly falling.</p>
<p>“!!”</p>
<p>Gargalla reacted instantly. The moment he looked at the direction the sound came from, something glinted in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Tch!!”</p>
<p>The slash, coming from the opposite direction of the sound source, grazed Gargalla’s legs and vanished.</p>
<p>Gargalla could only see the effects of the attack. Slashes that appeared out of nowhere, as if they had come from another dimension, were Shadow’s trademark in THE NEW GATE.</p>
<p>“Damn, can’t really see shit..!!”</p>
<p>Attacks that made full use of movement skills, concealment skills, and Ninja abilities. That was the true nature of the advanced player called “Shadow the Shadowless”.</p>
<p>From the legs to the neck, to the arms, then to the neck again.</p>
<p>The never-ending storm of swords clashed against Gargalla’s armor in bursts of sparks. The speed-based attacks were light, however, and could not exceed his defense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gargalla could not find a target to attack. However, he did not just stand around and be attacked; he managed to block the slashes at the last second.</p>
<p>Attacking deactivated concealment skills. Even the most experienced players could not avoid a certain time lag after the attack before activating concealment skills again. Normally the opponent would detect them as target after the first attack.</p>
<p>This did not affect Shadow, however. His mental operations were faster and smoother than most players. He attacked and disappeared immediately, almost as if he was on autopilot.</p>
<p>Shadow’s continuous attacks had not caused serious damage to Gargalla, but the 【Bloodred Poison】 status he had inflicted at the start was eating away at Gargalla’s HP gauge, as the latter could not recover.</p>
<p>Shadow was not targeting critical spots, but also parts that would delay Gargalla’s movements, such as joints and openings in the armor. When the opponent was starting to get used to such attacks, Shadow would strike critical spots again.</p>
<p>The incessant attacks continued. Finally, Shadow’s blade stretched towards Gargalla’s neck again, but the latter did not defend himself.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>The blade reached the man’s neck, but was repelled without cutting anything. Because of this development, completely different to what had happened until now, Shadow’s rhythm was disrupted for a moment.</p>
<p>“RRAAAHHH!!!”</p>
<p>Not Gargalla’s axe, but his fist lunged at Shadow. Protected by a gauntlet and boasting high STR, it was a fearsome weapon by itself.</p>
<p>“Sssh!!”</p>
<p>Having been seen, Shadow could not disappear again; he readied again the repelled blade in a battle stance and parried the attack.</p>
<p>Sparks flew between the gauntlet and the short sword. Shadow didn’t oppose the force pushing him back and put distance between himself and his opponent.</p>
<p>“You’re finally out in the open, huh. Totally different from last time though.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s tone was impressed, but Shadow silently took out an item.</p>
<p>The item’s name was “Miracle Drug of Blinking Life”. Shaped like a round pill, it boosted the user’s stats immensely but, in exchange, would soon take their life.</p>
<p>The time limit changed based on the user’s HP, but not even Shin could fight for long after using it. Shadow even more so.</p>
<p>Now that he could only confront Gargalla head on, he would use any means available.</p>
<p>If he had fought alongside Shin, he probably would not have needed to go so far. He was throwing away his life. Shadow himself understood that much.</p>
<p>He could not have done that, though. It would have meant nothing if he didn’t defeat the opponent before him, Gargalla, with his own two hands.</p>
<p>In his heart, Shadow whispered an apology. Then, he swallowed the “Miracle Drug of Blinking Life”.</p>
<p>“…——!!!!”</p>
<p>The moment he felt the item started being effective, Shadow charged towards Gargalla.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he didn’t think Shadow would attack from the front, or maybe because his speed was more than expected.</p>
<p>Taken completely by surprise, Gargalla barely managed to repel the blade aimed at his neck and swung his battleaxe in response.</p>
<p>The repelled shortsword struck Gargalla’s chest, making sparks against the armor; Gargalla’s breastplate was damaged but could not be pierced.</p>
<p>The battleaxe cut through the air, aimed at Shadow, who used his shortsword to forcefully change the attack’s trajectory.</p>
<p>A feat of strength only possible thanks to the item’s boost; now Shadow’s STR was not inferior to Gargalla’s.</p>
<p>Gargalla pulled back his battleaxe while parrying Shadow’s follow-up attacks with his gauntlet, then used the axe to push against him.</p>
<p>Shadow stopped attacking and attempted to increase the distance between them, but a sudden chill running down his spine made him give up on this too. He could not overcome the battleaxe’s momentum and used his shortsword to clash against it.</p>
<p>“You got good instincts.”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s smile suggested that he knew what Shadow tried to do. Based on his avatar’s stats, it was easy to imagine that many players until now had tried to best Gargalla using speed.</p>
<p>Shadow guessed that the chill he felt was caused by Gargalla’s countermeasure against speed-based players.</p>
<p>“See if ya like this, then!!”</p>
<p>Gargalla held his battleaxe with his right hand and spread the palm of his left hand. An instant later, a battleaxe just like the one in his right hand appeared in Gargalla’s left hand as well.</p>
<p>Using that opening, Shadow made use of Gargalla’s power to increase the distance between them. At the same time, he threw the shortsword he was holding at Gargalla.</p>
<p>Gargalla tried to knock the projectile down, but the shortsword changed directions in midair, dodging the battleaxe and aiming for his neck.</p>
<p>Gargalla flexed his neck, however, the flying blade passed right next to it and ended up stabbing the ground.</p>
<p>The Throwing and Wind combination skill 【Trick Throw】 allowed one to change the direction of the thrown weapon in midair. Gargalla had guessed how many times the direction could change during flight.</p>
<p>After throwing the shortsword, Shadow quickly materialized twin swords. Wielding these weapons with boosted AGI at the expense of durability, he attacked Gargalla again.</p>
<p>This time Shadow did not attack from the front, but unleashed attacks from many directions, using the walls and even the ceiling as foothold. Making use of the Movement-type skill 【Flying Shadow】, he increased the unpredictability of his attacks.</p>
<p>Shadow had little HP left; the time left for him was probably less than one minute.</p>
<p>But even in such a situation, he did not lose his cool. Aiming for the instant he could deliver the final blow, he used everything he could in the room as footholds for his movement and attacks.</p>
<p>A frenzied run that, in such a confined space, made it look like he could control space.</p>
<p>The light streaks drawn by the twin blades in mid-air surrounded Gargalla like a barrier.</p>
<p>“…ooh.”</p>
<p>Shadow ran. The sounds grew smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>“Ooohh!!!”</p>
<p>Shadow jumped. The flowing scenery became slower and slower.</p>
<p>“Oooohhh!!!!”</p>
<p>Shadow slashed. The cuts on Gargalla’s body gradually increased.</p>
<p>“oooOOOOOOOAAHHH!!!!”</p>
<p>Shadow roared, following the emotion bursting from within.</p>
<p>A roar that ultimately turned into a scream, as Gargalla’s armor saw its durability decrease exponentially.</p>
<p>“What the hell got into you all of a sudden!?”</p>
<p>Even Gargalla could not help being shaken by Shadow’s sudden acceleration.</p>
<p>The “Miracle Drug of Blinking Life”, in exchange of the ultimate price it required, granted the user an explosive stat boost. Added effects, such as the ones players normally used, were nothing in comparison.</p>
<p>Normally it would not be possible to use it to the fullest. In this moment, however, a power that players would subconsciously limit was under Shadow’s complete control.</p>
<p>A force of desperation, that lasted only dozens of seconds. Shadow used that fleeting time to decide the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>Gargalla could not keep up with Shadow’s movements anymore. Shadow first concentrated on his opponent’s right leg, to restrict his movements. The moment Gargalla lost his balance, Shadow went for his neck.</p>
<p>“Nnghh!!”</p>
<p>Maybe it happened because Shadow had already targeted his neck many times. Gargalla had predicted such an attack and raised his battleaxe in defense.</p>
<p>The twin swords had low durability from the start: clashing against Gargalla’s battleaxe, the armor shattered them.</p>
<p>“Kh!?”</p>
<p>“Out of time, huh?? You’re outta luck too!!”</p>
<p>His weapons crushed, Shadow landed and remained immobile for a moment. Gargalla’s battleaxe rose again, towering behind his back.</p>
<p>Shadow wasn’t sure whether his armor could withstand such an attack. There was no time to dodge it by sidestepping either.</p>
<p>Gargalla was sure to have claimed victory. The small opening birthed by such confidence was exactly what Shadow was waiting for. The shortsword he had thrown previously was stabbing the ground at his feet.</p>
<p>“And now—-”</p>
<p>Shadow was kneeling, his back facing Gargalla. He quickly took the short sword and jumped backwards.</p>
<p>Charging backwards at your opponent was an absolutely reckless move, but Gargalla’s battleaxe managed to react. Because of the unexpected movement, however, it did not succeed in splitting Shadow apart.</p>
<p>Shadow’s back clashed against Gargalla’s armor. The next instant, Shadow stabbed his own chest with the shortsword.</p>
<p>The blade pierced Shadow’s body and continued towards Gargalla’s chest armor.</p>
<p>Normally, it would have been repelled. But the accumulated damage created a different result.</p>
<p>The shortsword’s blade pierced the sturdy armor and stabbed the flesh it protected. A little, just a little more, and it would reach the heart.</p>
<p>“It’s over!!!”</p>
<p>The blade still stabbed, Shadow activated a skill.</p>
<p>It was the Sword and Flame combination skill 【Purgatory Thrust】. A blade of fire formed from the shortsword, filling the distance from the blade’s tip to the heart, extending out of Gargalla’s back.</p>
<p>Critical hit. An absolute instant death attack, ignoring remaining HP.</p>

<p>“Hah, not…ba—–”</p>
<p>Gargalla’s body turned into polygons and scattered before he could finish his last sentence.</p>
<p>Shadow kneeled down, the shortsword still lodged in his chest. Because of the last skill he used, he barely had 5 seconds left.</p>
<p>“Aah…”</p>
<p>A strengthless groan escaped his lips.</p>
<p>His love burnt, his hate exasperated, his sadness fed him to keep him going. But the conclusion he reached was just the reality that he had killed people.</p>
<p>He had his revenge. His mission was complete. Nothing remained in his chest, however.</p>
<p>He did not think that revenge was a fruitless thing.</p>
<p>It was not fulfilling either, though.</p>
<p>“Shadow!!!”</p>
<p>Five seconds until the flame of Shadow’s life flickered away. The last person to call his name was the man who shouldered the same pain as he, the friend that had walked down his same path.</p>
<p>“Shin.”</p>
<p>He had reached the end first. Because of that, Shadow thought that he had to tell him.</p>
<p>Maybe Shin would reply that he didn’t want to hear that from him. But Shadow felt that he had to be the one to say it, because he was in the same position, because his words could maybe reach Shin’s heart.</p>
<p>“Don’t…end…like..th…”</p>
<p>Shadow saw Shin run to him as if through a cracked lens. He couldn’t feel his body anymore. The end had come.</p>
<p>Had his words reached him? The vanishing Shadow could not know.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“Out of my sight.”</p>
<p>Shin received Shadow’s message about Gargalla as he was blitzing through the guild, still concealed by the robe. Everytime he found a PK he judged if they could be the guildmaster or not, then purged them one by one.</p>
<p>Since fighting had broken out within the guild, finding the guildmaster had become the top priority.</p>
<p>Before Shin’s 『True Moon』, average weapons and armor meant nothing.</p>
<p>Some PKs had formed a party and confronted him, but the frontline members’ swords, spears, armors and shields were torn apart as soon as they entered Shin’s range, together with any other equipment on them.</p>
<p>The rear lines’ mages, too, saw their spells nullified as they themselves were burned to a crisp by magic. Arrows and other projectiles could not overcome Shin’s Ancient-grade gear; here, too, magic annihilated everything in its wake.</p>
<p>“Where’s the guildmaster?”</p>
<p>“I d-don’t kn—”</p>
<p>The PK’s head flew from his neck before he could even complete his sentence.</p>
<p>Shin continued to search for the guildmaster, employing his detection abilities to the fullest.</p>
<p>Gargalla was for Shadow to take his revenge. Shadow would probably manage to kill him, even if it meant his own life. Sharing his same emotions, Shin knew that well.</p>
<p>“Tch.”</p>
<p>Shin loudly clicked his tongue. He was irritated at himself for letting Shadow go.</p>
<p>He understood Shadow’s feelings so much that it hurt. The hate burning the flesh, the sadness twisting the mind. Their feelings towards the target of their revenge could not be described in just a few words.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, he couldn’t help but think if it was really a good idea to let him go on his own.</p>
<p>Based on the information he had, Shadow had about a 30% chance of winning. If he used a certain item, 80%.</p>
<p>But in the latter case, even if Shadow won the chance of his death was 100%.</p>
<p>“….damn it.”</p>
<p>That was Shadow’s battle. If Shin got involved, even if anyone would say that it was to save Shadow’s life, for Shadow himself he would just be in the way. If their positions were reversed, Shin too would scream at him to stay out of the way.</p>
<p>Even so…even so. Even if he had chosen the path of revenge, even if he killed without hesitation, he could not be indifferent to a comrade’s death.</p>
<p>“Found you!!”</p>
<p>Shin had headed to the area with the highest number of responses within his detection area. Before him now stood Ouroboros’ guildmaster. Apparently trying to flee, they were advancing in the direction opposite to Shin’s position.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know where the border between the underground space and the guildhouse was, but as he was not using teleport crystals, it appeared that they were still inside the guildhouse.</p>
<p>Normally it was possible to teleport freely from a guildhouse, but when attacked by enemies the teleport function was turned off, to make it impossible to run away immediately. The remaining options were just two: to escape or to beat back the enemy.</p>
<p>Always concealed, Shin activated 【Enchant – Magic Boost】 and jumped over the group’s location. Without an instant of hesitation, he fired the spell.</p>
<p>“Die.”</p>
<p>【Elemental Blast】, a spell including seven different elements.</p>
<p>Flames, water, earth, wind, thunder, light and darkness all bared their fangs at the running PKs.</p>
<p>Some were burned to ashes, others were skewered, swallowed or torn to shreds.</p>
<p>Utter, unbridled destruction. The group Shin attacked was not allowed the slightest chance to counterattack, struck by a completely one-sided attack that reduced it literally to nothingness.</p>
<p>Shin checked that there were no survivors, then started running again. He used 【Ki Manipulation】 to boost his physical abilities and traversed the guildhouse in an instant.</p>
<p>“Shadow!!!”</p>
<p>He frantically charged in the room where Shadow’s response was. Gargalla’s response was no more.</p>
<p>The kneeling Shadow turned his face towards him. Something bright was trickling down it.</p>
<p>Shin saw that his few remaining HP were decreasing and felt that Shadow had completed his revenge. He quickly understood that Shadow had used the 『Miracle Drug of Blinking Life』.</p>
<p>Shadow looked at Shin with eyes that looked like dying flames. His lips moved as he tried to say something.</p>
<p>“Don’t…end…like..th…”</p>
<p>He couldn’t finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Shadow burst into a mass of polygons before Shin’s eyes. The twinkling shapes were so bright and beautiful it was difficult to imagine that they meant someone’s death.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Shin understood what Shadow was trying to say and fell silent.</p>
<p>As Shin had been thinking about Shadow, Shadow too had been probably thinking about him.</p>
<p>“Hyaaahh!!”</p>
<p>“…..tch.”</p>
<p>Shin clicked his tongue as his silhouette became a blur.</p>
<p>Even if he felt down, his blade would not become dull. The PK that had attacked him from behind turned into a mass of polygons as he touched the ground, unaware that he had been cut down.</p>
<p>All players were supposed to be the same when they died. The last moments of that PK, though, looked like tainted poison in Shin’s eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 4 – Part 1</p>
<p>After bringing down Ouroboros, Shin returned to Avidya’s headquarters.</p>
<p>As he entered, the eyes of all present turned to him. While there were some individual differences, most gazes were still turbid and sullen, but much less than they were a month before.</p>
<p>“Welcome back. I see you’ve kept your word.”</p>
<p>Calmia’s tone seemed brighter than usual.</p>
<p>“Not exactly, our side suffered losses too.”</p>
<p>“….so that’s why he’s not there by your side.”</p>
<p>Shin’s expression didn’t change as he spoke, but Calmia stopped breathing for a second before talking. She didn’t know about Shadow’s death yet, apparently.</p>
<p>Probably because they had heard the conversation, the surrounding people started whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>“Did he get his revenge?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he looked really satisfied.”</p>
<p>“I see. That’s good, then. That’s the reason we all gathered here, after all.”</p>
<p>Calmia looked sad, but relieved at the same time. Avidya was a guild formed by members that swore to exact their revenge. Even if they died in the process, as long as they had achieved their goal, guild members would praise them rather than mourn their loss.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Calmia asked Shin after taking his hand. Her expression suggested that she was worried about him. From her hand, however, no warmth could be felt.</p>
<p>“When the person next to them falls, some stop going forward. There is not much I can do, but consoling such people is one of my duties.”</p>
<p>Shin understood well enough what Calmia meant by “consoling”. She “could not do much” because of the restrictions imposed by the game.</p>
<p>“No problem. Shadow carried his convictions through to the end. I’ll just do what I set out to do.”</p>
<p>Shin’s hand, that Calmia had placed against her ample bust, was pulled away with enough strength as to not seem unkind. Even though his beloved, Marino, was no longer with him, he didn’t feel the urge to approach other women.</p>
<p>Shin lightly glared at Calmia, who quickly apologized.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I bothered you. You probably don’t know, but Ouroboros was responsible for my little brother’s death too. I’m really thankful to you for what you have done. This is pretty much all I can do to express my gratitude.”</p>
<p>Shin now understood the reasons behind her actions.Although her hands were pushed away, Calmia looked straight at Shin, tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>“We’re just using each other. There’s no need to express gratitude or anything.”</p>
<p>“Even so, I want to.”</p>
<p>Shin’s expression was still unchanged, but Calmia smiled at him. Shin clicked his tongue and turned away.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose we went off topic a bit too much. I have something to tell you today.”</p>
<p>“You should have said that first.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I was honestly shocked by what happened to Shadow, and I wanted to give my thanks to you for avenging my little brother.”</p>
<p>“Fine, fine. So, what do you have for me?”</p>
<p>Calmia’s expression turned completely serious when she answered Shin’s question.</p>
<p>“We are still in the middle of investigating Vlad, but we found Robin in the process. The priority’s lower than Vlad’s, but you were looking for him too, right?”</p>
<p>After starting the PK hunt, Shin’s hostility had focused so much on Vlad that he had almost forgotten about him. After hearing Robin’s name, the aura enveloping Shin suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Despite being inside a game, several members felt this abrupt transformation and flinched.</p>
<p>According to Avidya’s research, Robin did not belong to any PK guild, so it was clear that he had not killed any players yet.</p>
<p>Robin had kidnapped Marino and handed her to Vlad though. Because of this, he was one of the people Shin wanted to take revenge against.</p>
<p>“I’ll go right now. Where is he?”</p>
<p>The words coming out of Shin’s mouth sounded completely different from before. His expression didn’t change, but his tone now sounded much darker and fiercer.</p>
<p>“Calm down. The hounds are keeping track of him, so if something happens I’ll know right away.”</p>
<p>Shin learned of Robin’s whereabouts from Calmia, materialized his katana and left the guildhouse.</p>
<p>With his figure concealed, Shin walked through dimly lit streets and back alleys, like a wandering ghost, like a god of death.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Guided by the information obtained from Calmia, Shin arrived at a woodland area to the north of Kalkia. The woods were quiet, the low-leveled monsters within prowling about silently.</p>
<p>It was a location that rarely saw strong monsters and did not have any particular events associated with it, so it only contained a few lodges and nothing more.</p>
<p>“Robin is apparently using the third lodge as his base. No one knows what exactly he’s doing though, as he never leaves it.”</p>
<p>”I see. I’ll go by myself, please stay out of this.”</p>
<p>“Of course. There’s no one in Avidya that would get in your way now. Just let me stand by here, in case anything happens, all right?”</p>
<p>Saying this, the Hound concealed himself. Shin’s detection field registered his presence, but there was no need to point that out. Shin turned his back to the man and headed towards the lodges. The area was outside any hometown, making buildings and players susceptible to attacks.</p>
<p>In Shin’s map, the players inside the lodges were showed clearly. They were not friends or support characters however, so their names were not displayed.</p>
<p>The Hound’s information was surely correct, but to be completely sure Shin started from breaking down the 【Wall】 and 【Barrier】 erected around the lodge.</p>
<p>“Type V, huh. I guess it’s enough for a place like this, but it’s still too frail.”</p>
<p>Shin’s hands did not need to reach 『True Moon』, hanging from his waist; his left hand cut through the air in a rough motion and, with the sharp sound of glass breaking, the barriers protecting the lodge were destroyed.</p>
<p>A player from the neighboring lodge, alarmed by the sound, came out to see what was going on.</p>
<p>“W-what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Taking my revenge, you got a problem with that?”</p>
<p>“…..leave my lodge alone, all right?”</p>
<p>Maybe because he had sensed the aura Shin emitted, the player who had come out trembled and quickly turned back to his lodge after meekly voicing his request to Shin.</p>
<p>The player in the lodge on the opposite side had probably heard this exchange, because he closed the windows without the smallest protest.</p>
<p>Looking at the map, Shin noticed that a player was exiting the lodge on the side opposite to where Shin was.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Shin moved his right hand through the air and struck. The lodge crumbled on the player who had attempted to escape.</p>
<p>Shin walked closer to the wrecked lodge and found Robin under a fallen log.</p>
<p>“Y-You are…”</p>
<p>Robin had likely realized that the man standing before him was Shin. His expression warped with fear.</p>
<p>“You know what I’m here for, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I-I had no other choice!! I would have been ruined, you know!! I have a family to raise in the real world. That man was the only one I could trust to change things!!“</p>
<p>“First of all, where is Vlad?”</p>
<p>Shin’s question utterly ignored Robin’s desperate excuses. Robin had cooperated with Vlad, so he might know about his whereabouts.</p>
<p>“I d-don’t know anything…I haven’t met that man…Vlad, since then. He won’t answer my contacts either…we were never close anyway. He just u-used me!! I’m a victim here!!”</p>
<p>Seeing that Shin did not move an eyebrow while listening, Robin hurriedly changed the subject. His eyes darted everywhere, frantically looking for a way to escape.</p>
<p>The weapon at his waist was still in its sheath, untouched. Shin, however, could kill Robin faster than the latter could take out a crystal and teleport away.</p>
<p>Either Shin allowed him to go or someone else had to act as a decoy while he escaped. In all other cases, this was the end of the line for Robin.</p>
<p>“You have no idea where Vlad could be?”</p>
<p>“I, I, I didn’t know something like that would happen!! He didn’t tell me that he would kill her!! We even had recovery potions for the status ailment!! If you would have just accepted—”</p>
<p>Robin’s excuses stopped abruptly, followed by the acute sound of a katana resting again in its sheath.</p>
<p>Judging from Robin’s behavior and the current situation, it was clear that he had indeed only been used.</p>
<p>If so, there was no point in leaving him alive another moment. With his head detached from his torso, Robin disappeared in a burst of polygons, but Shin didn’t spare a glance and turned away from the pile of rubble that used to be Robin’s lodge.</p>
<p>As Shin was leaving, a bright voice, in strident contrast with the location, stopped him.</p>
<p>“So the rumors were true! You’ve become pretty good at cutting people down.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Shin turned towards the voice without a word. There he found a petite, young-looking girl with short white hair and big, round eyes.</p>
<p>She was wearing an oriental garb with rather high skin exposure. This stressed the mounds on her chest, which were already too pronounced for her physique. However, what stood out the most was the giant poleaxe, almost as long as the girl was tall, wielded by her tiny hands.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t need to cast 【Analyze】 to know who this unique combination was.</p>
<p>“Milt.”</p>
<p>“Long time no see. When was the last time we met, three months ago maybe?”</p>
<p>Milt approached Shin with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>Milt herself was a PK, but a rare case; she was not included in Avidya’s target list. The reason was that she killed only in self-defense or during duels to the death that both parties agreed to.</p>
<p>She was treated as a PK because, if her opponent agreed to fight to the death, she would kill without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me?”</p>
<p>“I heard you were looking for Vlad, so—”</p>
<p>Milt stopped halfway through the sentence; Shin had closed in on her in a second, grabbed her by the neck and pushed her down to the ground, 『True Moon』’s cold blade on her neck.</p>
<p>“If you know anything, talk.”</p>
<p>“Ha, haha! The Shin I see now will be OK, I guess”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Don’t leer at me like that. I’ll tell you everything.”</p>
<p>Milt let go of her poleaxe and raised both hands. When Shin withdrew 『True Moon』, she let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve looked everywhere too, but he won’t be found easily. Because he probably has no intention of attacking anyone now. It’s not possible to catch him in the act again.”</p>
<p>“How can you be so sure?”</p>
<p>“Well, he managed to warp his greatest prey with his own hands, after all. He’s not going to risk killing others and have their deaths overwrite that experience.”</p>
<p>Milt talked of something Shin could not comprehend. To burn people’s deaths into your memory was already far too depraved for him.</p>
<p>“Vlad was obsessed about you more than anything. He’s likely been observing you and gloating, I guess. You’re in a state close to what he called ‘the ideal’ last time we talked after all. He’d probably be glad even if he’s found and killed by you.”</p>
<p>“Disgusting bastard.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to understand people like that, you know.”</p>
<p>Milt’s shoulders dropped as she talked. Shin had no intention of understanding either, so he urged her to continue.</p>
<p>“Vlad’s keeping track of your movements. His main job, Dragon Knight, is one that stands out easily, but his sub is Ninja. He switched main and sub job now, to hide better. Ninjas have the best concealment abilities among all scout-type jobs, after all. He’s using all sorts of items and equipment to hide, so he won’t be easy to find.”</p>
<p>“You mean that he’s watching now too?”</p>
<p>“Probably, with binoculars or something like that. Well, that would mean the plan I thought about would work though.”</p>
<p>Milt spoke plainly. Shin tried to extend his detection field to the max, but could not find any players other than Milt and the lodge players whose presence he had confirmed before; no trace of Vlad.</p>
<p>As Milt had said, if he was using items and skills specialized for seeing long distances, it could be possible to observe locations even from outside detection fields.</p>
<p>Milt’s theory was not too bizarre after all; it could not be discarded as improbable.</p>
<p>“What’s your plan, then?”</p>
<p>“For me to join up with you. I’m pretty strong myself, but still nothing special compared to you. If he sees someone like me getting all close and personal—.”</p>
<p>“He’ll come to stop it, huh.”</p>
<p>“Bingo. Shin stopped hunting PKs to flirt with some broad. Vlad wouldn’t stand for that, I’m positive.”</p>
<p>Milt’s plan was to use Vlad’s obsession against him, to lure him out in the open.</p>
<p>“Won’t he be more alert if you’re involved?”</p>
<p>Unlike Marino, Milt could fight. If that was the case, Vlad might not think that Shin had given up on fighting for flirting.</p>
<p>“I was good friends with Mari, actually. We never really talked about it, so it’s not strange for you not to know.”</p>
<p>“You…and Marino?”</p>
<p>Shin furrowed his brow at Milt’s words. He had never heard anything of the sort from Marino.</p>
<p>“Yes, it happened by chance, because our situations in real life are pretty similar. We couldn’t say anything openly…but we talked a lot just between the two of us. Mari was sick, wasn’t she? In real life, I’m actually stuck on a hospital bed too…but the only other one who knows about this is Lucky Cat’s Catnip.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>
<p>Catnip knew about Marino too. The “Milmeow” she had mentioned before was Milt, then.</p>
<p>“Vlad had researched Mari thoroughly. I don’t know how he found out, but he knew about the connection between us. He asked me about her himself, so there’s no mistake about that”</p>
<p>Milt knew so much about Vlad because she had used the PK’s information network, not the normal players’ or the revengers’. The PKs were wary of her though, so she could only obtain limited information. Shin’s PK hunt had caused serious damage to the network.</p>
<p>“He shouldn’t find it too weird for me to take Mari’s place then. It could provoke him even more. I don’t dislike flirting in public, so there’s that too.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Milt tried wrapping her arm around Shin’s, but the latter stepped back to avoid her approach and thought about what to do.</p>
<p>Avidya’s hounds hadn’t found any useful information about Vlad. It was originally difficult to retrieve information about PKs not belonging to any organization. He could have asked Calmia could act as his partner in this operation, but in a dangerous situation, she couldn’t protect herself.</p>
<p>“If it means hunting him down, I can do this.”</p>
<p>Shin concluded that it was worth trying even if the plan would turn unsuccessful and agreed to Milt’s proposal.</p>
<p>“OK, I don’t mean to ask for this in return, but I have a request too. May I?”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“After Vlad is taken care of, I want you to fight me. To the death.”</p>
<p>Shin peered at Milt with surprise and suspicion in his eyes.</p>
<p>Milt said “to the death”, but as long as she didn’t pull off a series of incredible feats, she had no hope of winning. A duel to the death would have been suicide for her.</p>
<p>“If you just want to die, do it somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“I want you to be my last, Shin. Because I don’t want to go back to reality.”</p>
<p>“….let’s go to Tsuki no Hokora first, then talk more. This isn’t the right place.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Shin temporarily formed a party with Milt and returned to Kalkia via teleportation, then chain teleported to Tsuki no Hokora.</p>
<p>“Welcome back.”</p>
<p>Schnee welcomed Shin home, but Shin walked passed her without a word, had Milt sit down in the living room, and started preparing tea.</p>
<p>“….what?”</p>
<p>“Ah, er, you look quite used to it, I was just thinking.”</p>
<p>Milt was slightly surprised to see Shin prepare tea for them both.</p>
<p>“Anyone can make tea. Rather than that, let’s pick up where we left off.”</p>
<p>Shin took a sip of tea, then urged Milt to continue.</p>
<p>“As I said before, I’m stuck in a bed in real life. I can’t live if I’m not hooked to machines. I can speak, but my arms and legs won’t move like I want them to. I had to come to this world to finally understand how freely a body can move. But no matter how much I move here, reality doesn’t change. No…maybe because I had a taste of freedom here, reality became even harsher for me.”</p>
<p>For Milt, just staying alive meant having to pay expensive medical fees.</p>
<p>She could live on, thanks to her parents’ hard work, but looking at her parents growing thinner and more emaciated as she grew up, her heart couldn’t stand it anymore.</p>
<p>“We were never rich, so paying the hospital fees to keep me alive has always been a huge burden on them. Mom and Dad are always smiling, but that made it all even more painful. I…I could feel it. Their hands caressing mine…growing thinner and weaker over time.”</p>
<p>Modern medicine couldn’t cure Milt’s disease. Either her parents would reach their limit first, or Milt would.</p>
<p>“I have a little brother too, but it looks like he’s unhappy with my parents caring about me so much. If I’m not around anymore, all their love will go to him. The financial burden will also disappear — good things all around.”</p>
<p>“In a documentary on TV, I saw parents say that they’re happy just to see their child alive. From the standpoint of someone being kept alive, it’s not like that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to say that everyone sees it like I do, nor do I think so. My head’s the only thing working perfectly, so maybe I think too much…making them sad would be painful, of course, but….”</p>
<p>Milt was asking to be killed, but there was no sadness in her view.</p>
<p>“If you think so, then wouldn’t suicide be an option? It might be impossible in real life, but in this world you could end your life yourself.”</p>
<p>“I thought about it at first, but…but thinking of killing myself with my own hands is too scary. So I thought about having someone do it for me.”</p>
<p>Milt wished to die, but death was still terrifying. Milt herself admitted what a contradiction that was.</p>
<p>“I can forget about that fear in battle. I want to die while feeling truly alive.”</p>
<p>That was one reason why she had continued seeking duels to the death.</p>
<p>“…you won’t regret it?”</p>
<p>Shin released a wave of pure killing intent, which blew through Milt’s hair like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Yup. I couldn’t do anything myself…but this, only this, I’ve decided it on my own.”</p>
<p>The killing intent unleashed upon Milt was enough to make any average player turn pale and shake violently, but she did not even bat an eyelash.</p>
<p>Even PKs, used to end others’ lives, saw fear rear its ugly head when death approached. Milt had mentioned being scared of death, but to Shin, it seemed that she had completely accepted it.</p>
<p>The emotions he felt from Milt contained imbalance, yes, but also great tranquility. Somehow, she reminded him of Marino.</p>
<p>“Got it. Once we’re done with Vlad, I’ll be your opponent.”</p>
<p>For Marino and Milt, death has always been very close. They had had a longer, deeper relationship with it than Shin ever could.</p>
<p>Shin had killed a great number of PKs. One more wouldn’t be a problem at this point.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Let’s get the plan moving right away then! Back to town for some lovey-doveying!”</p>
<p>After thanking Shin, Milt’s enlightened atmosphere vanished somewhere as her mood turned to hyper excitement.</p>
<p>She now grabbed Shin’s arm firmly, determined not to let him go this time.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Shin, silently watching Milt holding his hand and guiding him, teleported back to Kalkia.</p>
<p>Eager to show their intimacy as clearly as possible, Milt had wrapped her left arm around Shin’s right arm. Leaving the choice of their destination to Milt, Shin contacted Calmia via chat.</p>
<p>“(I have something to tell you about.)”</p>
<p>“(Oh my, it must be the first time you sent me a direct chat.)”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t go to Avidya’s guildhouse with Milt in tow. As they wanted to pretend that he had given up on revenge, visiting that blood-drenched place was out of the question.</p>
<p>“(If there are any guild members with grudges against Vlad, I want you to tell them something)”</p>
<p>Shin explained to Calmia about Milt’s plan and the circumstances leading to it, lastly asking her to relay this. He had talked with Milt and decided how to finish Vlad.</p>
<p>“(—I see. Your method will definitely be really humiliating for Vlad. I’ll tell them.)”</p>
<p>“(Please do. I’ll contact you if there are any movements.)”</p>
<p>Shin cut off the chat and asked Milt where they were going. He had been focusing on the chat, his legs moving to automatically follow Milt.</p>
<p>“Catnip’s place, there are always a lot of people there after all. Perfect for rumors to spread.”</p>
<p>“Aah, I see.”</p>
<p>Catnip’s store, Lucky Cat, was a favorite destination of Shin and Marino’s. Many players there knew Shin’s face, even if they weren’t aware of his strength. Being a confectionery, most of the visitors were female players. If he went there, hand in hand with a female player other than Marino, rumors and conjectures would surely spread very quickly.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t think that Vlad was observing him at all hours; but if he caught wind of such a rumor, whether he acted or not, he would surely become restless.</p>
<p>“OK, will he move then?”</p>
<p>Shin felt that it would be great if anything was born from this. He had listened seriously when Milt talked about her situation, but not even the Hounds had managed to pick up any hints about Vlad, so he doubted Vlad would exhibit the kind of careless behavior Milt suggested.</p>
<p>For the current plan to succeed, that was a necessary condition. If Vlad had already lost interest in Shin, the plan would be completely useless.</p>
<p>“He will.”</p>
<p>Shin had whispered to himself, but Milt replied with confidence. Shin didn’t know what exactly made her so sure.</p>
<p>“Obsession is something that doesn’t just go away, not even if you think you’ve had enough. He staged something so huge for you and saw you change, he’s not going to be able to just turn the page on it.”</p>
<p>Milt stated her thoughts firmly, a serious expression on her face.</p>
<p>At the same time they had arrived at the Lucky Cat, so before Shin could say anything Milt had opened the door to the store.</p>
<p>The interior of the store was mostly the same as Shin remembered from his last visit, crowded as usual by female players.</p>
<p>Among them, wearing cat ears and tail, Catnip was serving her customers.</p>
<p>“Meow meow!? Shimeow and Milmeow, now this is a rare duo! Long time no see, both of you.”</p>
<p>Catnip noticed Shin and Milt and approached them with her usual “cat-like” talk.</p>
<p>Her gaze towards Shin, despite the peppy tone of her voice, was melancholic. She knew what he had been doing for the past month, surely.</p>

<p>“We talked via chat, though. We haven’t met face to face like this since about one month ago, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Because you never stay in one place, Milmeow. Finding you would be a miracle, meow…but more than that, I’m more interested to know why you two are so friendly, meow? You look just like lovers, meow?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe…that’s exactly what we are!!”</p>
<p>Milt squeezed her body even closer to Shin and made this declaration with a louder tone of voice. Shin felt multiple eyes on him and looked around, noticing that most gazes were fixated on his arm.</p>
<p>Staring at his left arm were all the (few) male players present and some of the female ones.</p>
<p>The male players’ stares burned holes in Milt’s watermelon-like assets pressed on Shin’s left arm.</p>
<p>Shin considered Milt’s presence as just one part of the plan, so he decided to smile in order for the rumors to spread even more easily.</p>
<p>“Meowhat!? So even Shimeow fell to the charm of Milmeow’s breasts!? Open your eyes, meow!! Small girls with watermelon chests don’t exist in real life!! I know the truth, meow. That chest is a lie!”</p>
<p>“You’re horrible!! Let me dream in this game world at least!!”</p>
<p>“What are you two saying…”</p>
<p>Shin gave a tired look at the two and the absurd conflict they had started.</p>
<p>“(I’ve heard everything. I’ll do what I can to help.)”</p>
<p>Shin had noticed that she was acting far too strange, and his suspicions were confirmed when Catnip sent him a chat.</p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine from the noisily meowing silhouette before his eyes, but the voice that reached his mind was cold and dry. Her melancholic eyes also contained a somewhat cold streak.</p>
<p>“(Catnip, you shouldn’t make eyes like that.)”</p>
<p>Shin was not in a position to tell others, though. Catnip, however, was someone Marino had been friends with. Shin himself felt that he had become less liable to emotional changes after Marino’s death, but he felt that he had to say it.</p>
<p>After showing off for a while, they purchased a few items and left Lucky Cat.</p>
<p>The rumors were probably already spreading; Shin felt more and more eyes fixed on them.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 4 – Part 2</p>
<p>About one week after Shin and Milt started their plan, it began.</p>
<p>Even in the orphanage, a place where rumors rarely spread, the news of Shin’s PK hunt had reached the children’s ears.</p>
<p>“I told you already, big bro Shin is fighting so that no one will be a victim anymore. It’s a bad thing, yeah, but.”</p>
<p>“There’s no police in this world anyway.”</p>
<p>Some didn’t share such feelings, though.</p>
<p>“Bu-but Shin is doing dangerous things.”</p>
<p>Despite knowing that PK hunting meant killing people -so it was a bad thing- Teppei and Ryohei claimed it was unavoidable. Luca wasn’t convinced however.</p>
<p>Despite her young age, Luca knew how terrifying PKs could be. That was precisely the reason why she was worried about Shin’s safety, endangered by his proactive hunting of the PKs.</p>
<p>Today, she was sitting at the orphanage’s gates.</p>
<p>“After he defeats all the PKs, he’ll come back…I think.”</p>
<p>“Ryohei, don’t talk like you really know.”</p>
<p>“Hey, what else can I do? The grownups won’t tell us anything else!”</p>
<p>“Shin, won’t you come back? We can’t meet anymore…?”</p>
<p>After listening to Teppei and Ryohei’s conversation, Luca’s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>The two boys hurriedly tried to calm her down and went to call an adult to confirm that Shin would return.</p>
<p>“Uuuh…”</p>
<p>Luca wiped her tears with her sleeves and raised her head. In front of her stood the gate she stared at every day since the attack one month ago.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>A thought developed in Luca’s head.</p>
<p>She didn’t know when, if ever, Shin would come to the orphanage again. If so, she should just go meet him.</p>
<p>It was still a little past nine in the morning; there was plenty of time.</p>
<p>The adults didn’t allow children to go out of the orphanage on their own. However, there was no one around now, so she could sneak out.</p>
<p>Luca looked around, confirmed that there really wasn’t anyone in the surroundings, and quickly sprinted away. She hurried through the orphanage’s gate and hid on the opposite side. Now she couldn’t be seen from the inside.</p>
<p>“Oh? Aren’t you one of Shin’s little friends?”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>The sudden voice made Luca jolt. Timidly, she looked in the direction of the voice and saw a smiling young man. He had said Shin’s name, so maybe they knew each other.</p>
<p>“Oh, I apologize for surprising you. I was looking for Shin, so I was wondering if you might know where he is.”</p>
<p>“Me too…I’m looking for Shin now.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? So you’ll go look for him in town?”</p>
<p>“Everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Everywhere? You mean, in the field and in dungeons too?”</p>
<p>Luca answered the young man’s question by forming two tiny fists and nodding.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“However, it seems dangerous for someone of your level to go in the field, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Luca had been dragged into the death game after her account had been created just to fill in a spot. As a result, she barely knew anything about how the game worked, having stayed in town since her first login. She couldn’t understand what the young man meant.</p>
<p>“Hmm…oh? Looks the like the orphanage is getting noisy. Could it be that you snuck out?”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>The young man’s guess made Luca’s body shrink. Ryohei or Teppei were probably calling for her. She could hear Emil’s voice too.</p>
<p>“Did you want to see Shin so much that you snuck out of the orphanage?”</p>
<p>“….Yes.”</p>
<p>Luca silently nodded to the young man’s sudden question.</p>
<p>Shin might disappear, like her brother and his friends did, like Marino did. Luca didn’t want to do nothing and just be separated like that.</p>
<p>“Hmm…hmm…oh, fine. I was looking for Shin too after all. Why don’t you come with me? The frontlines have turned quieter since he left, so lately things have been pretty boring.”</p>
<p>“Ehm…”</p>
<p>“If we stay here, someone from the orphanage will come soon, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ah…er…I’ll go!!”</p>
<p>Any average player would be wary of following someone they’d met for the first time. Luca, however, was urged on by hearing the voices from the orphanage, growing closer and closer, and her desire to see Shin, so she ended up nodding to the young man’s proposal.</p>
<p>The young man, with a bigger smile, took Luca’s hand and started walking away. They quickly became lost in the crowd, and impossible to find for anyone from the orphanage.</p>
<p>“What is your name?”</p>
<p>Luca remembered that she hadn’t heard the name of the young man walking with her, so she looked up at him and asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t introduce myself, did I. My name is Hameln. Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>The young man—-Hameln introduced himself.</p>
<p>Hameln, one of the masterminds behind the recent tragedy, smiled innocently as he led Luca through the crowd at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>“Well then, let me ask straight away, do you have any idea where Shin could be?”</p>
<p>“He talked a lot about clearing dungeons…”</p>
<p>Hameln, with Luca in tow, was walking through Kalkia’s main street. Being an MPK, a PK that used monsters to kill other players, his name and face were not known.</p>
<p>“Hmm, they say he’s hunting down PKs, so he’s probably outside the hometown.”</p>
<p>Hameln, holding his chin, started thinking.</p>
<p>Using an information broker was an option, but there was a high chance that the same broker would sell the information of Hameln’s visit to others. There was the chance for Shin to come to him because of that, but Hameln thought that it was still too early to meet him.</p>
<p>His visit to the orphanage was to confirm if Shin continued to hunt PKs even after crushing the largest guild.</p>
<p>Vlad, the man who snatched away Shin’s beloved, was still alive. Hameln thought that he would contact Shin after he was done with Vlad.</p>
<p>“A dangerous place?”</p>
<p>“For Shin, the dungeons available now are still safe enough. The only exceptions could be the bosses, I suppose. But I don’t think that Shin would fight bosses now, so there’s no danger.”</p>
<p>Hameln wouldn’t say anything to further Luca’s concerns; for him, Luca was in the position of someone to protect.</p>
<p>What Hameln wanted to observe was the will of people when facing against adversities. Most small children died before being able to show such willpower.</p>
<p>For this, he would protect her. To assess her willpower while fighting against the adversity that, one day, would surely visit her.</p>
<p>That was the only important thing. He was the one to create the adversities to show the will to fight against, but if, as a result, the child died without showing that willpower, it wouldn’t faze Hameln in the slightest.</p>
<p>His own desires were everything to him. That was the kind of player Hameln was.</p>
<p>“I guess we have no other choice. Let’s try betting on the piece of information I heard.”</p>
<p>Hameln’s shoulders dropped, and he walked forward again. The destination was a place with very few people, an area where several lodges stood. According to the information Hameln obtained, it was where Robin, a man who collaborated with Vlad, was supposed to live.</p>
<p>“You look pale, young lady, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“…..I’m okay.”</p>
<p>Despite Luca’s answer, she did not look okay at all. As it turns out, she had received messages and calls in her chat asking where she was.</p>
<p>In this world, much like the real one, it was very easy to contact others. Luca had followed Hameln, pushed by the situation’s momentum, but thinking calmly about it, she was now afraid to be yelled at.</p>
<p>Sneaking out of the orphanage to go look for Shin seemed like proof of courage, but now she was imagining the adults yelling at her, and she trembled. She had appeared resolute at first, but she had just followed her impulses. Luca was, after all, just a child.</p>
<p>“Let’s say you were kidnapped, then.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>While Luca was still reeling from the surprise, Hameln sent a message to Emil.</p>
<p>The message’s contents said, “I am going to use Luca to stop Shin”. For Hameln, who was used to being hated, being treated like a kidnapper was nothing he was concerned about.</p>
<p>“With this, at least they won’t yell at you for sneaking out. They’ll be more worried, but that can’t be helped, I guess. Ah, you should say in chat that you’re being threatened.”</p>
<p>Hameln was talking of very serious things, but continued with his casual tone.</p>
<p>“Why do you help me?”</p>
<p>“Help? That’s not right, I’m afraid. I’m not here with you because I want to help you after all. I just think that, for Shin, for a person in his current state, the emotional words of a child like you would be more effective than an adult’s realism-imbued speeches.”</p>
<p>Young age, surprisingly, works wonders as a weapon. After adding this final comment only to himself, Hameln asked Luca a question.</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s too late to say this now, but I am planning to use you. But, now and only now, I can let you go free. What will you do? Will you come with me? Or will you go back to the orphanage?”</p>
<p>Hameln repeated the question he had first asked Luca at the orphanage. Waiting to hear what her young will would choose, Hameln grinned.</p>
<p>“…I, I go. I will go together. If I don’t…Shin will go somewhere far.”</p>
<p>Luca answered while shaking slightly.</p>
<p>Hearing her answer, Hameln’s smile widened.</p>
<p>“Is this a woman’s instinct, I wonder? Or maybe, you know even if you don’t actually understand it.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Hameln voiced his thoughts out loud without realizing it. He then changed topic with an ambiguous smile.</p>
<p>“Shall we go, then?”</p>
<p>“Where do we go?”</p>
<p>“A place where he might be. Well, the information is old, so I can’t be sure though.”</p>
<p>His shoulders dropping again, Hameln summoned one of his contract beasts. A magic circle appeared on the ground and a blue tiger-type monster about two mels long, a Weyger, appeared.</p>
<p>Its fangs and claws were of a transparent blue hue, two large strands of white hair extended from its forehead over its back. Its level was 423. For Luca, just being pushed by its paws would reduce her HP to zero.</p>
<p>“Eek!?”</p>
<p>Luca’s body shrank in fear at the sight of the Weyger’s sudden appearance.</p>
<p>“Don’t be scared, this is just our means of transport.”</p>
<p>Following Hameln’s orders, the Weyger crouched down. The monster looked up at Luca, as if it was telling her “hop on, miss”.</p>
<p>“The faster we can move, the better. Please, get on.”</p>
<p>Encouraged by Hameln, Luca timidly mounted the Weyger. The monster made sure that Luca firmly grabbed its fur, stood back up slowly, and started walking next to Hameln.</p>
<p>“It’s so fluffy.”</p>
<p>“Gaarfn.”</p>
<p>Luca rode, hugging the Weyger’s back. The feeling of the monster’s soft fur was probably very pleasant, as she looked giddy now.</p>
<p>They Weyger snorted proudly, as if it was boasting about the quality of its fur.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty popular as a pet too, after all.”</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>To Hameln, instead, the monster snarled as if clicking its tongue.</p>
<p>“Okay then, our destination is just ahead. I set the Weyger so as to protect you, so don’t go far from it, okay?”</p>
<p>Hameln checked that the monsters at the destination were of a level much lower than the Weyger.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Gaarf!”</p>
<p>The Weyger growled, as if saying “leave it to me!”</p>
<p>“I guess monsters have likes and dislikes too?”</p>
<p>Puzzled by the Weygar showing a very different reaction to Luca than to himself, Hameln walked on. Soon enough, several small lodges appeared.</p>
<p>“I suppose we arrived too late. My my…the information was old, so I guess I should have made sure he was alive first.”</p>
<p>Hameln whispered while rubbing his chin in front of a completely wrecked lodge.</p>
<p>The information he had obtained stated that Robin lived in one of the area’s lodges.</p>
<p>There was no guarantee that Robin was in the ruined lodge, so Hameln decided to gather information in the surroundings.</p>
<p>“My apologies, I would like to ask you something.”</p>
<p>Hameln told Luca to wait and knocked at the door of the lodge next to the ruined one. A few seconds later, a pudgy male player appeared from inside.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a person, do you happen to know a player named Robin?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you knew the neighbor guy?”</p>
<p>The man’s answer suggested that the inhabitant of the collapsed lodge was indeed Robin. Hameln denied and the man continued.</p>
<p>“You didn’t? Well, whatever. It happened a couple days ago, a player with a katana wrecked the house all of a sudden. It made no sense to me to feel something like that in a game, but…I felt it for real. Killing intent. He looked real dangerous, so I thought I should leave him alone and hid inside right away. They talked for a while…but the guy inside, in the end, went like this.”</p>
<p>The man made a horizontal sliding gesture across his neck with his hand.</p>
<p>The meaning was probably that the head had been cut off. The two talked a little more, but there was no clue about Shin’s possible next destination.</p>
<p>“Is that so…thank you very much for your time.”</p>
<p>Hameln bowed deeply and closed the door.</p>
<p>“Shin isn’t here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it appears to be so. The only hint left is that rumor, then…”</p>
<p>“Rumor?”</p>
<p>“They say that Shin has a new girlfriend, and that they flirt in public with no shame at all…honestly, I can’t believe that Shin would get a new girlfriend now though.”</p>
<p>If large PK guilds still remained, he might have trusted his instincts and waited in ambush. The only ones remaining, however, were very small ones and solo players, so that plan was unusable.</p>
<p>Hameln couldn’t use information brokers either, so the last resort was to rely on a rumor he found repugnant.</p>
<p>“He’s in a place with many people?”</p>
<p>“That would be natural. But even as a rumor, it concerns me that it spread so quickly.”</p>
<p>It felt almost as if it was being spread on purpose.</p>
<p>“…ooh, I see, so that’s the plan.”</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Hameln realized something and suddenly looked very convinced.</p>
<p>Even if he was going around crushing PK guilds, Shin’s main target was still Vlad. Hameln, who knew both, realized what Shin’s true aim probably was.</p>
<p>“Do you know where Shin is?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I know yet. But I figured out what he’s trying to do. I wanted to do this without Vlad knowing, but if I say I will cooperate we can probably get information out of him.”</p>
<p>Hameln sent Vlad a message immediately.</p>
<p>“(Hello, it’s been quite a while. There’s something I would like to ask you, could you please spare some time for me?)”</p>
<p>When Vlad answered the chat, he appeared very irritated. Hameln, thinking that his behaviour exceeded his expectations, greeted him.</p>
<p>“(What do you want from me then? You of all people wouldn’t contact me without a purpose.)”</p>
<p>“(Well, that is true. I wanted to have a chat with Shin, do you have any idea where he could be? I caught wind of a strange rumor, so I thought that you might know more about that too.)”</p>
<p>“(I know. That woman is getting ahead of herself, isn’t she.)”</p>
<p>Hameln thought that the situation was bound to move rather quickly and smiled to himself.</p>
<p>Where had his peerless caution gone to? Vlad acted very differently from the last time Hameln spoke to him.</p>
<p>With most of the PKs exterminated, organizing large-scale operations required a great number of people and resources. The PKs with high fighting power, especially, had been carefully eliminated, so it was impossible to trick them to use them as assassins either.</p>
<p>“(Your cooperation during the invasion was valuable, so if you tell me his whereabouts, I can help you. I still have the items too.)”</p>
<p>“(What do you plan to do when you meet him?)”</p>
<p>Vlad probably instantly calculated that Hameln could have helped bolster his inferior fighting power; his voice sounded much more collected than before.</p>
<p>“(I just wish to talk with him. I doubt things will end peacefully though.)”</p>
<p>“(You’ll just get killed if you do.)”</p>
<p>“(I can probably buy some time if I use my monsters as shields. I’m just interested in what he’s actually thinking at present.)”</p>
<p>“(….so be it. I will contact you once I have a plan.)”</p>
<p>From Vlad’s tone of voice, Hameln perceived that Vlad had decided that he was going to make use of Hameln.</p>
<p>Hameln became an MPK because he wanted to observe the willpower and emotions of players when attacked by monsters. He was thus very skilled at reading others’ emotions.</p>
<p>The conversation had proceeded so smoothly it almost seemed like a trap. Despite the frail bond of trust between them, Vlad had been too reckless. His frustration had probably peaked.</p>
<p>“Well then, we should contact Shin now…what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>If he doesn’t answer to chat, just send him a message. Hameln was thinking this, when he noticed that Luca was crying.</p>
<p>The Weyger was licking her face, trying to console her.</p>
<p>“Shin…Shin is going away!!”</p>
<p>Hameln guessed that Luca had been talking with Shin via chat. Shin was about to step over a line that should not be crossed.</p>
<p>“I thought that he would come back once he had gotten his revenge, but this is a quite boring development.”</p>
<p>There was nothing more boring to observe than humans who had fallen into desperation. It was not uncommon for people who had embraced hope to end like that, but it was not what Hameln expected to see.</p>
<p>“We have the chance to see a grand stage with our own eyes…I’m sorry for dear Vlad, but I have to do something about it.”</p>
<p>Hameln crouched down, his eyes at the same height as Luca’s.</p>
<p>“Do you want Shin to come back?”</p>
<p>Hameln asked his question with a serious tone, his usual ambiguous smile gone from his lips. After a brief moment, Luca strongly nodded.</p>
<p>“Even if it means that your life will be in danger?”</p>
<p>Luca nodded again, with no pause this time.</p>
<p>“Very good. Please wait here then. If what I will say now happens, materialize it.”</p>
<p>Smiling again, Hameln gave a card to Luca. A spherical object and the number “10” were pictured on it.</p>
<p>“Shall we contact her, then?”</p>
<p>Timing was crucial. With this in mind, Hameln sent a message.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 10 Chapter 4 – Part 3</p>
<p>A week had already passed since they started standing out in public on purpose.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking that the plan’s effects should be showing soon, when he was contacted via chat from Emil. Maybe thinking of the possibility that he wouldn’t respond, she sent a message card at the same time.</p>
<p>“(Luca has been kidnapped by Hameln!!)”</p>
<p>“(Luca!?)”</p>
<p>Shin could tell Emil was unnerved as he listened to her story, yet he found it a bit bizarre.</p>
<p>Hameln was a player that liked using monsters to attack players, an MPK. His fighting level was rather high, but he seldom fought other than for self-defense. He apparently acted following his own rules; after entering Avidya, Shin had heard scattered reports about him.</p>
<p>Hameln was reported to have a light and easy personality. Yet, rather than engage in all PK activity, he seemed to focus on medium to large-scale battles.</p>
<p>Shin had briefly met him during the last invasion event, but he couldn’t help feeling it was strange for Hameln to take a hostage.</p>
<p>“(I thought I had set up the orphanage barrier again?)”</p>
<p>“(It looks like Luca went out on her own. But her expression was strange…I’ll send you the message Hameln sent me.)”</p>
<p>Emil’s message arrived soon: it read “I borrowed the young lady, I’ll send her back after a while”, almost like a bad joke or a prank.</p>
<p>“Were you able to contact Luca?”</p>
<p>“I did, but she only replied that she was going with Hameln, and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Shin found the situation more and more difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p>Chat mode was a completely private mode of communication; it was impossible for others to overhear. Even if she had been taken away or threatened, it was possible to inform others without the kidnapper knowing.</p>
<p>Since Luca had not said anything like that, it was possible that she had followed Hameln of her own free will.</p>
<p>Shin asked for more details and learned that just before disappearing, Luca had bickered with Ryohei and Teppei over whether Shin would return or not.</p>
<p>“(Until Hameln’s message arrived, those two said that she had gone looking for you. I have no idea what’s going on either…I wasn’t sure if I should have called you or not either.)”</p>
<p>“(….I see.)”</p>
<p>Barely half a day had passed since Luca’s disappearance. After thinking for a while, Shin tried to contact Luca via chat mode.</p>
<p>“(….Shin?)”</p>
<p>After a few rings, Luca answered. Her voice sounded timid, scared.</p>
<p>“(Emil told me Hameln kidnapped you.)”</p>
<p>“(Uuh…I’m sorry…)”</p>
<p>“(That’s fine for now. So, are you alright?)”</p>
<p>“(Yes, he’s helping me look for you.)”</p>
<p>He’s helping you?</p>
<p>Shin found Luca’s words nothing but puzzling. Hameln, a famous PK, was helping a little kid find someone? It was far too bizarre.</p>
<p>Shin asked more questions and found out that Hameln was apparently looking for him too. That he hadn’t hurt Luca in any way and had set a monster to protect her.</p>
<p>(Why would he be looking for me?)</p>
<p>The last time we met, Hameln seemed interested in him. Maybe it was an extension of that, but there was no reason to take Luca with him. During the invasion event, he had attacked not Shin himself, but the whole hometown, so he shouldn’t be obsessed with Shin like Vlad was.</p>
<p>There should be no reason for Hameln to bring a dead weight like Luca with him.</p>
<p>“(Luca, Hameln is dangerous. Emil and the others are worried too. Go back to the orphanage)”</p>
<p>“(Shin, when will you come back?)”</p>
<p>“(Well, I…)”</p>
<p>I’ll be back right away. That’s what Shin wanted to reply, but the words didn’t leave his lips.</p>
<p>Then, he realized. That even after exacting his revenge, he had no intention of going back.</p>
<p>Shin looked down and saw his hands. They were perfectly clean, but all he saw were stains of blood and guts. He felt blood dripping between his fingers. The smell of iron prickled his nose.</p>
<p>(This is pretty horrible.)</p>
<p>He couldn’t touch others anymore. Maybe he had realized it already, unconsciously.</p>
<p>“(Luca, I have to return everybody to the real world. I made a promise with Marino.)”</p>
<p>“(…hn.)”</p>
<p>“(I have to focus on clearing the dungeons from now on.)”</p>
<p>“(We can’t, meet anymore?)”</p>
<p>“(Don’t worry, I’m not going to die.)”</p>
<p>The words “we will” couldn’t come out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“(I am going to end this world. Luca, Emil, Ryohei, Teppei, everyone will be safe. So just wait.)”</p>
<p>“(Shin?)”</p>
<p>“(I’m going to be busy, so we can’t meet until then.)”</p>
<p>“(Shin!!)”</p>
<p>“(Luca, go back to the orphanage.)”</p>
<p>Shin cut off the chat after this last order.</p>
<p>Considering Hameln’s fighting power, Shin had to go confront him himself. Their location, however, was the lodge area where Shin had cut down Robin. Even if Shin went there now, by the time he arrived they would probably be somewhere else.</p>
<p>Hameln would probably try and come in contact sooner or later. He probably would not put Luca in danger either, so Shin decided not to go look for her and wait for Hameln to make his move.</p>
<p>Shin chuckled at himself, thinking that he had turned rather cold.</p>
<p>“Shin, looks like Vlad is on the move.”</p>
<p>As if she had waited for Shin to finish his chat, Milt -who had been walking next to him- called to Shin. Milt, not Shin, had received a message.</p>
<p>“Tell me more.”</p>
<p>Shin urged Milt for details, while at the same time connecting to Calmia via chat.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Vlad’s proposal was to offer Milt a place to die.</p>
<p>For a long time now, Milt possessed humorous nicknames such as “Mini Berserker” and “Poison Lolita”. After the death game started however, she was only known by the nickname “Deathwish”.</p>
<p>As she had told Shin, the method she had chosen to solve the contradiction of her desire to die but fear of suicide was to engage in fights to the death. It didn’t matter whether the opponents were monsters or players, Milt threw herself into battle without a speck of caution, so that nickname stuck to her quickly.</p>
<p>The reason why she wasn’t stopped by other players, even if she appeared while they were fighting bosses ,was that she took the highest risk of all when fighting.</p>
<p>“(I guess that he came to know that I told you that I wanted you to kill me. Though, it’s not like you’re acting like my boyfriend so I can die without regrets.)”</p>
<p>Thanks to Catnip’s help too, the rumor that Shin and Milt had become lovers had spread in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Not only Shin, but Milt was also rather famous, so the speed at which the rumor spread surprised even them. Thanks to that though, Vlad moved earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Shin was surprised that Vlad contacted Milt while she was with him: her expressed desire of being killed, no matter at whose hands it was, had probably worked in their favor.</p>
<p>Concealed through 【Hiding】, Shin and Milt waited for Vlad, keeping a chat open between them.</p>
<p>Vlad himself intended to be Milt’s opponent apparently. Shin and Milt were supposed to be lovers, so Vlad probably wanted to once again snatch Shin’s beloved away with his own hands.</p>
<p>“(Pretty sloppy.)”</p>
<p>“(Proof of the pinch he’s in. Well, it’s also a result of your relentless PK hunt.)”</p>
<p>The designed area was a place ideal for duels; few people or monsters ever visited it.</p>
<p>It was a perfect location to set up an ambush. The cloudy sky made it even more difficult to see Shin and Milt.</p>
<p>“(Come alone, without telling Shin. That’s really bad, if you ask me.)”</p>
<p>“(….could it that he’s actually an idiot? I thought that he would make something more impressive in the end.)”</p>
<p>“(Shin, let me remind you that you’re the one that made that impossible. You crushed all the places that Vlad could use, didn’t you?)”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t answer Milt’s slightly exasperated tone.</p>
<p>As they killed time with such exchanges, Shin’s map registered a marker coming closer, speeding through the nearby forest. After activating 【Clairvoyance】 and 【Through Sight 】, Shin’s eyes could see Vad riding on an Elder Red Dragon.</p>
<p>“You came alone?”</p>
<p>Vlad landed with his mount and cast the question to Milt. He looked slightly different from before.</p>
<p>His formerly very well kept long hair was now disheveled, the previously gleaming silver armor now emitted a dull glow. As a whole, he gave a sort of faded, stained impression.</p>
<p>“You requested me to, didn’t you? What are you saying now?”</p>
<p>“I heard you were lovers, so I thought you would bring him too.”</p>
<p>“If you know the reason why I was with Shin, you shouldn’t be surprised that I’m alone. I came without telling him anything, as you ordered me to. I wonder if he’s looking for me now…that’d make me a bit happy.”</p>
<p>Milt gave a little smile after saying this; Vlad looked at her like he had found something unspeakably filthy. His whole body expressed the utter disgust he felt.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible for someone like you to have moved his heart.”</p>
<p>“You look pretty pissed all the same though. Was I clinging to Shin so irritating?”</p>
<p>Every time Milt provoked Vlad, emotion seeped away from his face. Inversely, his killing intent grew and grew.</p>
<p>“I shall put you out of your misery.”</p>
<p>Still riding on the elder dragon, Vlad pointed 『Excalibur』, its blade of light extended, towards Milt.</p>
<p>“Too bad, that’s not going to happen.”</p>
<p>Before Milt could even finish her sentence, a slash flew at Vlad from his blindspot.</p>
<p>Maybe thanks to the instincts cultivated through his fighting job, Vlad barely managed to parry the attack with 『Excalibur』; the sword was unable to withstand the attack’s power however, and was blown away.</p>
<p>“Kh!! Greed!!”</p>
<p>Vlad touched the ground and called for his partner dragon’s name. The Elder Red Dragon, however, could not answer; aftershocks from the slash had severed its wings and front legs. One single slash had shaved about half of its HP.</p>
<p>“So you ca—-!?!”</p>
<p>Vlad looked towards the source of the slash, a smile widening on his lips, but was constrained by chains of light and thorns colored red and black.</p>
<p>The thorns disappeared thanks to Vlad’s struggling, but even the muscular strength of an advanced player like Vlad couldn’t make the chains budge.</p>
<p>It was a combination of the Light-type Magic skill 【Arc Bind】, which boasted high constrictive power, and the Dark-type Magic skill 【Thorns of Impurity】, which inflicted several status ailments.</p>
<p>“A little surprise attack, and you’re already helpless?”</p>
<p>Shin, who had destroyed the Elder Dragon’s head with a Light-type spell, spoke softly while looking, expressionless, at the collapsed Vlad. He felt no delight in having captured him.</p>
<p>Vlad was now affected with four negative statuses: 【Bloodred Poison】, 【Blind】, 【Hi-Paralyze】, and 【Curse】. He couldn’t move a single finger, let alone break free of the chains.</p>
<p>“Haha, did you come to exact your revenge?”</p>
<p>Vlad couldn’t move, but still flashed a twisted smile.</p>
<p>Despite his sight being clouded by 【Blind】, he recognized Shin from his voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Before his most hated enemy, Shin was perfectly calm.</p>
<p>He felt hate. But this hate, burning quietly within, had lost a flame hot enough to shake his emotions.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know when that happened. He couldn’t tell if it was something good or bad.</p>
<p>“I won’t be the one to kill you though.”</p>
<p>The obsession wasn’t gone. Anger and hate remained.</p>
<p>Now, however, he would not let his emotions swing his blade.</p>
<p>Following Shin’s signal, six players appeared from the woods. They had not been detected because they were all equipped with gear made by Shin.</p>
<p>“What’s this response….?”</p>
<p>The blind Vlad was confused by the approach of the players’ presences; naturally enough, as Shin, the one supposed to finish him, had not moved one step.</p>
<p>“It can’t be…”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it can.”</p>
<p>The Ancient-grade weapons in hand of the approaching players gave a dull glow. Even the players with less-than-superior stats, thanks to the weapons’ bonuses, could inflict significant damage.</p>
<p>“….stop.”</p>
<p>Without a moment of hesitation, the weapons rose in the air and swung down on Vlad.</p>
<p>“STOP!!!”</p>
<p>One blow couldn’t be enough to cause large damage. On the contrary, this let Vlad feel, as crudely as possible, how his HP was gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>“I SAID STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPP!!!!!”</p>
<p>He was being killed by people he didn’t know. This reality pushed Vlad to scream.</p>
<p>Shin had already turned his back; he wasn’t looking at Vlad anymore.</p>
<p>“Why!?! I am the one you hate!! Why is it these people!! These nobodies!?!”</p>
<p>Vlad probably couldn’t feel Shin’s expression, emotions, or even his eyes.</p>
<p>That was Shin’s revenge. To be ignored by someone you were so obsessed about. That reality would surely be painful above anything else to Vlad.</p>
<p>“Shitt!! HAMEL—-”</p>
<p>The last scream died behind Shin. Vlad’s presence was no more.</p>
<p>“Well, that was over quickly.”</p>
<p>“That’s what revenge really is.”</p>
<p>Shin was looking towards Milt.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for your help. Honestly speaking, I didn’t expect things to go so well.”</p>
<p>“I only did it for my own goal, so don’t mention it. Rather than that, when they go away…okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll keep my promise.”</p>
<p>The six players watched Vlad disappear, silent from start to finish. The man who appeared to be their representative gave several equipment cards to Shin, quietly bowed, and left.</p>
<p>Shin watched them go, then turned towards Milt.</p>
<p>“We can start anytime.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I won’t hold back then.”</p>
<p>A giant poleaxe appeared in Milt’s hands. Enveloped in blue flames, it was the lower Ancient-grade 『Breogand』.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some fun!!”</p>
<p>『Breogand』 slashed through the air, accompanied by Milt’s war shout. Even heavy weapons could move as swiftly as normal lances and axes thanks to Milt’s STR.</p>
<p>It was an attack that could even damage Shin if he was struck; he drew 『True Moon』 and blocked it.</p>
<p>“It’ll be over soon.”</p>
<p>The frontal clash caused 『Breogand』’s blade to shatter.</p>
<p>There was a stat difference between Shin and Milt, including the weapons’ bonuses, that 100 or 200 points could not fill. In a world where a video game’s system ruled all, it was an all-too-clear difference.</p>
<p>“Hey, what were Mari’s last words?”</p>
<p>Milt asked as their blades were still locked.</p>
<p>“…she said that she wanted everyone to go back together.”</p>
<p>“I see, Mari…she made her decision.”</p>
<p>Milt’s water spirit, Undine, released several bubbles, but Shin swatted them away with his left hand. The lightning spell he launched as a counterattack seared both Undine and Milt.</p>
<p>“I’m so envious…we had lost all hope in reality.”</p>
<p>Only Milt’s HP decreased, one-sidedly. The sparks shooting between their blades cast a shadow on her face. Her expression contained a mix of admiration and jealousy.</p>
<p>“This is the time you should say, ‘You can do it too!’!!”</p>
<p>“Only someone ready to carry your life on their shoulders could say that!!”</p>
<p>Milt shouted loud enough to not let her voice drown in the sound of the grinding metal, and Shin howled back.</p>
<p>In the 15th clash between their weapons, 『Breogand』’s blade shot in the air. Milt lost her balance as consequence, and Shin readied 『True Moon』 at his waist.</p>
<p>“I’m really—-”</p>
<p>Milt instinctively used 『Breogand』’s hilt to protect herself. Shin’s blow, as if guided by it, struck cleanly.</p>
<p>“—–envious.”</p>
<p>The slash was stopped for an instant by 『Breogand』’s hilt, but was then cleaved in two along with everything else in the blade’s path.</p>
<p>Katana-type martial skill 【Shiden – Helmet Smasher】.</p>
<p>The technique, that caused great damage to any weapon or defensive gear, unleashed its offensive power to the fullest.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Milt pronounced her last words with a smile.</p>
<p>Shin looked at Milt turning into a burst of polygons and disappear, a complicated emotion beating in his chest. He had never thought to be thanked by someone he killed.</p>
<p>“You are finished, yes?”</p>
<p>Maybe he had lowered his guard, maybe he was lost in thought.</p>
<p>Shin had not noticed the approaching presence until it talked to him.</p>
<p>“Hello there, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“….Shi, Shin…”</p>
<p>Shin turned around and saw Hameln with Luca.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I heard from Milt. I suppose she couldn’t stand to see you go down this path either.”</p>
<p>Both being PKs, it wasn’t strange for some connection to exist between Milt and Hameln. Shin, however, couldn’t understand why Milt would tell him about this place.</p>
<p>“For me too, it is truly not interesting at all for you to be like this.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that I’m a busybody. I just do what I feel like after all. The rest is up to you. Do your best.”</p>
<p>Hameln then used a crystal and teleported away. Only Luca was left, a card in her hands.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you to go back?”</p>
<p>“But Shin, you won’t come back!!”</p>
<p>“That’s-”</p>
<p>“Shin, you’re coming home with me!”</p>
<p>Luca ran up to Shin and tried to take his hand. But before her hands could touch his, Shin moved away.</p>
<p>Luca’s hands would get stained with blood. Or so he felt.</p>
<p>“Shin!!”</p>
<p>There were less than five steps between him and the screaming Luca. That small distance separated them like the steepest cliff.</p>
<p>“Nh!”</p>
<p>Luca held high the card she was holding. What appeared was a grenade-like item, that would explode after a set time.</p>
<p>“Nh…eh?”</p>
<p>“Luca!?”</p>
<p>Luca seemed unaware of the nature of the item she was holding. Shin stepped closer in an instant and took it out of her hands, then launched it high towards the sky.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, with a bang-like sound, a small cloud of white smoke appeared above.</p>
<p>It was just a smoke bomb.</p>
<p>“….what?”</p>
<p>“Nh!”</p>
<p>Shin looked suspiciously at the unexpected happening, when Luca firmly grabbed his hands.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back, okay?”</p>
<p>Luca’s words, strangely enough, were the same as Marino’s.</p>
<p>If Shin used just a little too much strength to shake Luca’s hands away -her level being in the single digits- he could easily blow away her HP.</p>
<p>Shin looked at her hands on his. The blood on his hands seemed to be staining hers too.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go back!!”</p>
<p>The edges of Luca’s eyes brimmed with tears. Even so, she gripped Shin’s hands as strong as she could.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back….”</p>
<p>Shaking her off would be all too simple. But it wasn’t as easy as that.</p>
<p>That same moment, an opening broke between the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>The newly shining sunlight illuminated Luca, as if clearly separating the two; Luca was in warm, bright, yellow light, Shin in misty darkness.</p>
<p>“…..eh?”</p>
<p>It was as if the difference between him and Luca was being clearly shown. Shin noticed it and was about to laugh at himself, when his eyes caught something else, something unbelievable.</p>
<p>On top of his and Luca’s, there was one more hand. Next to Luca, stood Marino. That moment, Shin forgot everything.</p>
<p>Luca pulled Shin as she walked. Completely lost, he followed her without the smallest resistance.</p>
<p>Shin was showered in sunlight, as if he was being pulled out of the darkness.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes were temporarily blinded by the dazzling light.</p>
<p>He closed them for just an instant, but that instant Marino disappeared.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Was it a mirage? Shin asked himself, then he felt the warmth of Luca’s hand on his.</p>
<p>No, that was definitely not only Luca’s. He had held that hand countless times. Even after becoming a murderer, he couldn’t forget that warmth.</p>
<p>That was Marino, without a doubt.</p>
<p>“Are you telling me to go back?”</p>
<p>The Marino he saw in the light looked sad.</p>
<p>“(Let’s go back.)”</p>
<p>The same words that Marino said seeped inside Shin’s heart.</p>
<p>He looked down and saw a small hand gripping his. He felt something inside melt away and disappear.</p>
<p>“Shin, are you crying?”</p>
<p>“I don’t…I don’t know…”</p>
<p>Shin felt all his strength leave his body and fell to his knees.</p>
<p>Something warm seemed to be flowing down his cheeks.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 1 – Part 1</p>
<p>The Black Priestess Shrine guildhouse, on the island country of Hinomoto.</p>
<p>Inside Tsuki no Hokora, which had been materialized in a woodland area within the guildhouse’s premises, Shin narrated his past.</p>
<p>About the days before the Dusk of Majesty, when this world was still the death game, when — even if for the sake of protecting innocent people — he committed countless PKs — murders.</p>
<p>Tiera slowly inhaled a deep breath after hearing Shin’s story.</p>
<p>“It’s something in the past now. ‘Oh, so that’s what happened, okay’. You can just see it like that if you want.”</p>
<p>Shin’s smile did not hide any shadows.</p>
<p>Everything would be OK.</p>
<p>With this conviction in mind, Tiera nodded.</p>
<p>“Could it be that what possessed me before was your former lover, Marino?”</p>
<p>The night before, Tiera had performed a ritual dance similar to the Japanese Kagura. The spirit that had taken over her body at the time housed a deep affection for Shin.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be many people with such deep feelings for him.</p>
<p>“It’s possible but….I don’t know. You snapped out of it before I could tell.”</p>
<p>While talking to Tiera about his past, Shin also realized that it could have been Marino.</p>
<p>“Aah, honestly, I don’t appreciate things like that being done through my body though.”</p>
<p>Tiera probably remembered the kiss as she hid her mouth with her right hand, her cheeks flushing a bit.</p>
<p>“Er….next time, I’ll do my best to dodge.”</p>
<p>Even if he had been entranced by something else, Shin felt guilty about kissing Tiera against her will.</p>
<p>“Er, well, I too want to know who it was that possessed me, okay? So, well, if it happens again, it’s okay to prioritize finding out who they are, you know!”</p>
<p>Since it was possible for it to be someone connected to Shin’s past, Tiera probably said that out of concern for him. Her words and behavior were very contradictory, but Shin chose to think that was her reasoning.</p>
<p>“While I’m thankful to hear that, wouldn’t you hate it if it happened again?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry! It could happen when I’m doing priestess things too!! A-and besides…”</p>
<p>Tiera’s words stopped.</p>
<p>She held her hands together and looked around, visibly fidgeting.</p>
<p>“Besides?”</p>
<p>“I-It’s nothing. Really nothing, so forget all about it.”</p>
<p>Tiera mumbled something, but in the end cut off the conversation without saying anything clearly.</p>
<p>The sun was already high in the sky, indicating that it was almost noon.</p>
<p>Tiera held her still blushing cheeks to cool them off and hurriedly said that it was time to eat lunch, thus forcibly changing the topic.</p>
<p>“That’s right, they’ll probably call us soon.”</p>
<p>Shin felt that it would have been better not to press the matter further, and agreed to Tiera’s proposal.</p>
<p>They both stood from their chairs and exited Tsuki no Hokora. Tiera, who was walking ahead of Shin, suddenly turned around.</p>
<p>“Thank you for telling me such a painful story, Shin.”</p>
<p>“No need to thank me. Pretty boring, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I’m glad I could know more about you.”</p>
<p>Tiera replied with a smile.</p>
<p>She did not regret learning about Shin’s past. Her expression stated that clearly.</p>
<p>“Actually, that scene from my past that you saw…I used to see it often in my dreams.”</p>
<p>“Your mother’s memory?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The time when I first met you too, I would dream about it sometimes. Every time, I would get awful headaches and feel depressed for the whole day.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while looking up at the sky as they walked towards Black Priestess Shrine’s guildhouse. Shin had returned Tsuki no Hokora to its compressed form.</p>
<p>“But ever since I received that from you, I haven’t had that dream anymore.”</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>“You know, this.”</p>
<p>Tiera then took out the Geyl coin from her robe that Shin had given her when they first met. The coin reflected the sunlight and sparkled vividly.</p>
<p>“I feel at peace when I hold this. Maybe because there’s your magic power inside.”</p>
<p>Shin looked intently at the coin and noticed that it indeed had the same aura as the items inside his item box.</p>
<p>“It isn’t supposed to have an effect like that, but I’m happy if it’s useful to you…why don’t we make it into a pendant? So you don’t risk losing it.”</p>
<p>Tiera kept the Geyl coin in a small pocket with metal fastenings.</p>
<p>It was also very valuable in this world, after all. Shin thought that the more closely it could be kept, the better, so he made that suggestion.</p>
<p>“That would be a great help, but is it alright?”</p>
<p>“We can do it in a flash. After all, metal forging is my strong suit.”</p>
<p>“Please do so, then.”</p>
<p>Shin stopped, took an Orichalcum ingot from the item box and, as if molding a lump of clay, quickly shaped it into a chain. He then took the coin from Tiera, molded the Orichalcum around it, fixed it to the chain and finished the pendant.</p>
<p>“Oh, could you make the chain longer, please?”</p>
<p>“Longer than this? How much?”</p>
<p>Shin increased the chain’s length as Tiera requested, even though he felt that it had become too long to wear the pendant around the neck.</p>
<p>“Did you really want it this long?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Most people would think it was a fake, but experienced people could tell that it’s real. I need the chain this long so that other people can’t see the coin. If it’s here, no one can see it as long as they don’t come close to my face and peek, right?”</p>
<p>Tiera then leaned forward a bit and pulled down the neck of her shirt to show Shin the coin’s position.</p>
<p>No matter how much he knew it was not right, Shin’s gaze was drawn to Tiera’s cleavage. The Geyl coin, attached to the long chain, was nestled right in the middle.</p>
<p>“I-I see. That’s why you needed it that long.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s….s-see? If someone comes this close I can react, right!?”</p>
<p>Finally realizing that the stance she had taken put her bosom in full view, Tiera hurriedly stepped back. Her cheeks flared red again.</p>
<p>She seemed shaken and quickly looked all around to make sure that no one else had seen them.</p>
<p>“…ehm, thanks.”</p>
<p>“Sure, that much is nothing.”</p>
<p>The two started walking again. Soon enough, they met Schnee and Yuzuha, who were also headed to the guildhouse, and joined them.</p>
<p>“Did you finish talking with Kuchinashi?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll tell everyone when we are with Filma and the others. Looks like there’s new trouble brewing.”</p>
<p>The enemies the Black Priestess Shrine’s guildmaster, Kuchinashi, talked about, the Seven Deadly Sins, grew more powerful as the event progressed. Their location was currently unknown, but it would be better to defeat them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thinking that it was better to also have the Golden Company research their whereabouts, Shin decided to send a message card.</p>
<p>When Shin’s group arrived at the guildhouse they found Filma and Shibaid with Oodenta Mitsuyo and Onimaru Kunitsuna, two of the Five Supreme Blades, already sitting at the lunch table.</p>
<p>“You’re late.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait, the talks went on longer than expected.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized to the slightly irritated Mitsuyo. She had let him and Tiera have time alone, so he was thankful for that.</p>
<p>“Oh really.”</p>
<p>“Lord Shin, as you can see she is feigning a lack of interest, but Mitsuyo has been fidgeting all this time, wondering when you would come back.”</p>
<p>Kunitsuna, an excited grin on her face, looked as if she were positively enjoying herself as she made her report.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kunitsuna!? What are you even saying now!?”</p>
<p>“Did I say something wrong? It’s rare to see the proud Mitsuyo all restless like that after all.”</p>
<p>“W-why you…!!”</p>
<p>Kunitsuna probably hit where it hurt. Even while glaring at her, Mitsuyo’s eyes darted towards Shin.</p>
<p>“….what?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing at all. Let’s eat, first of all.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo looked like she was blushing: her glare was thus not scary at all, but Shin felt that poking her further would prove dangerous, and decided to leave it alone.</p>
<p>“Do any of you have any plans for the rest of the day? Kuchinashi told me something interesting, so I’d like to let you all know too.”</p>
<p>Shin proposed discussing the Seven Deadly Sins, to which all present agreed.</p>
<p>After the meal, the whole group assembled in the room assigned to Shin.</p>
<p>“…..the Seven Deadly Sins, hmm. Clearly they can’t be ignored, but there’s not much we can do until they are found, is it.”</p>
<p>“Agreed. 500 years ago, the players used human wave tactics and somehow pulled through. Our group doesn’t even have 10 members, we just don’t have enough manpower for that.”</p>
<p>After hearing what Shin had to say, Schnee and Filma replied: the former with a very serious expression, the latter while shrugging.</p>
<p>When Shin said that he already requested the Golden Company to search for the monsters, the group agreed to wait for a reply.</p>
<p>“So there are creatures like that in this world…”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo seemed impressed to learn of the existence of such monsters, to which Shin replied brightly.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen their final forms, though. Though considering Fuji’s fighting power, I’m sure it’ll be alright as long as a pack of final forms doesn’t gather.”</p>
<p>“If the Five Supreme Blades are together, it would take a really tough enemy to take us down, yes.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo and the other Blades, like Kagutsuchi of the sacred mountain Fuji, were treated as boss monsters in the game. Because of this, both their stats and HP were much higher than the players.</p>
<p>They surpassed the players’ max values of 9999 by far, so if they fought together, even raid bosses would be felled.</p>
<p>Now that Kunitsuna and Dojigiri Yasutsuna had returned, their defenses could be said to be perfect.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, if nothing else comes up, we’ll go back to Fuji. The earlier you’re all back together, the better, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“Ah…yeah.”</p>
<p>Shin was kind of concerned about Mitsuyo’s somber look, but as business was done, the group split.</p>
<p>Nothing of particular importance happened afterward: after dinner, Shin was swinging his 『Kakura』 in the small garden where he had found Tiera the previous night. He was wearing a bathrobe supplied by Black Priestess Shrine, as to be able to go take a bath right after training.</p>
<p>“You got a bit better than last time we fought.”</p>
<p>Shin thrust 『Kakura』 into the ground and turned towards the voice. He was focusing on training, but had noticed Mitsuyo approaching.</p>
<p>“Whew, if you say that, it means that it was worth the effort.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo stepped out of the corridors’ shadows into the moonlight. She had removed her shoulder and breast armor: now she was only wearing an oriental-style attire with a miniskirt.</p>
<p>“We’re going back to Fuji tomorrow, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I doubt anything else will happen here anyway.”</p>
<p>The group had not stayed in the guildhouse after clearing the dungeon because they were wary of possible dangers. The miasma in Cadaver Realm had been purified thoroughly, so there was little to no chance of anything new arising.</p>
<p>“I see. If so…could I ask you one last request?”</p>
<p>“A request?”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo had come talk to him by herself probably because she didn’t want Schnee and the others to hear.</p>
<p>“I want you to use me. Even just for practicing techniques or something.”</p>
<p>“You mean, that I would just have to swing the katana 『Oodenta Mitsuyo』?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’d be enough. …but rest assured, it doesn’t mean that I feel anything for you.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo probably saw through Shin’s thoughts, because she gave a little troubled laugh.</p>
<p>Mitsuyo’s actual body was owned by Kagutsuchi, but the 『Oodenta Mitsuyo – Shinuchi』 she currently inhabited was Shin’s possession, so he could comply with her request if he wanted.</p>
<p>“Got it. That much is nothing.”</p>
<p>Thinking that he had said the same line earlier in the day, Shin took Oodenta Mitsuyo -now in katana form- in his hands. The unsheathed blade glistened under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Shin attached the sheath to his robe’s belt, gripped the hilt with both hands and took a stance.</p>
<p>“Shah!”</p>
<p>From a frontal straight stance, Shin went to upward diagonal, downward diagonal, sweep, then thrust.</p>
<p>He added Saegusa Karin’s teachings to the techniques he had learned from a certain person during the game. What he learned were just the basics, though. Much of Shin’s style was self-taught.</p>
<p>The sound of the katana cutting the air and Shin’s shouts resounded through the garden.</p>
<p>Thus around 10 minutes passed.</p>
<p>Mitsuyo’s Mind Chat—-in katana form, she couldn’t talk, so her voice directly reached Shin’s mind — gave the signal, and Shin stopped.</p>
<p>“It’s enough, thank you.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo, back in human form, had a faint smile on her lips.</p>
<p>“Did this mean anything for you?”</p>
<p>“There’s no special meaning. I told you that I have no special feelings for you, right?”</p>
<p>Even so, it looked like being wielded by Shin had meant something to Mitsuyo, as she looked satisfied.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be wielded as one of your weapons, even just once. If there was any meaning, that was it.”</p>
<p>“Not that wielding one of the Five Supreme Blades was unpleasant, of course.”</p>
<p>“I know. You have a powerful katana you’re attached to, right? I’m a weapon too, so I’m honestly a bit jealous of a katana treasured like that.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo then returned to her room, saying that she would be turning in.</p>
<p>Left alone in the garden, Shin looked up to the sky with mixed feelings in his heart.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 1 – Part 2</p>
<p>The next day, after making sure that the Cadaver Realm had not undergone any changes and that no miasma outbreaks had occurred, Shin’s group left the Black Priestess Shrine’s guildhouse to return to Fuji.</p>
<p>“If anything happens, just contact me via chat.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’ll try to handle things by ourselves if we can, but if we’re overwhelmed, I’ll call you.”</p>
<p>They had already said all they wanted to, so the farewell was a short one.</p>
<p>Along with Kuchinashi, the Black Priestess Shrine members who had bonded with Shin’s group the most saw them off.</p>
<p>“Please take care during your travels. I look forward to seeing you again one day.”</p>
<p>“…I’m thankful to you for saving my sister, but I’ll never let you have her!!”</p>
<p>While Rindou Kotone spoke with words of longing, Suzune glared at Shin.</p>
<p>“Same till the very end, huh…”</p>
<p>Suzune didn’t forgive Shin and Kotone’s friendship, after all.</p>
<p>Kotone added that Suzune too was truly thankful, but being grateful for Shin’s assistance was apparently a separate matter from letting him have her sister.</p>
<p>Schnee, Tiera and the others also bid farewell to Ayame and the other priestesses.</p>
<p>The greatest number, however, gathered around Shibaid, who had held a training session for the priestesses.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s some popularity.”</p>
<p>“Some girls even said that, if only he was free…”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Dead serious. Finding a marriage partner is tough in this world too, you know.”</p>
<p>Kuchinashi sighed quietly, mumbling that she couldn’t let her girls marry just anyone. Shin felt a vague discomfort learning that there were connections with the real world in curious places.</p>
<p>“(It would be a big relief for me if you took in Kotone though, Shin. There’s plenty of ambitious men out there pestering us to make her their bride.)”</p>
<p>“(No more, please. I still haven’t given up on returning to our original world, actually. Besides, even if I were to spend the rest of my life here, I have Schnee.)”</p>
<p>“(She only has eyes for you, hasn’t she? She’s always looking in your direction, it’s really easy to figure out.)”</p>
<p>During the chat, it was then Shin’s turn to sigh. He told Kuchinashi that “(That’s probably on purpose)”. There surely was a reason for Schnee to act so openly in front of someone she had just met.</p>
<p>“Okay, this looks like it could go on forever, so let’s go!”</p>
<p>Feeling kind of sorry for the girls sending burning gazes towards Shibaid, Shin climbed onto the horse carriage. After making sure everyone else was on, he motioned for Kagerou to go.</p>
<p>The carriage started slowly but quickly picked up speed. Unlike the time when they had first arrived at the Black Priestess Shrine, they were now traveling on a road used for transporting goods, so Kuchinashi and the other priestesses disappeared from sight very quickly.</p>
<p>“Take care!”</p>
<p>The carriage proceeded towards Fuji, Kotone’s voice trailing behind it.</p>
<p>The travel back to Fuji was completely uneventful. Monsters wouldn’t get close to the group in fear of Kagerou. And since thieves and bandits were routinely hunted down by the Kujou clan and the samurai affiliated with it, meeting any would be rare in itself.</p>
<p>The group stopped on the way in a large city to refill their supplies, but made no other detours, advancing towards Fuji at an explosive speed. This would leave all travelers and merchants they happened to cross paths with speechless.</p>
<p>“We’ve already arrived? Happy times really go by quickly.”</p>
<p>Kunitsuna spoke while looking up at Fuji, when the group got off the carriage just before Aokigahara.</p>
<p>“With a travel speed like that, it’s pretty obvious.”</p>
<p>Nodding to Kunitsuna’s words, Mitsuyo looked at the carriage, a bit melancholic.</p>
<p>As anthropomorphized weapons, Mitsuyo and her comrades were bound to certain areas. Normally, they would never be able to go on adventures like the one they shared with Shin.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, I was attacked the last time I was here.”</p>
<p>Thinking they shouldn’t just walk in silence, Shin talked about when he was attacked while traveling with Karin and Kanade.</p>
<p>“Oh, were you really? Was the assassin that fled part of the Rokuhara?”</p>
<p>“Could be. The ones who stirred up trouble have quieted down, so there’s no point in dwelling on it.”</p>
<p>When Shin finished talking, the group had crossed Aokigahara and reached Fuji. The mist shrouded the mountain as always, but posed no problem.</p>
<p>There was no reason to engage in battle, so the group proceeded while avoiding the monsters they occasionally spotted and quickly arrived at Kagutsuchi’s shrine.</p>
<p>“Yachi, we’re back.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo approached the Eight-Headed Orochi, which extended his necks to examine the group. The monster seemed to understand her words, as the “shaah” uttered in reply appeared to mean “welcome back”.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see that you’re back safe and sound.”</p>
<p>Mikazuki Munechika emerged from inside the shrine: she had probably sensed the incoming presence of Shin’s group.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Munechika. —-Haven’t you gotten prettier?”</p>
<p>Kunitsuna immediately noticed that Munechika’s appearance was now different from the usual.</p>
<p>“Just like Mitsuyo, now I am a Shinuchi.”</p>
<p>After Munechika’s explanation, Kunitsuna — who had already heard about the process from Mitsuyo — was easily convinced.</p>
<p>“I thought that you would look cuter, like Mitsuyo does…but I see, your beauty increased instead. That’s why Mitsuyo was kind of miffed, then.”</p>
<p>“I thought that only appearance would change, but the armor did too after all. But Yasutsuna and Tanetsugu praised Mitsuyo too, saying she had become prettier.”</p>
<p>“They laughed about it, I bet.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo, pouting, joined in on Munechika and Kunitsuna’s conversation. Her ponytail shook as she quickly looked to the side.</p>
<p>“That’s not true. We might be weapons, but our bodies are those of women. Decorating our appearance is enjoyable for us too. I too would be interested in looking cute.”</p>
<p>“That hairdo, however…rather than making you purely cute like Mitsuyo, gives a stronger feminine allure. The neck area, for example.”</p>
<p>Munechika spoke her mind honestly, and Kunitsuna added her precise observations.</p>
<p>Having an appearance more childlike or adultlike could influence greatly the impression given to others.</p>
<p>“Kh, I can’t deny that…”</p>
<p>Regardless of what she said, Munechika had just lightly tied her hair, but still emanated a sensual charm that made it difficult to believe that she was wearing armor. Mitsuyo’s shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>“—-look at them, they’re sure having fun.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, their comrade came back safe. Of course they’d feel elated.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid smiled while looking at the reunited Blades’ playful exchanges.</p>
<p>“Piyo!”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Nestled on top of Juzumaru Tanetsugu’s head, Kagutsuchi — now in chick mode — cried with its wings spread out. In response, Yuzuha raised her tail from her position on Shin’s head. The two descended from the respective heads they were on and initiated some sort of conversation.</p>
<p>Shin and Tanetsugu looked at each other and laughed wryly.</p>
<p>“Everyone, I wish to thank you for saving Kunitsuna.”</p>
<p>The only one to properly express gratitude was Yasutsuna.</p>
<p>“Our task is over, then.”</p>
<p>“Yes. However, I have been saved by you, sir Shin. If you ever require my assistance, I shall be at your side.”</p>
<p>He was probably serious through and through. Yasutsuna’s expression was firm.</p>
<p>“….hey, Yasutsuna? Don’t go hogging Shin for yourself, okay?”</p>
<p>“True, that wouldn’t be good at all.”</p>
<p>Munechika and Mitsuyo moved behind Yasutsuna in the blink of an eye. They each grabbed one shoulder, strongly enough to make a creaking sound.</p>
<p>“No, I had no such intention…”</p>
<p>Apparently, Yasutsuna was not receiving damage; however his reply was slightly confused by the developments.</p>
<p>“I’ll contact you if anything happens. Let me check if I can send you message cards.”</p>
<p>The Five Supreme Blades belonged to the monster, or weapon, category.</p>
<p>Shin knew that it was possible to send message cards to this world’s inhabitants, but was not sure if it was possible to do the same to humanized weapons. He thus tried to send a blank message, which was delivered without problems.</p>
<p>“I see, with this we can get in touch at any time.”</p>
<p>Munechika seemed impressed, but Mitsuyo, next to her, appeared frustrated.</p>
<p>“Ggh…why don’t we have any creation skills!?”</p>
<p>“My my, as usual you are full of surprises, young man. By the way, sir Shin, it does pain me to ask you this after everything you have done for us, but would you listen to an old man’s request?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’ll be able to grant it, but what is it?”</p>
<p>Shin asked Tanetsugu for details.</p>
<p>“Oh it is simple enough. I thought I would like to become a Shinuchi as well. Seeing how Munechika and Mitsuyo changed, I grew interested, you see.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, that is true. We cannot change appearance as humans do, after all. Asking sir Shin to do even more for us would be…”</p>
<p>Yasutsuna seemed interested in the Shinuchi too. He had just thanked Shin for saving him, though, so he looked conflicted, standing next to Tanetsugu.</p>
<p>“I see, that wouldn’t take too much, so there’s no problem. There’s a Ley Line here, and increasing its defenses wouldn’t hurt for sure.”</p>
<p>Shin too was interested in seeing how they would change, so he accepted the two Blades’ request.</p>
<p>Kunitsuna too expressed the same desire, so Shin set on working on all three of them.</p>
<p>The time was already past 5 in the afternoon. The strong sunlight on the peak made it hard to tell, but the sun was already setting.</p>
<p>“I’ll make preparations for dinner, then.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ll help too.”</p>
<p>Entrusting Schnee and Tiera with dinner, Shin headed to the smithy.</p>
<p>He had already reinforced 『Mikazuki Munechika』 and 『Oodenta Mitsuyo』, so he had more or less learned the “trick” to it, more or less. Because of this, Shin was done in about one hour.</p>
<p>Shin left the smithy and walked through the corridor towards the living room, when about five mels from the living room, he found Schnee standing there.</p>
<p>“Did everything go well?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I made them all into Shinuchi.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. I’ve made some preparations too.”</p>
<p>“Preparations?”</p>
<p>Schnee looked at Shin, somewhat fidgeting. He had no idea what she could have meant by “preparations”. He found it puzzling that she was blushing though.</p>
<p>Had something happened before dinner? So thought Shin, when Schnee abruptly started talking.</p>
<p>“W-will you have dinner first? Or have a bath? O-or, have…have m—”</p>
<p>Schnee couldn’t say it till the end, and covered her red hot face with her hands. She was obviously too embarrassed. Her long ears, poking from her silver hair, were blazing red too.</p>
<p>“Eh!? Wait a second, Schnee!!! If you say that much, you have to say it to the end!!!”</p>
<p>“I can’t!! I can’t do something as shameful as in-inviting Shin to….!”</p>
<p>After Schnee crouched down in embarrassment, Filma — who had been using a concealment skill — revealed herself.</p>
<p>“What are you even doing….”</p>
<p>Shin had noticed Filma’s presence, so he looked at her as to say, “I need an explanation”.</p>
<p>“I heard Cashmere and Hecate talk about it once. This is a wife’s proper greeting to her husband in your world, right Shin? A great welcome, to soothe the husband’s exhaustion while also encouraging prosperity for the family line!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for Schnee, who got all embarrassed like this…but that isn’t a proper greeting or anything…some people do say it though.”</p>
<p>Shin corrected Filma’s information, careful not to touch upon the wife-husband part.</p>
<p>He wanted to add that a phrase like that was only in manga, but he had actually seen his parents enact the situation once, so he couldn’t deny it outright.</p>
<p>“Really? Hecate and Cashmere really said that they would have liked to welcome their husbands like that, though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I heard that too. Hecate was looking for a partner, wasn’t she.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered hearing something about that during one of their offline meetings.</p>
<p>Rokuten members were mostly minors: Hecate was the only adult. As soon as she had found a job, she had quit being a hardcore gamer. For Shin, the impression of the real world Hecate was of a hard-working adult woman.</p>
<p>She was slender, beautiful, with a dimple near her eye. Her personality wasn’t bad either, so it was a mystery why she couldn’t find a boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Well, putting Hecate aside…Filma, don’t tease Schnee too much, okay?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t teasing her. Without some stimulus, the relationship doesn’t progress.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk about that here!”</p>
<p>Like Shibaid, Filma also wanted Shin and Schnee to become one soon. The difference was that Filma used a very direct approach.</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped, can it? If you disappear, then it’s all over.”</p>
<p>“….so you heard.”</p>
<p>Filma seemed to know that Shin was looking for a way to return to his home world.</p>
<p>“Though, I have no clue about how to do it.”</p>
<p>“And that’s precisely the reason why we should move now. If you find a way, it’s all over, isnt it?”</p>
<p>Filma was looking at Shin, but not in her usual joking way.</p>
<p>“Filma, that’s enou—-”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but in regards to this, I’m prioritizing Schnee over you, Shin. I’m sure you know why, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Filma interrupted Schnee’s words and pressed further. Shin knew the reason well, of course.</p>
<p>Filma Tolmeya was Shin’s second support character. She was without a doubt Shin’s support character, but her original position was supporting Schnee. That influenced Filma in this world too.</p>
<p>“I understand, once again.”</p>
<p>“Then—”</p>
<p>“Filma!”</p>
<p>Schnee interrupted Filma’s words this time. Her powerful shout stopped Filma in her tracks.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Shin. I’ll talk with Filma properly about this.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Schnee! Are you really fine with th-”</p>
<p>Filma was ready to double down, but Schnee put a finger over her mouth and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m all right. I have no intention of giving up either.”</p>
<p>“…hah, okay then. I’ll keep quiet for now.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s clear declaration, in front of Shin too, made Filma give a small shrug and nod.</p>
<p>“But, you know.”</p>
<p>The next instant, Filma took Schnee by surprise and stepped next to Shin, whispering something in his ear.</p>
<p>“Now I’d join in too, you know?”</p>
<p>Filma then kissed Shin’s cheek.</p>
<p>“W-what!? Hey!!”</p>
<p>“Filma!?”</p>
<p>“Schnee, you have to do at least this much!”</p>
<p>Filma fled into the living room before they could say anything else.</p>
<p>To think she’d go so far…thought Shin while touching his cheek and watching Filma go.</p>
<p>“S-Schnee? That look is kind of painful, you know…”</p>
<p>Shin realized that she was staring at him and fretted. Schnee came closer, silent.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>She finally took Shin’s head with her hands and pressed her lips on his.</p>
<p>The pressure felt just now completely vanished, Schnee gave Shin a gentle kiss.</p>
<p>“I can…do this much.”</p>
<p>She must have been nervous. After the kiss, she turned beet red again, as if opening a pressure valve.</p>
<p>“Le-let’s go eat! Everyone’s waiting!”</p>
<p>Not able to endure the embarrassment anymore, Schnee fled into the living room just like Filma had done.</p>
<p>“….what am I going to do?”</p>
<p>Filma’s concern for Schnee, Schnee’s feelings for himself…he could understand them. However, However, Shin had not given up on returning to his home world.</p>
<p>“If that wasn’t a possibility, I’d be OK with it in a heartbeat.”</p>
<p>Let’s go back — so Marino had said before dying. Her words were deeply engraved in Shin’s heart.</p>
<p>Shin himself felt a longing for his home world. It wasn’t just because he had spoken to Tiera about his past, but he strongly felt that he couldn’t just throw away the world he was born and raised in so easily.</p>
<p>“Well, I better go now.”</p>
<p>With a small sigh, Shin headed to the living room.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>“So this is the Shinuchi?”</p>
<p>“Well, I can see why Munechika and Mitsuyo were so smug.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>After the meal, Shin gave Yasutsuna, Kunitsuna and Tanetsugu their respective Shinuchi, but their responses were all different. Only Yasutsuna and Kunitsuna expressed their excitement and interest, while Tanetsugu showed disappointment.</p>
<p>“Er, what happened to Tanetsugu?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it appears that I cannot transfer my consciousness into this blade.”</p>
<p>According to Tanetsugu, the revival version of the katana could not serve as a vessel.</p>
<p>“The revival version won’t do, then?”</p>
<p>Based on what had happened until now, only weapons forged from scratch or obtained during the event could be used to transfer consciousness.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t want to go through that again…”</p>
<p>Shin could forge 『Juzumaru』, but to do so would mean going through the same ordeal as when he repaired 『Dojigiri Yasutsuna』. All weapon recipes were different too. Even though he was able to forge one of the Five Supreme Blades, it didn’t mean that the others were any easier to make.</p>
<p>“No, you have already done enough for us. Enough with my selfishness.”</p>
<p>Tanetsugu’s whole body clearly expressed how dejected he was, but he accepted the situation.</p>
<p>“Ooh, so this is how I change!”</p>
<p>“As expected, my change was similar to Munechika’s.”</p>
<p>Next to the resigned Tanetsugu, Yasutsuna and Kunitsuna expressed their joy and surprise at their new Shinuchi forms.</p>
<p>Yasutsuna was still lean but now looked more muscular; his facial features were more solid and rugged, like a young general who had trained his technique and accumulated experience.</p>
<p>Kunitsuna, like Munechika, was even more beautiful than before. Instead of gaining lustrous hair or whiter skin, she gain more prominent curves, giving her an hourglass figure.</p>
<p>“How regretful…”</p>
<p>Looking at his overjoyed comrades, Tanetsugu’s shoulders dropped even more.</p>
<p>“Munechika and now Kunitsuna!! Just what kind of joke is this!?!”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo, who had already been made into a Shinuchi, shouted. It wasn’t clear whether she was angry or crying.</p>
<p>“Shin! One more time, you have to reinforce me one more time! If you do, I will become like them toooo!!”</p>
<p>Unable to accept the difference in their transformations, Mitsuyo pressed Shin.</p>
<p>“I…could…do it…but…in your case, Mitsuyo, it might go totally against your wishes…you changed in a way completely different from them, after all.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo grabbed shin by the neck and shook him, but Shin freed himself from her grip and replied.</p>
<p>“Th-that can’t be…”</p>
<p>“Well actually, just because you’re small doesn’t mean you’re not powerful. For example, dwarves, so…”</p>
<p>Not all dwarves were short in stature: only some of the NPCs from the original game were smaller, compared to other species. Normally speaking, however, Shin’s explanation was not too far off the mark.</p>
<p>“But why…why only me…”</p>
<p>“I really can’t say.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo’s appearance settings were different from Munechika’s and Kunitsuna’s from the beginning. Shin thought that could be the reason, but was not sure, so he avoided saying anything clearly.</p>
<p>“Just give up. At least you were able to become a Shinuchi, unlike me. ”</p>
<p>“I know, I know…I just feel like acting a little spoiled.”</p>
<p>Mitsuyo pouted and breathed deeply; maybe that helped her change her mood, as she didn’t look irritated anymore.</p>
<p>“Oh, to think that you’d act spoiled to someone other than us.”</p>
<p>“….and what would you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Tanetsugu laughed innocently to Mitsuyo’s evil smile.</p>
<p>“That you’ve become much more expressive. Now, don’t look so scary. It’s just an old man’s rambling.”</p>
<p>“Is it really okay for you to give us your Shinuchi, though? Even though you can replicate them, they must be valuable items for you Shin.”</p>
<p>Munechika changed the topic and asked Shin about something that concerned her, but in response he took out two stacks of item cards.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, the more allies we have, the better. Oh, and take these, as miasma countermeasures.”</p>
<p>Munechika couldn’t tell what kind of items they were by looking at the cards’ illustrations, so she looked a little lost.</p>
<p>“What are these?”</p>
<p>“These are accessories and one-time use items. They’re all easy to use; the accessories just need to be equipped, while the items just have to touch miasma to activate.”</p>
<p>What Shin gave Munechika were accessories that neutralized up to a degree of miasma and items that could delete accumulated miasma. The one-time use items had a more powerful effect, but naturally could only be used once. The accessories’ effect was weaker, but lasted much longer. Using them in combination granted complete protection, as long as the miasma wasn’t too dense.</p>
<p>“We can’t thank you enough.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. It would be a problem for me too if this place was taken over. Besides, Yuzuha found a companion….well, if I can call Kagutsuchi that. But she’d be sad if it was hurt.”</p>
<p>Shin then looked towards Yuzuha and Kagutsuchi, who were playing on the table.</p>
<p>“Did Kagutsuchi recover its powers, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Yes, its actual body was turned to crystal, right? A bit after you left to rescue Kunitsuna, the crystallization was dispelled. The chick form was just a copy housing Kagutsuchi’s consciousness, but now it has returned to its actual form.”</p>
<p>Just like Yuzuha, Kagutsuchi was apparently able to alter its form to a degree. It couldn’t take human form however.</p>
<p>“Looks like it took a liking to that form. It gets all quiet if you hold it.”</p>
<p>“Yuzuha said something similar, now that I think about it. Its original form was huge, so it probably never experienced something like that.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had grown, but probably the little fox mode was the one she enjoyed the best. She often used it to sneak under the covers of Shin’s bed and sleep too.</p>
<p>In the game their role was to test players, so maybe they were fond of humans.</p>
<p>“Piyo!”</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so….Shin, Kagutsuchi has something to tell you. Can you call your comrades too?”</p>
<p>Kagutsuchi landed on Munechika’s shoulder and cried softly.</p>
<p>As Shin’s party gathered, they were invited to go outside.</p>
<p>As they all did, Kagutsuchi flew from Munechika’s shoulder, turning into a golden flame.</p>
<p>“So this is Kagutsuchi’s original form.”</p>
<p>The golden flame gradually formed beak and wings: in a few instants, it had become a large phoenix.</p>
<p>Flaming sparks scattered all around, but emitted no heat.</p>
<p>“I thank you for your assistance.”</p>
<p>Kagutsuchi’s voice sounded with a deep gravity which well fitted its current appearance. The reverberating echo expressed the divine beast’s presence adequately.</p>
<p>“As a gesture of thanks, I shall bestow the protection of my holy flame upon you.”</p>
<p>Shin and party were then enveloped by golden flames. This fire wasn’t hot at all, and it disappeared after a few instants.</p>
<p>The Gift list in Shin’s menu then displayed the message “NEW!”. Shin mentally opened the menu and found that the Gift 『Holy Flames Protection』 had been added.</p>
<p>Its effect was to weaken fire elemental damage exceeding a certain level. Below that level, it would be neutralized.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, only Schnee-level attacks could deal decisive damage. It was a very powerful protection, who could even be called fire damage nullifier.</p>
<p>“A-are you sure…sir?”</p>
<p>Surprised, Shin replied casually, but thought that it wouldn’t be appropriate to speak like that to Kagutsuchi in its current form, so he corrected himself.</p>
<p>Kagutsuchi did not seem to mind: after merely uttering “I am”, it returned to its chick form.</p>
<p>“Piyo piyo.”</p>
<p>Looking at how it flapped its small wings, it looked like Kagutsuchi was saying “it’s all good, just take it and go”.</p>
<p>“Understood, I’ll make good use of it.”</p>
<p>Kagutsuchi had nothing else to say, so the group returned inside Tsuki no Hokora.</p>
<p>The following day, it was time to descend the mountain.</p>
<p>“Once more, we are in your debt. Do come visit again.”</p>
<p>“You have to!! Definitely!!”</p>
<p>“Please do before Mitsuyo explodes from impatience.”</p>
<p>“Take care in your travels.”</p>
<p>“My my, I doubt there’s anything to worry about though.”</p>
<p>“Piyo!”</p>
<p>Shin’s group left Fuji while Munechika, Mitsuyo, Tanetsugu, Yasutsuna, Kunitsuna and Kagutsuchi saw them off.</p>
<p>Their next destination was a port town to find a ship heading to the Eltnia continent.</p>
<p>The group crossed Aokigahara, boarded the horse carriage which, led by Kagerou, started running through Hinomoto’s roads.</p>
<p>Unlike before, they made sure to slow down to a normal speed every time they ran into groups of merchants or travelers, in order to not stand out.</p>
<p>The reason was they had already heard rumors of a mysterious convoy running at an incredible speed on the roads around Fuji. Shin’s party had traveled at high speed when they went looking for Kunitsuna too, so the rumor must have spread further.</p>
<p>Luckily, the witnesses reported the mysterious cart to be running in the area opposite to the port town the group was directed to; if Kagerou was cloaked as a horse with illusion magic, they wouldn’t stand out much anymore.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“As expected of a port town, there are some amazing fish dishes here.”</p>
<p>Once they reached their destination, the group hid in a forest to change the carriage back to an item card, then proceeded on foot. Just walking aimlessly around town, they could see many stalls selling fresh fish. There were species Shin knew from his original world and monster fish sausages unique of this world, forming a wide range of products.</p>
<p>“Two weeks is a pretty long time…”</p>
<p>Tiera sighed after learning of the passenger ship schedule. A ship had left just the day before, and it would be some time until the next one left port.</p>
<p>The group was not exactly in a rush, but waiting two weeks in a town without any leisure activities was pretty boring, so they started looking for trade ships heading to the Eltnia continent.</p>
<p>About one hour later, the party learned from a sailor that there was a ship planning to leave two days later, so they went to negotiate a way to board it right away.</p>
<p>At first, the crew rejected their overtures as they did not have enough space, but the captain ultimately accepted them when Shin and his party said they would also act as escorts.</p>
<p>Shin and Tiera’s adventurer ranks were still low, but Shibaid had an A ranked adventurer card. It was a card that Shibaid used while still being able to hide his true identity. The Adventurers’ Guild owed a lot to him, so they made an exception by issuing it.</p>
<p>“They probably wouldn’t have let us on if it was just us without Shibaid.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Shin is rank D, and I’m still F to boot. Master is rank C on paper, so I bet they think we’re dead weight.”</p>
<p>Tiera had been promoted to rank F after taking care of the aftermath of Balmel’s defense battle.</p>
<p>Some were of the opinion that she should have been promoted to a higher rank, but the offensive power of the bow which slew so many foes was not hers only, so she was only promoted one rank.</p>
<p>The nature of Shin’s accomplishments had been a topic of much debate within the guild. There were apparently some disputes going on too, so he chose to head to Kilmont before finding out the results.</p>
<p>Just before that, the business with the Church happened, so at present, no one actually knew what rank Shin was.</p>
<p>“The sea’s more dangerous than land, after all. The first time I fought at sea, it was really different, and I could hardly get the hang of it.”</p>
<p>The same type of escort mission increased in rank if it was at sea instead of land.</p>
<p>“We’re a party with an A-rank adventurer and all skill inheritors, that should be more than enough for them.”</p>
<p>As Schnee said, now Tiera possessed skills too. Other than the 【Analyze】 skill Shin taught her, she had acquired skills for offense, support, etcetera.</p>
<p>Tiera could use her bow, while Schnee, Shibaid, and Shin could use their skills to fight enemies above or below the water. Thanks to these negotiations, they could split their duties with the escorts already on board without trouble.</p>
<p>Normally, ships protected themselves with long-range attacks. If worse came to worst, Shin’s group could act as decoys to lure the enemies far from the ship where they could be shot: it was one of the possible strategies.</p>
<p>Considering the crew and the ship’s safety, no one would object to having an escort-specialized party on board.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’ll be a peaceful trip this time.”</p>
<p>The group spent the time prior to their departure by going over battle strategies and sightseeing. Two days later, Shin and his party were onboard, gazing at the horizon. It did not look like they would be attacked by monsters such as the Gale Serpents; the ship proceeded without any delay.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many pirates or monsters in this part of the sea, but if anything happens, we’ll be counting on you guys, all right?”</p>
<p>Aral, an adventurer and the ship’s permanent escort, approached the group. He had red hair cut short and features that reminded the others of a wild animal.</p>
<p>Shin replied politely, not wanting to look like a cocky newbie adventurer.</p>
<p>“Please leave it to us. Our rank might be low, but we have some experience fighting at sea.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. Though, unexpected things happen at sea. There’s a rumor among sailors that a ghost ship appears in these parts, you know?”</p>
<p>“A ghost ship?”</p>
<p>Aral’s tone suggested that he just wanted to give Shin a scare. For Shin, however, it wasn’t just a joke. One of the area bosses in the game era was a true ghost ship, that appeared in certain sea areas.</p>
<p>Shin replied to Aral, asking him please not to scare them, and the adventurer grinned and left.</p>
<p>“The ship, hmm…”</p>
<p>Shin remembered one of Rokuten’s guildhouses, the 2nd Assault Ship Celciutos. He heard that not even the Golden Company found it, so he thought that it might have been adrift somewhere.</p>
<p>Unaware of Shin’s thoughts, the ship’s crew guided the ship with sails swelled in the wind and cut on through the waves. The weather did not turn sour and the ship sailed on under a perfectly blue sky. No traces of the ghost ships of Celciutos. Finally, two days after departure, the ship reached the Eltnia continent.</p>
<p>“So this is Barbatos the Marine City. You would think it’s a city of pirates, with this name.”</p>
<p>“They say they have geothermal energy-powered hot water pools here, you know?”</p>
<p>Filma, who had heard this piece of information from the captain, waved at the ship as the group disembarked.</p>
<p>“Pools, huh. They probably bathe in seawater normally though.”</p>
<p>All sorts of dangerous monsters dwelt in the sea, and some were even able to move around on land.</p>
<p>Rather than building walls or setting nets to protect the land from the dangerous sea creatures, the buildings and leisure facilities were completely separated from the sea and were therefore safer and easier to maintain. Because of this, the “Marine City” did not have a single beach.</p>
<p>“Since we’re here, we might as well check it out if we have time. We don’t have to worry about monsters. The baths are unlike the sea or lakes, so it’ll definitely be fun.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, once in a while we might as well forget our troubles and just play around.”</p>
<p>Before being trapped in the 『Drop of Erathem』, Filma barely had any freedom to enjoy leisure activities. Shin had also had no chance to really stretch and play around since coming to this world, so he agreed to her proposal.</p>
<p>“We need to buy some swimsuits then. I guess we should eat something first?”</p>
<p>The time was already past 1 PM. The group had decided to eat lunch at Barbatos, since they had not eaten anything after their breakfast.</p>
<p>Shin and the others began looking for a place to eat, while trying to calm down the overly excited Filma.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 1 – Part 4</p>
<p>“—here, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Cook’s subordinates -Zazie, Lapwing, Bell and Shell- should be here. But this is….unexpected.”</p>
<p>While heading toward Eltnia, Shin decided to stop by Barbatos because “Shigureya,” Rokuten member Cook’s home, was located there. Apparently, it still functioned as a restaurant.</p>
<p>Four of Cook’s subordinates, being long-lived races, were still active: the restaurant received guests from outside Barbatos too, or so said Aral.</p>
<p>Just as they had heard, Shin’s party found an incredibly long queue before them. People from all ages, genders, and species were neatly queued in one line.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like it’s just a one hour wait, huh.”</p>
<p>“I sent a message, so there should be some action soon.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking at the queue and Schnee replied to him.</p>
<p>After a while, two young girls ran out of the doors. They had very similar faces, horns on their heads, membranous wings on their backs, and scaly tails poking out from under their clothes.</p>
<p>These two girls were Bell and Shell. Both had eyes deep red in color, but Bell’s silver hair covered the right half of her face, while Shell’s black hair covered the left side of her face.</p>
<p>“They look just the same, even now.”</p>
<p>Shin referred to Bell’s kitchen frock and Shell’s maid uniform. Based on this, the remaining two of the four were likely wearing one a cook’s uniform, the other a kimono.</p>
<p>“Found Schnee!!”</p>
<p>“Found Filma!!”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell pointed in the direction of Shin’s party and shouted cheerfully. They mentioned Schnee’s name, but as she was camouflaged, no one recognized her.</p>
<p>“Found Shibaid!”</p>
<p>“Found Sh–”</p>
<p>“Girls? Aren’t you a bit too noisy?”</p>
<p>Schnee interrupted as they were about to shout Shin’s name. The girls instantly froze, just like frogs facing a snake’s glare.</p>
<p>Shin and the others all thought the same thing:<i>ah, she’s angry.</i></p>
<p>“My message to Lapwing clearly stated not to create a fuss, did it not?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry!!!”</p>
<p>They probably ran out without listening until the end. The two apologized and quickly returned inside the store.</p>
<p>“This sort of commotion feels nostalgic too…”</p>
<p>“Though, having our names shouted like that in public is pretty troublesome.”</p>
<p>Because of the exchange with Bell &amp; Shell, Shin’s group had attracted some attention.</p>
<p>As they thought that it would probably be better to come back some other time, Schnee suggested entering the restaurant from the back door. Lapwing had replied to her message, apparently.</p>
<p>The group left the store’s front and entered a backstreet that had little traffic. When they reached Shigureya’s back door, they found a woman waiting.</p>
<p>She was Lapwing, who had been communicating with Schnee via message.</p>
<p>Black hair tied behind her head and a kimono designed with ease of movement in mind.</p>
<p>Her green eyes had a gentle light within them, just as Shin remembered.</p>
<p>“I was waiting for you. I apologize for the trouble Bell and Shell caused.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m glad to see that nothing seems to have changed.”</p>
<p>Led by Lapwing, the group entered Shigureya and was led to a special private room.</p>
<p>The restaurant, having exhausted their ingredient stock for the day, had just closed. Only those customers who were still eating were inside.</p>
<p>“Your meal will be ready soon, please wait.”</p>
<p>After hearing that the group planned to eat lunch at Shigureya, Lapwing said “leave it to us” and accepted the request with enthusiasm. There were still ingredients left for the staff, apparently.</p>
<p>“Here is your water.”</p>
<p>“Please use these handkerchiefs.”</p>
<p>As Lapwing left, Bell and Shell appeared inside. Their movements indicated that they still felt guilty in front of Schnee, but when she forgave them, they smiled while announcing today’s menu.</p>
<p>“By the way, Zazie’s cooking, right?”</p>
<p>“Zazie’s focusing on cooking!!”</p>
<p>“When she gets like that nothing can stop her!”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell replied to Shin’s question, their expressions suggesting “She’s a helpless one, that girl!”</p>
<p>“Should I go call her?”</p>
<p>“No, I just wanted to say hi. We’ll probably meet her later anyway, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Shin shook his head to Bell and Shell’s simultaneous question. He didn’t feel like interrupting her cooking just for a greeting. In the past, Shigureya’s boss and thus the head chef, was naturally Cook.</p>
<p>Zazie and Lapwing were both vice-head chefs. Their cooking skills were on the same level. While in battle, Lapwing excelled in land combat and Zazie in sea encounters.</p>
<p>Bell and Shell, the waitresses, did not excel in cooking but in terms of fighting power were both above Zazie and Lapwing.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the meal.”</p>
<p>Zazie and Lapwing came after the party finished eating, as if they had been waiting for the right timing. Next to the kimono-clad Lapwing stood the slender yet muscular figure of Zazie, wearing her chef’s frock. At first glance, it would be hard to tell that they worked in the same restaurant.</p>
<p>In contrast with Lapwing’s mellow, gentle manner, Zazie was the “wild” type, well fitting her short red hair. She looked much more like an adventurer than a cook.</p>
<p>“Did you get even better at cooking?”</p>
<p>“If you truly think so, then my efforts have paid off.”</p>
<p>Lapwing nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“So, what brought you here today?”</p>
<p>Zazie finally spoke, with a low-pitched voice well fitting her appearance. Her brown eyes gave an intense look, just an inch short of glaring.</p>
<p>“I thought of paying you a visit, since we were in the area and all. Sorry to have you set a private room for us.”</p>
<p>“No, it would not do to inconvenience a friend of lord Cook.”</p>
<p>Despite her words, Zazie’s expression suggested that she found it all a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>If one didn’t know that her sour expression was something she was born with, it would look like she was really irritated.</p>
<p>“…let me ask one thing. Mr. Shin, have you not come because of that rumor?”</p>
<p>“Zazie, please. It’s ‘lord’ Shin.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s fine. Rather, what’s this about a rumor?”</p>
<p>Shin appeased Lapwing and asked for further details about the rumor.</p>
<p>“In Barbatos’ seas, there’s an area called Kuwain. A sailor claims to have seen a gigantic ship there. He is an elf, who knew what Celciutos looks like too.”</p>
<p>“You mean to say that the ship in question was Celciutos?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Zazie looked at Shin with a sharp glare.</p>
<p>The light in her eyes came from the strong resolve of looking for and finding Celciutos — the Guildhouse of her master, Cook.</p>
<p>“Change of plans then. Tell us more about the current situation. If possible, we’ll secure it.”</p>
<p>The ghost ship mentioned by Aral…Shin thought that it could be what they were looking for.</p>
<p>Apparently, the elf who had seen the mysterious ship was not in Barbatos anymore: he had come to report to Zazie and the others that he had seen Celciutos several years before.</p>
<p>“Is that elf someone’s support character?”</p>
<p>“No, to put it in simple terms for you, he’s just an NPC. He used to work in Erculus harbor and had the chance to see Celciutos several times, so he remembered its appearance.”</p>
<p>“It’s true that it stopped a few times in Erculus. The probability that he had just made a mistake is pretty low then.”</p>
<p>Erculus was a hometown that prospered as a port in the game era. Other than ships of all sizes, ship-shaped guildhouses could anchor there too.</p>
<p>Even without dropping anchor at a port, all Rokuten members could teleport directly from their guildhouses or homes. There also was a support character set exclusively to refill supplies, so no one else had to do that.</p>
<p>However, as it was a ship, they would occasionally use ports temporarily. One reason was to show off the grand, luxurious vessel that Celciutos was.</p>
<p>“Where exactly is this Kuwain area?”</p>
<p>“According to fishermen and sailors of trade ships, it’s the area above Hinomoto when departing from Barbatos. It’s not sealed, but it’s designated as a dangerous marine zone, so the guild forbids entering it.”</p>
<p>Zazie answered with a grimace, which Lapwing explained to be due to the guild’s refusal to allow them entry in the Kuwain area when they requested it.</p>
<p>“What exactly does “Dangerous Marine Zone” mean?”</p>
<p>“The Kuwain area is surrounded by three powerful currents, as if forming a triangle. Each corner of this triangle has also become the home of monsters which protect their respective territories. Until a few years back, the monsters just scared away those who tried to enter their zone, but now people say that they started attacking and destroying ships: even in areas that were previously peaceful. Now there are frequent storms violent enough to overthrow even large-size ships.”</p>
<p>Lapwing continued Zazie’s explanation, finishing by putting a hand to her cheek and sighing.</p>
<p>Storms alone would be enough of a problem, but with monsters involved too, it was not wrong for the guild to seal off the area to inspect it, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>There were three monsters guarding the Kuwain area, called the Three Sea Beasts.</p>
<p>In the northwest, a giant squid with 20-mels limbs and magic-unleashing gems, “Mascurda”.</p>
<p>In the southeast, a shark with razor-sharp fins and poisonous needles growing all over its body, “Eolios”.</p>
<p>In the southwest, a sea snake with body hair and compound eyes as tough as steel and even crab-like pincers, “Keseldran”.</p>
<p>These three monsters, commanding their minions, constantly fought to expand their territories, so very few returned from the Kuwain area alive, added Lapwing.</p>
<p>The elf who had spotted Celciutos had nearly died there himself: his ship overthrown, he was carried by the currents and ended up inside the Kuwain area. He was prepared to meet his end, or so he said.</p>
<p>After spotting Celciutos, he exhausted his energy and sank beneath the waves, but when he woke up again he found himself floating near the Barbatos coast, hanging onto a wooden plank like a floating tube. A passing ship then rescued him, so he had barely survived.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely something strange going on there.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Based on the sea environment, it’s probably Beasts, maybe mermen or fishmen.”</p>
<p>Shin also agreed with Lapwing’s hypothesis.</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, human-like sea creatures were called “Mermen”, while the ones more similar to fish were called “Fishmen”. Both categories were variations of the Beast group, specialized in underwater combat: they could dive without limits and all their stats grew by 10% while underwater. In exchange, their stats decreased by 10% when on land.</p>
<p>Underwater, all obstacles to their movement disappeared, so they boasted peerless strength at sea.</p>
<p>Some players employed strategies such as using this unlimited diving ability to drown other players and win. Having unusual names and statuses, they had a unique position within the Beast category.</p>
<p>“Based on what that elf said, even if entry is forbidden it’s not like there are walls or anything, right? Couldn’t we just sneak in?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s possible, but to inspect the area we’d need a ship of fairly large size, so it would be difficult to enter without the guild’s permission, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Lapwing and the others could not procure an inspection ship of sufficient size, so their request was refused.</p>
<p>In the game, Shin had experienced the sea during a storm. Waves large enough to knock over even large ships, unless they had magic enchantments to prevent it, were common in this world. Average ships wouldn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p>“I guess that means we should get permission first. Do you know what the conditions are?”</p>
<p>“To own a ship equal or superior to a certain size. The presence of an adventurer rank A or above. To have equipment suitable for fighting underwater. Those three should be all the conditions. Naturally, there isn’t any compensation in case of death or injury. Going to that area is seen as having a death wish, after all.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see that.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed to Lapwing’s words. Even excluding the three Sea Beasts, the Kuwain zone was rife with monsters. Just by hearing what Zazie and Lapwing said, Shin could tell how troublesome the area could be.</p>
<p>Originally, sea monsters appeared in the ocean much more frequently than monsters did on land. Footing was not stable and attacks could come from any direction. Additionally, if the enemy is underwater attacking then options become limited.</p>
<p>In the game era, there were plenty of tales of players who had made a name for themselves on land, but then died as soon as they challenged the seas.</p>
<p>The three Sea Beasts were powerful monsters around level 800, so their minions would obviously be quite threatening as well. Zazie and her comrades had been raised focusing more on creation skills such as cooking rather than fighting, so it would have been difficult for them to return alive.</p>
<p>“First of all, what we need is a ship.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, do you have anything in mind?”</p>
<p>Zazie looked at Shin with an expression full of anticipation.</p>
<p>“Well actually, I have the parts. If I can have a place to put them together, I can make a ship.”</p>
<p>Celciutos was extremely large and powerful even among all other magic-powered warships: in THE NEW GATE, it was one of the best super dreadnoughts existing. Its maintenance parts were in absurd quantities, most of them being made by the blacksmith, Shin. A large quantity of prototype and spare parts for ships thus rested in Shin’s item box.</p>
<p>Shin kept the parts in separate folders, according to the size of the ship they were for. He could exchange parts and customize ships, as long as the sizes were the same.</p>
<p>“As expected of Lord Shin!! Let us make preparations right away!!”</p>
<p>The overjoyed Lapwing was ready to burst out of the room.</p>
<p>“Can you really have a place ready that easily? I can’t just build it anywhere, you know?”</p>
<p>In the game all one had to do was to go to the port’s management office and register to build a ship, but in reality things could not surely be that easy.</p>
<p>“We are having a ship built in an acquaintance’s shipyard. I feel bad for the carpenters, but we will borrow that space.”</p>
<p>“Is that alright? I mean, in terms of your relationship with them.”</p>
<p>If there was a place available, they wanted to start right away, but saying that they didn’t need the requested ship anymore could be a problem.</p>
<p>“I think it will be alright. That carpenter wouldn’t care about small things if it meant honing their techniques. Rather, I’m sure he will look at the ship you make and try to steal your techniques.”</p>
<p>Zazie added that the carpenter would probably want to watch as the ship was made in place of his.</p>
<p>“Can you take me there right away, then? I want to make preparations and go to Kuwain as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The two girls nodded at Shin’s words and stood up. Having left the dishwashing to Bell and Shell, Zazie and Lapwing guided Shin’s group towards a large avenue. They had not changed before leaving, as their clothing had magic enchantments that kept them and their equipment clean at all times. It wasn’t something useful in battle, but Cook stated that it was absolutely necessary. Shin reminisced about making them with Cashmere and Hecate’s help.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 1 – Part 5</p>
<p>“It’s here.”</p>
<p>“As expected of a shipyard, it’s really huge.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group visited a shipyard located at the edge of the port. Despite its location, it didn’t lose to other shipyards in size. The group followed Zazie to the docks and found two galleons hanging in midair, suspended by fixtures. Next to them was a ship in the process of being built, probably the one requested by Zazie and her comrades.</p>
<p>The workers noticed Zazie’s arrival and one of them called to a large man who was a bit farther away from them.</p>
<p>The man then came closer; he was of short stature, but about two times wider than the average person, with a stocky and muscular physique.</p>
<p>“Hey there, Zazie. The ship is still in the works, ya know?”</p>
<p>Judging from the man’s familiar tone, he must have been on good terms with Zazie. Shin imagined him to be one of the chief carpenters.</p>
<p>“I came to talk about that ship. This guy is an acquaintance of ours, an adventurer named Shin. This man is the boss and chief carpenter of this Gourd Shipyard, Zigma Gourd, but everyone just calls him chief.”</p>
<p>Zazie did the introductions; Shin had told her that he didn’t want to attract attention where other people could see, so she had kept the introductions to a bare minimum. Lapwing fretted, looking at her.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Lapwing.”</p>
<p>“Zazie, isn’t that way of speaking a bit rude?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Shin isn’t the type of person to care about things like that.”</p>
<p>Even while Schnee added a helpful comment, Zazie continued talking with Zigma. She told him to suspend making the ship and Zigma looked at Shin.</p>
<p>“This isn’t something to talk about here I wager. Let’s go to the back, follow me.”</p>
<p>The group followed Zigma’s pounding steps to a small room in the back of the office. After drinks were served, Zigma started talking.</p>
<p>“So, why don’t you need the ship anymore? I know the reason why you needed it, why you’re so bent on this. I don’t think you can find a replacement so easily.”</p>
<p>To have a normal ship, one just needed to pay the right amount of money. Kuwain was an extremely dangerous marine area with powerful storms though. A ship that had its large size as its only advantage was still doomed to sink.</p>
<p>“I know you girls, you can’t have given up, right? The lad here is involved in it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Shin is going to make the ship.”</p>
<p>“Say what now?”</p>
<p>Zigma looked at Shin again, straight and deeply, as if to scan what kind of person he was.</p>
<p>“Yes, I would like to borrow the space where that ship is being built.”</p>
<p>“Do you have the materials? In order to make a ship like the guild specified, the materials alone cost an arm and a leg, ya know that?”</p>
<p>“I have the parts already, yes. There was no other good place to put them together, so…”</p>
<p>Saying so, Shin put an item card on the table.</p>
<p>“An item card, huh. It’s true that it would make carrying materials easy. But just having the parts isn’t enough to build a ship, how about that?”</p>
<p>Building a ship required a certain amount of manpower. Even if parts and tools were turned into item cards, Shin’s group was just five people. With three of them being women, Zigma appeared skeptical that they could build a ship by themselves.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want this to be known, but…using skills, I’d make do somehow.”</p>
<p>“…I see, so you’re a skill inheritor.”</p>
<p>Zigma nodded, convinced.</p>
<p>Skills allowed the use of powers well beyond human understanding. The item box, which allowed children to carry items of massive weight, was similar also.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of someone who did not understand skills, it was something impossible to comprehend. Shin’s way of speaking was due to him being an inheritor, and Zigma recognized that.</p>
<p>He was a creator, but also a businessman. The contract had been canceled unilaterally, but Zazie said that they would pay the full price, so he acknowledged their request.</p>
<p>“Well, business’s business, if ya pay I got nothing to say.”</p>
<p>“It sure doesn’t look like that, though?”</p>
<p>As Zazie pointed out, even if Zigma said to be content, his sour expression suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>“Can ya blame me? Building ships is my lifework. I haven’t spared anything, not materials nor technique, in the ship we’re making now. I can swear that it’d be my life’s masterpiece.”</p>
<p>He was surely confident; Zigma’s expression did not contain an inch of arrogance.</p>
<p>“That said, Zazie. Your expression tells me that the lad here can build something a hell of a lot better than I can. You know my skills, and here we have someone you trust that much. You bet I’m interested.”</p>
<p>“You never change, do you. Shin, I’m sure it’ll be alright with him.”</p>
<p>Zazie looked at Shin, as if to encourage him to show Zigma his skill usage.</p>
<p>Zigma’s attitude and the halfway built ship clearly showed that he had pride in his expertise, so Shin decided that he could let Zigma see his skills.</p>
<p>“…don’t tell anyone else about what you see or hear, and never mention that you saw me. If you can promise me these two things, then it’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. Whatever I see or hear, I’ll bring with me into the grave. If there’s something I can steal, will ya let me?”</p>
<p>“Take anything you can. I won’t stop you for using it as reference for other work.”</p>
<p>“Now this is one cocky lad. I’m getting excited here!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t possible to make a skill into your own just by looking at it. Looking at the completed ship and using it as reference for other projects was no problem for Shin.</p>
<p>In contrast, Zigma nodded, an evil-looking grin on his face. His pride as an artisan was burning, without a doubt.</p>
<p>As there were no separators or barriers within the shipyard, Shin would put together the ship after the other carpenters left. The group split with Zazie and Lapwing for the moment, who would return to Shigureya, and headed to the guild.</p>
<p>“Hopefully they give us permission without too much of a fuss.”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled to himself, even if he knew that it would be difficult. Filma, who was looking around at Barbatos’ town scenery, heard him and replied:</p>
<p>“Judging from what Zazie said, won’t it be pretty impossible? I doubt they’d easily let anyone go in a place if they know it means having a death wish.”</p>
<p>“They’re the current owners of Shigureya, though. The guild or the government might not want to lose such talent like that.”</p>
<p>“That is probably it. Shigureya would turn into a warehouse if they were to be gone.”</p>
<p>Shibaid said that even with the ship their chances of being authorized were low, and Schnee agreed.</p>
<p>Homes could usually be accessed by others only if the owner was inside or together with the visitor. This was the same for Shin’s Tsuki no Hokora too; now that it was inhabited, only Tiera, Yuzuha, and Kagerou — other than support characters like Schnee — could enter it.</p>
<p>Yuzuha because she had a contract with Shin, Tiera because Schnee registered her as Tsuki no Hokora member when she took her under her wing, and Kagerou for the same reason as Yuzuha.</p>
<p>If Zazie and her companions were to die, in this world only Shin would be allowed to enter Shigureya, as he had a special authorization due to being a member of Rokuten.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how Zazie and the others were treated in Barbatos, but imagined that they wouldn’t want them to go into such dangerous areas.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just try. We better gather info about the monsters that appear in these parts too.”</p>
<p>Just knowing about what they could face would be very helpful, the authorization could also come later. Is what Shin thought, when Tiera-who had not spoken a word until then-called to him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin. Fighting at sea will be something like when we fought the Gale Serpents in the storm last time right?”</p>
<p>“Well…yeah, but we could also have to fight underwater. I don’t think Celciutos could sink, as it has a diving function too. If, for some malfunction, it sinks underwater, we’d have to dive to recover it.”</p>
<p>Shin could turn any equipment into equipment usable underwater.</p>
<p>He had already done it to all party members…he thought, and then remembered that Tiera’s equipment had been updated.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, we have to do “that” one more time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do anything weird this time, okay?”</p>
<p>“Stop saying things that could be misunderstood…the design is random, I tell you. I was surprised myself that you got that of all things.”</p>
<p>A small accident happened last time Shin attached the underwater function to Tiera’s equipment. It was a very rare case, but for a woman such a design was a bit…no, extremely revealing. It was doubly rare, as it rarely appeared and Shin had never seen anyone wear it.</p>
<p>“I was more surprised!! What in the world was that, anyway? Even if it was to swim underwater, t-to wear that outside…would make me some perverse woman!!”</p>
<p>Remembering the incident, Tiera blushed fiercely and protested.</p>
<p>“Calm down, please! You’re too loud!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were few people around them, but they had attracted the attention of all those few, so the group hurried away.</p>
<p>As they walked on, Shibaid casted an inquiry.</p>
<p>“Shin, what happened to Tiera? It could not have been something trivial, if she showed such strong emotions in public.”</p>
<p>“When I attached the underwater function to her equipment, well, there was a small accident. Clothes and armor become a swimsuit, right? She had a rather risque one.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that it was pretty easy on the eyes, but did not dare voice his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see. There are many more variations for women than men, after all. I remember that there are also quite a few bizarre ones too.”</p>
<p>“Some of them are more embarrassing than being naked. I had something pretty crazy too. Are you sure it’s really random, hmm?”</p>
<p>“I said it is! If I could choose, I’d pick the current one from the start.”</p>
<p>Shin replied firmly to Filma’s teasing. If he didn’t, Schnee’s eyes would throw even sharper daggers into his back.</p>
<p>“I heard that nothing like that happened in Schnee’s case though?”</p>
<p>“Just a coincidence, I tell you.”</p>
<p>Tiera and Filma had very revealing designs, but Schnee had her current one the first time, so it was decided right away.</p>
<p>Depending on the viewpoint, however, one could say that in Schnee’s case any design would have worked.</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped, can it? I think that’s the one that looks best on her.”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t neglecting Schnee, or so he strongly stated. There were no lies there.</p>
<p>“You heard that?”</p>
<p>Filma grinned and turned towards Schnee, who was walking behind her.</p>
<p>“I haven’t said anything.”</p>
<p>Schnee looked the other way, but judging from her twitching ears, she surely didn’t look displeased.</p>
<p>“Heh, just as planned.”</p>
<p>“Tch, that was on purpose!?”</p>
<p>Shin groaned towards the chuckling Filma.</p>
<p>“Enough about the equipment, there’s the guild.”</p>
<p>Shin looked forward in response to Shibaid’s announcement and saw a building very similar to the ones he had seen in Bayreuth and Falnido. The signboard also showed that there was no mistake.</p>
<p>“By the way, Filma, were you registered in the Adventurers’ Guild?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? No, why? When I was active people were still recovering from the confusion caused by the Dusk of the Majesty, so there weren’t cross-continental organizations like the guild.”</p>
<p>“Guess we should do that then. You’d get an ID too.”</p>
<p>At present, for Shin’s group that was how much a Guild card was worth. Selling the materials they had meant that they were never out of funds. For gathering information too, as Shibaid was rank A, it wasn’t necessary for Shin and the others to raise their own ranks.</p>
<p>“It’s the same inside too, huh.”</p>
<p>The interior of the guild had reception counters to the right, a tavern to the left and a board with requests in the center, the usual composition.</p>
<p>The only differences were the species and equipment of the adventurers inside. Probably because of Barbatos being close to the sea, they could see mermen and fishmen here and there. Shin also noticed several Rare and Unique class items, probably picked from the seafloor.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Barbatos branch of the Adventurers’ Guild. How may I assist you?”</p>
<p>A woman with light blonde hair was at the reception.</p>

<p>“I’d like to register her as an adventurer.”</p>
<p>Shin knew the guild’s regulations, so they skipped the various explanations and proceeded with the registration.</p>
<p>“—-registration complete. Your card will be ready for pick up tomorrow.”</p>
<p>As before, it took one day to issue the card.</p>
<p>“Since we’re here, I’d like to ask you something. About the authorization to enter the Kuwain area, is it possible to receive it if we’re having a ship ready soon?”</p>
<p>“The authorization to enter…the Kuwain area…?”</p>
<p>Few people probably ever asked about it. The receptionist seemed to have no idea about what Shin was talking about.</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard that either the guild or the state’s authorization was needed in order to enter it. How does it work?”</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment…our staff needs to see the actual ship before granting authorization. There is a past case of people heading to sea with a ship of smaller size than the one reported in the request and disappearing, you see.”</p>
<p>The receptionist talked while looking at a document, probably listing the regulations. In the case she cited, some fishermen had witnessed the requester leaving port.</p>
<p>“Understood. I will come again once we have the ship then.”</p>
<p>“You can present your request first, if you wish to. The staff can fill in the ship’s information when they inspect it, so the procedures can be a bit quicker.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. Yes, I’ll do that.”</p>
<p>Thinking that saving time was always welcome, Shin filled in the required fields of the request form.</p>
<p>“Your name is…Shin, I see. Please present your guild card too.”</p>
<p>Shin handed in the filled request form and the receptionist checked it and compared it with his guild card.</p>
<p>“You are rank D? I’m afraid that even if you have a ship, you would not be granted the authorization.”</p>
<p>“There’s a rank A in my party. That means there’s no problem, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct, but…if you do not mind me confirming, you are the party leader, lord Shin?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Could you please tell me the ranks of your party members?”</p>
<p>Despite the presence of a rank A, the party leader was rank D. The receptionist probably found it strange.</p>
<p>Some adventurers deliberately set lower-ranked members as leader, in order to let them accumulate experience. There was no reason to use an inexperienced leader when going to a place like Kuwain, however.</p>
<p>“We have one C and one F, then two partner monsters. Depending on the circumstances, other members could join us later too.”</p>
<p>Zazie and the others would probably come with them too, but as Shin didn’t know if they were registered as adventurers or not, he kept things vague on purpose.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Do you know what the conditions for the authorization are?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The presence of an A-rank adventurer, a ship equal to or superior to a certain size, equipment usable underwater, or so I’ve been told.”</p>
<p>Shin repeated the conditions he heard from Zazie.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct. Is your equipment ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes, for all party members. Do you need to check that too?”</p>
<p>“I apologize for the inconvenience, but it is policy to do so. I do not mean to doubt your abilities, lord Shin. We simply wish to keep the risk of losing valuable adventurers to minimum levels.”</p>
<p>“No problem. I also wish to show you that we have no intention of going to die.”</p>
<p>With the ship and equipment Shin can provide, a stormy sea or two would be a piece of cake. Based on the members of his party too, unless something incredible happened, no one even risked being injured.</p>
<p>However, He couldn’t let the guild know everything. Shin’s techniques were far too advanced for this world; if he revealed them without thinking, he risked creating a commotion.</p>
<p>Shin was thus thinking of masking the ship when it was time to show it too.</p>
<p>“If possible, I would like to know about the monsters present in the Kuwain area though.”</p>
<p>Information about monsters heavily varied based on the area, but the guild recorded everything the adventurers reported. Knowing how to counter the monsters influenced the adventurers’ survival rate greatly.</p>
<p>The adventurer’s job always required their lives to be on the line, so it was absolutely necessary for them to pay attention to monster information.</p>
<p>“You may find such information in the reference room.”</p>
<p>The documents available varied by rank, but in general all documents except the ones concerning monsters in dangerous dungeons or sealed areas were available.</p>
<p>The monsters in the Kuwain area were also reported to dwell in other areas, so Shin’s group could browse the information about them, excluding the three Sea Beasts.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Once your ship is ready, please come to the reception again. If I am not present, please say that Arno Toole received your request, I’ll make sure it can be processed.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will come again th—”</p>
<p>“Oh, my apologies. There is something else I need to speak to you about, lord Shin.”</p>
<p>Shin was about to call on Schnee and the others to go to the reference room, when Arno stopped him.</p>
<p>“Something else?”</p>
<p>“There are about ten requests specifically for you.”</p>
<p>“Requests for me, huh. I’m truly sorry, but I have something urgent to do and cannot accept them.”</p>
<p>“Understood. As you cannot accept the requests, you will have to sign the request forms. Please wait in that booth, I will prepare the necessary documents.”</p>
<p>Arno pointed at a small booth next to the reception counter. Shin told Schnee and the others to wait, then sat on the sofa closest in the booth.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. These are the request forms.”</p>
<p>Shin took the forms and signed the field stating that he could not accept the request.</p>
<p>He looked at the requesters while signing and found names and locations he remembered, such as Bayreuth kingdom or Balmel.</p>
<p>“Here, this should be all of them.”</p>
<p>“…yes, no problem.”</p>
<p>Arno checked the forms and nodded.</p>
<p>“Is this really alright with you, though? The connections you could obtain through these requests all seem very valuable.”</p>
<p>Arno explained that the adventurers who quit the guild to enter an exclusive contract with nobles or merchants, to ensure a stable lifestyle, were not few.</p>
<p>“I became an adventurer for a certain goal, so I’m not thinking of serving anyone until I have achieved that you see.”</p>
<p>“I see. A-rank adventurers are really different from the rest, after all.”</p>
<p>Arno gave a small chuckle after saying this, but Shin was a bit confused.</p>
<p>“Er, you’re talking about my party member?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m talking about you, lord Shin. I checked it before, when I processed your request. Because of your achievements in the Balmel defense battle, your promotion to rank A has been decided.”</p>
<p>The long discussion ended with the decision of promoting Shin to rank A.</p>
<p>With Shibaid present, they could check any documents, so it wasn’t really meaningful, but apparently communication had been sent throughout the continent.</p>
<p>“Stating you’re rank D when you’re actually rank A…that’s not nice, lord Shin. I was really surprised when I checked your guild card.”</p>
<p>It was very rare for adventurers to jump directly from rank D to rank A. To be sure it wasn’t a mistake, Arno had asked other staff members to confirm it too.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that either until now though.”</p>
<p>“There are several adventurers named Shin, but who would have thought you were the one who acted in the Balmel defense battle. The name “Shin the Slashing Hammer” has reached even Barbatos, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah…..that too.”</p>
<p>Shin would have loved for that nickname to spread as little as possible, so he wished to be able to disappear among the other Shins.</p>
<p>“After such great achievements, it is only right for you to be evaluated fairly. But I’m glad, now I can send you off with fewer concerns. It is always painful when someone I assisted doesn’t come back.”</p>
<p>“It will be alright, as you can see it turns out I’m rank A, so I’ll be back in a flash. I’m not going to Kuwain just to hunt monsters after all.”</p>
<p>The goal of Shin party was to secure Celciutos. In case it was within the territory of one of the Sea Beasts, they could have to fight them. There was no need to come in contact with them or fight them however.</p>
<p>The Sea Beasts’ forces were at odds with each other, so they were likely to prioritize maintaining their territories and would not venture outside them. Defeating one could cause the others to attack ships or ports, thus it did not hold much meaning.</p>
<p>“If possible, could I know what your goal is?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. It’s not something as fixed as to be called a goal, though. If I had to give it a name, I’d say it’s adventure.”</p>
<p>“Adventure, sir?”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be good to have them look in too deep into his motives, so Shin used the response he had previously thought up.</p>
<p>“Unknown seas where man fears to tread…will there be something there, or maybe nothing? Wishing to know that is also what makes an adventurer, isn’t it? To seek the passion of adventure.”</p>
<p>“Passion, is that so.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well you could also say I’m a reckless idiot.”</p>
<p>There really were areas, called untrodden domains, which people very rarely visited. Shin found about them by coincidence, when he was looking through documents in Falnido.</p>
<p>Some adventurers made a living by entering such areas and finding rare items or exploring ruins. Shin decided to present his party as belonging to such a category.</p>
<p>“Not at all, there are many locations that have been discovered by such people. No one would call them idiots.”</p>
<p>“If you said that, I feel more confident.”</p>
<p>“As I am sure you know, fighting at sea is completely different than fighting on land. The monsters are peculiar too, but fighting in a field like the sea means that if you simply fall in, your movements will be limited. We die if we cannot breathe, and if the current sweeps us away and we lose our sense of direction, only death awaits. Please, do not let your guard down.”</p>
<p>“…I will not.”</p>
<p>Working in a guild in a port town, she surely knew well how terrifying the sea could be. Arno’s words and expression clearly showed that she was genuinely worried about Shin and his party.</p>
<p>“Please forgive me if I sounded patronizing.”</p>
<p>“No, I understand you said that out of concern for our safety. I am aware of how dangerous the sea can be, but I will be even more careful.”</p>
<p>Shin then went to join Schnee and the others to go to the reference room. There they looked up information about the monsters dwelling in the Kuwain area and compared them to what they knew. Being a forbidden area, there was not a lot of information, but there were not great differences with what they knew from the game era.</p>
<p>“The problem is the three Sea Beasts turning so violent. It’ll be easier if they don’t come to attack us, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>On the way back from the guild to the shipyard, Shin sighed.</p>
<p>In the game, the monsters called Sea Beasts did not attack unless provoked. According to Zazie’s information, however, now they indiscriminately attacked anyone they saw.</p>
<p>“What shall we do if we damage them and they do not withdraw?”</p>
<p>Shin held his chin, thinking about how to answer Schnee’s question.</p>
<p>“We could escape if we stop their movements, but they’re faster than us in the water…”</p>
<p>It would be difficult to make the monsters lose sight of the party, even with status effects such as 【Paralyze】 or 【Confusion】.</p>
<p>“We either stop them with binding skills, or through brute force.”</p>
<p>One method would be repeatedly striking them with lightning-element attacks to forcefully disrupt the control of their bodies. Doing so would prevent them from following the party.</p>
<p>If binding, like status effects, turned out to be ineffective, the only way was to inflict enough damage to slow down their movements.</p>
<p>“Could we distract them with some lure?”</p>
<p>“They’re all really huge, though…”</p>
<p>Shin considered Filma’s decoy strategy too. The 3 Sea Beasts, however, were all much larger than Shin’s party. They had no idea about the size of lure large enough to distract them.</p>
<p>Turning it into an item card would mean the weight was not a problem, but procuring such a lure would be very difficult. Even if they used Tsuki no Hokora’s creation device, using precious ingredients filled with unique magic as a lure sounded like a waste.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t they just swallow us whole while the lure’s materializing anyway?”</p>
<p>That was the greatest concern. If the monsters ate them up while the item was still appearing, it would be all for nothing.</p>
<p>“…you’d be okay, Shin.”</p>
<p>“My HP would, sure! But mentally I wouldn’t!!”</p>
<p>Shin wouldn’t enjoy having to cut his way out from the monster’s belly. Filma’s idea was obviously out.</p>
<p>“Anyway, we have to build the ship first…”</p>
<p>Shin emitted a tired sigh and put off the conclusion to the problem for later.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 2 – Part 1</p>
<p>Shin’s group arrived again at the shipyard just as the usual workday was coming to an end. Peeking inside, they saw the workers starting to clean up before leaving for the day.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re back, huh.”</p>
<p>Zigma spotted the group right away and approached them.</p>
<p>“Yes. What about Zazie and the others?”</p>
<p>“They’re already in the back. Want me to go call them?”</p>
<p>“No, we’ll head over there ourselves. I guess it’ll take some more time until the workers leave anyway.”</p>
<p>“You got a point there.”</p>
<p>In the room where they had spoken with Zigma earlier that day, Shin found Shigureya’s members, as the chief carpenter had said.</p>
<p>They killed time chatting, then headed to the work area after they made sure the workers had all gone home.</p>
<p>“What did you do with the ship you were working on?”</p>
<p>“Zazie turned it into a card. After all, it would be a waste to just dispose of it.”</p>
<p>The chief had no intention of throwing away the materials.</p>
<p>“I’ll get to work right away, then.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Zigma’s words and started choosing the parts he needed from the item box. From Zigma’s viewpoint, it probably looked like Shin was drawing something in the air with his index finger.</p>
<p>“It’ll only take an instant, so please make sure you don’t blink.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Shin activated the skill and the ship’s completed plans appeared in his head. In the game, they would have appeared in a separate menu window.</p>
<p>Where there were missing or excess parts, the plans would flash red. In the map in Shin’s head, however, there were no red spots.</p>
<p>“【Creation】!”</p>
<p>Shin activated a key command and the item cards swirled in midair, shining brightly. The lights, as if they had a will of their own, changed shape and formed a ship.</p>
<p>“Wh-what in blazes…!?”</p>
<p>Zigma’s utterly surprised voice escaped his lips. He had probably expected a skill that combined all of the ship’s parts in an instant. Seeing the lights change shape in front of his eyes would have surely been shocking had he not known about the skill.</p>
<p>A few moments after the lights started changing shape, a ship not unlike a large cruiser, was formed.</p>
<p>“Our main objective is exploration, so I focused on movement and defense.”</p>
<p>The ships created by players had different performance based on the parts used. Shin had chosen parts that would allow the ship to move with agility even during storms, and resist surprise attacks from monsters. It looked like a ship that would travel by floating on the sea, but it was actually a magic vessel that could also submerge if necessary.</p>
<p>“Well I’ll be…what is even going on here!?”</p>
<p>“This skill lets you instantly combine the parts you have into the finished product. Well, even I can’t explain why it looks like lights changing shape though.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t say that it was a video game’s visual effect.</p>
<p>“Can I touch it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m going….to inspect it too.”</p>
<p>As soon as Shin had consented, Zigma rushed towards the ship with the eyes of a carnivore pouncing on newly spotted prey. It looked like he had only listened to the first word Shin said.</p>
<p>“Nghwaaahhh!! What’s this smooth coating!? Not a single wrinkle. The dense magic power contained in each part. But it’s all harmonised together, forming an even stronger bond!!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s group was rendered speechless for a while by Zigma’s sudden change.</p>
<p>The chief jumped on board of the docked ship and analyzed the materials and techniques used in its creation, his eyes blood-red. He hugged the ship tight, as if licking its surface, in order to analyze it: he almost looked like he had used some dangerous substance.</p>
<p>“Chief, you really should calm down a little.”</p>
<p>“Hah!? What was I doing!?”</p>
<p>Zigma regained lucidity thanks to a chop from Zazie. His enthusiasm had not simmered though, and he started bombarding Shin with questions about which processing techniques he had used.</p>
<p>“I said calm down.”</p>
<p>“Gwah!”</p>
<p>A chop slightly stronger than the one before collided with Zigma’s head. Zazie was showing less and less restraint.</p>
<p>“You only need to look at it to know how it was made, don’t you chief?”</p>
<p>“Kh, this is frustrating, frustrating I tell ya…if only I was 20 years younger, I’d plead him to make me his disciple, even if I had to throw away everything I had!”</p>
<p>Zigma’s passionate words convinced everyone that he was speaking from the heart.</p>
<p>“That’s just impossible. Mr. Shin’s techniques are just out of this world…and that’s an understatement.”</p>
<p>“Gah, hearing that makes it all the more frustrating.”</p>
<p>The chief’s artisan spirit was definitely burning. His eyes sparkled like a child with a new toy, but also burned with the flame of a warrior eager to do battle.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I trust you have no objections about the ship now?”</p>
<p>“No shipyard in Barbatos would have objections about this. If Zazie and the girls hadn’t explained to me in detail, I wouldn’t have believed this was made with spare parts, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Zigma answered while looking all over the ship.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m going to check the inside of the ship, so look at the exterior as much as you want. Please don’t come inside though. The anti-intruder magic enchantments would pulverize you.”</p>
<p>“Ngh, that’s a darn shame.”</p>
<p>A function of all vehicles was that only after the creator registered other people’s names could they board said vehicle safely. In case the creation of the vehicle had been commissioned, it was possible to change ownership by registering the commissioner’s name first.</p>
<p>“Now we can go look for lord Cook’s guildhouse.”</p>
<p>“Yes…I’ll find it no matter what.”</p>
<p>“It took a long time.”</p>
<p>“Finally…”</p>
<p>In contrast with Zigma’s excitement, Lapwing, Zazie, Bell, and Shell were quietly rejoicing. After hearing the elf’s story, they had gathered materials for the ship, looked for able carpenters, negotiated, then finally the ship’s construction had started. The materials, however, were difficult to work without skills, so they had been told that it would take at least 10 years before completion. They were obviously overwhelmed now.</p>
<p>“Looks like there are no problems about the ship’s capabilities either. I already registered everyone. We’ll test it tomorrow, and if all goes well we can leave the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Shin informed the group of his plans after checking the ship’s functionality.</p>
<p>“We’ll make preparations. If it’s a ship lord Shin made, I’m sure there won’t be any problems.”</p>
<p>“Fantastic.”</p>
<p>“Perfect.”</p>
<p>After Lapwing’s words, Bell and Shell also expressed their approval, both giving thumbs up.</p>
<p>It was Shin’s first time using the skill after coming to this world however, so he wanted to test the ship and check it thoroughly.</p>
<p>“If you’re not going to move it until tomorrow, can I look over it until then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, feel free to take your time tomorrow too.”</p>
<p>Zigma definitely wanted to examine the ship as much as he could before Shin’s group arrived. It was also very clear that he had no intention of sleeping that night.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of doing the test tomorrow at nine, is that all right?”</p>
<p>“No problem. We’ll prepare everything necessary today”</p>
<p>“Today!”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell echoed Lapwing’s answer, while Zazie silently bowed her head.</p>
<p>After one last greeting to Zigma, who was jotting down notes while looking at the ship, Shin and the others left the shipyard.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Shin’s group had not secured a place to stay yet, but thanks to Lapwing’s introduction they could check into one of the best luxury lodgings in Barbatos. The owner was a fan of Shigureya they had said. The party could pay the lodging fee without problems, so they decided to take two rooms and split based on gender.</p>
<p>“Okay then, let’s get that over with.”</p>
<p>After dinner, Shin’s party gathered in the room the females were assigned. As expected of a luxury class hotel, the room could easily accommodate at least five people and two animals.</p>
<p>“Tiera, you have two new pieces of equipment, huh. Hmm, this is pretty plain, but this is a bit too flashy to wear on the regular…”</p>
<p>“I picked one for close range and one for long range combat, just in case. The appearance…is kind of concerning, I have to agree.”</p>
<p>One was a dark-colored shirt and mantle. The other was a sparkly armor, which reminded of a “warrior maiden” style. As Filma said, their appearance swung wildly between the plain and flashy ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>“Leaving the Bow Princess set aside, we could make the Heat Haze series a bit cuter. She’s a girl after all, she has to dress nicely too.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible to make it cuter though?”</p>
<p>“If Shin helps, sure.”</p>
<p>Filma looked at Shin and he nodded.</p>
<p>Tiera’s Bow Princess and Heat Haze equipment sets were in their default design, in other words their initial settings. Using them like that was not a problem, but the design could be modified too.</p>
<p>In the game, creation-type jobs tried all sorts of modifications and colorings in order to express their originality, creating many different designs.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear some ideas then. About the accessories, how would red look instead of gold, for the hairpin? So it matches her eyes’ color better…”</p>
<p>“An all-black mantle is a bit too simple too. We might as well—-”</p>
<p>Schnee joined Filma in helping to make the designs cuter. The three looked at the changed designs Shin created with his skills and debated on which was best.</p>
<p>“E-er…is it only me, or is the equipment getting gradually smaller? Were the pants always this short? Was there so much skin exposed?”</p>
<p>Tiera raised objections while looking at the changing designs, but couldn’t stop the three’s momentum.</p>
<p>“You can only hope that the result is something proper to wear.”</p>
<p>Shibaid shook his head, well aware that it wasn’t possible to stop them anymore.</p>
<p>“Kuh, the atmosphere is so tense!”</p>
<p>“Guruu.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha and Kagerou seemed excited to see the results of the debate.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, which felt excruciatingly longer to Tiera, Shin’s “this should be enough” signaled the end of the process.</p>
<p>“Try them on now.”</p>
<p>Shin handed Tiera the cards, a satisfied look on his face. She looked at the cards’ illustrations, wondering if it really was the same equipment as before.</p>
<p>The shirt’s sleeves had been largely cut off, turning it into a sleeveless one. The color had been changed to white, with a light green line drawing a flower-looking pattern on the chest area.</p>
<p>The pants were now around the same length as hotpants, the boots became short boots and the mantle into a hooded long coat with a faded silver crescent moon mark on its back.</p>
<p>The former plainness was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Wow! Doesn’t it look good on you?”</p>
<p>“Not bad.”</p>
<p>“That’s about it.”</p>
<p>Looking at Tiera wearing the gear set, Shin and the other creators expressed their satisfaction.</p>
<p>“T-that’s nice, I guess.”</p>
<p>Tiera looked at herself with the help of a mirror and seemed to enjoy the result too.</p>
<p>“While it’s good that it became cuter, won’t white and gold stand out too much?”</p>
<p>Tiera had not forgotten that the attire was meant to be for combat, so she wondered if the original design wouldn’t have been better for stealth purposes. Shin then explained that as battle started, the equipment’s effect would make it look the same color as the surroundings to the enemies’ eyes.</p>
<p>Even if the color was faded, the hairpin was now gold, to match Tiera’s eyes, so it looked like it would stand out, but it too, would be concealed like the shirt. The hairpin was also not just a decoration, but could notify the wearer when they had been spotted by enemies.</p>
<p>“The Bow Princess set is fine as is?”</p>
<p>Filma asked, her arms crossed, while looking at Tiera wearing the Bow Princess gear set.</p>
<p>This set’s default design was pretty popular.</p>
<p>“We can change that too if we want to.”</p>
<p>Filma, however, shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not really familiar with armor designs, so I say it’s fine as is for now.”</p>
<p>The Bow Princess set not only had outstanding stats, but its design was gorgeous too, so they decided to leave it alone.</p>
<p>“Let’s move on to swimsuit designs, then.”</p>
<p>“Agh, there was that too…”</p>
<p>Shin had informed Tiera that since there were two new sets of equipment, they would have to make them usable underwater.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you enchant them without me wearing them, anyway?”</p>
<p>Tiera, standing before Shin in her Bow Princess attire, voiced her complaints.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me.”</p>
<p>The underwater enchantment could be cast to other players or NPCs, as long as they were wearing the equipment in question. Sometimes the resulting costume was very risque, so even if it was just an avatar wearing it, it could be pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p>Because of this, in the game era most players asked an enchanting artisan of the same gender to do it.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me something weird again, okay?”</p>
<p>“It all depends on your luck.”</p>
<p>Shin then activated the magic enchantment. Tiera’s Bow Princess set started glowing, then changed shape. When the light faded away, it revealed a one piece with vivid blue and green gradations.</p>
<p>“This will do.”</p>
<p>“Is that okay? We can stock a design after it appears once, so you can check others too if you want?”</p>
<p>Tiera decided instantly, so Shin asked if she was sure, but she said that she’d rather not risk having weird costumes appear.</p>
<p>“Let’s get to the next, then? What will come out this time?”</p>
<p>Tiera changed to the Heat Haze set and Shin cast the enchantment again.</p>
<p>This time Tiera’s swimwear was a black pareo, same-colored bottoms and a white tube top, something very similar to when she had tried the Amazoness set previously.</p>
<p>“Not bad, isn’t it? It looks like the equipment became the swimwear, pretty much.”</p>
<p>The swimsuit’s coloring and design was similar to the Heat Haze set’s new design. This also was a result of having changed the default design.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad, yes, but it feels like there’s less cloth?”</p>
<p>Tiera too, like Shin, did not find the swimsuit’s design bad. It was also true, however, that the tube top cloth covering her breasts was a bit lacking in size.</p>
<p>“No need to worry yourself over it, should we try the next one?”</p>
<p>Tiera’s words had directed Shin’s attention to her chest; the sharp chill from the stare he then felt on his back prompted him to encourage Tiera to try another design.</p>
<p>“Yes, I guess that’s better.”</p>
<p>Tiera agreed and Shin cast the enchantment again. The next swimsuit was composed of black hotpants-like bottoms and a white bikini.</p>
<p>Maybe because of an unknown rule, the bikini was rather small as well.</p>
<p>“Shin, you aren’t doing this on purpose, are you?”</p>
<p>“Well, Shin’s a boy after all, it’s not weird for him to prefer the sexy type.”</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p>Shin shook his head as fiercely as he could in response to Tiera, Filma, and Schnee’s words and looks.</p>
<p>“Wait just a second!! You’re saying it like it’s my fault, but the size of the cloth can’t be adjusted, okay!?”</p>

<p>Shin cast the enchantment several other times, but each design had very limited cloth extension.</p>
<p>“Is this because we changed the original design?”</p>
<p>“Well, we did make it a lot more “open” than the default one. I never heard that it would influence the swimsuit though.”</p>
<p>If the same thing happened frequently, information about it would have spread.</p>
<p>“Will reverting the design solve the problem?”</p>
<p>“That’s no good Schnee, we made it cuter, it’d be a waste to discard it now. There might be a bit more exposure, but defensive power doesn’t change, so isn’t that fine?”</p>
<p>Filma opposed Schnee’s idea of changing the Heat Haze set’s design to the default one.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, the equipment retained its stats even in underwater mode.</p>
<p>Using an extreme example, even the skimpiest swimsuit, covering only the important parts, would have had the same defense underwater; even if the wearer appeared completely naked.</p>
<p>Filma was of the opinion that as long as performance was the same, some more skin exposure shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Tiera? We can try.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, well…it’s a bit embarrassing, but…I’ll keep it like this.”</p>
<p>“That’s my Tiera, I knew you’d say that!”</p>
<p>Filma nodded happily, while Tiera gave a wry laugh.</p>
<p>“Since we’re doing this and all, why don’t we change our swimsuits’ design too?”</p>
<p>“Filma, we’re not going to play tomorrow, you know? Besides it takes work to do that.”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be much work for Shin though.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, this much is nothing…”</p>
<p>Casting enchantments didn’t require a lot of MP, so Shin’s burden was next to zero. There was no need for preparations and it was still early to go to sleep, so if they wanted to do it Shin had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>“What do you say, Shibaid?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll pass. I don’t see the necessity of changing it.”</p>
<p>“….but yours is a loincloth, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Filma meant to ask if Shibaid was really okay with it, but the latter nodded all too naturally.</p>
<p>Shibaid’s swimwear was a red and silver loincloth.</p>
<p>Shin had decided on it half as a joke during the game era, so he was okay with changing it now, but judging from Shibaid’s powerful nod, he must have liked it a lot.</p>
<p>“If he says that works, no need to force him then. It doesn’t look like Schnee would be on board either, so let’s leave the swimsuit fashion show for after we recover Celciutos.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about…”</p>
<p>Schnee held her head with her hands, as if physically troubled by Filma’s announcement.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about knocking Shin out with our super sexy costumes, of course! I’ve been thinking about it ever since I heard that we’re going to the pool.”</p>
<p>“Filma, be a little more serious, please.”</p>
<p>“I am completely serious. If we want to keep Shin here, we have to use every chance we can.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so, but…”</p>
<p>“Shin was the one to set your physique, Schnee, so if we use that, we might have a chance.”</p>
<p>No matter how large the room was, with five people inside there couldn’t be a lot of distance between them.</p>
<p>Were they talking hoping that Shin heard, or did they think that no one could hear them? In any case, Shin could hear everything the two said. Tiera did too: blushing fiercely, she mumbled the words, “knock out…swimwear…”</p>
<p>Shibaid heard everything too, as evidenced by his tired expression.</p>
<p>“Let us go rest for today. Or this will never end.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Deciding to leave the girls alone, Shin decided to turn in early.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 2 – Part 2</p>
<p>The next day, Shin woke up earlier than usual and went to practice behind the lodging.</p>
<p>Thanks to his continued practice, which he started in order to gauge his physical abilities, he had recently learned to adjust his strength even with 【Limit】 removed.</p>
<p>Swinging his weapon at full strength would cause a catastrophe, so he had focused on controlling and limiting his power.</p>
<p>“You’re working hard early this morning.”</p>
<p>“I woke up pretty early too, maybe because we turned in early yesterday.”</p>
<p>Having also awoken early, Shibaid approached Shin, who was swinging 『Kakura』.</p>
<p>“There’s still some time, why don’t we spar a little?”</p>
<p>“As long as we make sure we don’t destroy the surroundings.”</p>
<p>Both cast 【Limit】, equipped sponge blades and lances for training, then faced each other.</p>
<p>Shin moved first. Sliding along the ground without a sound, he stepped closer to Shibaid. In response, Shibaid thrust his weapon at Shin. As he used a halberd, which had the properties of both lances and axes, Shibaid’s thrusts were fast and sharp. Even a mere wooden spear could have caused considerable damage.</p>
<p>Sponge-series weapons were characterized by their inability to cause damage, but Shin would have gone forward anyway. If he could dodge the thrust, he would be inside Shibaid’s guard.</p>
<p>“….if our stats are the same, I can’t get into range, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin had stepped in diagonally, and Shibaid’s sponge lance passed right by him. Faster than Shin could step in, however, came the second thrust from Shibaid’s weapon.</p>
<p>Knowing that it would be dodged, he thrust his lance in such a way to be able to quickly pull it back.</p>
<p>“I haven’t continued fighting for 500 years for nothing, after all. I have never neglected my training.”</p>
<p>Shibaid, as the party’s shield, was a warrior with rich battle experience. Even if defense was his strongest asset, it didn’t mean that his attacks could be underestimated.</p>
<p>He specialized in facing multiple enemies while drawing their attacks away from his allies.</p>
<p>Shin too had fought in such battles, but mainly against monsters. In regards to taking the right distance and strategies against human opponents, Shibaid was still relatively ahead of him.</p>
<p>“My attacks do not seem to hit squarely either, though!”</p>
<p>With renewed vigor, Shibaid attacked again. The repeated strikes were thoroughly blocked by Shin’s blade; if he focused on defense, Shin could avoid clean hits from Shibaid.</p>
<p>Shin, too, had fought many battles to the death. In a one-on-one frontal bout, even if he couldn’t read Shibaid as well as he should, there would not be a large gap between them.</p>
<p>After a while, Shin sensed presences moving about in the lodge and made a proposal.</p>
<p>“…I guess we should go eat.”</p>
<p>“…indeed. We risk standing out too much.”</p>
<p>People had begun walking around in the premises. Shibaid looked a bit dissatisfied by the early conclusion, but rested his weapon. Their weapons put away, the two returned to the room, only to find Yuzuha, in human form, standing with arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Shin ditched Yuzuha!!”</p>
<p>“You were sleeping so soundly, that’s why. It felt bad to wake you up.”</p>
<p>“Mph—”</p>
<p>Yuzuha pursed her lips and pouted, but her dangling tail showed that she was aware of Shin’s kindness and that she slept like a log.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what else to do, and Yuzuha looked down sad.</p>
<p>“….don’t leave me.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha then grabbed Shin’s sleeve. Maybe she remembered her days in the shrine. Even if her powers were returning, being alone was still one of her fears.</p>
<p>“Got it, I’ll wake you up next time.”</p>
<p>Shin patted Yuzuha’s head while saying so, and she raised her head as to rub it more against his hand. In fox mode as well as human mode, Yuzuha seemed to love having her head rubbed.</p>
<p>Shin knew it too, so he often rubbed her head without restraint.</p>
<p>“Hmm, to think that a divine beast would look like a mere child like this.”</p>
<p>Shibaid laughed wryly.</p>
<p>“A lot of things must have happened to Yuzuha too. If she hadn’t been weakened at the time, she wouldn’t have bound a contract with me either, I guess.”</p>
<p>Element Tails in their complete forms were creatures that not even Shin could have handled by himself. Now that his stats had increased, he could surely fight them much better than before, but there still was no guarantee that he would win.</p>
<p>“Mph! Yuzuha stays with Shin!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha didn’t seem to appreciate Shin’s words, and hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>“Shin, I cannot say I appreciate such words either.”</p>
<p>“Ah…you’re right. I’m sorry, Yuzuha. You’re my partner.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!!”</p>
<p>A happy yelp and Yuzuha’s tail started swinging left and right. Shin thought that it was sometimes too easy to make her happy.</p>
<p>Shin and the others then had their breakfast and, after killing some time, joined Zazie and the others heading back to the shipyard.</p>
<p>“….is he okay?”</p>
<p>Shin inquired to Zazie as soon as they stepped inside.</p>
<p>The reason was Zigma, who was fervently writing down notes on his papers, a ghoulish look on his face.</p>
<p>“Chief!! You need to take a rest!!”</p>
<p>“Look, the clients are here!”</p>
<p>“Nnnngghh!! A little more, just a little more tiiiimmmeee!!!”</p>
<p>The other workers tried to stop him, but Zigma, eyes bloodshot, did not show any sign of stopping.</p>
<p>“Looks like you tickled chief’s fancy more than expected.”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell’s shoulders dropped to Zazie’s comment.</p>
<p>“Desperate.”</p>
<p>“Perverted.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a pure artisan all right…”</p>
<p>Skilled artisans with particular ideals were sometimes regarded as bizarre: the way they expressed their passion was stronger than normal people, being focused on their craft and works.</p>
<p>No matter how much others would say enough, they wouldn’t be satisfied, and continue until they would themselves felt it was enough. Zigma, too, was one of such artisans.</p>
<p>“First of all, let’s tell him that there will be more time to study the ship after the test until we leave tomorrow. Or he might end up collapsing.”</p>
<p>He must have focused as if life depended on it: deep black bags had formed under his eyes, a level of exhaustion difficult to imagine after only one full night.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. If he keeps this up, I’m afraid that even the president would go K.O”</p>
<p>The workers brought Zigma to the nap room to let him rest, and the female vice-president thanked Shin’s group. Her name was Milea Torseau, a mermaid with blue hair and eyes.</p>
<p>She had been away on other business when Shin’s group visited the day before.</p>
<p>“We’re going to test sail that ship now, did Zigma tell you about it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you may leave whenever you want. What time will you be back?”</p>
<p>“Probably around noon, but it depends on the situation. We will definitely be back before dusk, though.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Take care, then.”</p>
<p>Under Milea and the other workers’ gaze, Shin and the group boarded the ship. Shin poured in his magic and the magic-powered engine activated. The propulsion device, attached in the back of the ship, pushed away the seawater and the ship slowly moved forward.</p>
<p>“It’s moving forward without natural or magical wind.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t even have sails…how does that work?”</p>
<p>“I can see why the president would get so riled up.”</p>
<p>The ship left towards the seas, among the whispers of the head carpenters.</p>
<p>“Ok then, let’s check the speed first. Everyone, make sure you’re holding onto something! We’re going to seriously accelerate soon!”</p>
<p>Shin made sure that there were no monsters or other ships in the immediate area and then grabbed the magic vessel’s control lever.</p>
<p>No old-fashioned rudders could be found on this ship. The pilot seat Shin was sitting on had a control lever, pedals, and some buttons but nothing else.</p>
<p>Players used to say that it looked like a fighter jet pilot seat.</p>
<p>Shin stepped on the pedal with his right foot and the magic-powered engine roared. If the vessel wasn’t pushed down on the water surface by Shin’s magic, the acceleration would probably have flipped it over.</p>
<p>Like a pebble bouncing on the waves, the ship carrying Shin’s group shot forward on the sea.</p>
<p>“H-hey, we’re, shaking too–”</p>
<p>The initial vibrations were extremely powerful, so Tiera — who wasn’t used to the magic-powered engine — desperately clutched onto the closest arm rail.</p>
<p>“Turn!”</p>
<p>Connecting his map to the ship’s sonar underwater radar, Shin maneuvered the ship while gathering information on the surroundings.</p>
<p>The following sharp turn, worthy of a race motorboat, was followed by an even louder shriek by Tiera.</p>
<p>An average ship would not only have been knocked over, but also broken into pieces beneath the water.</p>
<p>“Shin, Tiera will be at her limits soon.”</p>
<p>“Whoops, guess I overdid it a bit.”</p>
<p>Shin slowed down the ship and stopped it.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Tiera, still grabbing the arm rail, had turned completely pale and was holding her mouth with her hands.</p>
<p>Kagerou was licking her face, worried.</p>
<p>“Drink this, you’ll feel better.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Schnee and the rest were already used to it; Shibaid had not even grabbed onto any support as he leisurely gazed at the seas.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is indeed more refined than riding on a wyvern.”</p>
<p>“My head’s spinning~~”</p>
<p>“This so much fun~~”</p>
<p>Next to Shibaid, in strangely good spirits, Bell and Shell had hit peak excitement.</p>
<p>They probably felt like they had ridden an amusement park’s roller coaster. They were unsteady on their feet, but did not feel sick at all.</p>
<p>Zazie and Keritori did not create a fuss or lose their composure; nothing about their demeanor had changed.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Yuzuha was on top of Shin’s head, her eyes sparkling.</p>
<p>“We’re going underwater now.”</p>
<p>Shin pressed on the control lever, and the ship gradually sank underwater.</p>
<p>The exterior of bridge was covered by the seawater, as the light from the surface became a single column extending to the seafloor.</p>
<p>“Wow…..”</p>
<p>Still supported by Schnee, Tiera looked around and let out an exclamation of wonder. Thanks in part to the clear weather, the light shone from above and illuminated the depths of the sea, creating a magical scenery.</p>
<p>“Diving capabilities perfectly functional too, good.”</p>
<p>Shin made sure that the instruments did not report anything abnormal, then looked outside too.</p>
<p>The glass on the bridge and the rest of the vessel was magically reinforced, so it could withstand the pressure even if they kept diving. There was nothing to fear even if a monster rammed the ship from outside.</p>
<p>“We’re going to an area of stormy seas, right? Is it possible to leave the ship even in a condition like this?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, anything could happen after all. I added the option to exit the ship even if it’s underwater.”</p>
<p>“Can I try to go out a while, then? I haven’t tried the underwater mode yet, I want to see if anything’s changed.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha.”</p>
<p>Shin operated the screen tied to his menu and teleported Filma in front of the underwater propulsion hatch. Part of the menu changed and now showed Filma’s silhouette.</p>
<p>“(I’m flooding the room, are you ready?)”</p>
<p>“(Go for it.)”</p>
<p>Shin called to Filma, who had changed to her underwater gear, and activated the flooding.</p>
<p>When the process ended Shin opened the hatch and Filma swam out.</p>
<p>Like Shin and the rest of the party, she too had the 【Dive】 skill, so she did not need to breathe even if she was immersed in water for a while. Filma swam around the ship, checking if it felt any different from the past. After a while she waved to the ship from beyond the glass, signaling that she was finished.</p>
<p>Filma’s swimsuit was a red bikini, which covered relatively little of her body; skin exposure so high that Schnee and Tiera would definitely refuse to wear it. The bikini had black lines drawing flame patterns on it.</p>
<p>Despite being deep beneath the surface, the light from above dimly lit the sea, which made Filma’s red bikini clearly visible.</p>
<p>Filma swam leisurely between the brightly shining pillars of light, forming the fascinating illusion that she was freely floating, unbound from the shackles of gravity.</p>
<p>Looking at such scenery, which gave an almost sacred impression, Tiera sighed in awe.</p>
<p>“So beautiful…”</p>
<p>“Looking at her like this, she does look graceful, doesn’t she.”</p>
<p>Shibaid exhaled a hopeless sigh.</p>
<p>Among his support characters, Shin spent the most time and effort in shaping Schnee. This did not mean, however, that he had created the other characters carelessly.</p>
<p>Putting her words and behavior aside, Filma’s looks were more than beautiful enough.</p>
<p>“(Get back inside now. After I check the diving function a bit more, we’ll go back to port for a while.)”</p>
<p>“(Got it…but rather than that, how does my swimsuit look? I think it’s sexier than Schnee’s at least, pretty stimulating, no?)”</p>
<p>Filma then struck a pose and winked, instantly destroying the poetic beauty she had expressed until then.</p>
<p>“(Truly-beautiful. I-was-charmed.)”</p>
<p>Shin replied as emotionlessly as possible, to let her know how he felt about her antics. Not satisfied at all, Filma’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“(Wow, that was SO heartfelt.)”</p>
<p>“(Stop joking around and get back in)”</p>
<p>“(Ye–s sir.)”</p>
<p>Filma had always been the joking type, so Shin rebuked her casually. She was well aware of it too, as she replied even more casually.</p>
<p>“OK, let’s dive a little more and wrap things up.”</p>
<p>After confirming that Filma was back inside the vessel, Shin headed towards the seafloor.</p>
<p>The light from the sea’s surface turned gradually fainter, ultimately surrounding the ship with darkness. A darkness that, different from its aboveground counterpart, instill terror into people.</p>
<p>Utter, pitch-black darkness which did not let one breathe without proper equipment. An unstable space where sky and ground disappeared. If one wasn’t used to it, they would be subject to a stress infinitely higher than the darkness above the sea.</p>
<p>“Kuh, it’s all black.”</p>
<p>“It’s a little scary…”</p>
<p>Since it was their first time deep underwater, Yuzuha and Tiera, felt shades of this fear, even if they were inside the ship.</p>
<p>Yuzuha was looking forward, nestled on Shin’s head, her tail wrapped around his neck.</p>
<p>Tiera too held Kagerou — in puppy mode — with her left arm, while her right arm touched Shin’s left. Her hand was lightly grabbing his arm. Being next to Shin and knowing that the ship was safe let her feel just this degree of nervousness.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, not even the Sea Beasts could easily destroy a ship like this. I agree that it’s pretty scary, though. Honestly speaking, even with underwater equipment I’d rather avoid deep sea stages.”</p>
<p>Deep sea stages include marine creatures other than monsters as well, which would appear suddenly from the darkness, leaving players in a state of shock.</p>
<p>The skill 【Night Vision】 allowed to see a little better, but even so some players would run as soon as they heard about facing deep sea stages.</p>
<p>Such stages, however, were treasure troves for cooks.</p>
<p>“I think I just saw a shark!”</p>
<p>“We could get some really good shark fins from something that big. I wonder about the taste, though.”</p>
<p>As Bell and Lapwing were talking about the shark that just passed in front of them…</p>
<p>“C’mon, I want to see a giant squid! Come out already!”</p>
<p>“Forget it! Even if we knock it out, it’s not food fit for people!”</p>
<p>Zazie expressed her disappointment with Shell’s comment.</p>
<p>Even marine creatures bizarre enough to make Tiera shriek, for the Shigureya folks, were simply separated into two categories: delicious or not.</p>
<p>“As expected of lord Cook’s support characters.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, they’re just like her in that respect.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed to Schnee’s comment about Zazie and the others. Even the first time they adventured in a deep sea stage, Cook was the only one not to feel any fear. Shin remembered that she even happily approached sea beasts that Shin would hesitate getting close to.</p>
<p>“Ok then, let’s go back to port.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to test the automatic defense systems?”</p>
<p>“We’ll probably find some monsters on our way back, so I’ll do that then. I saw a lot of them on the way here.”</p>
<p>Shin answered to Schnee and changed the ship’s course to the surface. They moved at high speed not above but underwater this time, crashing into the monster groups they happened upon.</p>
<p>Not wanting to kill monsters without a purpose for the test, Shin only aimed at the ones that would create trouble for fishermen or kill people.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what a ship really is anymore…”</p>
<p>“In the past, there were areas of the sea where ships would get damaged just by traveling through them. In order to successfully navigate such locations, magic-powered vessels like this were invented. For the people of this era, it probably is an unbelievable technology, though.”</p>
<p>Shibaid heard Tiera’s mumble and recalled the past with a certain nostalgia.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I didn’t really want to experience it…”</p>
<p>Because of the shaking caused by the ship’s high speed, Tiera had become violently seasick. She was getting better thanks to Schnee’s medicine, but at the same time probably starting to dislike sea travel.</p>
<p>The ship could also navigate at normal speed, but at times they would need to escape at speeds even higher than what Tiera experienced; So Shin decided to let her experience the speed and shaking while feeling sorry for her.</p>
<p>“It’s not good to rely on medicine to stop seasickness, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Filma is right, but we have no time to train this time, so it can’t be helped, I think.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“When we’re done, we’ll do some special training.”</p>
<p>“We will!?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s style was not to let weaknesses remain as such.</p>
<p>“As expected of someone so diligent.”</p>
<p>“And all despite the fact that in this world it’s harder to raise skills, too.”</p>
<p>Zazie and Lapwing, who knew that Schnee had raised her cooking skill to 9, nodded in understanding to her response.</p>
<p>“I still don’t know well about that, does it take more time to raise skills now?”</p>
<p>“We haven’t gathered enough data to make statistics, but it looks like that the growth of a skill’s expertise isn’t fixed anymore. Personally, I feel that it’s slower than before.”</p>
<p>“I agree with Lapwing. Even if I try doing the same thing as before the Dusk of Majesty, I feel that the expertise ratio accrued to the skill is smaller than before.”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell too nodded in agreement to Lapwing and Zazie’s words.</p>
<p>Apparently, in some cases expertise raised faster than usual, but the pace was generally slower than before.</p>
<p>Skills couldn’t be trained all the time, so their growth speed required much more time than during the game era.</p>
<p>For an acquaintance of Zazie and the others, who was a Lord, it took 70 years to raise a skill from five to six, or so they said. If this was true, Schnee’s effort to raise a skill to nine was something incredible.</p>
<p>In the game era, at the time Shin headed to the final dungeon, Schnee’s Cooking skill was just level three. Even if 500 years had passed, it could not have been easy.</p>
<p>“It’s impressive that you even thought of raising it so much.”</p>
<p>“…I just cooked to keep myself occupied.”</p>
<p>Schnee replied humbly to Shin’s praise. Behind her, Filma grinned.</p>
<p>“She obviously did her best to let you taste her handmade food when you came back, Shin!”</p>
<p>“Filma! What are you saying!?”</p>
<p>“No blushing, no blushing. You wanted him to say “that was delish—gwah?”</p>
<p>“Don’t speak another word.”</p>
<p>Schnee covered Filma’s mouth to prevent her from saying anything more about the reason she had raised her Cooking skill. She didn’t like to show openly how she had worked hard.</p>
<p>“Ah…well. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“N-no! No, well, I didn’t want to reject your thanks, I……………..yes.”</p>
<p>Hearing that it was for his sake, Shin was of course happy. Hearing Shin’s thanks, Schnee panicked a little, then nodded ever so slightly.</p>
<p>Her slightly blushing cheeks, reminiscent of a young maiden, were lovely.</p>
<p>“Shin, if we don’t let ship emerge soon, it’ll stand out too much.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah.”</p>
<p>Warned by Shibaid, Shin changed his focus on the ship and quickly changed the route.</p>
<p>When the group returned to the shipyard docks, they found Zigma waiting, arms crossed. In order to start his inspection again whenever, he had prepared pen and paper and a meal that he could eat with one hand.</p>
<p>“We’re leaving early morning tomorrow, so you can inspect the ship only until then.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Can I start right away?”</p>
<p>“Just don’t push yourself too hard, please.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry. I can’t inspect anything if I collapse, I know that.”</p>
<p>Shin wondered if Zigma was really aware of that, but, as Milea was standing behind him, he didn’t say anything. She would probably stop Zigma if anything happened.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 2 – Part 3</p>
<p>“Mr. Zigma, my apologies, but you’ll have to stop.”</p>
<p>The next morning, Shin’s group made the necessary preparations and headed to the shipyard. Shin found Zigma glued to the ship and had to give him the bad news.</p>
<p>Knowing that his inspection had to end, Zigma looked disappointed, but when Milea put her hand on his shoulder, smiling, he shuddered and quietly backed away. Apparently, Milea overruled Zigma in their company — a relationship that was opposite to what their ranks would suggest.</p>
<p>“The guild representative arrived!”</p>
<p>The inspector in charge of checking the ship’s dimensions had arrived shortly after Shin’s team. The group had visited the guild the previous day, informing Arno that they had procured a ship.</p>
<p>“Oh? Ms. Arno?”</p>
<p>The guild representative, led by the shipyard workers, turned out to be the receptionist, Arno.</p>
<p>“Good morning. I have come to inspect your ship.”</p>
<p>“Good morning. So you are in charge of inspecting ships too? This is the ship we will use for our search.”</p>
<p>“I am not the only one, but…….by the way, I don’t think I see any sails?”</p>
<p>Arno voiced her doubts after looking at the ship’s shape. In this world, ships with sails were still the norm.</p>
<p>“This is a rather unique ship that we found in a certain ruin. The Kuwain area is very different from the usual seas, after all. It looks ragged, but I assure you that it sails without problems. We tested it yesterday in the bay too.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Shin’s illusion skills, the ship looked battered enough to make anyone believe that it had been found in some ruin.</p>
<p>“I can vouch for that too, miss. It does look bizarre, but let me say that it’s tough.”</p>
<p>Zigma, who had inspected the ship, gave his full approval.</p>
<p>“I see. If sir Zigma says so as well, there shouldn’t be any problems. I have verified that the ship’s dimensions are more than enough fit the guild’s regulations, so I don’t think there are problems. Here is your permit. If one of the ships patrolling Kuwain’s premises stops you, show it and they will let you through. If you do not meet any patrol ships, just go on further.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. We’re going to leave soon, so…until next time.”</p>
<p>“Please take care.”</p>
<p>Zigma and Arno looked on as the party boarded the ship. Zazie and the others were hiding inside, since things would be troublesome if they were found and stopped.</p>
<p>Shin activated the magic-powered engine and the ship departed.</p>
<p>Leaving behind Arno’s surprised expression, the ship proceeded in the direction of the Kuwain area.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“This is…not a place you could get lost in by accident, huh. A stormy sea stage if I’ve ever seen one.”</p>
<p>Shin’s party accelerated after leaving Barbatos and had now arrived close to their destination, which reminded Shin of the game era. Before them were battering rain, massive waves, and violent winds.</p>
<p>As if separated by an invisible wall, just outside the area the breeze was gentle and the waves small. A situation completely outside the realm of natural phenomena.</p>
<p>“Looks like this sea trip is going to turn rough. Are you ready everybody?”</p>
<p>Shin made sure Tiera had drunk the anti-seasickness medicine Schnee gave her and called to the group.</p>
<p>After everyone nodded in agreement, he stepped on the pedal.</p>
<p>There were no patrol ships in the surroundings. As Arno had instructed, Shin proceeded forward. The ship, lulled by gentle waves, sped towards the storm.</p>
<p>“Waah!?”</p>
<p>The next instant, the vessel shook violently vertically, a shock big enough to make Tiera shout, despite her preparation. When the ship pointed upwards, the sky could be seen from the bridge. When it pointed down, the sea surface was directly in front.</p>
<p>The gap was so large that, for an instant, it felt like the ship was floating in midair.</p>
<p>“Shin! Look! In front!”</p>
<p>Tiera pointed to a large wave, taller than the ship itself.</p>
<p>“This is even worse than stormy sea stages, huh.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to travel underwater?”</p>
<p>Despite the powerful rumbling and rocking of the ship, Schnee made her suggestion without a single change in her expression .</p>
<p>“That would be better to go forward, for sure. But the elf saw Celciutos above water, so we’ll travel above the surface for now, at least until we reach the center of the area. I wanted to save energy, but it looks like there’s no other way. Activate the vessel balance system!”</p>
<p>As Shin said these words, part of the tall wave in front of the ship split, just enough to let the ship pass. At the same time, the violent waves around them became relatively calm.</p>
<p>“Wha, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I calmed the surrounding sea with water, wind, and ground spells, to secure us a route. It’s a function that most magic-powered vessels have. That’s why these ships can travel on routes impossible for normal ships.”</p>
<p>“If you have something that convenient, you could have used it since the start…”</p>
<p>Tiera, tightly latched onto an arm rail, let out a heavy sigh, feeling powerless. Facing such a large wave during her second time at sea was a bit too much for her. Even so, she was now standing on the ship, without losing balance or rolling around, so she must have acquired some resistance.</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry. In the past, I faced a stormy sea stage similar to this. I just wanted to see how this one actually was first.”</p>
<p>After apologizing to the slightly glaring Tiera, Shin looked forward again.</p>
<p>“Let’s head northeast first. I’m checking the surroundings via the sonar and the map, but just in case let me know if you see anything weird outside everybody.”</p>
<p>The party sailed on, defeating monsters every now and then, when a tune started playing, making the air vibrate eerily.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“This feeling…it’s a cursed song.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t hear the tune well and looked towards the storm, then Schnee answered his question.</p>
<p>Unlike the barrier set up in the woods north of Bayreuth, this song did not manipulate the intruder’s mind to make them turn back, but enticed them in a certain direction.</p>
<p>“My head’s starting to hurt…”</p>
<p>“How does it feel? To me it looks like it’s trying to make us go in a certain direction.”</p>
<p>Shin asked Tiera, who was frowning, her hands pressing against her temples.</p>
<p>He thought she could be affected, but maybe thanks to her particular position as priestess, or maybe because she had powered up, she did not seem to be influenced by the cursed song.</p>
<p>“It makes its victims change directions without them realizing it. If we didn’t resist it, we’d probably exit the area before we knew it.”</p>
<p>“I see, sorry for making you do that. Put these on. If you can resist it now, they should lighten the burden.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized and gave Tiera a pair of faded silver earrings. They had the effect of increasing mind manipulation resistance and did not conflict with the effects of the Heat Haze gear set, even if equipped together.</p>
<p>Tiera put on the earrings and breathed a sigh of relief. Her expression was more peaceful too.</p>
<p>“Since we didn’t hear it before, it’s safe to assume that we’re getting closer to our destination. There must be mermaids in this part of the sea, and a lot of them too.”</p>
<p>Shin’s assumption was based on the area of effect of the cursed song.</p>
<p>If some species with lore related to singing sang cursed songs, they would obtain bonuses. Mermaids were one of those species.</p>
<p>Cursed songs did not have a very large area of effect, only around 20 mels, but that was in the case where there was only one singer.</p>
<p>Some skills could be powered up or have their area of effect increased if players and/or support characters used the skill together at the same time.</p>
<p>Cursed songs were such skills: their area of effect increased proportionally with the number of singers. Even if each caster’s skill level was low, if many sang it as in a chorus, the song could become powerful enough to affect a great number of monsters or even boss monsters.</p>
<p>“Where is the singing coming from?”</p>
<p>“That way.”</p>
<p>Zazie answered Shin’s question immediately. She had closed her eyes, probably to detect the direction the song came from.</p>
<p>“I think so too.”</p>
<p>Lapwing, who was next to her, agreed with Zazie, who was pointing west.</p>
<p>“…yeah, there’s something there.”</p>
<p>Shin used long-range sight skills and peered into the distance: beyond the storm’s veil, he found a light. Because of the distance, he could not see beyond it yet. Compared to the waters the ship was sailing now, where dark clouds stopped most sunlight, however, it was clearly different.</p>
<p>“Let’s go forward like this. Let me know if the direction of the singing changes.”</p>
<p>Continuing to use skills would interfere with piloting the ship, so Shin deactivated the long-range sight skills and adjusted the ship’s route to the west, where Zazie was pointing.</p>
<p>Eventually, Shin’s ears clearly picked up the song.</p>
<p>“They must be nervous because we’re not turning back.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, the song is disturbed too. You’ll be able to see what’s beyond the storm soon, no?”</p>
<p>“Right, let me give it a shot.”</p>
<p>Prompted by Filma, Shin put his long-range sight skills to full use, while paying attention to the ship’s controls at the same time.</p>
<p>He looked beyond the light and found a very nostalgic sight.</p>
<p>“Rejoice, ladies and gentlemen. We’ve hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>A vessel many times larger than the ship Shin built, armed with cannons long enough to pierce the sky, its front ram glinting in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Excluding the fact that it was stranded on a massive crag, it looked exactly as Shin remembered. Colored white, following its owner’s nickname, Celciutos’ imposing silhouette was there.</p>
<p>“If we go forward like this, we’ll see Celciutos soon.”</p>
<p>Shin’s words caused a wave of excitement in the party. Bell and Shell jumped up in joy.</p>
<p>“If Celciutos is in this direction, does it mean that the cursed song aimed to prevent anyone from finding it?”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, it’s strange for the song to come from inside Celciutos’ barrier though.”</p>
<p>Shibaid voiced his opinion, following a question from Zazie.</p>
<p>Shin very much doubted that normal mermaids could have penetrated Celciutos’ barrier. The support character in charge of Celciutos’ equipment was a dwarf, so it was very unlikely for him to still be alive. The only possibility was that the mermaids were protecting it.</p>
<p>“Maybe he negotiated with the mermaids?”</p>
<p>Knowing that his life was coming to an end, the dwarf could have thought of a plan to preserve Celciutos, or so hypothesized Lapwing.</p>
<p>“We’ll know all about that once we get closer.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’m sorry for them since they’re working so hard, but we’re going straight on.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Filma’s words and the ship carried on. The cursed song was gaining in volume and strength, but neither the number of casters nor their skill level was high enough to manipulate Shin’s group.</p>
<p>Probably growing more nervous due to the ship not changing directions or speed, on the course of Shin’s group, pillars of water clearly different from the usual waves started appearing.</p>
<p>Shin, wary, lowered the ship’s speed, and the responses he had registered on the map moved to surround the ship. They were 30 in all: ten on each of the ship’s sides and ten behind it.</p>
<p>“They came out of the barrier?”</p>
<p>As they were singing the cursed song, Shin could tell that they had come out of the barrier.</p>
<p>The reason was that, to prevent players from attacking safely from behind a barrier, if offensive skills were used from inside, aiming outside the barrier, its endurance would decrease significantly.</p>
<p>Celciutos’ barrier was no exception. Its endurance was very high and recovered automatically, so they had probably been singing from inside until now.</p>
<p>As the cursed song did not seem to have an effect, it would have been safer to not attempt to fight and take shelter inside the barrier: average intruders would simply be repelled, after all.</p>
<p>The responses, however, all moved outside the barrier to surround the ship. Shin thought that they did not go to the front of the ship, where the barrier was, in order to cut off all escape routes.</p>
<p>“I guess they think they got us surrounded, but they don’t know that it’s pretty meaningless for us.”</p>
<p>The front was still clear, so the ship could go forward without trouble. The speed was slower than before, so even if the barrier stopped them the ship would not suffer considerable damage.</p>
<p>Despite the ship continuing to proceed, the responses did not move. They were examining the situation, maybe, and did not emerge.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>The ship crossed the barrier of storm and winds: without particular resistance, Shin’s ship entered Celciutos’ barrier.</p>
<p>The responses — possibly mermaids — probably thought that the barrier would have stopped the ship’s advance: they scattered irregularly around the map, likely out of confusion.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re coming after us.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see how they react — this is bad.”</p>
<p>Shin was ready to gauge their reactions, but then his face tensed.</p>
<p>The cause behind this sudden change was that his map registered a new response, something larger than even the ship. Its speed was very high, meaning that it would come in contact with the party in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>As it was still relatively far, the mermaids seemed not to have noticed, and they appeared to be still undecided about how to react to Shin’s arrival.</p>
<p>“You people underwater! A huge monster’s heading here! Get back inside the barrier, now!”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t sure that they could hear him, but he used the megaphone function to try to call to the mermaids.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know about the extent of their abilities, but if they were attacked by surprise, there was the chance they would suffer damage. No matter what relationship they would have in the future, if they were annihilated in a situation caused by Shin’s group, it wouldn’t sit well with them.</p>
<p>Shin’s warning appeared to have reached the merpeople, as they all started swimming towards the barrier, managing to enter it before the large response could get closer. About one minute after the merpeople had safely taken shelter inside the barrier, the response showed itself.</p>
<p>“It’s huge…”</p>
<p>“I had the feeling it was too big…I see, it came out right away, huh.”</p>
<p>Looking at the source of the response, Tiera became speechless, while Shin laughed.</p>
<p>A body that emerged from the sea and towered high in the sky, black and red compound eyes glaring at Shin’s party: the “visitor” was none other than Keseldran, one of the Three Sea Beasts.</p>
<p>Even just the body, visible above water, was easily above 15 mels. Its size and the red aura the monster’s whole body emanated clearly expressed its status as a boss monster.</p>
<p>“■■■■■■■■■■■■■■――!![T/N: black squares, I think it’s supposed to be a roar]”</p>
<p>After less than one minute, Keseldran made its first move.</p>
<p>With a roar, better described as an explosion of sound, the monster looked towards the merpeople.</p>
<p>Unlike before, when it was just glaring, Keseldran now exuded a very powerful pressure in their direction.</p>
<p>The stormy waters, affected by the shockwave, formed radiation-like waves with the boss monster at the center.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, get ready to defend, just in case.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin examined the situation, then ordered Shibaid to activate a defensive barrier. Celciutos’ barrier was probably enough to repel the monster, but there was the possibility of it malfunctioning, like what happened in Palmirack.</p>
<p>As Shin’s group started moving, something changed with Keseldran.</p>
<p>“Er, it’s, shining?”</p>
<p>“Watch well. That’s Keseldran’s most powerful attack.”</p>
<p>Tiera perceived the danger and began to fret, but Schnee replied to her with a completely calm tone.</p>
<p>What Tiera had referred to was a bloating bluish-white globe of light that had formed in Keseldran’s maw. The thunderbolts running along its surface and the almost audible way the light blinked clearly suggested what element the attack was.</p>
<p>“It’s coming.”</p>
<p>Almost at the same time as Shin spoke, Keseldran fired a massive beam of lightning. Fitting the monster’s massive size, the bolt was around one mel in diameter.</p>
<p>Keseldran’s attack, which looked like lightning from the sky had been gathered together and given a direction, crashed against Celciutos’ barrier, then broke in four bolts running along the barrier’s surface. Part of the repelled bolts hit the water’s surface, releasing the electricity and causing an explosion.</p>

<p>“Aah!?”</p>
<p>Behind Shin and Shibaid, who had raised their shields to be safe, Tiera let out a small shriek.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt versus barrier bout saw the barrier emerge as the victor. Despite the continuing lightning strikes, the barrier’s surface did not show any cracks or signs of damage.</p>
<p>“Looks like the barrier’s still sturdy enough.”</p>
<p>The barrage of thunderbolts ended after about 5 seconds. Seeing that the barrier was unscathed, Keseldran growled ominously, then quickly retreated outside Shin’s detection range.</p>
<p>“My eyes still sting…what in the world was that?”</p>
<p>“Keseldran’s sure-kill breath. When its mouth starts lighting up like that, if you don’t dodge it or block it will turn you into ashes.”</p>
<p>Keseldran used lighting-based attacks despite being a sea monster, but its attacks were not limited to above water: its breath could also strike below the surface, its power not diminishing in the slightest. Furthermore, it even boasted the very troublesome effect of ignoring the protection granted by lightning-nullifying accessories.</p>
<p>During the game era, it allowed players to live the rare experience of being burned alive underwater.</p>
<p>The capabilities of its breath might suggest that Keseldran was superior to the other Sea Beasts, but Mascurda could avoid the breath with magic and Eolios possessed the rare skill to diffuse the breath to weaken it.</p>
<p>Precisely because such a lethal attack could not easily prove fatal, the Three Beasts maintained a balance.</p>
<p>“Okay then, let’s try talking with the merpeople first. Now that they’re surprised, they’ll probably at least listen to what we have to say.”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t sure that the approach would be successful, but planned to do his part so that both parties will understand each other.</p>
<p>“If they attack us one-sidedly, can we knock them out?”</p>
<p>Probably because they had finally found Celciutos, Zazie was feeling belligerent.</p>
<p>“Let’s wipe the floor with them!!”</p>
<p>Lapwing calmed Bell and Shell’s shouting enthusiasm, but if they were attacked she would strike back too without reserve.</p>
<p>“Considering the place, if it turns out that they’re occupying Celciutos without permission, no need to have mercy. But if there are some special circumstances, we have to hear them out, right? They can enter the barrier after all, so there has to be a reason.”</p>
<p>Shin turned the ship towards the merpeople who fled from Keseldran. He then switched the controls to remote mode and exited on to the deck.</p>
<p>“I know you’re there! We have no intention of fighting you! If possible, I want to talk with your representative! Will you accept?”</p>
<p>Shin used wind magic to spread his voice underwater.</p>
<p>He then waited, looking at the trembling water surface. Soon enough, a mermaid with light blue hair emerged.</p>
<p>“…..Arno?”</p>
<p>Recognizing the mermaid’s face, Shin was surprised. He checked with 【Analyze】 too, but there was no mistake: the name Arno Toole was clearly displayed.</p>
<p>“I have come to talk with you as the merpeople’s representative. Will you allow me to board your ship?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that would instigate your comrades, so I will come down. That would make you feel safer, am I right?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>Differently from when they met in the guild, Arno’s expression was now stiff. She was clearly very nervous.</p>
<p>Shin told Arno the number of people that would come, then went down into the sea with Schnee, Zazie, and Lapwing. Their equipment changed to underwater mode, they swam to Arno’s position.</p>
<p>“As we barged in first, let us explain our circumstances first.”</p>
<p>As Arno belonged to the guild, Shin kept his identity as High Human hidden and explained that he was helping Zazie and the others in retrieving their master’s guild house.</p>
<p>Shigureya’s owner was well known throughout Barbatos. No one had more reason than them to enter the Kuwain area to find Celciutos.</p>
<p>“Is that so. I’m afraid this is the end, then.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Shin inquired to Arno, who looked defeated.</p>
<p>If they were using Celciutos as a safe dwelling, losing it must be painful.</p>
<p>In Barbatos, however, merpeople and fishpeople were not persecuted in any way. Rather, one could say they were very welcome.</p>
<p>Shin had no idea why Arno looked so hopeless.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you everything over there.”</p>
<p>Arno pointed at Celciutos. Having no objections, Shin’s group returned to the ship, then, following the merpeople, sailed closer to Celciutos.</p>
<p>When they arrived less than 100 mels from the ship, however, trouble surfaced.</p>
<p>“Stop right there!!”</p>
<p>A large pillar of water appeared in front of the merpeople, probably meant to stop them or act as a warning. There was no damage to the ship or the merpeople.</p>
<p>The merpeople were surprised and some panicked, but Arno calmed them down.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what was going on, so he stopped the ship for the moment.</p>
<p>“Why do you let the intruders into our sanctuary? Depending on the circumstances, I will show no mercy, even if you are our mediator with the city!!”</p>
<p>The water pillar settled down and revealed a giant over 2 mels tall standing on the water. Behind him, all sorts of fishmen showed their faces from underwater.</p>
<p>The only fishman standing on the water was a Type Orca.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, orcas were not fish, so calling Type Orcas fishmen would be wrong, but in THE NEW GATE they were categorized as such.</p>
<p>The appearance was simply an orca with legs. Like a mascot that could be found in an aquarium, it was also deformed and relatively cute. The fishman was pointing his trident to the group, probably trying to appear menacing, but other than his size there was nothing particularly frightening about him.</p>
<p>To Shin, it was more of a mystery how the Type Orca could hold the trident with arms that looked just like elongated fins.</p>
<p>——- 【Marshill Killer Level 209 Pirate】</p>
<p>(A rare job, huh. He’s probably a Chosen One)</p>
<p>Shin thought so after looking at the information displayed by 【Analyze】.</p>
<p>The Pirate job was a rare one that gained boosts when fighting in water. To obtain it the player needed to defeat certain bosses: despite what the name suggested, there was no need to perform evil acts such as pillaging or plundering.</p>
<p>Some players enjoyed acting as bad guys, but mainly defeated Pirate NPCs who appeared as enemies.</p>
<p>“Let us through, Marshill. These people are the legitimate successors of Celciutos’ owner. Standing in their way means to violate the agreement.”</p>
<p>Arno’s words seemed to strike a nerve with the fishman called Marshill. As if triggered by his emotions, the trident’s prongs started crackling with electricity.</p>
<p>Shin was wondering what to do, when Zazie’s group, who had come out on deck too, stepped in front of him.</p>
<p>“We have come to retrieve our master’s possession, nothing more. What right do you people have to be here? What happened to Celciutos’ caretaker, Jesta? Why can you enter the barrier?”</p>
<p>“Successors? You couldn’t even cross the seas and abandoned our sanctuary for years! What do you want to do after all this time!?”</p>
<p>Jesta was a High Dwarf, one of Cook’s support characters. As long as something similar to what happened to Girard had not happened to him too, he was probably not alive anymore.</p>
<p>“We have kept all intruders from approaching Celciutos for generations, protecting this sanctuary. I don’t know why you appeared now, but this place is ours now. Leave at once!”</p>
<p>“Answer our questions. “This place is ours now?” Celciutos is Lord Cook’s, and no one else’s!! Keep spouting crap and I’ll turn you into sashimi, fish bastard!!”</p>
<p>Zazie roared back to Marshill’s claims of owning Celciutos.</p>
<p>Like Todo Kankuro had told Shin in Hinomoto, Rokuten’s support members still felt a deep loyalty to their masters, even after so much time had passed.</p>
<p>Zazie’s group too was highly loyal to Cook, thus witnessing other people using their master’s possession without permission and even claiming it was theirs, what would happen?</p>
<p>To know the answer, it was enough to hear Zazie’s shout and see the sashimi knife she held with both hands.</p>
<p>Lapwing, Bell, and Shell did not say anything, but all of them were wielding their weapons already.</p>
<p>Maybe because the opponents were fishmen, Lapwing was holding a sashimi knife as well. Bell had a huge sledgehammer, Shell two large chef’s knives, one in each hand.</p>
<p>Except Bell, all Shigureya members looked more like they were going to start cooking instead of fighting, but all weapons were actually Mythology grade: they could easily slice in two anything from cooking ingredients to dragon scales.</p>
<p>While not as powerful as Schnee and the others, Zazie’s group was far superior to the average Chosen One.</p>
<p>Marshill probably realized it too: from his forehead, or maybe his cheeks (it wasn’t clear where) sweat had started trailing down his face.</p>
<p>“…if you refuse to leave, we’ll just force you—”</p>
<p>“Ehm, sorry to bother when you’re all heating up, but why don’t we talk before we fight?”</p>
<p>Just as battle was about to break out before the two parties, Shin interrupted them. His teleportation-like instantaneous movement caused Marshill to instinctively try to retreat, but Shin had grabbed his trident, thus preventing him from doing so.</p>
<p>“Nnnggh! L-Let go!!”</p>
<p>“I will, if you listen to what we have to say. We have our own reasons. We can’t just turn back and leave.”</p>
<p>Marshill pulled on the trident with both hands, as hard as he could, but it didn’t budge an inch, as if it was fixed in midair.</p>
<p>“Let go!! Or else my light…ning…?”</p>
<p>Lightning ran down Marshill’s trident, but disappeared after a sparkle. It couldn’t exceed Shin’s magic resistance.</p>
<p>“Kh, what the hell…are you…?”</p>
<p>Shin calmly observed Marshill’s belligerent bunch. Despite the difference in strength, it seemed to him that they ran out of energy too quickly. The fishmen behind him were panting too, like the air around them was extremely thin.</p>
<p>The difference in fighting power was clear. Shin had used his pressure in order to make them desist from fighting. As he did, Marshill -who had tightly gripped the trident until now- and the fishmen behind him shuddered.</p>
<p>“…I understand. Let us talk.”</p>
<p>“That’s helpful of you. Zazie, you guys calm down too. I understand your anger, but blasting your killing intent like that is a bit much, no?”</p>
<p>“….understood.”</p>
<p>Zazie’s group made sure that Marshill didn’t make strange moves even after Shin let go of the trident and put down their weapons. Their complexion seemed a bit worse than before however.</p>
<p>“Ehm, may I…lead you somewhere…we can talk?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Arno’s proposal, spoken in a tone sort of lacking confidence, and returned to the ship. He piloted the ship forward following Arno’s lead; Marshill’s group also followed quietly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, that was pretty surprising.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, a pillar of water out of the blue like that.”</p>
<p>“No, what happened after that! Things were tense enough when you grabbed that guy’s spear, but then you went and put pressure on the fishmen like you wanted to kill them all…”</p>
<p>“Uh…that much?”</p>
<p>Shin meant to just intimidate them a little, thus Filma’s words surprised him. He had intimidated others in this world before, so it felt strange to him to fail in adjusting the pressure he released.</p>
<p>“Seeing your comrade’s guildhouse being used by others without permission might have made you add more power unconsciously, it wouldn’t be too strange.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I agree with Schnee.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded too.</p>
<p>“Well, I admit that when I heard “this place is ours now” I got pretty ticked off.”</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes of following the merpeople, Shin’s group arrived at Celciutos’ side. Both merpeople and fishmen climbed on land; Arno, as their representative, acted as guide for Shin’s party.</p>
<p>Merpeople’s lower body was fish-like, but when they were on land it turned into human-like legs. Arno was no exception: she was now wearing just a tube top and a pareo barely reaching her knees. Other mermaids had a similar look, while most mermen wore simple pants on their lower bodies and t-shirts or nothing at all on their upper bodies. They wore such clothing as to be ready to dive anytime.</p>
<p>Among the merpeople and fishmen, some also wore armor. They were the ones who would cover the others’ retreat in case of necessity, apparently.</p>
<p>“This way, please.”</p>
<p>As they were talking of such topics, the group arrived at their destination. Shin and his party walked on the crag Celciutos lied on, until they reached the ship’s mast.</p>
<p>Arno signaled something upwards and a sort of basket, made for several people to fit in, descended from above.</p>
<p>“Please ride on this, it’ll take you aboard Celciutos.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group now was near Celciutos’ bottom part. Without skills that made walking on walls possible, such as what Shin and Schnee had, contraptions like the basket were necessary.</p>
<p>Together with Shin’s group there were also the merpeople and fishmen, so the basket made several laps to take all present on board. Shin’s party, Arno, and Marshill went first.</p>
<p>“….ehm.”</p>
<p>When they arrived on the deck, they spotted an elderly man and four women, all wearing what looked like traditional clothing, kneeling down.</p>
<p>“We humbly thank you for coming all the way here. My name is Lierno Toole, I act as the leader of the merpeople and fishpeople living in this area.”</p>
<p>“Er, my name’s Shin. I’m Cook’s…comrade, someone the same as her, you could say. Something like that.”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t sure how to react, and opted to introduce himself first of all.</p>
<p>He could have said he belonged to same guild as Cook, but in this world the word “guild” referred to associations of merchants or adventurers, so in order to keep things separate he used the word “comrade”.</p>
<p>“Lord Shin. I beg for your forgiveness for Marshill’s disrespect towards High Humans.”</p>
<p>Lierno bowed his head even deeper, almost touching the floor of the deck.</p>
<p>“High Human!? Weren’t they all extinct!?”</p>
<p>“You felt that aura and still say things like that!? On your knees, fool!!”</p>
<p>“Gwah!”</p>
<p>Marshill was shocked to learn that Shin was a High Human and was promptly scolded by Lierno. The latter probably used magic to push Marshill down from above with an unseen force.</p>
<p>“How did you know that I am a High Human?”</p>
<p>“That device displayed that lord Shin had entered the premises.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the panel set on the wall and remembered about the existence of the device.</p>
<p>As Lierno had said, in the login column only Shin’s name was lit up.</p>
<p>“First of all, would you mind explaining the current situation?”</p>
<p>“Naturally. It would not do to talk here, however. Please, come this way.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group was led to a room previously used for meetings. Lierno waited for Shin’s group to sit down, then started talking in a calm tone.</p>
<p>“We can enter Celciutos’ barrier because of the agreement bound between Master Jesta and our ancestors.”</p>
<p>“An agreement?”</p>
<p>“In the past, when disaster struck this area, our ancestors were in danger of being annihilated. For some unknown reason, not only monsters but also some humans were set on hunting us down. I was told that Master Jesta, Celciutos’ caretaker, saved our ancestors in such a time of peril. At that time monsters were growing violent, miasma eruptions broke out, continents moved…disasters happened one after the other. It is told that if we did not take shelter within Celciutos’ barrier, our species would have surely gone extinct.”</p>
<p>Even after the natural calamities, monsters continued to grow violent: in their search for a safe haven, they had found the Kuwain area, or so Lierno said. Kuwain was originally the dominion of Ishkar, dragon king of the seas, and the three sea beasts were its guardians.</p>
<p>“Ishkar was a highly intelligent monster. It allowed our people to live here, so we finally could find safety.”</p>
<p>That did not last long, however. The Seafloor Sanctuary, Ishkar’s dwelling, was tainted by miasma. In order to contain the spread of miasma, Ishkar locked itself in the sanctuary: thus returning the peace once again.</p>
<p>Such peace, however, was disrupted a few years ago. The guardian beasts serving Ishkar, the three sea beasts, turned violent.</p>
<p>“I heard that Celciutos too was affected by the miasma and some of its functions stopped working as intended. Master Jesta used the stored items and Celciutos’ barrier to seal the miasma in the sanctuary, then told our ancestors to preserve it, or so it is said. In exchange, they were allowed to live on Celciutos. Most of its functions were locked, though. Master Jesta had probably foreseen that even a small mistake in operating Celciutos could cause disasters.”</p>
<p>Celciutos wasn’t just a ship Shin put together in a rush, but a magic-powered battleship that all Rokuten members collaborated to build, based on precise and intricate blueprints.</p>
<p>The fishmen would not have been able to make it move, but it was still equipped with anti-air, anti-ground, and anti-submarine weapons and ammunition, so just taking these out could have caused a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>“Apparently, Master Jesta said that if just one of the Rokuten members returned, they would have been able to find a solution to this predicament. I am fully aware of how shameless such a request may sound, but please, could you grant us your invaluable assistance in purifying the Seafloor Sanctuary?”</p>
<p>Lierno then bowed his head, as did the women around him and Arno. Ishkar, dragon king of the seas, was a monster on par with Yuzuha’s complete form, however. Not even Shin could easily accept to face it.</p>
<p>As Shin was reflecting upon this and thinking about what to do, Yuzuha contacted him via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>“(Shin, can’t we save Ishkar?)”</p>
<p>“(Yuzuha?)”</p>
<p>“(Ishkar, like Yuzuha. Blocking miasma. Ishkar is sea guardian. If Ishkar gone, big trouble in all seas.)”</p>
<p>“(He’s like Yuzuha, hmm.)”</p>
<p>Shin was reminded of the suffering Yuzuha in the shrine.</p>
<p>Ishkar, like the Element Tails, was a monster close to humanity. As Yuzuha said, it was probably in the sanctuary, doing everything possible to keep the miasma in check.</p>
<p>Considering this, Shin thought that just retrieving Celciutos and saying goodbye would not be a good idea. According to Lierno, if Ishkar had completely sealed in the miasma the seal would then unlock automatically: the fact that this hadn’t happened meant that it was still fighting against the miasma within the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Even Yuzuha had weakened because of the miasma’s effect: there was no guarantee that Ishkar was safe and sound. If they wanted to save him, the sooner the better.</p>
<p>In the end, they couldn’t leave miasma-related trouble alone.</p>
<p>“…guess there’s no other way. We’ll do it.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>“I knew you would say that, Shin.”</p>
<p>“Yep, sure enough.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, we cannot ignore this.”</p>
<p>“Not miasma, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, Schnee, Filma, Shibaid, and Tiera agreed to Shin’s decision. They all knew that this would be the conclusion as they listened to Lierno’s story.</p>
<p>“The first thing to do then, is to check Celciutos’ current state. Zazie, you guys help me with this too. You know the ship’s internal structure, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We should check on the engines first.”</p>
<p>Zazie’s group could also perform maintenance on Celciutos. They wouldn’t equal Jesta, who was exclusively in charge of the ship, but they knew its structure and functions perfectly.</p>
<p>Shin decided to make sure that Celciutos could move when necessary and then head to the supposedly sealed Seafloor Sanctuary.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 2 – Part 4</p>
<p>Shin’s group temporarily left Zazie’s and went to Celciutos’ bridge. The basic controls were not much different from a regular ship’s, it just had more equipment and functions.</p>
<p>According to Lierno, Jesta had sealed off the bridge, so no one had been able to enter it. Shin simply knocked on the Chimeradite door and operated the control panel.</p>
<p>“It was locked from the inside, so that only Rokuten members could access it, huh.”</p>
<p>The panel confirmed Shin’s magic power and changed the color of its light from red to blue. The door slid open, sounding like a steam vent.</p>
<p>“At least it doesn’t look like anything is damaged.”</p>
<p>The room’s self-cleaning function seemed to be still active, since there was no dust piled up. And the various panels did not look cracked or broken either.</p>
<p>As Shin gave a quick look around the bridge, he felt something tugging at his sleeve. Tiera had grabbed Shin’s sleeve and weakly pulled on it.</p>
<p>“Are those….human bones?”</p>
<p>“Bones?”</p>
<p>Shin looked in the direction Tiera pointed at and, sure enough, spotted what looked like a person’s bones sprawled on the ground. The hands were clasped on the chest, so it didn’t look like he had been killed.</p>
<p>“Jesta, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the equipment on the skeleton and quickly noticed that some of it were his own creation. It was possible to instantly notice equipment one had forged, even if it was equipped by others. Shin also remembered seeing the equipment somewhere before. He didn’t use 【Analyze】, but there was no mistaking it.</p>
<p>“…before we go to the sanctuary, can we give Jesta a proper send off?”</p>
<p>Shin contacted Zazie and the others, who rushed to the room. Zazie then asked Shin this question while looking at Jesta’s remains.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded. There was no way they would leave him like that.</p>
<p>“Are these letters?”</p>
<p>“Yes, one is addressed to us, one to any Rokuten member, one to lord Cook.”</p>
<p>Three letters were found next to Jesta’s remains. Based on the situation, they were probably his will. Shin took the letter addressed to Rokuten members and unsealed it. The letter contained a detailed report of what had happened after Jesta had met the merpeople.</p>
<p>He had chosen to spend the last moments of his life alone in the bridge, accounting for the possibility that some merpeople or fishpeople plotted to misuse Celciutos.</p>
<p>After reading the letter, Shin had a newfound respect for Jesta.</p>
<p>Other than the ship and the miasma, the letter also recounted the cause of his death. In his older years, he had caught a disease that potions could not cure. Potions mainly focused on healing wounds, so they were often ineffective against diseases.</p>
<p>The letter stated that the disease itself was not extremely rare, but maybe because he had become weaker due to his age, Jesta’s condition just kept worsening.</p>
<p>“Amazing…”</p>
<p>Despite knowing that his death was approaching, Jesta spent his days thinking about the people living on Celciutos and how to deal with the miasma, showing impressive mental fortitude.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be his comrades.”</p>
<p>Zazie, reading the letter addressed to them, whispered with a quavering voice. Next to her, Lapwing hugged the weeping Bell and Shell.</p>
<p>“….how do you bury people here?”</p>
<p>“Barbatos’ style is to cremate the body and scatter the ashes in the sea. The soul returns to the heavens, the body to mother sea…this is the creed in this region.”</p>
<p>Shin waited for Zazie the others to settle down before asking, and Zazie replied. They turned Jesta’s remains into a card, which Zazie held.</p>
<p>“Could you please allow us to participate in the send off? We are deeply indebted to him as well.”</p>
<p>Shin told Lierno that they wanted to give Jesta a proper send off before heading to the Seafloor Sanctuary, and the chief made his plea, his head bowed.</p>
<p>The whole tribe wished to participate in the funeral. Arno and the mermaids, who had waited for the High Human’s return, shared this sentiment too and nodded.</p>
<p>“….chief, I understand you want to pay your respects to the person we are indebted to, but we can’t do something like that now, can we? If we go on like this, some of us will end up starving.”</p>
<p>Despite the general atmosphere which indicated that everyone wanted to proceed with the funeral, only Marshill expressed a contrary opinion. Lierno’s scolding had probably cooled him off, since his tone was now perfectly calm.</p>
<p>“Even so, we must. That is the greatness of the debt we owe him. If we shirk this responsibility, how can we face the spirits of our ancestors?”</p>
<p>“But chief…!”</p>
<p>“What is happening, exactly? He said that your people will starve?”</p>
<p>Shin was thankful that they would participate in the funeral, but after hearing that people would die, he couldn’t just ignore it.</p>
<p>“Actually, just like the three sea beasts, all monsters in the Kuwain area started growing feral…sir. Because of this, the resources we need are getting scarce…m’lord.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to force yourself to speak politely.”</p>
<p>According to Marshill, the monsters had turned feral and attacked without regard to their own safety, so many of the fishpeople and merpeople who had exited the barrier to procure supplies had fallen victim to their attacks.</p>
<p>Some of the Celciutos dwellers could deal with the monsters, but it was nevertheless becoming increasingly difficult to ensure that all of them had enough to eat. Because of this, the settlement’s food reserves were now very low. The fishpeople and merpeople working outside helped however they could, but the limit was apparently near.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take refuge in Barbatos? Arno said that she can teleport there, so if the merpeople and fishpeople here can manage to leave the Kuwain area you can make do somehow, no?”</p>
<p>Arno, who watched Shin’s party leave for Kuwain, had somehow arrived before them. She had used a teleport crystal. It was a secret method that not even the guild knew about.</p>
<p>Arno had also said that she worked in the guild to know who wanted to go to the Kuwain area as early as possible. The teleport spot she used was just outside Barbatos, on the seafloor. The teleport crystals she used were not single use items, but high grade items which could teleport the user an unlimited number of times to a registered location.</p>
<p>“The teleport crystal I use only works with members of the Toole bloodline. Even if someone of my bloodline used it, they couldn’t bring anyone from outside the bloodline with them. We thought of moving to another location, but the Kuwain area, as of now, is too dangerous even for our warriors. Even if we moved in small, escorted groups, it would be very risky.”</p>
<p>While they were ready to flee, leaving their sanctuary behind, they could not reach an agreement about when and how to do it. Thus time passed and the situation continued to worsen. Transferring not only one or two people, but the whole clan, was something above Arno’s capabilities too.</p>
<p>Even if they moved to Barbatos in small groups, in the current situation, some warriors would surely die, so there was no way to know how many would safely reach Barbatos’ shores.</p>
<p>They had also made a plea to Barbatos’ lord, but the answer had not been favorable.</p>
<p>“Most of the people living here have never set foot in a town. It seems they are worried that a mass immigration would later create troubles.”</p>
<p>Barbatos, thanks to the pools built inside the city and its temperate climate, was a popular tourist destination. The famous restaurant Shigureya, too, was one of its attractions. Because of this, its governors were sensitive to situations that could create problems. Events that could damage the city’s reputation were dealt with swiftly.</p>
<p>For Barbatos, a mass immigration of individuals not used to living in towns was nothing but a recipe for trouble.</p>
<p>Fishpeople and merpeople were humanlike creatures, not wild beasts. They had the intellect to learn the rules and the rationality to respect them. Even so, most of Barbatos’ dwellers were humans. They were races with different cultures and lifestyles. Fishpeople and merpeople already lived there, so it was not likely for large conflicts to break out, but it would still be difficult to imagine that both sides could fully accept each other without any trouble, even for Shin.</p>
<p>“Most of all, saving us would mean entering the Kuwain area. Thinking about the casualties that such an operation would mean, they surely couldn’t send a rescue team.”</p>
<p>Not even a marine city’s sea warriors would be safe when traveling to Kuwain. It was a route dangerous even for veterans, with a very low survival rate. Any leader would hesitate to send their forces there.</p>
<p>“Many of us refuse to leave their hometown, too. They would want to stay even if the barrier were to disappear.”</p>
<p>The elderly especially displayed such a tendency. If they had to die, it would be where they were born, or so they said.</p>
<p>“Even if the barrier was gone, we could somehow manage if the monsters returned to normal. If we could get rid of the cause, we wouldn’t need to hide in Celciutos.”</p>
<p>Marshill, standing calmly next to Lierno, spoke again.</p>
<p>“I think we could do something about the need for the barrier. If we could get rid of the problem with Ishkar, then we could solve the situation somehow…or so I would like to think.”</p>
<p>Shin heard that Kuwain had originally been a safe area to live in. If the miasma was purified and Ishkar regained its strength, the seas would hopefully return to how they were.</p>
<p>Shin paused for a moment, then continued.</p>
<p>“Well, I understand the situation now. This is a problem to be solved after the funeral, but let’s all eat for now. You have to hold on for a little longer, until we do something about Ishkar, at least.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. An empty stomach robs people of their willpower.”</p>
<p>“It’s almost lunch time for us too.”</p>
<p>Shibaid and Filma, who had kept silent until then, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Shin’s item box contained great quantities of food supplies. While the funeral was important, he decided to give the priority to those who were living now.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, guys.”</p>
<p>“No, Jesta too would say that if we had time to hold a funeral for him, we should fill up people’s bellies first.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, that’s exactly what he would say.”</p>
<p>“Grandpa Jesta wouldn’t get angry!”</p>
<p>“He’d get angry and say ‘leave the funeral for later!’ instead!”</p>
<p>Shin apologized for deciding on his own, but Zazie, Lapwing, Bell and Shell shook their heads. Being support characters for the same master, they knew very well how Jesta would have reacted in that situation.</p>
<p>Schnee, who had a high Cooking skill, and Tiera – who had been trained by her – offered to help. Shin told the apologetic Lierno to gather the other tribe members and, with the rest of the party, went to Celciutos’ kitchen. Shibaid and Filma, who were not especially skilled in cooking, went with Lierno to call the other tribe members.</p>
<p>Arno was the only mermaid with the cooking skill, so she went with Shin’s group.</p>
<p>“Who knew that there was a place like this…”</p>
<p>Arno was wide-eyed; Celciutos’ kitchen was equipped with cooking utensils of the highest quality. Basic tools like knives and pots, modern machines like stoves and ovens, bizarre tools that made it difficult to guess what they could be used for… It looked like a small exhibition.</p>
<p>“Let’s start cooking. Prioritize quantity and speed.”</p>
<p>“I’ll handle the preparations.”</p>
<p>Shin took ingredients out of the item box, which Zazie and Lapwing started cooking. Thanks to their boosted stats, vegetables and fish were instantly cut, cleaned, then put into large pots.</p>
<p>There was a great quantity of food to prepare, so they decided to make soup dishes. After skillfully preparing the ingredients, they prepared to cook a bouillabaisse.</p>
<p>Bell and Shell left the room for the moment and went to set the tables.</p>
<p>“Master, you look like you’re keeping up with them, but I couldn’t at all…”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t either…”</p>
<p>Tiera looked at Schnee working alongside Zazie and Lapwing and commented, with a slightly troubled expression on her face. Arno, who was standing next to her, agreed.</p>
<p>“They go above and beyond simply being good cooks, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin too couldn’t help but laugh wryly while looking at the cooking team’s movements.</p>
<p>High physical abilities and cooking skills complemented each other to form a scenery quite different from what one would expect to see in a normal kitchen. The sound of cutting vegetables was quick and sharp, but when it was heard the vegetable had already been completely cut.</p>
<p>Rather than cooking, it was like seeing a magic trick where vegetables were sliced instantly. Shin and Tiera could not intrude the realm of such experts.</p>
<p>“…we might as well go help Bell and Shell.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s. We’d just be in the way here.”</p>
<p>The two gave up on helping in the kitchen and decided to go help prepare the tables.</p>
<p>All cooking tools in the kitchen had time reduction bonuses attached, so soon after putting them in the pot to boil they already gave a delicious smell. Seconds later the ingredients looked tasty and a kuu-like sound could be heard.</p>
<p>“…Yuzuha didn’t say anything, you know?”</p>
<p>Shin too knew that the sound was different from Yuzuha’s usual voice. He looked towards the source and found Tiera and Arno.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! That wasn’t me!”</p>
<p>Tiera realized what Shin’s look meant and motioned her denial with her hands. The only other option was thus Arno.</p>
<p>“….uh…”</p>
<p>She must have been embarrassed to be asked if she was hungry. Arno’s face was growing redder and redder.</p>
<p>“…aah, I’m sorry, that was me just now. I’m getting pretty hungry.”</p>
<p>“Shin, that was way too slow.”</p>
<p>If he had to say something, he should have done so right after the rumbling stomach. Shin’s “helpful” comment was mercilessly struck down by Tiera. It had not been helpful at all, but there was nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>“Ehm, I’m sorry, about everything…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m ashamed to have—”</p>
<p>Just as Arno was apologizing, another “kuu” sound resounded in the surroundings.</p>
<p>It was more than clear that Arno’s stomach was the source.</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>Arno, still blushing violently, hit her stomach to try to prevent it from rumbling again.</p>
<p>It was painful to see how she was trying to fake a smile. Maybe her will had won, though, because the rumbling stopped.</p>
<p>“Ehm…you don’t need to go so far.”</p>
<p>“….that’s not it.”</p>
<p>“Er…”</p>
<p>“We didn’t have enough for everyone…so I just skipped breakfast….”</p>
<p>Arno crouched down and hid her face with her hands, while explaining herself in a quiet voice. Her still visible ears were as red as apples.</p>
<p>“Shin, you and Yuzuha go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, gotcha.”</p>
<p>Shin followed Tiera’s advice and headed out of the room with Yuzuha. Tiera’s expression seemed to tell him, “don’t look at her”.</p>
<p>“With a smell like this in the air, of course your stomach starts rumbling…”</p>
<p>“Yuzuha’s hungry too!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha agreed to Shin’s mumbling, her tails swaying left and right.</p>
<p>The scent wafting from the kitchen was getting more and more powerful and now strongly stimulated the appetite of anyone who smelled it. If one had skipped breakfast, it was no wonder for the stomach to start craving nutrition.</p>
<p>“We’ve come to help, but have you already finished here?”</p>
<p>“All finished!”</p>
<p>“All done!”</p>
<p>Bell and Shell worked at Shigureya, after all, so their preparation was flawless.</p>
<p>They explained the menu, asked if anyone had allergies, and promptly completed all other necessary preparations. The merpeople and fishpeople who came inside all received a bowl and a spoon, then stared at the kitchen: the source of the smell deliciously filling the air, of course.</p>
<p>“(The food is ready, can you help us bring it out?)”</p>
<p>“(Okay, I’m coming.)”</p>
<p>Shin received Schnee’s Mind Chat and went back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Shin? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“They told me the food’s ready. I’m going to help serve it.”</p>
<p>Shin told Tiera, who was with the still slightly blushing Arno, and walked away. As he neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>With Yuhuza perched on his head, both her and Shin’s stomachs gave healthy rumbles.</p>
<p>“These are the first 80 servings. We will bring the rest as soon as it’s ready.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I’ll give these to Bell and Shell, then come back.”</p>
<p>Shin turned the bubbling pot into a card and quickly left the kitchen.</p>
<p>He then materialized the pot on a table prepared by Bell and Shell, raising loud cheers from the fishpeople and merpeople. Shin’s group split their roles and served them food, prioritizing children, women and the elderly. Shibaid and Filma kept the queue in order.</p>
<p>“So tasty!!”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is really delicious…”</p>
<p>“I feel so warm…”</p>
<p>“Mgh! Gulp! So good!! Amazing!!”</p>
<p>Mothers smacked their lips while looking at their rejoicing children. Grandmothers let out sighs of relief after slowly bringing the bowl to their lips. Young men wolfed down on their portions as if in a trance. Everyone had content smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>“So this is Shigureya’s true power. It really is delicious.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, so tasty!”</p>
<p>Realizing that if they properly lined up, they could all have something to eat, no one disrupted the queue. Taking turns, Shin’s party ate their fill too. Yuzuha took the chance to change into human form and enjoyed her soup.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s asking for seconds. Well, it was to be expected…hmm?”</p>
<p>Shin finished his soup, then his eyes caught the sight of Marshill, bowl in hand, looking at the other fishpeople. There was still steam coming from his bowl: he clearly hadn’t finished his soup yet.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to eat?”</p>
<p>“What do you—oh, it’s you, sir.”</p>
<p>The surprised Marshill stood perfectly straight and bowed to Shin.</p>
<p>“What’s gotten into you, all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“I am deeply sorry for my deplorable behavior until now.”</p>
<p>“Hey now…”</p>
<p>Shin was confused by the fishman’s sudden change. He told him to raise his head and explain first of all. They went to sit on a ledge and Shin told Marshill to drink his soup before it turned cold.</p>
<p>Marshill still tried to speak as politely as possible, so Shin requested that he speak normally.</p>
<p>“I am the leader of the warrior tribe protecting this sanctuary. But all I could do for everyone’s sake was to gather a meager amount of food.”</p>
<p>Having fighting skills, he could have become an adventurer and earned through that, but there was the chance that some among the dwellers may go on a rampage out of frustration and despair, so – thinking about such a possibility – he could not bring himself to leave the settlement.</p>
<p>Marshill had witnessed personally how ferocious the attacks of the three sea beasts were: he was also concerned that the barrier might break down.</p>
<p>“Little by little, day by day, everyone was growing thinner. But I couldn’t do anything to change the situation.”</p>
<p>As they were tasked with procuring food supplies, warriors received relatively complete meals: the portions to the children, the elderly and young people without anything to do, however, were unbearably small.</p>
<p>Some warriors shared their food with them too. If they did, however, they wouldn’t be able to muster their power when needed; many of them were killed by monsters this way.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t move to Barbatos now, not even if we wanted. Even if we knew we had no future, staying here is all we could do.”</p>
<p>Even when he stood against Shin, Marshill didn’t have enough strength to fight properly. The difficult situation is the reason why he looked so irritable.</p>
<p>“….Kids can laugh like that, huh.”</p>
<p>Marshill looked at the children running around near them, a mellower expression on his face.</p>
<p>His peaceful atmosphere now made him look like a completely different person compared to when Shin first met him.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what happens to me. But please, let my subordinates go. They just followed my orders.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t you dare do that here.”</p>
<p>Shin felt that Marshill was going to kneel to apologize and stopped him.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of doing anything anyway. We didn’t fight and no one was hurt on either side. You better apologize to Zazie and the others, though. You said that something belonging to their master was yours, after all. It’s not something they can just let go either.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Marshill nodded firmly to Shin’s words.</p>
<p>“Whoops, looks like the last pot is almost empty. I’ll go take it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help too if I can.”</p>
<p>Marshill went to Bell and Shell, while Shin headed to the kitchen.</p>
<p>He went back and forth three times.</p>
<p>After about 400 servings of soup were cleared, the cooking came to an end.</p>
<p>“We finished cleaning up, so can you tell us where the Seafloor Sanctuary is?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was told to be your guide. Please follow me.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group boarded their magic-powered vessel and, following Arno’s lead, went underwater.</p>
<p>Joining Shin in this expedition were the usual members: his support characters and Tiera. As there was the possibility of fighting in an unfamiliar underwater environment, Shin gave Tiera a ring that would absorb damage to a certain degree.</p>
<p>The Shigureya crew remained on Celciutos, in charge of checking whether all its functions were working properly. Shin didn’t think anything would happen so soon, but he told them to focus on the barrier first, just in case.</p>
<p>“The barrier extends underwater…no, up and down? So it’s less affected by outside sources, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin considered how Celciutos’ barrier had been erected as the ship proceeded underwater. Even inside the storm, the waves around Celciutos were calm. The underwater surroundings did not seem unusual either.</p>
<p>Learning that the Seafloor Sanctuary was directly below Celciutos, Shin pictured the barrier’s extension in his head.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 3 – Part 1</p>
<p>“Are we there yet?”</p>
<p>Tiera asked after about 30 minutes of continuous diving.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s deeper than expected.”</p>
<p>Shin also felt that they had already been descending for a long time, but not knowing how deep the sea was in that area, he could not give Tiera a clear answer.</p>
<p>The depth of their current position was 6000 mels.</p>
<p>Thanks to the enchantments attached to it and the unique materials it was made with, the hybrid magic-powered vessel could dive at high speed, but nothing resembling the “Seafloor Sanctuary” could be seen yet.</p>
<p>Arno still lead the way without any signs of indecision however, so they kept following behind her.</p>
<p>Thirty more minutes passed.</p>
<p>Finally, something began to shine in the distance. It was the building Shin’s group was looking for. There were no light sources visible, but its surroundings were strangely bright.</p>
<p>“So that’s the Seafloor Sanctuary. The official name is ‘Castle of the Depths’? Wait, ‘Seafloor Sanctuary’ is there too. They’re mixed together?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that ‘Seafloor Sanctuary’ was the building’s official name, but when he looked at it, another name was displayed. If he moved his gaze just a little, however, the “Seafloor Sanctuary” name also appeared.</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s why Ishkar is here.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The Ishkar I knew used to dwell in the royal chambers deep inside an underground dungeon masquerading as a castle. So when Arno said the word “Sanctuary”, I thought it had changed locations, but now I see how it is. The building probably moved when the crust did.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Tiera’s question with a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the group noticed the broken down remains of a building scattered around the Sanctuary. It had probably been destroyed by the natural disasters. The main building was the “Castle of the Depths”, with the “Seafloor Sanctuary” around it.</p>
<p>When Shin mentioned this to Arno, she was very surprised. Apparently she did not know about this bizarre occurrence.</p>
<p>“In that case, the interior of the dungeon could have changed too. Hopefully the path isn’t blocked.”</p>
<p>Schnee commented while looking at the Castle of the Depths. That possibility wasn’t far-fetched at all.</p>
<p>In the game area, such a phenomenon was impossible. In any dungeon there was a path leading to the boss. Now, however, even such an obvious reality could have changed.</p>
<p>“We can only go and check.”</p>
<p>Shin guided the ship until it was close to the Castle of the Depths, then anchored it to the seafloor. As the whole group had left the ship, their equipment changed to its underwater mode, and Shin turned the ship into a card.</p>
<p>Tiera, who did not have the 【Dive】 skill, equipped an earring with the same effects.</p>
<p>Arno was surprised to see the massive ship instantly turn into a card, but then nodded to herself. She now knew that Shin was a High Human, which was enough of an explanation.</p>
<p>“The entrance is over here”</p>
<p>Led by Arno, the group reached the Castle of the Depths’ gate. Even though it was called a castle, the exterior looked like a cardboard cutout. The dungeon itself extended underground, so it wasn’t possible to use shortcuts to the lower floors or similar tricks.</p>
<p>There were treasure chests and such in the above ground part of the castle, but the group had no time to go look for them, so Shin went straight towards the gate.</p>
<p>“This is as far as I can guide you.”</p>
<p>Arno stopped about 10 mels from the gate: a semi-transparent barrier had appeared before her. It apparently stopped all intruders with stats lower than a certain amount.</p>
<p>In the game era, the Castle of the Depths was a high difficulty dungeon, fitting as Ishkar’s abode, a boss monster of level 1000.</p>
<p>All monsters that appeared within it had high levels too, so players used it to train low level players: it was a so-called power leveling area.</p>
<p>The game’s management did not appreciate such a usage however, and entry into dungeons with a certain number of high-level monsters became restricted.</p>
<p>The restriction placed that time was apparently still active, even in this world. Shin tried to get closer and was able to pass through without problems. Schnee and the rest of the party followed him, until only Tiera remained outside the barrier.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>She extended a hand towards the barrier, a nervous look on her face. Just as she was about to touch it, Tiera’s hand passed through.</p>
<p>“Wheew…I was so nervous…”</p>
<p>There seemed to be a good chance that Tiera would be repelled, so she was really relieved to have been able to pass through the barrier.</p>
<p>(If she’s able to enter here, it means that her average stats are over 450. Even factoring in equipment bonuses, that’s not a number you can reach without resurrection bonuses…)</p>
<p>So thought Shin while looking at Tiera coming towards them.</p>
<p>Tiera was a Priestess of the World Tree, a special existence, but it was confirmed that she was not a Chosen One.</p>
<p>In the game, no matter what bonuses were granted by equipment, she couldn’t have entered in the Castle of the Depths or the Seafloor Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Just now, before Shin’s eyes, Tiera had overcome the barrier though.</p>
<p>In this world, players without resurrection bonuses could raise their base stats only by leveling up or using rare items.</p>
<p>Just like Schnee and the others, Tiera had received a stat bonus from the Ley Lines; as a denizen of this world, however, she was starting to become an impossible existence.</p>
<p>“….? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing.”</p>
<p>Thinking wouldn’t solve the problem. Tiera was a bit puzzled by Shin’s silence, but he waved at her not to mind and looked at Arno.</p>
<p>“Do be careful.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how long it would take, so he had Arno go back first. Being a mermaid, she could go back to Celciutos even without boarding a ship.</p>
<p>Shin’s group watched Arno go, then looked up at the Castle of the Depths’ gate.</p>
<p>The gate had three depressions, the same size as item cards.</p>
<p>“Just like how it was set up in the game, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Set up?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you need to offer the Three Sea Beasts’ materials to enter Ishkar’s Castle of the Depths.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Schnee’s question while taking items out of his Item Box.</p>
<p>A fragment of Mascurda’s pearls, Keseldran’s fang, and Eolios’ needle. To enter, they had to be turned into cards and placed in the gate’s depressions.</p>
<p>In this world they had just briefly met Keseldran, but the materials gathered in the game era were still in Shin’s item box.</p>
<p>Shin took the three cards and placed each in the depression where the corresponding Sea Beast was depicted.</p>
<p>The response was immediate as two of the three cards were rejected. Only Keseldran’s card stayed in place, glowing faintly.</p>
<p>“…whatever could this mean?”</p>
<p>“This happens when the wrong card is put in. The gate’s functions are still active I see.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Schnee’s confused question while touching the gate. There was no response, it didn’t look like it would open anytime soon.</p>
<p>Normally, the cards would stay in and the gate would open.</p>
<p>“The materials are the right ones, though. Why did only Keseldran’s stay in, anyway?”</p>
<p>In the game era too, item cards received by others would be rejected. The cards in Shin’s item box were originally from the game era, they could be seen as having been received from someone else.</p>
<p>“Keseldran was that snake monster with the pincers, right? Maybe we have to come in contact…or at least be seen by them?”</p>
<p>“Looks like that’s the only possibility.”</p>
<p>Shin could only agree with Tiera’s opinion.</p>
<p>“Kuu kuu”</p>
<p>Shin was thinking about the reason behind the rejection of the materials, when Yuzuha poked his forehead.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s up, Yuzuha?”</p>
<p>“When we met Kesel, its magic power went into you, Shin. That’s it, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Its magic power came into me?”</p>
<p>According to Yuzuha, when Keseldran attacked the barrier a small part of its magic power flowed into Shin. It was such a minimal amount that Shin didn’t realize it, but the magic power emanated from the cards was similar to that, apparently.</p>
<p>“Meaning, as long as we get close to them, we don’t need to fight.”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t sure if the same thing would happen with the other two Beasts too, but there was nothing else they could do.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start from Mascurda then.”</p>
<p>Since they just needed to get close to the monster, Shin decided to try from the one easier to escape from: among the Three Sea Beasts, Mascurda had the lowest movement speed.</p>
<p>Shin materialized the magic-powered vessel from the Item Box, deactivated underwater mode, and boarded it with the rest of the party. The direction they set for was north-west.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope we can find it quickly though.”</p>
<p>“Keseldran had come right next to Celciutos, I guess it had perceived our presence?”</p>
<p>Shin had also considered the possibility that Shibaid mentioned.</p>
<p>Despite being in the heart of Kuwain, Keseldran had attacked when the group had neared Celciutos’ barrier. They didn’t know if it came for Shin’s party or the merpeople, but the timing was too good.</p>
<p>Based on what they knew and what Arno had told them, Keseldran had roamed very far from its territory. It wouldn’t have made it in time if it didn’t start chasing Shin’s ship as soon as it entered the Kuwain area.</p>
<p>“If it will come to us, then it’s even better. First we’ll go somewhat closer, set a marker and go back. If getting closer is enough, then great. If not, we’ll think of something else.”</p>
<p>Among all magic skills, there was one that allowed someone to place a marker to know where a particular target was, for a limited period of time. If just getting closer wasn’t enough, Shin planned to use it to locate Mascurda.</p>
<p>Moving at high speed underwater was dangerous, so Shin brought the ship near the surface. If they emerged completely they would be subject to the stormy sea and tall waves, so he stopped the ship’s ascension to a depth that didn’t hinder the ship’s sailing.</p>
<p>After a while, a large number of jellyfish-type monsters appeared in front of Shin’s ship. Their levels ranged wildly from low to high and they floated really close to each other, leaving almost no space in between.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a detour.”</p>
<p>There was no need to force their way through the monsters. Jellyfish monsters rarely attacked first, so they would probably let the ship go as long as they weren’t attacked.</p>
<p>Shin had heard that the monsters had turned violent, but this type didn’t seem to be affected.</p>
<p>The group of jellyfish monsters floated at a depth where light just barely penetrated into the sea, so Shin decided to pass below them.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The ship was proceeding slowly, when Shin noticed a half transparent red marker on the map. It symbolized the presence of a monster that was using 【Hiding】.</p>
<p>The jellyfish swarm also slowly moved, as to block the ship’s path.</p>
<p>“It came out earlier than expected, huh.”</p>
<p>“So it looks like.”</p>
<p>Schnee had also perceived the monster’s presence and looked under the ship.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Filma realized it too.</p>
<p>“What’s coming?”</p>
<p>Tiera understood that a monster was approaching, but she couldn’t detect concealed enemies, apparently.</p>
<p>“There’s a concealed monster below us. If we go a bit lower, it’ll probably attack.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group was trying to go through what could be called the entrance to the sea depths, a place where light couldn’t reach.</p>
<p>Below that, without light sources or night vision skills, it was impossible to see anything.</p>
<p>The jellyfish monsters were just decoys. The ship would be attacked while it tried to dodge them, or so Shin thought the monster’s plan was.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we change course, then?”</p>
<p>“If we do that it might not attack though. We’ll dodge and escape.”</p>
<p>“Escape? Wait, you mean that the monster trying to ambush us is—”</p>
<p>“It’s coming! Grab hold of something, everyone!”</p>
<p>Before Tiera could finish her sentence, Shin sharply turned the control lever and stepped on the pedal. The ship’s course changed diagonally and accelerated.</p>
<p>“Bingo! I knew it!”</p>
<p>“Waah…”</p>
<p>Shin turned the ship around, shining its lights on the spot it had recently vacated. There they found six squid-like tentacles with suckers, squirming around in search for the ship.</p>
<p>Tiera backed away at such a sight, holding her own body with her arms and shaking. It was her first time seeing a squid’s tentacles that were this large: more than being surprised, she was hit by a wave of disgust.</p>
<p>“Those are Mascurda’s tentacles. If they grab you, you’ll be dragged straight into its mouth.”</p>
<p>The monster’s main body was somewhere deeper, so the group could only see its huge tentacles sprouting from the darkness. Because of this, it looked even more creepy.</p>
<p>“What will you do now?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it won’t work with just the tentacles, so I’ll get closer to the main body. Sorry guys, but the ship is going to shake some more!”</p>
<p>Realizing that it couldn’t catch anything by trying to grasp with those tentacles, Mascurda’s body emerged from the darkness.</p>
<p>Its main body, larger than Shin’s magic-powered vessel, was armed with shells and gems, fitting for one of the monsters called a Sea Beast. Large, sharp claws adorned the tips of its tentacles: in spite of its similarity to normal squids, its appearance clearly indicated the creature was a monster.</p>
<p>Additional tentacles it had not used before stretched out towards the ship, but Shin avoided them by moving the ship horizontally. The tentacles, missing their target, crashed into the jellyfish swarm, wrapping themselves around several of them.</p>
<p>“Shin…I don’t think I’ll be able to eat squid anymore…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, if you’re not used to it this can be a pretty shocking sight.”</p>
<p>Tiera and Shin were watching Mascurda as it feasted on the jellyfish monsters it had caught. The monster’s round mouth on the lower part of its body ripped apart the jellyfish and swallowed them.</p>
<p>Rows of saw-like teeth could be seen within the monster’s mouth. The fate of the jellyfish demonstrated clearly what would happen to anything that ended up in the monster’s maw.</p>
<p>“So those jellyfish weren’t Mascurda’s servants, then.”</p>
<p>“If we’re getting closer to the main body, I’ll put up a barrier.”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>The ship was enchanted with protective magic, but for added safety, Shibaid took out his</p>
<p>『Great Shell Shield of Collision』.</p>
<p>Shin directed the ship towards Mascurda’s body, keeping the monster in his field of vision.</p>
<p>“We might be attacked, so make sure you don’t lose your balance!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted while stepping harder on the pedal. The magic engine roared, attracting Mascurda’s attention, its eyes glaring at the ship.</p>
<p>“Well, now it found us for sure.”</p>
<p>”Underwater, detection via sound is the basic method. Of course it would.”</p>
<p>During Filma and Schnee’s exchange, Mascurda’s tentacles were already shooting for the ship. The ship accelerated away faster than they could reach, however.</p>
<p>“Shin!! Shin!!! We’re tilting!! The ship’s tilting!!”</p>
<p>The ship sped through the tentacles at a speed unthinkable for underwater travel. The ship, tilted at 90 degrees, barely managed to dodge the tentacles, so the surprised Tiera called Shin’s name.</p>
<p>“We’re going to go straight like this and pass next to Mascurda! It’s going to shoot magic at us, brace for impact!”</p>
<p>Just as Shin said, the two mels wide gemstone on Mascurda’s forehead started glowing. Also due to its status as an underwater monster, the magic it used was mainly water-based.</p>
<p>As the gemstone’s light grew stronger, the seawater in front of Mascurda’s eyes started whirling.</p>
<p>The newly formed whirlpool quickly became larger and larger, big enough to swallow Shin’s ship whole.</p>
<p>Water-type Magic skill 【Maelstrom】.</p>
<p>Using it underwater gave bonuses such as a boost in offensive power and a larger area of effect. With Mascurda as its caster, the resulting whirlpool reached a size that few players could create.</p>
<p>“Not so fast!”</p>
<p>In the ship, facing the whirlpool, Shin shouted and hit the control panel. He chose an armament and pulled the trigger without hesitation.</p>
<p>The side of the ship opened with a psssht-like sound and two torpedoes shot towards the whirlpool, leaving a trail of bubbles behind them.</p>
<p>The torpedoes shot straight into the heart of the whirlpool: once they reached it, the spell inside them was activated. After an explosion, a 【Maelstrom】 spinning in the opposite direction as Mascurda’s was generated, and the two whirlpools canceled each other.</p>
<p>“Now!!”</p>
<p>One instant before the whirlpools disappeared, Shin moved the ship forward.</p>
<p>Maybe because the clashing whirlpools obstructed its sight, Mascurda could not react quickly to the ship that forced its way through the two half vanished 【Maelstrom】.</p>
<p>Shin’s magic-powered vessel passed right next to Mascurda’s body. At that moment, Shin shot a marker, which simply acted as a beacon of magical power, so Mascurda did not even notice being hit with it.</p>
<p>After passing, the ship accelerated and sped away from the monster.</p>
<p>Mascurda tried to chase after it, but right then Shin’s parting gift was activated.</p>
<p>——!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>What had been released from the back of the ship was a load of barrels. Their objective was to create a smokescreen underwater: rather than actual smoke, they released an ink-like liquid all around. Touching the liquid also made it impossible to detect the player and inflicted negative statuses. It was the underwater version of the item used to escape after encountering monsters too different from one’s level.</p>
<p>Leaving behind Mascurda, who emitted shrill screams out of anger, or pain, Shin’s group returned to the Castle of the Depths.</p>
<p>There they again tried to place the item card of Mascurda’s parts in the matching depression of the gate. This time, the card started glowing properly.</p>
<p>“Good! Now we know that we don’t need to fight.”</p>
<p>It would be a problem to weaken one of the Sea Beasts, for one of the other two to ultimately defeat them. If they just had to go near them, it was much easier than fighting them. Yuzuha confirmed that, just like what had happened with Keseldran, Mascurda’s magic power had flowed into Shin.</p>
<p>“Our next destination is the southeast, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Eolios is the only one left, let’s make sure we can get this done today.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Schnee and returned to the ship.</p>
<p>The current time was a little past three in the afternoon. Considering how long it would take to come back, it would probably be dusk when they did.</p>
<p>If they started exploring the dungeon then, it could take until late at night to clear it.</p>
<p>The dungeon the group was going to enter was an unknown one, where they would find sources of miasma. It surely wasn’t a place to spend the night in.</p>
<p>In the depths of the sea, the presence or absence of sunlight did not make a difference, but because of the lack of sunlight it was easy to lose track of time and be active for long hours, thus impacting one’s own performance.</p>
<p>Knowing this, Shin had decided to take sufficient rest before facing the dungeon.</p>
<p>“What? We’re not going to leave right away?”</p>
<p>“I have to stock up on items first. Eolios is a fast swimmer too, so I wanted to pick up some items to take care of that.”</p>
<p>Eolios was the sea monster that boasted the highest swimming speed. It could even dodge the item the group had used against Mascurda.</p>
<p>Shin was changing the ship’s equipment, looking at a diagram of the vessel displayed on a screen. Next to him, Tiera looked impressed.</p>
<p>“Pictures and text floating in midair…it’s really strange, no matter how many times I see them. Besides, just moving them around changes things in reality too…”</p>
<p>The screen that Shin was manipulating was a function loaded onto the ship and visible to anyone, unlike each person’s status screen.</p>
<p>“Once you get used to it, it’s really convenient.”</p>
<p>After answering Tiera, Shin chose an item to equip on the bottom of the hull: as he did the image on the screen changed, now showing a sort of nozzle.</p>
<p>Shin went outside the ship to make sure that it had changed as the diagram had shown. Part of the changes had been executed on the bottom of the ship, so he had to change to underwater mode and dive to check.</p>
<p>“It’s really changed. I wonder how this works…”</p>
<p>Tiera was interested and joined Shin in the inspection: when they returned, she expressed her amazement while deactivating underwater mode. She had looked very closely at the changed parts, but couldn’t understand how it had happened.</p>
<p>“Magically, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t say that it was a game mechanic, so he decided to rely on the always convenient answer that magic did it.</p>
<p>“That’s the most convincing answer, I guess. That…magic-powered engine, was it? The magic flow when it activates is really something else too.”</p>
<p>What Yuzuha called magic flow was visible to Tiera too; like in this case, though, it was apparently possible to see the magic flow coming from items too.</p>
<p>“What do you see, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“I see a thin, sparkling purple light coming out of the engine and spreading throughout the ship. It’s really beautiful, so it’s a bit of a shame that I’m the only one that can see it.”</p>
<p>After completely spreading, the flow vanishes away. Hearing Tiera talk about it, Shin thought that he wanted to see it too, but there were no skills to make magic flow visible, so he gave up.</p>
<p>With their preparations done, Shin’s group departed again, this time for Eolios’ territory.</p>
<p>The area ruled by Eolios looked extremely different from Mascurda’s.</p>
<p>“This is bad!”</p>
<p>Shin cursed under his breath while carefully handling the ship’s controls.</p>
<p>Soon after entering Eolios’ territory, the ship was attacked by monsters. Their quantity and species also increased minute by minute.</p>
<p>“Why is it so different from the other areas here?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, this is incomprehensible.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid voiced their perplexion too, looking at the monsters that attacked them like an avalanche.</p>
<p>Shibaid erected a barrier to repel the attack of a swarm of mackerel pike-like monsters, while Shin made the ship spin to shake off a group of octopus-type monsters that had attached to it.</p>
<p>For a ship, the action was getting a bit too exciting.</p>
<p>“I might end up knocked-out even before we find the boss…”</p>
<p>The ship’s sudden accelerations, decelerations, and rotations were proving to be too much for Tiera, even though she had drunk the anti-seasickness medicine.</p>
<p>Just as Shin began to realize that they couldn’t go on like that, he noticed a response far larger than the surrounding monsters heading in their direction at extremely high speed.</p>
<p>The real identity of the response blasting towards the ship, bulldozing through the monsters, was, of course, Eolios.</p>
<p>A massive shark-like monster, with its head and part of its fins hardened as protection. Its whole body was also covered by one-mel long stake-like needles, which could diffuse magic and were also used as powerful weapons. Even if the monsters that could not dodge Eolios’ passing got stuck on them, the Sea Beast did not seem to notice or care.</p>
<p>During the game era, Eolios had pierced many players to death. For the surrounding monsters, being pierced meant instant death. Due to Eolios’ tremendous swimming speed, they would be cruelly ripped apart.</p>
<p>“Just as expected from the fastest among the Three Sea Beasts. That speed is on a whole other level.”</p>
<p>Shin got rid of the surrounding monsters with the ship’s anti-attacker magic and forcefully steered the vessel out of Eolios’ path.</p>
<p>Even if they had turned feral, the monsters could probably still realize danger to a degree. The ones surrounding the ship seemed to be shaken by Eolios’ arrival.</p>
<p>“It’d be easy if we could just pass by, like we did with Mascurda, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin said so to Schnee, but did not attempt this maneuver. Eolios’ mobility was at its apex when it attacked, but it could also change direction vertically or horizontally very easily.</p>
<p>Because of this, to avoid its charge they would need to gain a large distance very quickly. Just moving to the side would not suffice.</p>
<p>Even if, by chance, they managed to avoid the collision, Eolios could shoot its needles, thus piercing the ship just after it was thought to be safe.</p>
<p>With the ship’s protective plating and Shibaid’s barriers, the ship would probably be able to withstand one attack, but if it didn’t work they would be unable to recover, so Shin decided not to test it.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha! Is the magic here yet?”</p>
<p>“Not yet!”</p>
<p>The distance between the ship and Eolios was around 300 mels. In Mascurda’s case, they had passed less than 10 mels from the monster’s body, while with Keseldran the distance was about 100 mels: considering this, Eolios was still too far.</p>
<p>“How do you like this then!”</p>
<p>Shin moved the ship right in front of Eolios’ path and slowed down.</p>
<p>Maybe thinking that its prey had weakened, Eolios came closer slowly, its jaws wide open.</p>
<p>“My chest…hurts…”</p>
<p>From the bridge it wasn’t possible to see behind the ship. Tiera, however, had felt Eolios’ pressure and was holding her chest with a frown.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, please bear with it a little longer!”</p>
<p>—Distance to Eolios, 280 mels.</p>
<p>Shin looked at the map and measured the distance. The monster could accelerate suddenly, so his finger was ready on the emergency acceleration switch.</p>
<p>—220 mels.</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s signal wasn’t coming yet. She was gazing intently at something, towards the back of the ship.</p>
<p>—180 mels.</p>
<p>Shin felt something creeping up his shoulders. Probably the pressure that Eolios emanated.</p>
<p>—130 mels.</p>
<p>“It’s here!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s voice echoed through the bridge.</p>
<p>“Alright, we’re off!!”</p>
<p>As soon as he heard that the magic power had arrived, Shin activated the ship’s emergency acceleration. At the same time, he released an item to facilitate their escape from the stern – a different one than what he used against Mascurda.</p>
<p>—–!?!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>A few seconds after the release, an inhuman shriek could be heard from behind them.</p>
<p>What Shin had thrown to Eolios was a barrel filled to the brim with crystals, each one imbued with the Wind-type magic skill 【Shock Pulse】. The skill was used to release an extremely loud noise, to disperse pursuing monsters. What would happen if 10, 20, or more were activated underwater, where sound propagated at a faster rate?</p>
<p>“Seems like we managed to escape, somehow.”</p>
<p>Shin breathed a sigh of relief while looking at the responses disappearing outside the map’s detection range.</p>
<p>The crystals emitted a physical shockwave as well, so Eolios had more important things to deal with than chasing Shin’s group. Looking at the marker moving left and right, Shin guessed that it was probably fairly confused now.</p>
<p>Being a shark-based monster, it would have been a problem if it followed them via smell, so Shin had launched a barrel producing a foul smell too.</p>
<p>The monsters that had attacked the ship seemed even more confused than Eolios. Some were bumping into each other or wandered off randomly. The situation was utter chaos. Others, possibly having lost consciousness, did not move at all.</p>
<p>“Looks like the area of effect was pretty wide.”</p>
<p>“We even managed to surprise a boss monster, after all. Though, it must have been because it was activated underwater.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Schnee’s comment while operating the ship’s controls. Unlike before, when they had just arrived in the area, they managed to proceed without serious obstacles.</p>
<p>They were attacked again by monsters on their way back, but probably because of 【Shock Pulse】’s effects, the monsters were much less fierce than before, so the group could return to the Castle of the Depths relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 3 – Part 2</p>
<p>Shin’s party spent the night in the ship. After making the necessary preparations, they stood before the dungeon’s gate.</p>
<p>Shin placed the last remaining card in the gate’s depression and all the cards started glowing brightly. With creaking, scratching sounds, the gate to the Castle of the Depths finally opened.</p>
<p>“Shin…there’s the possibility that we might be too late.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, even I can tell. This time it’s really bad.”</p>
<p>Shin could only agree with what Tiera said after the gate opened.</p>
<p>The Castle of the Depths had been swallowed by terribly thick miasma.</p>
<p>“Just to be safe, let’s all use these.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking at the miasma oozing from beyond the gate. The situation was worse than expected, so he decided that it was too risky to just charge in without preparing proper countermeasures. He then handed some 『Miracle Drug of Holy Skies』, which they had used when exploring Fuji’s dungeon, to all the party members. To prepare for anything unexpected, he gave a stack of the item’s cards to everyone.</p>
<p>“Tiera, take this.”</p>
<p>“This is…er, goggles?”</p>
<p>Together with the item cards, Shin gave Tiera a pair of underwater goggles enchanted with bonus effects such as 【Night Sight】 and 【Far Sight】. The goggles were large, similar to the ones used when diving.</p>
<p>In dungeons where visibility was poor due to miasma, visual assistance skills -【Night Sight】 above all- were a necessity. Tiera had learned 【Far Sight】, but did not know 【Night Sight】yet.</p>
<p>“When I equipped them, the water inside the goggles disappeared…is this okay?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay…I guess?”</p>
<p>The goggles did not change form even if the wearer’s equipment turned to underwater mode.</p>
<p>If the goggles were equipped underwater, seawater would normally seep inside, but there was supposed to be no effect on the skills attached to them. For some reason, however, the water inside had disappeared. It could have been a difference between the game and reality.</p>
<p>“No use thinking about it, I guess. The goggles’ effects are still there, so I’ll make good use of them.”</p>
<p>Tiera knew that it wasn’t something they needed to talk about then and there, so she wrapped up the topic. Shin nodded and turned again towards the gate.</p>
<p>“First, I should make sure the miasma doesn’t spread any more than it has already…okay, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin stopped the miasma from spreading beyond the gate, then entered into the Castle of the Depths, with Schnee and the others in tow.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have expected the castle to be corrupted this much, though. Was the outer appearance just an illusion?”</p>
<p>“If I remember well, its appearance didn’t change even if players destroyed it. Maybe it’s to prevent seeing the interior of the dungeon from outside.”</p>
<p>While advancing through the water, Shin answered Schnee’s question, recalling his memories of the game era.</p>
<p>The Castle of the Depths’ castle part was just a facade, like a cardboard cutout placed in front of the actual dungeon. If one wanted to, it was possible to turn it into a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>Doing so would not have achieved anything, though, so most players did not bother to destroy it.</p>
<p>Shin was looking for the path leading underground, when he picked up several responses within his detection range.</p>
<p>“The castle is supposed to be deserted, but it turns out there’s something here.”</p>
<p>“With this much miasma around, that wouldn’t be strange.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Shibaid’s warning while drawing his sword, 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>“They’re ghost types! They’re going to come from the front, left, and right, through the walls!”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the map and noticed hostile markers moving towards them passing through rooms and corridors, so he notified the rest of the party.</p>
<p>A few seconds later ethereal, eerie monsters appeared in front of Shin’s group, from the ceiling and the walls on their right and left sides.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, Filma, the Skullfaces in front are yours. Schnee and I will take the Phantoms on the left and right. Tiera, deal with the Baby Hollow on the ceiling!”</p>
<p>Shin gave orders to the party, then activated the skill 【Pure Holy】 with Schnee.</p>
<p>The half-invisible human-like monsters who had passed through the walls, draped in capes that concealed their features, were High Phantoms: Ghost-type monsters with levels around 400.</p>
<p>Being capable of using magic of every element, they were rather nasty opponents.</p>
<p>Knowing that it was coming, however, Shin and Schnee could prepare to attack as soon as the Phantoms phased through the walls. The light they emitted from their palms caused the High Phantoms to simply vanish before they could do anything.</p>
<p>“I’m done here too.”</p>
<p>At about the same time of Shin and Schnee’s defeat of the High Phantoms, Tiera had dealt with the infant-shaped fireball monsters called Baby Hollow.</p>
<p>There were only a few of them, so they didn’t stand a chance against a shot from Tiera’s bow, armed with the arrows Shin had given her, which had both anti-miasma Light element and【Purification】 bonuses attached.</p>
<p>As the battlefield was now underwater, Tiera had changed her equipped bow to the 『Emerald Whirltide Bow』, a lower Legend-grade bow that increased in offensive power and accuracy underwater.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t think that she could use it, but Tiera proved to be able to handle it without penalties.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re about done too.”</p>
<p>Shin watched Shibaid and Filma sweeping through the Skullfaces. The corridor they were in was fairly wide, but still not enough for many Skullfaces to stand side by side. No matter how many there were, the only ones who could swing their weapons were the three, maybe four in front.</p>
<p>In terms of stats and equipment, there was no way they could match Shibaid and Filma. Even the King class Skullfaces were felled in a single blow. It was just a matter of time until the entire pack, composed of Skullfaces of various classes, was annihilated.</p>
<p>“They’ve got numbers, but their levels are nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Anyway, High Phantoms were a monster that appeared in the Seafloor Sanctuary, right?”</p>
<p>The Castle of the Depths was a den of high-level monsters. Thinking about the game’s standards, High Phantoms were too low-leveled to appear there.</p>
<p>“Meaning that the Seafloor Sanctuary monsters are dwelling in the castle too? That can be a bit of a pain.”</p>
<p>“Judging from the current situation, that appears to be the only explanation. Surely they couldn’t be the vengeful spirits of people who died at sea.”</p>
<p>Filma looked annoyed, her shoulders dropping, but Shibaid answered her seriously.</p>
<p>Defeating the monsters wouldn’t be difficult at all, but speed was of the essence this time, so having their progress slowed down wasn’t a good prospect.</p>
<p>Shin’s group decided to focus more on enemy detection and proceed while avoiding encounters as much as possible.</p>
<p>“If the structure is the same as before, the path leading to the dungeon should be in the throne room.”</p>
<p>The interior of the castle looked very similar to what Shin remembered. He decided to head for the throne room, as he had in the game. Located in the center of the castle, it would have taken about 15 minutes of walking to reach it.</p>
<p>The most ideal path would be to head straight towards it, destroying the walls blocking the way, but it would have, without a doubt, attracted monsters towards them, so they discarded the idea.</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Knowing that there were monsters around, the group proceeded in silence thanks to Shin and Schnee’s 【Silent Domain】. Unlike sound on land, at sea, even the smallest whisper could attract a monster’s attention.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it…really cold?”</p>
<p>The throne room was still a few minutes away when Tiera mumbled to herself. Even in underwater mode the effects of the original equipment were still active, so there were environmental changes that only she could notice.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel anything in particular, how about everyone else?”</p>
<p>Filma, Shibaid, and Schnee answered Shin’s question in the same way, they had not picked up anything either.</p>
<p>Yuzuha and Kagerou had different opinions, however.</p>
<p>“My tail feels chilly!”</p>
<p>“Guru!!”</p>
<p>Kagerou growled in agreement to Yuzuha’s words.</p>
<p>“There’s something up ahead.”</p>
<p>“Considering who detected this, I have a bad feeling about what awaits..”</p>
<p>A cold chill that could not be detected by any usual means. The cause was apparently in the throne room.</p>
<p>“It’s not just miasma. It’s probably also dragging the souls of the people who died at sea here. There are so many too…”</p>
<p>Tiera, blessed with spiritual detection abilities, spoke while trembling, her face pale.</p>
<p>“Are you alright? If it’s too tough, we can deal with whatever’s inside ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be able to join in the fighting if I do, but there is something I’d like to try. Yuzuha, could you help me?”</p>
<p>“Kuu?”</p>
<p>Tiera restrained her body from shaking and looked at Shin. Her eyes shone with the light of a very strong resolve.</p>
<p>“…got it. Yuzuha, take care of Tiera.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha cried as to say “leave it to me!” and paddled to Tiera’s shoulder. Being underwater, it felt like she did not weigh anything at all. At Tiera’s feet, Kagerou stood proud, as if saying “I’m by your side too!”.</p>
<p>“Good, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin proceeded forward, ever focused on detecting any threats. Walls and such were meaningless to Ghost-type monsters, so whenever they came close, Shin and Schnee blew them away with magic.</p>
<p>“This must be it.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group quickly reached the throne room, successfully avoiding as many encounters as possible.</p>
<p>Beyond the door Shin detected three presences, all larger than the monsters wandering the castle corridors.</p>
<p>“Looks like there are bosses stationed here.”</p>
<p>“Originally there wasn’t supposed to be anything here, so…I suppose they are monsters from Seafloor Sanctuary?”</p>
<p>“I wonder…that place mainly had fish-type monsters, after all. I think the situation now is different.”</p>
<p>The monsters appearing in Seafloor Sanctuary were mainly based on sea creatures, such as fish or crustaceans. Based on the fact that Undead-type monsters like Skullfaces and Phantoms now prowled in the castle, Shin doubted that marine monsters would appear as bosses.</p>
<p>“We can only be alert and proceed.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Shibaid. Passing through the throne room was the only way to go underground, so they could not avoid this boss confrontation.</p>
<p>Even though they resolved themselves to confront the bosses, they still wondered whether the dungeon entrance was still in the throne room. However, there was no way to clear their doubt at this moment.</p>
<p>“Are you ready, everyone? I’m opening the door.”</p>
<p>Shin had Schnee and the rest of the group take one step back, then pushed the door open. The doors did not offer much resistance and slowly opened.</p>
<p>The very instant the inside of the room became visible, a black spurt of miasma shot through the opening of the doors directly towards Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“!!”</p>
<p>The miasma had been shot violently, with an explosive power similar to backdraft. The level of danger was much higher than that of the miasma that had been oozing from the castle.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw it, Shin put up a miasma barrier and stepped back. Stopped by the barrier, the miasma’s momentum grew temporarily weaker. Tainted, the barrier vanished quickly, but it was enough to gain some distance.</p>
<p>Shin’s group was at peak alertness when they opened the door, so their response had been immediate.</p>
<p>The new miasma barrier put up by Shibaid opened a gap between Shin’s group and the miasma.</p>
<p>“【Purification】!!”</p>
<p>Shin then unleashed his skill towards the miasma that was swallowing Shibaid’s barrier.</p>
<p>Struck by the light emitted by Shin’s palms, the erupting miasma vanished like smoke.</p>
<p>“Well well. That was quite the welcome.”</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose we can expect courtesy from a host made of miasma.”</p>
<p>Exchanging banter with Shibaid, Shin enlarged the range of 【Purification】. Ignoring his decreasing MP, he got rid of all miasma in the throne room at once.</p>
<p>The room had originally appeared dimly lit even through 【Night Vision】, because of the miasma, but now 【Purification】’s light showed its original appearance.</p>
<p>If intruders entered it, the throne room became lit with flames that did not go out even underwater, ensuring visibility.</p>
<p>“So that’s the source of the response. The miasma wave was just the beginning, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group had torn apart the veil of miasma and could clearly see what the room looked like. What appeared before them were giant skeletons, made of countless small and large bones. The massive creatures were covered by a pale blue skin-like substance.</p>
<p>The skeletons’ insides were faintly visible, making the eye cavities of the many skulls embedded in them stand out even more: it was as if countless holes had been opened on the creatures’ bodies.</p>
<p>The appearance of the bosses was enough to inspire disgust to whoever laid eyes on them.</p>
<p>In addition, the robe that shrouded the skeletons was a problem as well. At first glance it looked like a dirty blue robe, but looking at it closely, one would realize that the robes were made of transparent human-like figures.</p>
<p>The “robe” had actually been made by stitching together the souls of the dead: even such a wild theory sounded plausible.</p>
<p>The faces of those souls, that Shin could see, were wailing and filled with desperation, or overtaken by other negative emotions.</p>
<p>——- Try%op&amp;ob$a – Le#el 8?9</p>
<p>“【Analyze】 isn’t working right?”</p>
<p>“Based on its looks and the readable part, I’d say it’s Trypophobia. This size and ominous aura though…they turned way too violent, seriously.”</p>
<p>Schnee became alert because of the bizarre way the monster’s name and level were displayed, then Shin replied while putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>The Trypophobia that Shin knew was a monster about three mels tall with strong magic resistance. Its physical defense was not high, so as long the player could get within striking distance, it wasn’t a fearsome opponent. The only thing to pay attention to was its sweeping attack, performed by its four clawed arms.</p>
<p>The Trypophobias now standing before Shin’s party, however, had six arms and bluish flames resembling will-o’-wisps burning on the ends of each of their claws.</p>
<p>Fighting them while assuming that they were the same as the game era’s Trypophobia would definitely give birth to painful regret.</p>
<p>In their originally hollow eye cavities now burned golden flames.</p>
<p>—-■■■■■■■■■■■■■■――!!(T/N: Black squares, unintelligible roar)</p>
<p>As if synchronized with the rekindled flames, the twisted, inhuman roar rising from the Trypophobias’ mouths echoed through the throne room. It was 【Deadman’s Howl】, a skill used by many advanced Undead-type monsters.</p>
<p>The monsters’ screams were incomprehensible gibberish. They were supposed to inflict negative statuses to whoever heard it, but to Shin’s party it sounded like a desperate request for help.</p>
<p>Help us, end our suffering…the wails of the souls, shackled even beyond death, caressed the ears of Shin’s party and vanished behind them.</p>
<p>The 【Deadman’s Howl】 had the power of three monsters behind it, but even so it failed to affect Shin’s party with any negative status.</p>
<p>Tiera however, because of her spiritual detection abilities, grimaced. Thanks to the equipment Shin had given her, she avoided any negative statuses, but her mental burden grew heavier.</p>
<p>The party was still a fair distance from the Trypophobias.</p>
<p>No matter how they fought, she knew she had to bear with it a little longer, but as to dispel such concerns on Shin’s part, Tiera shook her head lightly, breathed deeply and looked straight ahead.</p>
<p>“Can you make it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this isn’t enough to take me down. Besides, I want to free those people.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while looking at the Trypophobias. In her expression, the fear of facing a powerful monster was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>“Should we just weaken them and not defeat them yet?”</p>
<p>“No, take them down without holding anything back. It probably doesn’t matter how many times we defeat them, if we don’t do something about the trapped souls first though.”</p>
<p>Tiera said that the monsters would probably revive even if they were defeated.</p>
<p>“Okay, then leave the normal fighting to us. Yuzuha, Kagerou, I leave Tiera with you.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>“Gurua!!”</p>
<p>Their cries behind him, Shin and the party wielded their weapons. Only Tiera clasped her hands on her chest, as if praying.</p>
<p>“Looks like they noticed that their skill had no effect.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the Trypophobias, which had raised their arms high. They had some time to talk because the monsters hadn’t been moving.</p>
<p>The Trypophobias did not seem to have any particular intelligence, but being high-level monsters, they could probably at least realize if the skills they used were effective or not.</p>
<p>Seeing that Shin’s party was not affected, they probably decided to go with physical attacks next.</p>
<p>“I shall take the first attack.”</p>
<p>At the same time as the Trypophobias started moving, Shibaid leapt. Despite the water resistance, he charged in even faster than usual with his shield at the ready.</p>
<p>Because of how its body was structured, Trypophobia could not move by itself. Because of this, it possessed skills to force enemies to come towards itself. Shibaid was moving faster than usual because of the effects of the skill that one of the Trypophobia used to lure him closer, 【Darkness Beckons】.</p>
<p>The Trypophobia raised its flaming arms, ready to strike the approaching Shibaid. The monster swung down when Shibaid was within range, its arms drawing a bluish arc in midair before clashing with Shibaid’s shield. A loud sound of clashing metal resounded, then Shibaid stopped moving.</p>
<p>The boss had swung its three right arms. Shibaid couldn’t stop them with only his shield, so he also erected a defensive barrier, ultimately blocking 15 claws.</p>
<p>As a testimony to the monster’s offensive power, Shibaid’s greaves dug into the floor, cracking the stone tiles.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be fire, but I feel no heat. Is this cold air?”</p>
<p>What Shibaid felt through the barrier was not searing heat, but freezing cold air.</p>
<p>The flames probably looked like fire because of the way the seawater continually froze and shattered. It was likely due to an effect of the monster’s magic or an unique skill it possessed.</p>
<p>“If it really is cold air, then have a taste of this!”</p>
<p>Filma cut down another one of the Trypophobias. Flames blazed from her 『Red Moon』: the instant they touched the monster’s swinging claws, they shattered them from the wrists down, with the sound of breaking glass.</p>
<p>“It’s weak to fire, no doubt about it!”</p>
<p>Filma twisted her body while shouting, then shattered the monster’s other arm.</p>
<p>At the same time, Schnee stepped to the side of the last remaining Trypophobia. After moving behind the monster, she spun around, ready to counterattack. The monster, however, had just received a blow that had cut into half of its body, so its arms could not reach Schnee.</p>
<p>“Shibaid!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>It was like they were communicating telepathically. Without the need for more precise orders, Shibaid activated the Shield-type Martial skill 【Knock Move】 and shook off Trypophobia’s right arm. This skill allowed the user to erect a barrier with the same defensive power as the shield they had equipped and use it as a decoy as they retreated, often fast enough to leave behind after-images. It was usually used by the party’s shield to gain distance from the enemies or when they needed an emergency exit.</p>

<p>Taking the place of the retreating Shibaid, Schnee released a magic spell.</p>
<p>Ten cemels long rays of light extended to each of the monster’s arms: three seconds later, fire erupted from the arms and exploded.</p>
<p>Fire-type Magic skill 【Materia Bomber】.</p>
<p>This skill, quite unusual among all Flame-type spells, instantly changed the targeted body part to a bomb. Only non-living matter could be turned into an explosive however.</p>
<p>“For a monster over level 800, it’s a bit too frail…”</p>
<p>The monster’s arms were powerful enough to force Shibaid’s greaves to carve the ground, but after finding its weak point it was going down too easily, so Schnee was growing suspicious.</p>
<p>Before the wary Schnee, Shin gripped his 『Moonless』 at his waist, preparing to strike.</p>
<p>The now armless Trypophobia roared again, probably to attempt a last resort attack. That very instant, as if triggered by the roar, tentacles made of bones extended from the bones supporting the monster’s upper body and the foundation-like base part of the monster, mixed with the souls. At the same time, the blue flames burning on the monster’s claws appeared in midair.</p>
<p>“Time for the trump card, is it?”</p>
<p>Attacks never seen in the game era were coming up one after another. Even so, Shin did not falter.</p>
<p>From a videogame perspective, it was completely normal for bosses to perform unexpected attacks. That was far from enough to stop Shin’s attacks though.</p>
<p>The tentacles, as fast and sharp as arrows, were parried by Shibaid, while the flames were swept away by Filma and Schnee.</p>
<p>All three then jumped out of the attack range, at the same timing.</p>
<p>“Shah!!”</p>
<p>In the space they previously occupied Shin unleashed his attack.</p>
<p>Tentacles and flames had appeared again, but could not offer meaningful resistance as they were torn apart. Trypophobia tried to use its arms and claws as a shield at first, to little or no effect: along with the monster’s torso, they were cleaved in two.</p>
<p>The following sharp slash severed the skull, formed by countless bones, in two clean halves.</p>
<p>Katana and Divine Combination Skill 【Scourge Divide】.</p>
<p>A slash that caused additional damage to Undead types and miasma, this skill could not be resisted by Trypophobia.</p>
<p>It was not the end of Shin’s party’s offensive, though: Schnee, Filma, and Shibaid each followed up by attacking with their own weapons.</p>
<p>Schnee’s 『Blue Moon』, Filma’s 『Red Moon』, and Shibaid’s 『Placid Moon』 struck the skeleton’s skull and torso, already cut in horizontal halves, and cut it vertically this time.</p>
<p>Several seconds after Shin’s attack, the Trypophobia — to be precise, the four parts it had been severed into — slowly collapsed.</p>
<p>The golden flames in its eye cavities flickered out and the masses of bones forming it came apart. It was almost like the Trypophobias had turned into sand.</p>
<p>“Tiera, how’s the situation?”</p>
<p>“The binding is coming loose. I’m going to start now, but just in case, please defend me.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s hands, held over her chest in prayer until then, were now released and she spread her arms wide. Her lips then moved and started intoning a melody.</p>
<p>It was a requiem, meant to free the trapped souls and send them to a place where light shines.</p>
<p>It was a song with no words, a melody formed only by sounds higher and lower, stronger and weaker.</p>
<p>Tiera’s chant resounded through the miasma-tainted waters.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>Changes started manifesting seconds after Tiera had started singing. A bright, pure light started to fill the throne room. It was brighter and warmer than the automatic fires that had lit up the room until then.</p>
<p>Shin’s party swallowed their breath at the scenery. It was almost like Tiera herself was shining and illuminating the room.</p>
<p>“Kuu”</p>
<p>“Guru…”</p>
<p>The two beasts next to Tiera also cried in unison with her singing.</p>
<p>Yuzuha spread her tails in a fan-like shape, Kagerou’s horn lit up intermittently. Both of them also emitted a pale light from their bodies.</p>
<p>There was someone else, however, who could not simply stay quiet while they watched.</p>
<p>“—this is no time to be noisy.”</p>
<p>Shin turned around and saw the defeated Trypophobia start reforming, much like video footage played backwards. The bones were forming a skull, which the robe of the wailing ones covered. Only one of the three Trypophobias had started reforming.</p>
<p>If it was left alone like this, the monster would have completely reformed after only 10 seconds or so. Shin wouldn’t just watch and not do anything.</p>
<p>“【Ignition Red】!”</p>
<p>Shin pointed at the Trypophobia, and the gradually recovering body suddenly burst into flames.</p>
<p>The Trypophobia had been burned up by a magic skill of the Ignition series, which struck the area the player pointed in with the element of the player’s choosing.</p>
<p>Red meant flame magic, Blue water magic, etcetera. The name changed according to the element.</p>
<p>Underwater, fire — the element Undead types were weak to — was not as effective, but with Shin’s stats, it was possible to keep the same amount of firepower as if the skill was used above ground.</p>
<p>The recovering skull turned into ashes, the arms it was trying to raise scorched and fell.</p>
<p>The flames did not lose momentum and spread to the foundation of bones supporting Trypophobia, then the mass of souls.</p>
<p>The monster’s alleged source of energy was being burnt by Shin’s flames. What remained was just a small mound of ashes.</p>
<p>Every time it was annihilated, Trypophobia’s bones started to form again from nothingness. No matter how high its recovery power was, if it was defeated before reforming, it was all meaningless.</p>
<p>Shin was forced to shoot 【Ignition Red】 over and over again, but his automatic MP recovery ratio exceeded the quantity he used for the spell, so there was no risk of running out.</p>
<p>After several instances of burning bones down, Shin noticed that the monster’s recovery speed was slowing down.</p>
<p>“It’s started acting differently.”</p>
<p>The quantity of rising bones was decreasing and the spiritual veil covering them was getting thinner, as Schnee noticed too.</p>
<p>“Yes, besides, something’s leaking out of its body.”</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, a small light was leaking out and disappearing like steam from Trypophobia’s body and the foundation part.</p>
<p>Thanks to Tiera’s power, two-thirds of the throne room were now illuminated. Maybe because of the light’s effects, the monster’s recovery had considerably slowed down.</p>
<p>—–■■■■■■■■■■■■■■――!!</p>
<p>Maybe it had understood that it was going to disappear, as Trypophobia opened its maw as much as it could, as if screaming, bending its forming body backwards.</p>
<p>Only the left half of the skull had formed, but the golden light in its eye cavity burned fiercely.</p>
<p>Tiera was purifying the miasma, while Shin was shooting 【Ignition Red】 spells. The other party members were currently free and would not just stand by and watch.</p>
<p>Shibaid stood in front of Tiera and reinforced his guard. Schnee and Filma rushed towards Trypophobia.</p>
<p>Using the Movement-type Martial skill 【Waterbolt】, the two could move underwater with extreme speed, barely feeling the water resistance, and arrived close to the monster in no time.</p>
<p>“It’s too late to get desperate.”</p>
<p>“Give up already!”</p>
<p>Schnee’s left hand softly held the hilt of her 『Blue Moon』, its blade now wrapped in what looked like a platinum snowstorm, while Filma held her 『Red Moon』, burning brightly in golden flames, over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Take this.”</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma spoke at the same time.</p>
<p>As they did, Trypophobia’s body was cut apart by countless slashes, colored platinum and gold. A small snowstorm that could freeze even miasma and searing flames to burn it to cinders. These two opposites became one within Trypophobia.</p>
<p>Tetra-type composite skill, 【Divine Flame – Royal Frost Blade】.</p>
<p>This unique skill was activated by using Katana/Water and Flame/Sword combination skills at the same time. It was often used as finisher when battling bosses or powerful monsters.</p>
<p>Trypophobia, slashed again in four parts by the attack, fell to the ground, immobile. It was like time had stopped for the monster.</p>
<p>It was difficult to notice because of Trypophobia’s originally white color, but its whole body was now frozen. A few seconds after it touched the ground, golden flames erupted from its body. Divine flames with miasma purification properties enveloped the frozen Trypophobia.</p>
<p>Different from 【Ignitior Red】, which only burned its target, 【Divine Flame – Royal Frost Blade】’s flames did not leave even a speck of ash.</p>
<p>When the fire had vanished, leaving nothing in its wake, Tiera’s chant became louder.</p>
<p>In response, light started appearing from the spots where the Trypophobias were. They were larger than the ones that had leaked from the monsters’ bodies during the fighting.</p>
<p>The globes of light were initially very few, but quickly increased in quantity. They formed a sort of river of light in the air, which started flowing upwards, towards the surface of the water.</p>
<p>“Hah…now…it should be…okay…”</p>
<p>“Those were the freed souls?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There’s no one left here anymore.”</p>
<p>Shin waited for Tiera to recover her breath, looking at the lights floating away.</p>
<p>The lights passed through the ceiling of the Castle of the Depths and were not visible anymore.</p>
<p>“So that is…how souls shine?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. But their true glow is much stronger.”</p>
<p>Tiera said that after being imprisoned for so long, they had probably grown weaker.</p>
<p>The brilliance of the ancestors’ souls, which Tiera had felt during her service as Priestess of the World Tree, was much warmer and brighter than what Shin’s party had just witnessed.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’ve taken care of the bosses and all, but is the entrance to the dungeon still there?”</p>
<p>While they waited for Tiera to recover, Shin inspected the location that the Trypophobias were guarding.</p>
<p>【Analyze】 had displayed the monsters’ names in an unusual way, so he thought that there might be something left.</p>
<p>“Is that a gem?”</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was a gem the same size as the one of the non-standard monster he had fought in Bayreuth, the Skullface Lord.</p>
<p>The gem’s color, a very deep blue, showed that it belonged to the water element. Even after appraising it, he could only learn that it belonged to the highest Unique grade, and nothing else.</p>
<p>“Did you learn anything?”</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t seem to be unusual in any way. This gem too, as material it’s something that I’ve seen before.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t find any drops besides the gem where the Trypophobias were. Different from the game era, they did not drop any weapons or materials. Just in case, he inspected the floor too, but could not find anything of note.</p>
<p>Shin decided to inspect the throne with Schnee. If it was still as he remembered, the entrance to the dungeon should have been there.</p>
<p>“There should be a switch behind the throne….here it is.”</p>
<p>Shin found a small gap in a part of the throne. He checked if there were any traps, then pushed the gap deeper inside.</p>
<p>With the sound of stones grinding against each other, the throne and a part of the floor began moving to the side, revealing stairs going downwards. The passage was so narrow that Shibaid could barely fit in it.</p>
<p>“We found the path leading underground. Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t use that much energy anyway, I’m okay.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s HP and MP had both completely recovered. Her complexion wasn’t bad either, so Shin concluded that she wasn’t faking it.</p>
<p>“OK then, let’s go.”</p>
<p>The party finally set foot in the Castle of the Depths’ dungeon.</p>
<p>Schnee led the formation, followed by Shibaid, Filma, Tiera, and Shin. Yuzuha and Kagerou walked alongside Tiera.</p>
<p>After 5 minutes of descending the narrow stairs, the group arrived in what resembled a natural cave. The width of the corridor increased enough to make it possible for 3 members to fight side by side.</p>
<p>“Without 【Night Vision】, we wouldn’t be able to see even one mel ahead here.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while looking at the corridor. She had removed her goggles to see how much would be normally visible.</p>
<p>The miasma underground was thicker than above. To be safe, the group took another dose of the miracle drug.</p>
<p>“There are less monsters than expected, but is that normal when the miasma infection progresses?”</p>
<p>Filma wondered out loud after the group had repelled several monster attacks.</p>
<p>“Dungeon monsters can’t exactly reproduce, after all. Either new ones aren’t born, or they turned into Chimeras, I guess?”</p>
<p>Shin answered while searching the surroundings for any presence. It was just a theory, as there was the possibility for the monsters to be gathered in the lower floors, but Shin felt that it wasn’t too different from normal dungeons.</p>
<p>“In any case, let’s not lower our guards.”</p>
<p>Shibaid spoke as he raised his shield and halberd to repel monsters that had charged towards the group.</p>
<p>The path had reached a crossroads and the monsters had attempted a pincer attack on the party.</p>
<p>The monsters that Shibaid knocked away were mackerel pike-like monsters with heads morphed into iron lumps, called Magnum Fish. Its level ranged from 600 to 650 and its greatest characteristic was its high speed. Many players had experienced receiving large damage by their charge attacks the first time they fought this monster.</p>
<p>Magnum Fish had low defenses on all body parts other than their heads, so if the first strike was dodged or blocked, they became easy to neutralize. If the charge attack struck, however, rear guard Jobs with low defenses, such as Mages or Hunters, risked being knocked out in one blow.</p>
<p>“I-I didn’t even see them…”</p>
<p>“That’s what they call a trap for first timers.”</p>
<p>Shin had also been hit and sent spinning in mid-water his first time.</p>
<p>“With the skill 【Insight】, you can get a hunch that it’s coming though.”</p>
<p>“I barely have any skills that reinforce the senses…”</p>
<p>Tiera had learned several skills, but they still counted up to less than a dozen. In order to avoid Magnum Fish attacks, she would have to somehow guess their trajectory or take cover in a place with many objects to use as protection. If such methods didn’t work, she could only rely on her intuition.</p>
<p>“Do not fret. As long as we stand, no monster will ever touch you.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, you know you’re in good hands with us around.”</p>
<p>In a narrow corridor like the one the group was exploring, attacks could only come from determined directions. Shibaid and Filma, the front guard, would not let anything pass them in such a situation.</p>
<p>“I will take the lead then.”</p>
<p>Schnee, using her trap detection skills, examined the surroundings as she led the party forward.</p>
<p>They were still in the upper floors, but Castle of the Depths was still a high-level dungeon. Because it was located underwater as well, the group had to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between dungeons above ground and underwater ones was the type of traps present.</p>
<p>The whole passageway was filled with water, so it was difficult to dodge if the ceiling opened, sucking the players in, or poisonous liquids were scattered all around. Sometimes it was also necessary to use the traps to go forward, so underwater dungeons had generally higher levels of difficulty than their above ground counterparts.</p>
<p>“No problem, it seems. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin talked to Schnee via Mind Chat. On the way, they found a trap that would freeze the water in the passageway for a set time, and Tiera groaned “How are you supposed to dodge that…?”</p>
<p>Any attacking monsters were crushed by Shibaid and Filma, as they had said they would. Usually Shibaid would attract the monsters’ attention, luring them in one location, where Filma would cut them down all together.</p>
<p>『Red Moon』’s flames did not lose any power even underwater, thanks to 【Enchant – Mana Fire】.</p>
<p>What appeared to be roaring flames actually functioned just as a visual scare. They became effective only when they hit the opponent, slashing and scorching them.</p>
<p>Its effectiveness did not disappear after a set time, but after a certain number of uses, a condition perfect for Filma, who could K.O. any monster in a single stroke.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s a dead end ahead.”</p>
<p>Schnee had returned from her inspection and mapping, shaking her head.</p>
<p>Most high level or high profile dungeons had already been considerably mapped in the game era, but here, Castle of the Depths’ map was -as expected- completely blank.</p>
<p>Because of that, the group was forced to re-do the mapping all over again.</p>
<p>The Castle of the Depths was a wide dungeon, so even 【Magic Sonar】 could only scan half of one floor.</p>
<p>When the path split, Shin and Schnee parted ways to explore both ways but, even then, it took time.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’ll be impossible to clear this in one sitting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…well, normally it takes a few days to map a dungeon, so doing it as quickly as we did in Hinomoto is actually unusual.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered how tough things were in the game era and reassured Filma, mentioning that things had gone almost too smoothly until now.</p>
<p>In the last dungeons cleared by the party, Depths of Hellfire and Cadaver Realm, they had achieved their goals in one day, but those dungeons usually required several days to clear them.</p>
<p>“Should we set up a proper camp somewhere? In a place like this, I wouldn’t want to just sleep in a tent, honestly.”</p>
<p>“I understand all too well not wanting to rest in a place filled with miasma like this. If we could teleport and leave it’d be very different, but…”</p>
<p>Shin had attempted before, but both mid-level teleport crystals used to escape dungeons and high-level ones used to leave from special areas, such as event fields, did not work at all.</p>
<p>Shin had always tried in dungeons tainted by miasma, but was not sure if miasma was the reason or there was something else.</p>
<p>“Guess it wouldn’t hurt to try. Gather here, everybody.”</p>
<p>Teleport crystals transported all players and monsters in a five mels radius from the user. In order to prevent the player from fleeing via teleport when they were in a pinch, monsters were transported too.</p>
<p>Even if a player was registered in the party but was outside the range when the teleport crystal was used, they would be left behind.</p>
<p>Shin made sure that everyone was within range and activated the teleport. The destination was the entrance to the Castle of the Depths, before the gate where he had placed the Three Sea Beasts’ cards.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 3 – Part 3</p>
<p>“….It worked.”</p>
<p>“So it seems.”</p>
<p>An instant later after activating the teleport magic sealed within the crystals, Schnee and Shin looked around and commented, a bit dumbfounded.</p>
<p>They both thought that it wouldn’t work. However, contrary to their expectations, the entrance gate of the castle now stood before them. They also checked the map, but there was no mistake.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Teleporting never worked before, right?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s related to the fact that the dungeons are mixed together?”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid wondered why teleporting worked in this instance. They had too little information to reach a conclusion though.</p>
<p>“What do we do now? Even if we reenter, I don’t think we can get much farther. It should be getting pretty late too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t know why we were able to teleport, but just knowing that we can is an accomplishment in itself. We have the map, so we can reach our previous location with the shortest route possible. Let’s call it a day.”</p>
<p>Tiera had also performed the great feat of freeing the imprisoned souls, so it was preferable not to push her too much harder today.</p>
<p>Shin materialized the magic-powered vessel from the item box and the whole party boarded it.</p>
<p>They deactivated the equipment’s underwater mode and decided to eat.</p>
<p>The ship wasn’t originally equipped with a kitchen, so Shin changed part of the structure and added a kitchen. He also created rooms for all members and a bath.</p>
<p>“This dungeon feels somewhat different than the ones we faced until now.”</p>
<p>Schnee wondered aloud while watching the bubbling pots in the newly created kitchen.</p>
<p>Tiera and Filma had gone to the bath with Yuzuha and Kagerou. Shibaid had left the kitchen, saying he was going to take a look at his room.</p>
<p>Without anything else to do, Shin was just looking at Schnee cook. Her words intrigued him.</p>
<p>“Different how?”</p>
<p>“I feel…uneasy. I can’t express it in words…I don’t know what else I could say about it.”</p>
<p>Schnee put a hand on her chest, a somber look on her face.</p>
<p>“It feels similar to…that time.”</p>
<p>“That time? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Schnee turned around and looked at him with a sad smile.</p>
<p>“Like when…I thought that you might not come back anymore. It feels similar to the time when I thought about that.”</p>
<p>“I…?”</p>
<p>Before Shin could ask anything else, Schnee came closer to him. She took his hand in hers and put it against her cheek.</p>

<p>“…this helps me calm down.”</p>
<p>With silver hair, red eyes, and pale, evanescent skin, Schnee’s appearance suggested a certain coldness, but the hand on her cheek was surely warm.</p>
<p>“Schnee…”</p>
<p>“While I was waiting for you, I thought that you might not come back anymore…so many times. The thought that time will just go on like this, that I…that my feelings too will just die one day. On such days, I sometimes couldn’t sleep until dawn.”</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how to reply. Schnee’s words, in a way, had become reality.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>After a brief silence, Schnee talked again.</p>
<p>“Now that we’ve talked like this, I feel certain. That time, I felt like I was missing something…in the Castle of the Depths, I felt something similar.”</p>
<p>“Is that…so.”</p>
<p>A feeling of loss.</p>
<p>A feeling of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Probably something like that.</p>
<p>Why would Schnee feel something like that in the Castle of the Depths though?</p>
<p>“I…did?”</p>
<p>Shin could be somehow connected to what Schnee felt.</p>
<p>“But I have no idea what it could be…?”</p>
<p>“I do not know either. Yet…”</p>
<p>Schnee was probably thinking of something: she started talking, but stopped.</p>
<p>“Yet…what?”</p>
<p>“It’s just a possibility, but…in the Castle of the Depths, there might be something………………….something that leads to you going back.”</p>
<p>Schnee hesitated in the middle of the sentence, and continued while looking down.</p>
<p>“…I see, that’s what you meant.”</p>
<p>Shin could now understand. There was no need to think about what could be the cause behind her feeling of loss.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“!!”</p>
<p>Shin stood up and grabbed Schnee’s hand. Because it was him, she did not put up any resistance.</p>
<p>“Ehm, Shin?”</p>
<p>“Even if we find something related to how I can go back, I’m not going to disappear right away. Besides…I know it might sound unfair to say it now, but I am thinking that it might be nice to stay here too.”</p>
<p>“!? Do you…really mean it!?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s expression was almost blank, but now changed completely. She grabbed Shin’s shoulders and stared at him straight in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. Anyway, people like me usually can’t go back.”</p>
<p>If he had been summoned on the basis of a solid theory and technology, there might be the possibility to go back.</p>
<p>Shin had been transported to the new world in incomprehensible circumstances, however: believing that he could somehow go back was kind of too convenient.</p>
<p>The last thing that Shin saw was a gate opening. It was a situation that was impossible in a game, something he couldn’t understand at all.</p>
<p>“By this, I don’t mean that…h-hey, Schnee!?”</p>
<p>Shin was scratching his cheek, meaning to say that it wasn’t just an excuse, but he couldn’t finish his sentence. Clear tears were streaming down Schnee’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“Sch-Schnee!? Are you okay!?”</p>
<p>Shin, not expecting her to cry, was a bit shaken.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Hearing you say that made me even happier than I thought…”</p>
<p>Schnee smiled while wiping her tears. Shin’s chest hurt at such a sight.</p>
<p>It was true that he thought that he could stay. It was not something he decided he would do no matter what, however.</p>
<p>Putting aside the fact if he could actually go back or not, his desire to go back to his former world and his feelings towards Schnee were clashing within his heart, making sparks fly.</p>
<p>“Please do not make such a face. Just knowing that there is a chance is good news for me. It will make such feelings even stronger.”</p>
<p>Schnee probably felt what Shin was thinking about and smiled at him, traces of tears on her face. It was a smile brighter than Shin had ever seen.</p>
<p>“Schnee…you’re tough.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I am the maiden that fell in love with you, after all!”</p>
<p>“O-oh. Of course.”</p>
<p>After being impressed for an instant, Shin was disoriented by Schnee’s very direct declaration.</p>
<p>“W-well, I think the pot has boiled enough. Could you please go call Filma and the others? I’m sure they must have come out of the bath.”</p>
<p>Embarrassed because of her maiden in love statement, Schnee blushed.</p>
<p>Shin nodded to her and headed towards the corridor. It was then that he finally noticed the two pair of eyes looking at them.</p>
<p>“….hey. Since when have you been there?”</p>
<p>The eyes belonged to Filma and Shibaid. Both were peeking inside the dining room from the corridor.</p>
<p>It was normal for Filma, but seeing Shibaid poke just his face in the dining room, while hiding the rest of his body in the corridor, was kind of surreal.</p>
<p>“Enough to catch all the good parts!”</p>
<p>“Indeed. More precisely, if I were to re-enact it…”Please, don’t worry.”.”</p>
<p>Shibaid then embraced Filma. Filma then answered with a dramatic motion.</p>
<p>“Ehm, Shin?”</p>
<p>“Even if we find somet——”</p>
<p>“Stop the playyyyyy!!!!!”</p>
<p>Shin screamed.</p>
<p>They had seen everything since that!</p>
<p>“You two were SO much in your little world that you didn’t even notice us…I’m almost jealous.”</p>
<p>“Just say if you’re there!!”</p>
<p>“In that situation? It would have been quite inconsiderate.”</p>
<p>“Watching is even more inconsiderate!!”</p>
<p>Shin turned towards Schnee, seeking help, but she was staring intently at the pot, pretending not to hear anything.</p>
<p>She had heard everything, though. Her glowing red ears were proof enough.</p>
<p>“Ehm…did something happen?”</p>
<p>The dining room was very chaotic until Tiera arrived, with Yuzuha and Kagerou in tow, and asked what was going on.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 4 – Part 1</p>
<p>The following day, Shin’s party was once again standing before the gate to the Castle of the Depths.</p>
<p>“I’d sure love to be done with this place today.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Let’s proceed while keeping time loss to a minimum.”</p>
<p>Probably because of what happened the day before, Schnee looked less concerned and more eager.</p>
<p>All party members agreed with her; Filma and Shibaid looked in better shape than usual too.</p>
<p>“….hey, Shin. Are you really sure that nothing happened yesterday, before I arrived?”</p>
<p>“I explained already, didn’t I? That we might find something related to me.”</p>
<p>“But despite that, aren’t master and Filma acting kind of weird?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so. Really.”</p>
<p>“….very suspicious…”</p>
<p>Under Tiera’s inquisitive stare, Shin was in a cold sweat, trying his best to control his facial expressions.</p>
<p>He had already told Tiera about what Schnee had felt. He couldn’t tell her, however, that he had also hugged Schnee and made her cry. Shin also wanted to forget about the fact that Filma and Shibaid had been watching.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not going to ask anymore…but don’t hide really important things from me, okay? I told you about my biggest secret after all.”</p>
<p>“I know, and I told you about the most important part. There’s something that Schnee seems to feel, but the others don’t. I don’t either. Can you feel something peculiar other than the miasma, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“With all the miasma, I feel that my other senses are dulled, but…well, now that you mention it, other than feeling worried, I feel like…there’s something pulling me? Something like that, but just vaguely…”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while looking at the miasma lightly swaying beyond the gate.</p>
<p>Shin trusted Tiera’s sharp senses, so he found her mention of feeling something pulling at her a bit strange.</p>
<p>“Schnee feels like I might disappear, but you feel something pulling at you. Hmm…”</p>
<p>If Shin was the one being pulled, Schnee’s sensation would become more realistic, but Tiera said that she felt like she was the one being pulled.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t make anything of it yet.</p>
<p>“It’s pointless to simply worry about it here. We’ll know if we go.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, that is the only way.”</p>
<p>Shin was deep in thought, his head cocked to one side, but Filma and Shibaid prodded him. Thinking about it wouldn’t lead to any answers.</p>
<p>“Right, we’ll just go and see what happens.”</p>
<p>Just like the day before, the group used the『Miracle Drug of Holy Skies』and entered the castle.</p>
<p>Using the map, they proceeded quickly up to a certain point: then Shin and Schnee split up to explore and fill the remaining blank portions of the map, all the while maintaining communication via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>During the exploration of the dungeon, Schnee was the first one to notice something unusual.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any Chimeras.”</p>
<p>“Right…we’re already pretty far into the dungeon, this doesn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>“I can’t find any miasma-infected monsters either. With this much miasma filling the dungeon, it’s strange that the monsters are unaffected.”</p>
<p>The group was already past the midpoint of the dungeon, but had not yet encountered any monsters possessed or infected by miasma: Shin couldn’t rule it out as just their imagination anymore.</p>
<p>Except for the miasma hanging heavily throughout, the dungeon seemed absolutely normal.</p>
<p>“I guess this is different than all the dungeons we’ve explored before. Could that also be the reason why Schnee and Tiera feel something out of the ordinary?”</p>
<p>“It could be. Trypophobia’s bizarre display too could have been the product of something other than miasma.”</p>
<p>Even if affected by miasma, the 【Analyse】display had never looked bugged before.</p>
<p>Shin thought that the transformation from a game into reality might be a reason for the strange behavior.</p>
<p>Judging from the condition of the dungeon’s monsters however, there was a considerable chance that something other than miasma lay in wait.</p>
<p>“Did something like this happen before?”</p>
<p>“No, I cannot recall anything of the sort.”</p>
<p>Shibaid shook his head in response to Filma’s question.</p>
<p>Schnee, Tiera, and of course, Shin shook their heads as well.</p>
<p>“I thought something had happened while I was sleeping, but it looks like that’s not the case. Anyway, we can just go on and see, huh. It’s starting to feel like going to face a boss we’ve never fought before.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, now that you mention it, that’s it.”</p>
<p>Filma shrugged and Shin agreed with her assessment. The current situation wasn’t completely the same, but prior to facing a boss for the first time he would also think about how it would act or what type of enemy it would be. The only way to know was to fight.</p>
<p>Filma’s conclusion was not far from the truth.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, we have to find the route to the boss chamber today.”</p>
<p>The party advanced deeper in the dungeon. Now well past the middle point, they descended to what they supposed was the lower area of the dungeon — if Shin’s memory was correct. They could not detect any changes in the monsters they encountered though.</p>
<p>Just like the upper and middle areas, miasma leaked from the walls and floor.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee led, followed by the rest of the party. Progress was time consuming, but they were not hindered by obstacles like the Trypophobia.</p>
<p>After descending the stairs to yet another floor, Shin’s group faced a large, 5 mels tall, 4 mels wide door, intricately adorned with gorgeous, pompous decorations.</p>
<p>“This is…ice?”</p>
<p>The door, probably leading to Ishkar’s throne room, was covered by transparent crystal. Shin touched it warily and felt a cool sensation.</p>
<p>“Should we try to melt it?”</p>
<p>“No, it already took plenty of time to arrive here. Let’s go inside tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Considering who they were going to face, Shin prioritized keeping everyone’s condition in top form.</p>
<p>The group teleported to the dungeon’s entrance with a crystal and rested in the magic-powered vessel. The next day, after making sure that no one was feeling unwell, they quickly navigated to the majestic door they had stopped at the day before.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 4 – Part 2</p>
<p>“Let’s melt the ice first. Shibaid, put up a barrier, just in case.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin stood in front of the frozen gate and activated a basic Flame-type Magic skill 【Fireball】. Instead of releasing it as an attack, he held it in front of the door to melt the ice.</p>
<p>Shattering the ice by force was also an option, but accidentally hitting the door might cause something unexpected to happen, so Shin decided to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Keeping a ball of fire alive deep underwater was in itself a strange thing, nevertheless that was but a type of miracle granted by the mysterious power of magic.</p>
<p>Little by little, the heat emitted by the fireball melted the ice, which covered the door as if to seal it.</p>
<p>“I expected as much…this isn’t normal ice.”</p>
<p>Shin’s 【Fireball】 was easily over 1000 degrees, so ordinary ice would have completely disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>The ice covering the door, however, melted extremely slowly even with the ball of fire touching it. At this rate, it would take hours to completely vanish.</p>
<p>“It might have something to do with the miasma…let’s try 【Purification】.”</p>
<p>Shin stopped 【Fireball】 and activated 【Purification】, but there was no visible change to the situation.</p>
<p>“The surroundings are filled with miasma, but only this door isn’t? I guess I just have to increase the firepower then.”</p>
<p>Shin activated one of the most powerful Flame skills he possessed, the Flame-type Magic skill 【Flare Wall】. This high-level flame skill created a wall of fire in one spot. It couldn’t be moved, but emanated enough heat that the target would suffer damage even wearing fire-resistant equipment.</p>
<p>Shin created 【Flare Wall】 right in front of the door, so its heat was in direct contact with the ice. Maybe because of the higher temperature, the ice started melting much faster than when it was subjected to 【Fireball】’s heat. Even so, it would still take considerable time.</p>
<p>“Let me do it too.”</p>
<p>Schnee created a 【Flare Wall】 herself. While not at Shin’s level, Schnee too had reached high proficiency in martial and magic skills.</p>
<p>Wall-type skills became more powerful if cast in multiples, so Schnee added hers to Shin’s.</p>
<p>“The melting speed isn’t changing.”</p>
<p>“We definitely have more firepower now, though”</p>
<p>Despite the clear increase in firepower, the ice wasn’t melting any faster than when only Shin was casting the skill.</p>
<p>“Try using some other skill.”</p>
<p>Following Shin’s proposal, Schnee tried casting other Flame-type skills. None of them seemed to be effective, however.</p>
<p>“What could this mean?”</p>
<p>“Since I’m apparently connected somehow to this place, only my magic works? Tiera, could you try too, just to be sure?”</p>
<p>Tiera said that she felt pulled by something, so Shin thought that her magic could have some effect.</p>
<p>All of Tiera’s Flame-type magic spells were Arts. Their power was far lower than Skills, so it was hardly likely for them to have a significant effect on the ice that not even Shin’s magic power could melt quickly. Shin asked her to try, nonetheless, to be sure.</p>
<p>“Here goes nothing!”</p>
<p>Tiera held a hand towards the ice cover and casted 【Fire Wall】, right next to the door, just like Shin had done. Being the same Flame-type magic skill, firepower should increase, if only slightly.</p>
<p>Tiera’s 【Fire Wall】, however, instead of merging with Shin’s 【Flare Wall】, was repelled by it and vanished.</p>
<p>“It should be possible to use Skills and Arts together, though…”</p>
<p>Schnee had successfully attempted it before, so she was puzzled by this development.</p>
<p>“Should I try putting out my 【Flare Wall】?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we should. Even if my Art was effective then, there’s too much of a difference in firepower between us. I think that our abilities are just too different.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s supposition was very plausible. It would take too much time to test every little possibility, so they decided to simply wait for Shin’s skill to do its work.</p>
<p>“It’s taking more time than expected, huh.”</p>
<p>“Anyone or anything inside has already noticed us, that’s for sure. I only hope that Ishkar is still holding on.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid exchanged words while watching Shin melt the frozen door.</p>
<p>There was the chance, as it had happened with Trypophobia, for miasma to suddenly burst from beyond the door, so they kept alert.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like we can be too hopeful.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“Do you feel anything, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“I feel all my senses overwhelmed by the presence of miasma. But…it feels strange, somehow.”</p>
<p>Tiera replied that she couldn’t tell what was inside the room, because of the miasma’s thickness.</p>
<p>Maybe because she already had several encounters with miasma, however, she felt that the miasma tainting this dungeon was different than her other experiences.</p>
<p>“In what way is it different?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to put into words…the miasma I sensed until now felt like it was a fusion of many kinds of malice and ill will. Not a firm conscience like a person might have, but something ambiguous and indefinite, like it was hollow inside.”</p>
<p>That was the reason why miasma had different effects on different people, she added.</p>
<p>“Hmm…thus do monsters become more feral under its influence because they are affected by its more aggressive side?”</p>
<p>“Probably. I don’t know how it is with Chimeras and Demons, though.”</p>
<p>Tiera concurred with Shibaid’s theory, though she wasn’t absolutely sure.</p>
<p>“Hearing you that say that makes me think that what they say is actually true…as long as there is a man, there will be miasma.”</p>
<p>There were creatures with high intellect even among monsters, but their numbers could not be compared with humans’. It was natural to think that man was the source of malice.</p>
<p>“Negative emotions are born easily, it’s true. They can be also reduced, however. Man does not possess only negative emotions.”</p>
<p>Shibaid voiced a somewhat grand-sounding rebuttal to Filma’s words.</p>
<p>Among the party members present, Shibaid was the one who had participated in the greatest number of battles to the death, so he was well acquainted with the malice and hostility that men could harbor. Maybe because of this, he wanted to believe in the goodwill that man could also possess.</p>
<p>“If monsters are born from ill will, it would be nice if something like a protector was born from goodwill…”</p>
<p>Filma complained that if there were creatures opposite to Demons, things could be very different. Next to her, Shibaid replied, completely serious:</p>
<p>“I agree with you, but I suppose it means that we have to do something about that ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I guess we got a bit off topic…anyway, Tiera, you said the miasma here feels different, but what makes you think that?”</p>
<p>“It’s only something I feel, so I can’t say for sure, but the miasma corrupting this dungeon feels like it has a strong will. I don’t know what exactly that is, though.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that a Demon is about to be born? A will born from malice could be an even stronger mass of ill will.”</p>
<p>Shibaid tried to guess what the cause could be, his guard always up. Filma nodded as well.</p>
<p>“I agree, this can’t be good…what do you think, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…it’s only something I feel, after all. But it seems different from malice. At least, I don’t think it’s a Demon.”</p>
<p>Tiera added that she had sensed something different in the presence of Demons.</p>
<p>Shin thought about Tiera’s words, while continuing to cast 【Flare Wall】.</p>
<p>“Something other than a Demon…”</p>
<p>“Could Ishkar have turned into an Invader because of the miasma?”</p>
<p>“The possibility is there. Ishkar was never the type of monster to go on a rampage. Like Yuzuha and the merpeople said, it was like the guardian of these parts too. It probably has a bad affinity with miasma…if it’s resisting it, the emotions it projects would not be only born from malice, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Shin’s prediction was born also from his wish for Ishkar to be still resisting.</p>
<p>“Well then, we’ve made all sorts of theories, but now it’s time to find out the truth.”</p>
<p>Shin’s 【Flare Wall】 had melted away most of the ice. There were no locks or traps. All that was left was to push the door open.</p>
<p>“Shibaid and I will open the door first. The rest depends on the situation inside.”</p>
<p>Shin had already formulated a basic strategy, estimating the situation inside. Everyone nodded to his words.</p>
<p>“Here we go!”</p>
<p>Shin pushed the door open.</p>
<p>Differently from the royal chambers where the group fought Trypophobia, there was no sudden blast of miasma this time.</p>
<p>“First off, 【Purification】.”</p>
<p>The interior of the room was abnormally dark: even with 【Night Vision】, it was barely possible to see anything.</p>
<p>Behind Shibaid, who cautiously held his shield high, Shin and Schnee activated 【Purification】. The lights born from their palms vanished in the darkness.</p>
<p>“Eh…what…?”</p>
<p>An exclamation of surprise and confusion escaped Tiera’s lips.</p>
<p>The reason was clear enough. In the space where the miasma cleared, something she had not expected appeared.</p>
<p>“That must be Ishkar.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Judging from its appearance, it has not turned into an Invader.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee understood right away that the giant creature they saw beyond the door was Ishkar.</p>
<p>Ishkar’s torso was as much as 5-mels thick in the part nearest to its head. Because of this, looking at it from Tiera’s position — a few steps away from the door — it looked like there was a wall just beyond the door.</p>
<p>“So that’s…Ishkar…”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee reacted calmly. Behind them though, Tiera audibly swallowed.</p>
<p>Ishkar, one of the monsters who had reached the apex, level 1000.</p>
<p>With an appearance similar to an eastern dragon, it moved through the water by twisting its long and narrow body.</p>
<p>Two pairs of blue eyes gleamed on its head, while crystal-like horns sprouted from its sides. The claws on its limbs could easily tear through steel. Its rock hard scales, colored blue, would be difficult to damage with average weapons.</p>
<p>Its enormous body, however, was its most dangerous characteristic. There were countless reports of it swallowing several players in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Also because of the treacherous underwater field, it was the first monster that usually came to mind first when thinking about bosses difficult to defeat.</p>
<p>“Let’s go closer to its face. Keep your guard up.”</p>
<p>The part of the monster’s torso before Shin and the party seemed to be the upper one, the part closest to its head.</p>
<p>Beyond the previously frozen door was not a throne room, but a bizarrely vast expanse. Its depth seemed to extend even farther than 100 or 200 mels.</p>
<p>If such a large room, without a single pillar, was built above ground, it would surely crumble. Considering that it had to allow Ishkar to move, however, made it seem small somehow.</p>
<p>Making sure to be ready to cast defense skills whenever needed, Shin and his party kept rising up. Ishkar’s face was more or less 100 mels from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Shin could only see the side of the monster’s face, but it looked just like he remembered.</p>
<p>“….!!”</p>
<p>As the party was slowly nearing the monster’s head, Ishkar’s eyes suddenly moved. It was difficult to tell due to their lack of irises, but the deep blue orbs were definitely focused on Shin’s party.</p>
<p>Shin noticed that Tiera, behind him, stiffened up.</p>
<p>(Okay, what are you going to do now…?)</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself, without speaking a word aloud.</p>
<p>Ishkar’s level being as high as 1000, he could tell that not only Tiera, but also Schnee and the others were tense.</p>
<p>They were prepared. If Shin fought with his limiters removed, it would be difficult for them to lose.</p>
<p>But even then, the possibility of one of the members dying was not zero. That’s how much of an opponent Ishkar could be.</p>
<p>『…..HIgH hUmAn.』</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>As the group carefully observed Ishkar’s movements, a voice like the sound of a gong reverberated through the room.</p>
<p>Yes, a voice. The echo made it difficult to understand it, but the sound that reached the ears of Shin and his party clearly showed signs of intelligence.</p>
<p>“You’re conscious?”</p>
<p>“To tHinK…tHaT oNe wOuLd aPpEaR bEFoRe mE. WHaT I feLT wHeN sEAlinG tHE MiASma…wAs YOuR poWEr.”</p>
<p>Ishkar did not answer Shin’s question. It continued its monologue, as if it couldn’t hear Shin’s words.</p>
<p>“ReMovE tHE dOLls. I sHaLl dO No HaRm to THoSe bORn In THis wOrLD. OnLy pLAyeRS cAN Be mY eNEmY.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying? Hey! Can’t you hear me?”</p>
<p>“ThE pOWeR tHAt DeVouRS eVEn mIaSMa…NoT eVEn I cAN bESt iT. ——-hIGh HuMan. If YoU oPPoSe A rETuRn aGAinSt YouR WiLl…sLAy Me.”</p>
<p>Ishkar did not answer Shin, until the end.</p>
<p>Shin found the mention of an existence other than miasma especially puzzling. The words lastly spoken by Ishkar, however, made him forget everything about that.</p>
<p>“Hey!! What do you mean by—”</p>
<p>As if in answer to Shin’s half-spoken question, the door slammed shut. At the same time, Ishkar’s body started emanating energy — enough to make the very atmosphere tremble.</p>
<p>“Nngh, as expected of a monster standing above all others…what pressure…!”</p>
<p>Shibaid, who was standing in front of the group as the shield, frowned. The energy, released in all directions, was Ishkar’s 【Wave of the Monster Lord】, the skill it unleashed at the start of each battle.</p>
<p>Shibaid managed to block it with an attack-mitigating barrier, but if he hadn’t used the barrier, it was likely that all members except Shin would have been unable to move for a while.</p>
<p>Monsters above level 950 could use attacks that blew through the defenses of status immunity accessories. In that case, whether the wearer is affected by negative statuses depends on their stats, the accessory’s rank and the rank of the skill cast.</p>
<p>“Even with Shibaid’s barrier, that gave me goosebumps.”</p>
<p>Filma’s grip tightened on her 『Red Moon』 as she looked at Ishkar.</p>
<p>“Are you frightened?”</p>
<p>“Not a chance! My blood’s burning!”</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma encouraged each other.</p>
<p>Ishkar was slowly turning towards Shin’s group, showing clear hostility. Its pressure was powerful enough than even Schnee and others would be slowed down if they didn’t focus.</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>“Guruu!!”</p>
<p>Next to Tiera, Yuzuha and Kagerou were also in a battle-ready stance. The opponent was above them in rank, but even so they had not lost the will to fight.</p>
<p>Tiera, standing between them, looked straight at Ishkar, her expression stiff.</p>
<p>“Schnee, everyone, focus on support. The rest is as we planned!”</p>
<p>Shin gave his directions and leapt in the middle of 【Wave of the Monster Lord】.</p>
<p>【Wave of the Monster Lord】 lasted 20 seconds. In the game, Ishkar would not attack during that time. It was not something they could absolutely count on, however.</p>
<p>With every 【Limiter】 removed, Shin exceeded in stats any other creature in that world; it was not currently possible for him to be affected by negative statuses.</p>
<p>He was still wary of the possibility that the enemy could attack during those 20 seconds.</p>
<p>“—-■■■■”</p>
<p>Something close to, but slightly different than a roar came out of Ishkar’s mouth. It was a type of chant, which could not be heard as intelligible words to the group’s ears.</p>
<p>Before the eyes of Shin and his party, the seawater filling the room started to change. It was compressed in an instant, then shot at a speed invisible to human eyes.</p>
<p>In one second, countless blades of water were formed and shot at the party, each one sharp enough to slice Legend-grade equipment in one slash.</p>
<p>“【Ice Maelstrom】! ”</p>
<p>“【Vortex Slash】! ”</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma countered the water blades targeting the party with their own skills.</p>
<p>A whirlpool of ice shards extended from Schnee’s palm. Then electricity drawn by 『Red Moon』’s slash ran through the water, as if chasing after the whirlpool. Filma’s thunderbolts combined with Schnee’s ice whirlpool, amplifying its power and area of effect.</p>
<p>Ishkar’s water blades clashed head on against the giant whirlpool formed by the combination of Filma and Schnee’s skills.</p>
<p>The water blades ground and cracked, as did the ice crackling with electricity. After several seconds of clashing, Filma and Schnee’s combination attack emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma had not destroyed all water blades, but only those directed at them. The result was thus not mutual destruction, but more like a breakthrough.</p>
<p>“Good thing we prepared in advance.”</p>
<p>“Yes, now we can be more versatile strategically.”</p>
<p>The skill used by Schnee and Filma did not have a particular name as a combination skill.</p>
<p>Even so, combining two skills boosted their power and effectiveness.</p>
<p>In the game, even if two skills not meant to be combined were used together, there was no change in their effects.</p>
<p>In this world, however, it was impossible for skills not to influence each other.</p>
<p>Despite being created by the mysterious force called magic, skills manifested as physical phenomena. Some thought that they had to affect each other someway, and the effects of such combinations had been researched and proven.</p>
<p>There were few opportunities of testing it in combat, but Shin’s group had tried all sorts of combinations whenever they had the chance.</p>
<p>The whirlpool of ice and electricity broke through the barrage of water blades and collided with Ishkar’s torso. The ice shards shattered the monster’s scales, the electricity enveloping them seared its flesh.</p>
<p>The whirlpool had lost power after breaking through the water blades, but still managed to inflict damage.</p>
<p>The problem was that, because of Ishkar’s massive body, the wound was simply a small singed area. It would have been different if the attack was powerful enough to pierce the sea dragon’s body, but a superficial burn could not slow down its movements.</p>
<p>“As expected, an attack like that can only scratch its skin.”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s leave that to Shin.”</p>
<p>Their goal was to deflect Ishkar’s attack in the first place. To hope to do more against Ishkar would have been arrogant, even for Schnee and the others.</p>
<p>“Wooooohhh!!!”</p>
<p>Shin mustered his fighting spirit and swung 『Moonless』. For him, Ishkar’s large body was a huge target impossible to miss.</p>
<p>『Moonless』’ blade drew an arc, which extended in a 6-mels long crimson blade. It was the first step of a skill that unleashed slashes with seven blades, one for each element.</p>
<p>Octa-elemental composite skill, 【Seven Radiant Blades】.</p>
<p>The deep red blade that tore through 【Wave of the Monster Lord】 as it advanced was the incandescent Flame-elemental slash. Now that Shin had removed the upper limiter on his stats, his slashes could cut through Ishkar’s scales and flesh in one stroke, leaving a deep wound on the monster’s torso.</p>
<p>“One more!”</p>
<p>Shin readied his weapon again, to perform the next slash.The blade was now formed by a large mass of sand. The katana, now a light brown color, was swung as if tracing the burning wound on the monster’s body.</p>
<p>Ishkar, however, would not allow itself to be attacked without dodging or defending.</p>
<p>The seawater rumbled and covered the surface of Ishkar’s twisting and winding body.</p>
<p>A blade of sand and an armor of seawater. The clash of the two ended with the blade emerging victorious.</p>
<p>An attack made of sand might not sound too dangerous normally, but the sand forming Shin’s blade was anything but normal. It could vibrate and move at high speed. Thanks to the power of magic, its movements defied the laws of physics, boosting its cutting power higher than a mere saw blade, but also any Ancient-grade weapon.</p>
<p>The sand blade thus sliced through the seawater armor as if through butter, carving many more wounds on Ishkar’s body. With each slash, the sand also attached to the monster’s body, enlarging the wounds.</p>
<p>This attack’s gradually increasing damage made it even nastier than being burned by fire.</p>
<p>Ishkar had twisted its body to avoid the slashes, so it had only suffered flesh wounds until now. Shin’s offensive, however, was far from over.</p>
<p>“You won’t let me have my way, huh?”</p>
<p>As if the battle until now was nothing but a warm-up, Ishkar moved away from Shin at extremely high speed. The monster’s huge body did not mean that its movements were sluggish. If it moved at high speed in water, the generated currents would affect even the movements of Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“If I use my full abilities, I get this weird feeling of omnipotence…”</p>
<p>Shin focused strength on his legs and kicked the water. His body then accelerated forward, as if he had kicked a solid object.</p>
<p>The water currents generated by Ishkar would make it difficult to swim straight even for a Chosen One, but Shin advanced as if slicing through them with his body.</p>
<p>The third slash, a blade of ice covered by white mist, was ready to be swung at Shin’s side.</p>
<p>Ishkar blasted a burning hot beam towards the approaching Shin. It was a massive heat barrage, large enough to completely engulf Shin’s body.</p>
<p>Shin countered it head on, swinging the Skill-boosted 『Moonless』 right on the middle.</p>
<p>His explosive advance was halted, but his body remained unscathed.</p>
<p>The monster’s burning beam was cleanly cut in two halves by the white mist on Shin’s katana, changing directions to his left and right sides.</p>
<p>“Haha, that was easy!”</p>
<p>Shin cheered, his hands powerfully gripping the blade’s hilt.</p>
<p>『Moonless』 once again drew an arc, freezing the surrounding seawater. The following instant, a freezing storm started blowing towards Ishkar, like a waterfall ready to devour the monster’s burning beam.</p>
<p>Ishkar saw the incoming attack and stopped releasing the heat beam, twisting its body away from Shin’s attack. The monster emitted lightning attacks from its horns in retaliation, but Shin swept them away with his now lightning-clad 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>“—■■■■”</p>
<p>A low growl escaped Ishkar’s mouth. Shin had learned the dragon’s attack patterns, but it could have new strategies in this world. Shin realized this and decided to observe what the monster would do next.</p>
<p>The wary Shin was then attacked from all directions.</p>
<p>The seawater around him started moving, all at the same time. It changed into 1-mel spheres, occupying a 50 mels radius all around Shin.</p>
<p>It was one of Ishkar’s skills, 【Aqua Cage】.</p>
<p>The 【Aqua Cage】 water spheres, completely filling Shin’s field of view, were then struck by Ishkar’s lightning attack.</p>
<p>It was not the same yellow lightning that Shin had swept away before, but light blue bolts that came in contact with the spheres and changed directions, just like rays of light deflected by water.</p>
<p>The sphere-shaped seawater served not only to trap Shin, but also to conduct the lightning bolts.</p>
<p>The bolts, passing through several spheres, arrived very close to Shin’s position.</p>
<p>“Now this is something I’ve never seen before.”</p>
<p>The lightning split in two in front of Shin’s eyes and passed by him. Several seconds later, some of the spheres were cleaved in two as well, turning back to seawater.</p>
<p>The bolts had been sliced by the invisible blade extending from 『Moonless』, a blade of wind. Someone with good eyesight could probably see that, near 『Moonless』’ tip, part of the scenery appeared distorted.</p>
<p>【Aqua Cage】 was a skill that affected the target’s surroundings, but causing no damage itself. It was thus obviously possible to move.</p>
<p>After 『Moonless』 was swung, the wind blade disappeared and was replaced by a pitch black one. Shin confirmed the change with a glance and held the sword high.</p>
<p>“Shaah!!”</p>
<p>The darkness-colored katana swung down. The sixth blade’s effect was to negate all magic, causing all the water spheres in the blade’s path to vanish.</p>
<p>【Aqua Cage】, an attack meant to gradually shave the target’s life down to nothing, was powerless before the black blade’s negation of magic. This result affected the surroundings as well. The 【Aqua Cage】 in front of Shin too had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Lastly, 『Moonless』 morphed into the skill’s final slash, a blade of light. Shin held it firmly and quickly moved through the now open space.</p>
<p>Ishkar too had probably noticed the opening carved into 【Aqua Cage】.</p>
<p>Even with Shin’s high magic resistance, however, he could not simply break through the 【Aqua Cage】 released by a level 1000 monster. He went on forward, however, despite the danger.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t see past 【Aqua Cage】’s spheres, so he used the map and presence detection to proceed while avoiding them.</p>
<p>As soon as he finally managed to exit 【Aqua Cage】’s area of effect, Ishkar’s claws were brought down towards him.</p>
<p>Shin drew 『Moonless』 closer and used it to protect the left side of his body.</p>
<p>Ishkar’s attack sent Shin flying. Witnessing this, Schnee and the rest of the party each inhaled sharply. In the game, a direct attack like that would surely drop the target’s HP gauge to the red zone.</p>
<p>“Just as expected…guess I really have to thank these cheat-like Gifts I got!!”</p>
<p>Because of Shin’s boosted stats and the bonuses provided by his equipment, however, his HP decreased by less than 10%. One reason was the small damage received, but his total HP was also more than double the original amount. As long as he properly defended, it would be no problem even if he received several attacks.</p>
<p>Before Shin shouted, the light blade from his katana pierced Ishkar’s eyes.</p>
<p>The greatest characteristic of the blade of light was its length, extending over 100 mels. It could not affect its surroundings like the blade of darkness, so it could be said that the blade just literally grew longer.</p>
<p>Most players took advantage of this to perform a wide-range sweep, but its greatest power was drawn out when thrusting.</p>
<p>The tip of the blade was aimed straight forward. An attack a few cemels wide, very few mels high, that covered an extreme distance in an instant. Even for Shin and the party, avoiding it would be a very difficult feat.</p>
<p>Naturally, Ishkar could not, since its eyes were one of the monster’s very few weak points. The blade of light stabbed them, extending as far as it could, finally piercing through Ishkar’s skull.</p>
<p>“■■■■■■■■■■■■■■――!?!”</p>
<p>Even Ishkar could not help bellowing in pain after being gouged by the blade. The result was just a scream of pain because, thanks to its massive body, the blade was too small to cause instant death.</p>
<p>Not unleashing an attack in all directions immediately, however, was a fatal mistake for Ishkar.</p>
<p>In the small timeframe of its pained scream, it lost sight of Shin.</p>
<p>The piercing blade of light disappeared. When Ishkar’s eyes caught Shin again, he was now wielding 『Moonless』 with his left hand, while his right was clenched in a fist.</p>
<p>Ishkar noticed that Shin’s silhouette was enveloped in a faint purple light, different from the aura of physical boosts.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if you can survive even with your head blown off?”</p>
<p>Shin hadn’t noticed his physical change. His fist crashed into Ishkar’s lightless eyes.</p>

<p>Barehanded-type Martial skill,【Shiden – Zekka】.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful barehanded skills erupted from Shin’s right fist.</p>
<p>Ishkar’s eye, already pierced by the blade of light, ruptured and burst. An instant later, the monster’s cranium swelled.</p>
<p>The sheer power unleashed in Ishkar’s head ravaged its insides and took the dragon’s life. Ishkar’s HP gauge hit zero instantly.</p>
<p>The power let loose by Shin’s fist, however, was not content with simply destroying the dragon’s head.</p>
<p>A few seconds after Ishkar’s head started swelling, the monster’s skull could not withstand the damage anymore and exploded. The released power traveled through the seawater and reached as far as Schnee and the rest of the party.</p>
<p>Having lost everything above its neck, Ishkar’s massive body gradually lost its strength. From the wound supposed to be spraying blood, a blue vapor-like substance emanated instead.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 4 – Part 3</p>
<p>“Hey, Schnee…isn’t Shin acting kind of weird?”</p>
<p>“………………”</p>
<p>Shin swung the ice blade towards Ishkar. Unable to keep it in anymore, Filma asked for Schnee’s opinion.</p>
<p>Schnee did not answer. Her grip on 『Blue Moon』’s hilt tightened.</p>
<p>There was no need for questions, she already knew the answer.</p>
<p>Ishkar had started fighting with Shin, and Shin only: it was like it did not even acknowledge the existence of Schnee and the rest of the party.</p>
<p>While Shin had tried not to get them involved, it was more than clear that the dragon actively not attacking them.</p>
<p>Finding the battle a good opportunity, Shin fought with his limiters off, but his current style of fighting was kind of different from the one that Schnee was familiar with.</p>
<p>Regardless of how high Shin’s stats were, his party members were unable to determine precisely how strong he was. No one knew how powerful of an enemy he could fight by himself, what kind of enemy could match him, or what kind of enemy could be superior to him.</p>
<p>More than his offense, Schnee was worried about his defense. The only way to actually know was to be attacked, so even if they could make predictions, there was no way of knowing how much he could withstand.</p>
<p>Shin’s current way of fighting, however, did not suggest that he was sparing much thought to his defense.</p>
<p>“This is bizarre…for Shin to laugh while fighting such a battle.”</p>
<p>Following Filma’s question, Shibaid expressed his doubts too. His shield high, he still kept his guard up, but his gaze followed Shin, not Ishkar.</p>
<p>“Kuu, something, strange.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha watched Shin with furrowed brows. Kagerou likewise cried in agreement.</p>
<p>“This is strange. I can’t feel any miasma coming from Ishkar!”</p>
<p>Tiera, who had been focusing on trying to purify the miasma, as she had done against Trypophobia, suddenly raised her voice, slightly panicked.</p>
<p>Schnee’s expression turned sour.</p>
<p>She was also capable of detecting miasma, to a degree. Based on the density of the miasma corrupting the dungeon, it was impossible that its boss, Ishkar, was unaffected.</p>
<p>Watching the battle Schnee and the rest of the party thought that Ishkar had weakened or could not move anymore, due to having sealed the miasma. If not, it would have lost to the miasma and turned into an Invader.</p>
<p>Despite their predictions, however, Ishkar appeared before them looking just as they remembered, with all of his abilities intact. It was fighting against Shin as if miasma didn’t affect it in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p>Looking at Shin’s clearly offensive-oriented fighting style, Schnee felt compelled to run to him. She wanted to go to his side, to talk to him.</p>
<p>She could not do it though.</p>
<p>Shin was fighting against a monster above all monsters, a beast of level 1000.</p>
<p>While her stats had been boosted by the Ley Lines when they freed Filma, and she equipped Ancient-grade weapons and armor, this fight was too dangerous for her to dive into.</p>
<p>“….Filma, Shibaid. Let’s go to Shin’s side. Tiera, you go with Yuzuha and Kagerou close to the walls, make sure you stay out of attack range.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m going too.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous, you know?”</p>
<p>“I know. But I can feel a power that’s not caused by the miasma coming from Shin and Ishkar.”</p>
<p>“A cold, mighty power from Ishkar and a raging power from Shin. The latter is especially something the likes of I’ve never felt before,” said Tiera.</p>
<p>“A raging power…might that be the reason why Shin’s acting so strange?”</p>
<p>“Let’s think about that later. More importantly, even if we go, what exactly are we going to do? It’ll be tough even for us to keep up with Shin as he is now, you know that right?”</p>
<p>Without his limiter, Shin moved much faster than anyone else in the party and his attacks were also much more powerful than theirs.</p>
<p>He could face Ishkar head on, after all. His power was on a whole other level.</p>
<p>If Schnee and the party were to participate in the battle between Ishkar and Shin, it could only be as decoys.</p>
<p>“I believe that if the targets become two, it will have to look at us too. With Shin as he is, we will just act as support.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine as for joining the battle, but are we going to leave Shin like that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll go by myself. I have the highest speed among us, and even if I’m attacked I can dodge with a Kunoichi skill.”</p>
<p>The power-up received when they freed Filma, the usual boost attachments.</p>
<p>Combined with the physical boosts due to spirit summoning, available only to Elves and Pixies, Schnee’s AGI was maxed out. Being a Kunoichi skilled in dodging, she would probably be the quickest in reaching Shin’s position.</p>
<p>“You’re really something, you know…”</p>
<p>“Based on our abilities, Schnee is the most suitable one. Shin’s belligerent attitude is a concern, but even if something happens I doubt that she could be felled in one instant.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded at Shibaid’s words and started moving. Shibaid led with Filma following a few steps behind. Tiera, Yuzuha, and Kagerou acted as the rear guard.</p>
<p>Separated from Shibaid’s group, which proceeded with every member at the same pace, Schnee approached Shin at high speed, using a different route.</p>
<p>She was looking at Shin, now surrounded by water spheres, Ishkar’s 【Aqua Cage】.</p>
<p>She knew that they weren’t just spheres made of water.</p>
<p>Shin would probably be okay, but in Schnee’s heart, the worry that was supposed to be dispelled appeared once again.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>One second before Schnee could activate a skill to get rid of 【Aqua Cage】’s spheres, Shin had slipped past the spheres’ area of effect. A blade of light extended from 『Moonless』 and pierced one of the dragon’s eyes.</p>
<p>Shin then moved closer to Ishkar and readied his right hand into a fist. His body was wrapped in a faint aura, different from anything hat Schnee had seen before. Cold chills ran down her spine.</p>
<p>No one needed to explain it to her. Schnee instinctively felt that Shin, while possessed by that aura, could not be allowed to fight any longer.</p>
<p>“Shin!!”</p>
<p>Schnee’s voice, however, did not reach him.</p>
<p>Shin’s fist landed heavily on Ishkar’s skull, which burst into pieces in front of Schnee’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Kh…”</p>
<p>A wave of power spread through the seawater, exhibiting the strength of the attack.</p>
<p>The party felt the surge of power course all over their bodies. Schnee and the other members were stopped in their tracks by it.</p>
<p>“I have to go…quickly…”</p>
<p>Schnee focused her strength on her frozen legs and kicked the water hard. Before she could get closer to Shin, however, something changed in Ishkar.</p>
<p>His skull exploded. Ishkar was now headless, completely still. Blue vapor flowed out from his severed neck.</p>
<p>At the same time, countless icicles shot out of the dragon’s torso and neck, like a flurry of lances, covering the monster’s body.</p>
<p>That ice then gradually changed shape.</p>
<p>The ice spears all fused together into one and re-created Ishkar’s head.</p>
<p>It was not completely made by ice, however: the eyes and horns were a deep blend of blue and purple. After forming the dragon’s head, blue ice also covered its claws and scales.</p>
<p>Shin attacked again before the monster regenerated completely, but Ishkar avoided his attacks with an agility unthinkable for such a large body.</p>
<p>“What the…..!?!”</p>
<p>Schnee was confused by Ishkar’s new, unknown form and was too late to notice what had appeared before her. She slowed down instantly, but could not avoid crashing into something solid.</p>
<p>She received no damage, but even looking at what she crashed against, she could not see anything. She stretched out her hands cautiously and felt the presence of something smooth, like a glass wall.</p>
<p>“This is…a wall?”</p>
<p>Schnee pushed against it, but the wall did not budge. She pressed with more strength, but the wall showed no sign of breaking. Shibaid and the others caught up with her, but they did not seem to be able to pass either.</p>
<p>Shin seemed to have the advantage in the battle, but as time passed the aura around Shin gradually grew larger. At the same time, his fighting style changed too.</p>
<p>“—-out of my sight!!”</p>
<p>Schnee swung 『Blue Moon』, forcefully, not holding back at all.</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid noticed Shin’s state and struck the invisible wall with skills.</p>
<p>“Damn you, why…!?”</p>
<p>『Blue Moon』’s blade was repelled, and magic seemed to not have any effect either. The feeling spreading from the katana’s blade expressed that the wall hadn’t been damaged at all.</p>
<p>“…..Shiden.”</p>
<p>Schnee moved away from Filma and the others, to make sure not to hit them by accident, and unleashed one of her trump cards.</p>
<p>A long, thin blade of ice extended from 『Blue Moon』. Unlike Shin’s 【Seven Radiant Blades】, the crystal clear blade looked like a longer 『Blue Moon』.</p>
<p>Katana and Water Combination skill, 【Shiden – Flowing Spark Blossom】.</p>
<p>This skill ignored armor and all defenses and was also highly effective against barriers such as the one stopping the party’s advance. Schnee unleashed it against the glass-like wall without reserve.</p>
<p>“This can’t be…”</p>
<p>But even this slash, carrying every ounce of her power, could not destroy the barrier before them.</p>
<p>“Schnee…”</p>
<p>“The result was the same, then.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid approached Schnee after trying their own Shiden skills, to no avail.</p>
<p>Behind them, Yuzuha and Kagerou struck the barrier with flame and lightning attacks.</p>
<p>“What in the world is up with this barrier? It’s way too tough!”</p>
<p>“I have no idea…I can’t remember ever seeing something this sturdy.”</p>
<p>In the game, Ishkar did not possess the ability to create such barriers.</p>
<p>A barrier that did not even crack after being struck by Schnee’s, Shibaid’s, and Filma’s Shiden skills could not be erected even by a level 1000 monster, after all.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, if we do not pass this obstacle, we cannot go to Shin’s aid.”</p>
<p>Shibaid spoke while glaring at the transparent wall.</p>
<p>As the barrier did not show the slightest crack, it was clear that it couldn’t be destroyed just by hitting it with skills. Being invisible to the naked eye, it was also impossible to tell how far it extended.</p>
<p>“Tiera, can you tell us anything….Schnee, Filma, look!”</p>
<p>“Tiera? What….?”</p>
<p>Schnee looked at Tiera after Shibaid called her, and saw her floating in front of Yuzuha and Kagerou. The latter two were moving their paws up and down, as if scratching against something.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tiera had passed through the barrier that was blocking Schnee and the rest of the party.</p>
<p>“Why…?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Schnee!! We might have found a way to pass through!!”</p>
<p>Urged by Filma, Schnee and Shibaid rushed to where Tiera was. She seemed utterly confused and hurriedly spoke to the three as they approached.</p>
<p>“Master!! I-I don’t know why, but I got through!!”</p>
<p>“How?? What method did you use?”</p>
<p>“Well, I…I tried cutting through the barrier with my dagger, and I just kind of fell through…”</p>
<p>Tiera herself did not seem to know how she had gotten past the barrier. Kagerou, left behind, was scratching at the invisible wall with all his might. Yuzuha was also clawing at the barrier in the same way, but she suddenly slipped through the barrier. At the same time, Kagerou likewise passed to the other side.</p>
<p>“Kuu!?”</p>
<p>“Guruu!?”</p>
<p>Taken completely by surprise, the two spun once in the water because of their excess momentum. After a bit of paddling, they finally returned to their original stances.</p>
<p>“….we, passed too!?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha was baffled by the sudden development, then her body trembled. The same purple aura around Shin rose from her body too.</p>
<p>“This is…like Shin? Yuzuha, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Schnee, concerned, asked Yuzuha how she felt. However Yuzuha did not answer and howled loudly in response.</p>
<p>“Kuu…KUOOOOOOOOON!!!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s body glowed brightly and increased in size. When the light faded, Yuzuha had returned to her original form.</p>
<p>She was now much larger than Schnee or Tiera and sported her trademark nine tails as well. There was no mistaking it: Yuzuha had returned to her original form.</p>
<p>“Eh…? Yuzu…ha?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s sudden transformation left Tiera almost speechless. Kagerou too, next to Tiera, growled in confusion.</p>
<p>“…so this power can influence me too.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha looked at her own body and whispered to herself. Her voice did not bear any childish traits anymore. Her consciousness seemed to have returned to one fitting to her current body.</p>
<p>“Do not fret, I remember you all. I shall lend you my strength. You too, Kagerou, do not glare at me so.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha used one of her tails and lifted Tiera on her back. She then slowly turned her eyes towards Shin.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what’s going on, but I guess we can only leave things to Tiera and Yuzuha…”</p>
<p>“…Tiera. Listen well. I am sure you understand after seeing that aura, but Shin is different from usual now.”</p>
<p>Schnee breathed in, then started talking. She couldn’t go herself, so there was no choice but to talk.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s kind of…scary. I also feel that he changed.”</p>
<p>“He cannot control it, surely.”</p>
<p>Tiera and Yuzuha agreed while looking at Shin fighting against Ishkar. Tiera, thanks to her sharp senses, had felt the same thing as Schnee.</p>
<p>Yuzuha, her eyes narrowed, seemed to be trying to conclude something.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, do you know what that is?”</p>
<p>“It is power, that much I can tell. I do not know what it actually is. However, it seems Shin has not been completely consumed by it either.”</p>
<p>“Could you use it to break down this wall?”</p>
<p>“With time, it appears to be possible. But not immediately. This form too is temporary, not complete.”</p>
<p>“….understood. We cannot go any further than this. Thus we entrust this to you.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke to Yuzuha and Tiera, restraining her emotions. She had not lost her composure to the point of asking Yuzuha to destroy the barrier, without knowing how much time it could take, in a situation like the current one.</p>
<p>“….I shall break into their battle.”</p>
<p>Tiera swallowed her breath and looked towards Shin and Ishkar. Her reaction was perfectly natural, as both opponents were using attacks that meant instant death for someone with Tiera’s stats. Interfering in their conflict meant that one misstep would result in certain death.</p>
<p>“….understood. Yuzuha, please.”</p>
<p>“Leave everything to me.”</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Tiera asked Yuzuha for her assistance, with a resolute expression. Going together meant facing danger together. Yuzuha was already prepared for what was going to come.</p>
<p>“We’re going!”</p>
<p>Riding on Yuzuha, Tiera headed towards Shin.</p>
<p>Schnee could only gaze at her back as she did.</p>
<p>“Can’t I…do anything…?”</p>
<p>Looking at Ishkar and Shin fighting, Schnee remembered the words uttered by the dragon before the battle started.</p>
<p>“Dolls….those born in this world….could it be….!?”</p>
<p>Schnee reflected and realized that Ishkar could have been talking about support characters and all those that came in this world from the previous one, excluding former players.</p>
<p>Only players can be enemies. That probably meant that, among them, only Shin should be allowed to fight.</p>
<p>“If so, why….”</p>
<p>Why could Tiera pass through the barrier?</p>
<p>Tiera was a creature of this world, not a player. Schnee knew that she was not the child of players either.</p>
<p>Yuzuha was Shin’s partner monster. Her role was to fight alongside Shin, that could explain why she could pass through the barrier.</p>
<p>Kagerou had the same relationship as Yuzuha did with Shin. If Tiera had not passed the barrier, Kagerou probably would not have been able to either.</p>
<p>Yuzuha, Kagerou, Tiera…among them, Tiera was a bizarre case. She was born in different circumstances, but she should be on the same side as Schnee and the others.</p>
<p>Yet she had passed through the barrier and was now heading towards Shin.</p>
<p>“Why….”</p>
<p>Schnee could only watch. In her heart, many doubts rose and vanished.</p>
<p>Why is that not me?</p>
<p>Why is it not me the one going to help Shin?</p>
<p>Someone else was in the place she should be in. Just thinking that made Schnee feel like her whole body was grinding and cracking.</p>
<p>—–was Tiera someone important to Shin?</p>
<p>The last doubt that rose within her, no matter how much time passed, would not disappear.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 11 Chapter 4 – Part 4</p>
<p>“That’s…not blood.”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled to himself, still in a fighting stance, while looking at the blue vapor-like substance exuding from Ishkar’s neck.</p>
<p>The exploded skull vanished as if melting away.</p>
<p>It ended all too easily. That was the reason why Shin hadn’t lowered his guard yet.</p>
<p>Shiden’s offensive power was high. With Shin’s stats, it was probably possible to KO even Ishkar in one blow.</p>
<p>And yet,…even considering this, there was no challenge. It felt “boring”.</p>
<p>“!? Wait, what was I thinking just now!?”</p>
<p>Shin felt his fighting spirit boiling, as he was facing a powerful opponent. However, he felt that his last thought had come from a completely different source.</p>
<p>As if someone other than him was inside his mind.</p>
<p>“….as I thought, you aren’t down yet.”</p>
<p>Before the frowning Shin, several ice pillars sprouted from Ishkar’s neck. In the blink of an eye, the pillars fused into one and rebuilt Ishkar’s head.</p>
<p>It was not completely made of ice: the horns and eyes were a deep blue. Shin felt some sort of will behind the eyes gazing at him.</p>
<p>“If you’ve revived, all I have to do is defeat you one more time.”</p>
<p>Shin forgot what he was thinking about for the moment and kicked the water, moving toward Ishkar, the explosive propulsion letting him close in on the dragon instantly.</p>
<p>Ishkar, however, blocked his advance by freezing the seawater around Shin.</p>
<p>Shin immediately cast magic to destroy the ice. However…</p>
<p>“I can’t break it? I’ll just smash it then!”</p>
<p>Magic should have been able to weaken the binding’s effects, but it failed. Shin guessed it was probably because of a particular skill Ishkar possessed, so he decided to force his way out of his bonds.</p>
<p>Half of his body was already frozen, but he could still swing his arms and legs to break free. Maybe thanks to the effects of his resistances, only the surface of his body was frozen.</p>
<p>As soon as Shin broke free, Ishkar’s arms swung down towards him. Shin noticed, but before performing an evasive maneuver he swung 『Moonless』 around him.</p>
<p>While swinging 『Moonless』, in a sweeping motion, Shin heard cracking noises from the katana’s tip. The sources of the sound were Ishkar’s scales, which had changed color to blend in with the seawater.</p>
<p>It was 【Dead Fragment Drops】, one of Ishkar’s attacks which had claimed the lives of many a player in the past. The scales were very difficult to see, extremely sturdy and numerous, characteristics which made them extremely troublesome to deal with. They caused the players to separate and attacked them individually.</p>
<p>Shin knew how sturdy the scales were, so he activated the Katana-type Martial skill 【Blade Breaker】 to destroy the scales as they headed towards him. While Shin was busy dealing with the scales, Ishkar’s claws bore down upon him too.</p>
<p>“Hhngh!”</p>
<p>Against the sharply gleaming claws, Shin chose not to defend or dodge, but to attack.</p>
<p>He turned his back to Ishkar and spun once in place. His right leg kicked the water and the left leg, taking advantage of centrifugal force, countered the claws with a roundhouse kick.</p>
<p>Barehanded-type Martial skill 【Rolling Wave Strike】.</p>
<p>The kick, unleashed with a burst of white foam, released a controllable shockwave when it clashed against Ishkar’s claws. Focusing the impact on one point allowed Shin to crush Ishkar’s claws, like a raging wave.</p>
<p>“With this difference in size, it sure isn’t easy.”</p>
<p>Shin had crushed Ishkar’s claws, but also because of their difference in mass, he couldn’t maintain his position just by using the seawater as a foothold. He suffered no damage, but was pushed back and forced to withdraw.</p>
<p>That instant, a familiar voice reached his ears.</p>
<p>“Shi—n!”</p>
<p>“Tch, who’s getting in the way now…in…the way? No, I…wait, that’s…?”</p>
<p>Every time he thought, he felt something unfamiliar creeping in his mind. He shook his head to get rid of it, and then he noticed what Tiera was riding on.</p>
<p>While not as large as Ishkar, it was a silhouette of much greater size than Shin or his party. Eyes concealing intellect, powerful limbs, and its greatest characteristic: nine tails.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, is that you?”</p>
<p>Thanks to the contract bound with Yuzuha, Shin quickly realized that Tiera was approaching him while riding on her.</p>
<p>Yuzuha arrived next to Shin in the blink of an eye, stopped as if screeching to a halt, pushing Tiera out with her back, then turned towards Ishkar.</p>
<p>“I shall hold him back.”</p>
<p>With Yuzuha’s words echoing behind her, Tiera headed towards Shin. Moving at a speed she couldn’t reach by herself, Tiera opened her arms and legs wide.</p>
<p>She probably meant for Shin to catch her. Slightly confused, Shin opened his arms wide too.</p>
<p>“—-eh?”</p>
<p>Just before they could touch, Tiera used her arms to change direction.</p>
<p>She only moved a few cemels: from a course that would have led her to embrace Shin, she changed to a head hugging course.</p>
<p>Shin would have never expected Tiera to change course: the surprise, added to his initial confusion, prevented him from dodging.</p>
<p>As a result, Shin’s head ended up firmly planted in Tiera’s chest.</p>
<p>“Begone, evil! Be purified!”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Tiera shouted, still holding Shin’s head tightly.</p>
<p>Divine-type Skill 【Purification Verse】.</p>
<p>When Tiera was still a Priestess of the World Tree, she used this skill to purify the surroundings before invoking the spirits. The skill removed and prevented status ailments from the user in a set radius around them; however, she was supposed to have lost it along with her Priestess job.</p>
<p>The aura that enveloped Shin’s body dissipated. After making sure that it was really gone, Tiera let go of Shin.</p>
<p>“Ah….had I turned nasty or something?”</p>
<p>The aura disappeared thanks to 【Purification Verse】, and Shin felt that the unusual presence inside his mind was gone.</p>
<p>While fighting he would instantly forget about it: now that it was gone, Shin clearly grasped that unusual feeling and was shocked.</p>
<p>“You had an aura around you that master and the others said they had never seen before. Your way of fighting was violent too. Don’t…make us worry like that.”</p>
<p>Tiera talked with a very serious expression. Shin thanked her honestly.</p>
<p>“Where are Schnee and the others?”</p>
<p>“Some sort of invisible wall won’t let them through. I don’t know the reason, but only me, Yuzuha, and Kagerou could pass through it.”</p>
<p>Shin looked towards Schnee and the others and found them shooting skills towards an apparently empty space. As Tiera had said, their skills stopped and disappeared abruptly after traveling to a certain point.</p>
<p>“I don’t get what’s going on either, but we better wrap this up quickly. You stand back, Tiera. Yuzuha and I are going to end this now!”</p>
<p>Tiera nodded and withdrew, while Shin again faced Ishkar. His eyes now showed a light that was not present before.</p>
<p>—–Boundary Guardian level 1000</p>
<p>The name displayed by 【Analyze】 was not Ishkar’s.</p>
<p>Shin recalled Ishkar’s mention of a “power that devours even miasma”. Ishkar’s consciousness was probably not present anymore in the monster.</p>
<p>The boundary guardian-turned Ishkar unleashed its lethal breath, which Yuzuha neutralized with five types of magic. Shin advanced under her massive body.</p>
<p>The two contenders exchanged attacks that would definitely inflict great damage if not blocked, so Shin was able to prepare to strike without Ishkar noticing.</p>
<p>Shin was now about 10 mels under the guardian’s chin. For the monster, it was a complete blind spot.</p>
<p>“(I’m going to attack too. Please keep it busy a little more)”</p>
<p>“(Understood.)”</p>
<p>Shin was reminded of how adult-like Yuzuha’s original voice sounded, while he held</p>
<p>『Moonless』 with the opposite hand.</p>
<p>He aimed at the guardian’s jaws and activated a skill.</p>
<p>Katana and Darkness combination skill 【Hollow Shackles】.</p>
<p>Shin threw『Moonless』, wrapped in a dark aura, with all his might. The katana turned into a pitch black flash and stabbed the monster’s jaw, without being hindered by its scales, then released its effects.</p>
<p>“■■■■!!■■■■!!!”</p>
<p>Forced to face upwards because of 『Moonless』’s stabbing impact, the Guardian’s head was wrapped tightly by black bands extending from the katana.</p>
<p>The black bands covered most of the monster’s head, then gained even more momentum and proceeded to wrap around the Guardian’s entire body.</p>
<p>The monster tried resisting, but Shin’s boosted stats had also reinforced the bands’ binding power.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Guardian couldn’t tear through the bands fast enough: new ones would be generated and tie it down again before it could gain any freedom. It was impossible to completely seal the monster’s movements, but now the Guardian couldn’t move as freely as before.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha! Maximum firepower!”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me!”</p>
<p>In response to Shin’s words, a globe of golden light formed in Yuzuha’s mouth.</p>
<p>Shin cast a magic spell alongside her.</p>
<p>Globes containing magic power of each of the seven elements appeared around Shin. Red, blue, brown, green, yellow, white, black: all seven spheres were around one mel wide.</p>
<p>Shin then extended his right arm forward and all globes gathered in one spot. The seven globes fused together and started glowing in the same golden color as Yuzuha’s.</p>
<p>Hepta-Elemental Composite Skill 【Elemental Order】 .</p>
<p>The two-mels golden sphere, capable of striking the weak point of all elements, merged with Yuzuha’s breath, a unique skill named 【Supreme Catastrophe】, and pierced the Guardian’s head.</p>
<p>“Off with you!”</p>
<p>Shin and Yuzuha kept releasing their skills, while changing their directions. The golden spheres of light moved from the monster’s head to its torso, tearing through its body.</p>
<p>Blue vapor was released from the monster’s severed torso, but that too was consumed by the golden light and disappeared.</p>
<p>“We destroyed all we could see, but…”</p>
<p>The opponent was capable of regenerating its head. For added safety, Shin and Yuzuha cautiously studied their surroundings.</p>
<p>“Shin!”</p>
<p>As they were doing so, Schnee and the others approached them. The barrier that had been blocking them had disappeared apparently.</p>
<p>“Sorry for making you worry.”</p>
<p>“No..if you are all right, then it’s enough.”</p>
<p>Relieved, Schnee put a hand on her chest.</p>
<p>“So, what are we going to do now? Differently from outside, there’s no miasma in here.”</p>
<p>“Ishkar’s transformation was bizarre as well. It wasn’t supposed to have regenerative abilities like that.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid voiced their doubts, while looking at the space where the recently disappeared Ishkar used to be.</p>
<p>“It turns out there was something else inside it. The name displayed was Boundary Guardian.”</p>
<p>“Never heard that name before.”</p>
<p>All members present nodded to Schnee’s words. Yuzuha — still in her adult form — also said that she didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>“What could have happened here…? It looks like I changed too…it could be tied to the reason why I was brought here.”</p>
<p>Ishkar had mentioned a “return against your will”. It could mean that, had Shin not resisted, he could have returned to his original world.</p>
<p>It was just a possibility, so he had no intention of trying. More than that, Shin was intrigued by the word “Boundary”.</p>
<p>The real world and the game world. Maybe it was guarding the boundary between the two?</p>
<p>That would generate another series of questions, but being a game’s world, it was not too strange for such a creature to exist.</p>
<p>Supposing that the players dead in the other world lived here. That normally, the boundary could not be crossed without dying, but Shin had crossed over without dying…</p>
<p>(Could it have had a reason for wanting to get rid of me?)</p>
<p>To go all the way of taking over Ishkar’s body to attack me…could maybe mean that I can be the cause of some disaster? Or maybe it was just trying to remove an extraneous object?</p>
<p>“….I just don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Shin sighed while looking at the space Ishkar used to occupy. He pondered for a while, but in the end it was all his imagination, his delusions. He had no idea about how things could actually be.</p>
<p>“Shin, look.”</p>
<p>“….the stopgap keeping miasma in check is gone, so it’s flowing out?”</p>
<p>Shin looked in the direction Tiera pointed at and saw a black mist appearing in the previously empty space. In its center there was a sort of rectangular object.</p>
<p>Because of the mist only its silhouette was visible, but it was just as Shin remembered.</p>
<p>After defeating Ishkar, the certificate proving victory over a level 1000 monster, materials, gear, and other item cards appeared. Apparently, most of the miasma was housed by these items.</p>
<p>“Tiera, please.”</p>
<p>“Yes, leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Shin and the others kept the miasma from spreading, while Tiera purified the main mass. Maybe because the Guardian was gone, the miasma vanished with an ease that surprised even Tiera.</p>
<p>“Eh? This is…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Tiera looked at the stack of purified item cards. The illustration on the top card made her react, surprised.</p>
<p>Shin became curious and took a peek in Tiera’s hands. The top card of the stack had the picture of a crystal glowing in rainbow colors.</p>
<p>The item name was 『Divine Beast Crystal』.</p>
<p>“Seriously…? This is the item that lets you summon a divine beast!”</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Monsters called divine beasts, like Element Tails and Gruefagos, could not be tamed normally. But with the item that Tiera was now holding, the Divine Beast Crystal, they could be called temporarily as an ally unit.</p>
<p>Divine Beast Crystals appeared as rare drops after defeating divine beasts and allowed the summon of a monster just like the defeated one as an ally.</p>
<p>It was a one-time use item, but if used against boss monsters as a trump card, it was powerful enough to change the flow of battle.</p>
<p>Depending on the monsters they could summon, Divine Beast Crystals could have the same value as Ancient-grade equipment.</p>
<p>“…hey, if I use this, won’t Ishkar be able to resurrect?”</p>
<p>“Summoned monsters usually disappear after a set time…I wonder, though. In this battle against Ishkar some unknown force interfered after all.”</p>
<p>No one knew what could happen to this area of the sea, were Ishkar to disappear. The sea dragon’s resurrection would be the most favorable outcome.</p>
<p>“Do try. If I can use my power on it, I shall lend you my aid.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Your power hasn’t returned completely, has it?”</p>
<p>“That is of no concern. The absence of this area’s master is a much more pressing matter.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, who did not know how long she could keep her current form, urged Shin to use the item, so he agreed to.</p>
<p>“….come.”</p>
<p>Tiera held the Divine Beast Crystal high and pronounced the keyword. The crystal then shattered, emanating a rainbow light.</p>
<p>The light gradually took shape: after five seconds, it had formed Ishkar’s silhouette. When the light eventually disappeared, before the group was Ishkar, looking exactly the same as when they had entered the room.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see.”</p>
<p>The summoned Ishkar did nothing, simply floating in place. It was waiting for orders from its summoner.</p>
<p>“Do you think you can do anything?”</p>
<p>“Be patient for a while.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha then extended one of her nine tails towards Ishkar. She placed the tip of the tail on the dragon’s jaw, then stopped.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, Ishkar and Yuzuha’s bodies started glowing. They continued to do so for about 10 seconds, then the light dimmed and disappeared.</p>
<p>“This shall be enough.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha then changed back to small fox mode. She still had nine tails though.</p>
<p>“I’m slightly tired. Hold me.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ah, sure. Thanks.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha floated lightly in the water and cuddled up in Shin’s bosom. Her small fox face looked somewhat satisfied.</p>
<p>“It appears you have won”</p>
<p>Just as the group relaxed a little, Ishkar’s voice reached their ears.</p>
<p>“Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“That maiden used my soul’s crystal. Would you understand if I said ‘back-up’?”</p>
<p>“Well, I would have never expected a divine beast to say ‘backup’…”</p>
<p>“It’s just a fragment embedded in my memories. Now that the Ley Lines are free of contamination, my servants above should quiet down too. You have my gratitude.”</p>
<p>Ishkar had already taken care of the Three Sea Beasts apparently. The merpeople and fishpeople were not in immediate danger anymore at least.</p>
<p>“I wish to express my gratitude, but that fox has already taken away part of my power. I cannot do much.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Yuzuha! What tricks are you pulling, taking advantage of a situation like this?”</p>
<p>“I made it possible for him to stay here and connected him to the Ley Lines. As you know, the Ley Line was already shut where I used to be. Let me have that much.”</p>
<p>The power that Yuzuha took from Ishkar would return over time, so Ishkar did not want to seriously find fault with her.</p>
<p>“Well, we didn’t come here looking for something anyway, and it looks like Yuzuha got closer to returning to her original form, so that’d be enough for me.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at Schnee and the others, but they all shared the same sentiment.</p>
<p>“Just one thing, then. Do you know anything about whatever possessed you?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…I remember that you were its target. That its objective was to remove you from this world. Only these two things.”</p>
<p>“For what reason?”</p>
<p>“I could not say. But it was something that even miasma cannot affect. It wiped the miasma I was holding in check as if it was mere smoke.”</p>
<p>An existence superior to miasma. Shin had no idea what it could be, nor did Schnee and the others, who all shook their heads.</p>
<p>“It was an utterly unknown existence. Do be on your guard.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I got it.”</p>
<p>Shin finished talking with Ishkar. As Yuzuha had turned back too, they left the royal chambers.</p>
<p>Events other than their initial goal of helping the merpeople had happened, but Shin thought that, all in all, the result was positive. He could not be sure, but he felt that the power within him was not something negative either.</p>
<p>The party proceeded through the now miasma-free corridors.</p>
<p>Ishkar had resurrected, the merpeople and fishpeople avoided destruction.</p>
<p>Tiera and Yuzuha powered up, the party’s overall power increased.</p>
<p>Not all results were to rejoice about, though. Something had definitely been proved in the battle against the Guardian.</p>
<p>Those stopped by the barrier, and those allowed in by the barrier. Their hearts were clearly divided.</p>
<p>Schnee’s heart, especially, was riddled with thousands of small ripples.</p>
<p>With each member holding different thoughts in their hearts, the party left the dungeon.</p>
<p>At the same time as Shin concluded his battle against Ishkar, one man arrived in Barbatos.</p>
<p>At the moment no one knew, naturally, that he would bring a great trial to Schnee…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 1 – Part 1</p>
<p>Shin’s party had ventured into the Kuwain marine area to search for the second Assault Ship Celciutos, one of Rokuten’s guild houses.</p>
<p>The group managed to find the guildhouse, but found that miasma had transformed the surrounding seas into an extremely dangerous area.</p>
<p>Shin’s party discovered that the cause lay in the underwater dungeon “Castle of the Depths.” They hurried into the dungeon and fought against the miasma-corrupted Sea King Dragon Ishkar, ultimately achieving victory…</p>
<p>After the battle against Ishkar, the group returned to the entrance of the dungeon. The group’s adventure had experienced several unexpected events, so, as soon as they materialized their magic-powered vessel and rode in, they decided to take a rest.</p>
<p>Maybe adrenaline existed in the new world too: when the group left the “Castle of the Depths”, their tension was replaced by fatigue.</p>
<p>After each member had taken a shower, they retreated to their respective quarters for some rest: they decided to leave the Kuwain matter to its own devices.</p>
<p>“Nh…nnh…nnhg..?”</p>
<p>How long had he been sleeping?</p>
<p>Shin woke up, puzzled by the sensation of someone hugging him.</p>
<p>“Ah, Yuzuha.”</p>
<p>Looking at the ceiling, Shin remembered that sometimes Yuzuha would come sleep with him. She used to lie on top of him, maybe to look at his sleeping face.</p>
<p>He mumbled “you again?”, and then tried to move Yuzuha away. He then noticed.</p>
<p>The presence of something terribly soft pressing on his stomach.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t Yuzuha. This was Shin’s conclusion, in the utter silence of the room.</p>
<p>His senses remembered his partner’s weight. Yuzuha had grown, but she should still have some childish features left. Shin’s senses told him that the body now on him was different from Yuzuha’s. It was wearing a tracksuit as pajamas, so it was easy to tell.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, the soft, freely shapeshifting twin mounds that clearly made their presence felt against Shin’s body were definitely not Yuzuha’s.</p>
<p>“Hnn?”</p>
<p>Shin turned his neck, trying to raise his head as much as possible. He looked towards his lower body and could see the head of the person now lying on top of him.</p>
<p>The room was dark, but thanks to 【Night Vision】 he could clearly tell the hair color of his “guest”.</p>
<p>Fluffy-looking silver hair, pointy fox ears. Shoulders poking out of fur. The first two were Yuzuha’s characteristics, as Shin remembered.</p>
<p>——【Yuzuha level 871 Element Tail】</p>
<p>“Wait a second, how much power did you absorb back there…?”</p>
<p>Before fighting Ishkar, Yuzuha was still below level 700. Yet now, she was closer to 900.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know exactly how much power Yuzuha had taken from Ishkar, but it had to be a considerable amount.</p>
<p>“You’ve grown even more than last time.”</p>
<p>Her appearance had changed from a 6th-8th grader to a high school student. Shin couldn’t see her whole silhouette yet, but her current weight made him think so.</p>
<p>He looked at the clock: he had slept for about two hours, as it was almost 1 PM.</p>
<p>He didn’t feel physically tired, so Shin decided that he might as well get out of bed and tried to wake Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yuzuha. Wake up.”</p>
<p>“Mmh…”</p>
<p>“Hey, you heard me.”</p>
<p>“Just five more minutes…”</p>
<p>Shin shook Yuzuha’s body through the covers, just to hear a classic reply.</p>
<p>“If you’re tired, you can rest some more, but get off me first.”</p>
<p>“Just five more minutes…let me enjoy this..”</p>
<p>“Enjoy what!? You’re awake, aren’t you!?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha surprised Shin with a completely unexpected line. He looked at Yuzuha rubbing her head on his chest, reflecting that her personality must have changed again.</p>
<p>“…you got me.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>She probably realized that she couldn’t continue like that. Yuzuha pulled herself up and the blanket fell off, revealing her body.</p>
<p>It was completely different from two hours ago. Shin covered his eyes as not to see her very feminine curves.</p>
<p>“Wear something, now.”</p>
<p>“Want to enjoy?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Still completely naked, Yuzuha asked the question to Shin while sitting near his thighs.</p>
<p>While she was as expressionless as before, that was due to her inability to express emotion. However, now she belonged to the completely relaxed or unimpressed category.</p>
<p>Shin looked at Yuzuha between his fingers and saw her there, not attempting to cover her naked body at all, tilting her head at him. She did not seem to have any sense of shame.</p>
<p>“Yet another weird personality…how did you become like this?”</p>
<p>“There have always been several personality patterns within me…the personality you all know is the total sum of the characters housed inside me. Even as I am now, I am still one side of the being known as Yuzuha. Ultimately, I will become like the complete form you already know.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha said all of this with a lazy tone, then fell again on top of Shin.</p>
<p>Shin stopped her fall as well as he could, and Yuzuha’s budding breasts ended up right in front of his eyes. Despite his will, he ended up in an embrace with Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“Why did you fall on top of me again…”</p>
<p>“I get tired if I talk a lot.”</p>
<p>That was probably the truth. Her tone of voice clearly showed how tired she was.</p>
<p>“That’s one amazing reason…anyway, putting that aside, get off me. And wear something already.”</p>
<p>The situation could be easily misunderstood by anyone, so Shin prodded her more strongly.</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell how she would react, as her personality had changed, but if she persisted he would have to move her by force.</p>
<p>“…that’s not nice.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha probably guessed what Shin was thinking, because she finally got off him.</p>
<p>While he was raising his body, Yuzuha went to a corner of the room and turned on the light device.</p>
<p>“Wear something first.”</p>
<p>Shin covered his eyes again and scolded Yuzuha. Even with the room fully lit, she made no attempt to conceal her body. Every part was completely visible.</p>
<p>“If it’s Shin, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha stood proudly, puffing her chest out without restraint. Shin could swear he heard a bounce-like noise.</p>
<p>“What are you acting smug for!”</p>
<p>Shin, always making sure not to look at her, picked up an item card near the bed.</p>
<p>“Here, your usual clothes.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, but something sexier would be nice too, no?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha replied, the priestess clothing Shin gave her in hand.</p>
<p>“Stop being silly.”</p>
<p>“Aw.”</p>
<p>Shin, making sure only to look at Yuzuha’s face, gave her a light chop on the head and left the room.</p>
<p>There were priestess clothes with more skin exposure, as Yuzuha hinted, but Shin had no intention of having her wear anything like that.</p>
<p>In terms of stats, there were plenty superior options. But with Yuzuha’s stats, while she couldn’t take a Ishkar-class enemy on her own, she generally wouldn’t have any trouble as she was now.</p>
<p>The situation was different from Tiera, who had to wear certain outfits to boost her stats.</p>
<p>If he had Yuzuha wear a skimpy priestess outfit, Shin knew that Schnee and the others would look at him in a way he couldn’t bear for long.</p>
<p>Shin’s train of thought reached this point and he sighed again.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait.”</p>
<p>“Good, you wore it.”</p>
<p>Shin voiced his surprise, as he didn’t expect Yuzuha to really wear the outfit properly, which prompted a question from Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“…should I wear it more loosely?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s hand headed towards her chest area, all too naturally, but Shin grabbed it midway. It was easy enough to guess what she was going to do.</p>
<p>“Not at all…more than that, you remember what happened before now, right? The others must be up too, let’s go to the kitchen. If you still feel tired, you can just go back to sleep.”</p>
<p>“My body will get used to it soon enough.”</p>
<p>Her strength had returned, but apparently her body hadn’t adjusted to it yet. Her fatigue, however, was mostly gone. For an instant, Shin thought about asking her why she said she was tired just moments ago.</p>
<p>“Anyway, don’t act like that when Schnee and the others are around.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. My services are for Shin and Shin only.”</p>
<p>“….what did I do to deserve this…”</p>
<p>Shin sighed yet again because of Yuzuha’s radical change.</p>
<p>He could tell from their presences that Schnee and the others already started moving inside the vessel. Shin warned Yuzuha again, then started walking.</p>
<p>“Oh, Shin you’re awa….who is that?”</p>
<p>Shin and Yuzuha entered the room and Filma greeted them, although she stopped when she saw Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“It’s Yuzuha, she gained power from Ishkar and grew up.”</p>
<p>“…hello.”</p>
<p>“Hey there. I felt Yuzuha’s presence all right, but she sure changed a lot. I was surprised.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had changed quite a lot, so Shin understood well what Filma meant.</p>
<p>“Shin, you’re up. Hm? Oh, it’s Yuzuha. You sure got bigger.”</p>
<p>Shibaid, who was helping in setting the table, came closer. He could tell it was Yuzuha right away and acted very much like an uncle.</p>
<p>“You caught on quick.”</p>
<p>“For me, Human and Beast children, just like Yuzuha here, grow up really fast. So my eyes got pretty good at that. Well, I’m just used to it.”</p>
<p>“You got a nifty new ability while I was sleeping.”</p>
<p>Shibaid said it like it was nothing, provoking a wide-eyed reaction from Filma, who then turned again towards Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“Your atmosphere sure changed a lot too, huh?”</p>
<p>“Relaxing type, I guess? I’ll go back to small fox mode later though.”</p>
<p>“Oh really?”</p>
<p>“So Shin won’t scold me even if I stick to him.”</p>
<p>“Well, honest aren’t we?”</p>
<p>Filma smiled at Yuzuha’s clear and concise words. A smile that surely concealed nasty plotting.</p>
<p>“So only Tiera is still asleep.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, we do not know how taxing miasma purification can be. We only prepared the food. Instead, shouldn’t you stop them?”</p>
<p>Shin tried to pretend not to hear what Filma and Yuzuha were talking about, but Shibaid pointed it out.</p>
<p>“Even if they’re plotting something, they won’t stop even if I say anything…”</p>
<p>“Yuzuha seems to have changed a lot, but she’s always liked you, Shin.”</p>
<p>“I won’t deny that, but I don’t think what she feels is what we call love or a crush…”</p>
<p>Thanks to Marino’s existence, Shin felt the difference in what Yuzuha expressed towards him.</p>
<p>When she looked like a child, it was fine just saying that she was attached to him, but that didn’t work anymore. Even so, it was different from the affection that Marino or Schnee had shown towards him.</p>
<p>“How can I explain, it’s like a mix of affection towards a parent and a friend. That’s how I see it at least.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, if so, there’s non-romantic affection within. The Element Tails I saw in the past tested, trained, and treated humans with affection.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered the Element Tails in the game era and nodded.</p>
<p>Personality changes with growth. He had to decide how to handle her.</p>
<p>“Well, guess I’ll wait and see for now.”</p>
<p>As Shin said so, Tiera and Kagerou entered the room.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m the last one?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re up. We just finished preparing the meal.”</p>
<p>The timing was just right, so the party started eating.</p>
<p>“By the way, Shin. What are you going to do about Celciutos, since now the merfolk are using it as their home?”</p>
<p>After the meal, Schnee mentioned a doubt that resurfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>That magic-powered vessel was not Shin’s guildhouse, but at present the only Rokuten member in the new world was Shin. Schnee’s expression indicated that he should be the one to own the ship.</p>
<p>“We can’t leave it like that…personally, I’d entrust it to Zazie and the others.”</p>
<p>Celciutos was their master, Cook’s guildhouse, so Shin would like them to manage it.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be difficult to set a teleportation point from Shigureya to Celciutos. For the merfolk, we could set up a barrier and a substitute housing.”</p>
<p>“Would they accept it?”</p>
<p>“They’ll have to. It won’t be easy for them to agree, since they’ve lived there for a long time, but it’s too dangerous to just leave it there as a safe place to live. We’ll give a quick look if there aren’t any immediate problems, but then I plan to have Raster come.”</p>
<p>Celciutos had already been used for more than 500 years, without any maintenance. The residents only used the undamaged sections, but if they somehow accessed the armory or stockroom, there could be trouble.</p>
<p>Celciutos, like Reed’s third Moving Base Miraltrea and Cashmere’s sixth Sky Castle Rashugum, was a guildhouse designed for combat. If it malfunctioned, it could bring about unimaginable damage.</p>
<p>That was one more reason why Shin didn’t want to leave things as they were.</p>
<p>“Is that so dangerous?”</p>
<p>“Fantasy weapons are sometimes even more lethal than real ones…more than that, I’m having a hard time piloting, so would you mind getting off my lap?”</p>
<p>Shin moved the small fox-mode Yuzuha to his shoulder and returned to looking into the distance.</p>
<p>Real life battleships couldn’t shoot explosive ammo from rapid-fire weapons like gatling guns, nor did they have any barriers equipped. They couldn’t neutralize torpedoes by themselves either.</p>
<p>Thanks to the technology provided by the supernatural power called magic, they could only be called supernatural weapons.</p>
<p>“The ship we’re boarding now too could be pretty dangerous with the right equipment. Come on, Yuzuha, here. Or Schnee’s thunder’s going to strike soon.”</p>
<p>“Kuu? …shame.”</p>
<p>“Filma? What do you think I am?”</p>
<p>Filma and Yuzuha backed away from Shin, as to escape from Schnee’s look. They had suddenly become very friendly, for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>“So she’s….”</p>
<p>Schnee whispered a question to Shin.</p>
<p>“…changed, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s just learned to show affection, I think.”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty different from what Filma and Shibaid said.”</p>
<p>Schnee seemed to understand how Yuzuha felt.</p>
<p>“We’re alike, that’s all. All I can tell is what concerns you though.”</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>
<p>Shin stuttered in response of Schnee’s confident reply. He still wasn’t fully decided about many things, so he was almost envious of Schnee’s confidence.</p>
<p>As they were talking, the surroundings of the ship grew gradually brighter: they were closer to the sea surface. As they proceeded upwards, merfolk and fishpeople gathered around the ship. Among them there was also the adventurers’ guild receptionist, the mermaid Arno.</p>
<p>Shin’s group waved at her with a smile and she waved back, relieved.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see you’ve returned safely!”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’d like to tell you what happened, so could you call Lierno and the others in the room we talked in before?”</p>
<p>“Understood, I will make preparations right away.”</p>
<p>The group got down from the ship and headed towards Celciutos, surrounded by many merpeople and fishpeople, who had probably been waiting for the group to return. Zazie and the others quickly joined them.</p>
<p>The group arrived in the room at the same time as Lierno and the other people involved in decision-making for the merpeople and fishpeople.</p>
<p>“Well, let us report the results of our exploration of the Seafloor Sanctuary…which actually was the Castle of the Depths.”</p>
<p>“….please.”</p>
<p>Shin heard the sound of someone swallowing their breath. Some looked expectant, others doubtful, others again looked uneasy: all sorts of expressions decorated the faces of the people present.</p>
<p>“Ishkar had been corrupted by miasma. We have purified it however, and now it should be nearly restored to normal. We have also been assured that the Three Sea Beasts should calm down too. I believe that the monsters will quiet down as well.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Is that the truth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ishkar told us itself, so there should not be any mistakes.”</p>
<p>“Oh my…you have spoken with Ishkar directly?”</p>
<p>Most members looked terribly surprised that Shin managed to exchange words with a divine beast. For this world’s inhabitants, divine beasts were truly special beings.</p>
<p>“We shall never forget the gratitude we owe you. If you are ever in need of our assistance, please say so anytime.”</p>
<p>“Well…about that, we do have a request now, something we’d like you to do, actually.”</p>
<p>When Lierno and the others raised their heads, Shin explained about moving out of Celciutos, setting up another barrier and moving to a new settlement.</p>
<p>Lierno and the others seemed confused and apprehensive at first, but as Shin continued talking, they became surprised by the fact that he would go so far for them.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you to get out after all, so the least I can do is to provide you with a new place to live.”</p>
<p>“No, we have been borrowing this place after all…as long as the seas are safe, we can live even without Celciutos. It will be more than enough if you could just set up a barrier.”</p>
<p>Originally, fishpeople and merpeople did not build houses, but lived in caves, a lifestyle suited for underwater creatures.</p>
<p>The sea inhabitants here, however, had lived on Celciutos since they were born: they were probably very attached to it.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking that since he was asking them to leave such a place, he should give all the support he could.</p>
<p>Lierno looked extremely apologetic while listening to Shin’s proposal. After some moments of silence, he nodded.</p>
<p>“…understood. If you say you will do so much for us, we cannot reject your kindness. As you say, for me and everyone born here, Celciutos is a place of guaranteed safety, our hearts’ pillar.”</p>
<p>In this world, living alongside monsters brought with it an always present danger. Even in cities or villages, one never knew when there was going to be a monster attack, and underwater settlements were no exception. That was the reason why Celciutos, equipped with a barrier that even high-level monsters couldn’t break through, was treasured by all who lived on it.</p>
<p>“I was concerned about what could happen while we moved to Barbatos, but thanks to you there’s nothing to worry about, sir Shin.”</p>
<p>“You will move, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Our numbers have decreased, you see. If we start moving in small numbers, I do not think there will be any risk of needless friction arising.”</p>
<p>While the decision did not appear to be final, the other members did not express any objections.</p>
<p>There was also the proposal of erecting a memorial monument in the spot where Shin would create the barrier. Lierno added that they would deal with all the details after Jesta’s funeral ceremony was over.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 1 – Part 2</p>
<p>“For now, I plan to move it to some place where it won’t stand out and have Raster perform maintenance.”</p>
<p>After changing locations, Shin talked with Zazie and her group about what he planned to do with Celciutos. They had not discussed this topic during the talk with Lierno and the other leaders.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, I know this is a difficult request, but allow me to ask. I would like you to leave Celciutos to us.”</p>
<p>Zazie mentioned the matter of managing Celciutos before Shin brought it up. In terms of administration hierarchy, Shin was above Zazie and the other former support characters. If Shin didn’t allow it, they could not even move Celciutos.</p>
<p>Standing behind Zazie, the other support characters — Lapwing, Bell, and Shell — watched Shin with a pleading expression.</p>
<p>“Rest easy, I planned to leave it to you from the start. This is Cook’s guildhouse after all, and I’m sure you wouldn’t do anything weird with it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Zazie lowered her head, her serious expression still on her face. Lapwing and the other two followed suit.</p>
<p>With Shin’s authorization, they would be able to pilot Celciutos now. First of all they wanted to make it possible to come and go between Shigureya and Celciutos, so the four went to the operation room.</p>
<p>“OK, I’m going to give Celciutos a general check-up then. What are you going to do, everybody?”</p>
<p>“I do not possess any skills about such technology or maintenance, thus I will go assist with the preparations for Jesta’s funerals.”</p>
<p>“Same as Shibaid, I’m just no good with creation-type skills.”</p>
<p>Shibaid and Filma replied in similar ways to Shin’s question.</p>
<p>Girard was the same too: Shin’s front-line support characters were specialized in combat, so they had not acquired enough techniques related to creating things to be useful.</p>
<p>Because of their jobs, they could perform simple disassembling and cooking, but they couldn’t do anything in terms of maintenance of a large ship like Celciutos.</p>
<p>“I’ll go help with the funeral too.”</p>
<p>Tiera likewise said she would go with Shibaid and Filma. Her abilities as a priestess had returned, so she could probably be useful there, she said.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay and help Shin.”</p>
<p>Schnee would assist Shin instead, using her knowledge of alchemy.</p>
<p>“Kuu, I want to watch.”</p>
<p>Still in fox mode, Yuzuha rode on Shin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Okay, it’s decided then.”</p>
<p>Shin headed to Celciutos’ engine room, with Schnee and Yuzuha. If he wanted to move Celciutos, that was the first location to check.</p>
<p>The ship’s engine room was built using a combination of blacksmithing, alchemy, and magic. Shin and Hecate had created it together, so he knew how it worked and how to perform maintenance on it.</p>
<p>“It’s as amazing as I remembered.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, so much magic power.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group passed through several rooms, finally reaching the room beyond Celciutos’ engine room, where the ship’s power source was held.</p>
<p>The 3-mel wide transparent, round container in the room was supported above and below by four mechanical arms. Inside the container was an off-white light, which would sometimes show glimpses of aurora-like lights.</p>
<p>“No changes in color, and it doesn’t look damaged either.”</p>
<p>Drawing on all of his knowledge from the game, Shin inspected every part of the room. The guildhouse’s engine room was normally maintenance-free, but after 500 years of neglect due to abandonment, something could have gone wrong. Shin told Schnee to let him know if she found anything concerning, then resumed his inspection.</p>
<p>“Strange, light.”</p>
<p>“Because we used a large ‘Drop of Erathem’. It created a semi-permanent engine, or at least that’s what we called it. We haven’t actually tested it though.”</p>
<p>The light emitted by the power source glowed gently and did not hurt the eyes, even if looked at directly. Also, because of the seven-colored lights that sometimes appeared within it, no one would have guessed that it was Celciutos’ giant power source.</p>
<p>Yuzuha seemed to have grown fond of it, and watched it intently, full of childish wonder.</p>
<p>“Ok, no problem here. Onto the next, come on Yuzuha.”</p>
<p>Confirming that there were no irregularities, Shin quickly finished the check-up of every part of the room. Some parts needed changing or maintenance: he took care of parts where specialized knowledge or techniques were needed and let Schnee take care of the rest.</p>
<p>After completing the maintenance Shin went back outside. In a square-like open space he found a pile of 2-mel long wooden logs stacked on top of each other to form a hexagon-shaped structure. He was first reminded of a campfire, but then he saw harpoons and decorations around the structure and realized that it was something ritualistic.</p>
<p>Shin asked the fishman Marshill, who happened to be nearby, about the structure. The wooden structure would be burnt alongside the deceased, to return the soul to the heavens and the body to the sea. It was the same as the Barbatos ritual, which Zazie had talked about.</p>
<p>“The funeral will be held tomorrow. If there is something you want to burn with the deceased, please let me know.”</p>
<p>Things dear to the deceased or things they liked, provided they were flammable, would be burnt with the body, to send them off together.</p>
<p>Shin replied that Zazie or Lapwing would know more about that than him, and Marshill replied that he had already told them about it.</p>
<p>The next day, under a clear blue sky, the funeral ceremony started in a very serious and formal tone.</p>
<p>Before the vividly burning flames, Lierno and Arno, wearing what looked like tribal clothing, chanted words Shin’s group could not understand. They couldn’t understand the meaning, but could somehow feel that the chant was praying for those passing into the otherworld.</p>
<p>Perhaps the timing had been calculated, but, as soon as Lierno and Arno finished chanting, the burning logs crumbled. Tiera, who had been standing next to them, splashed water on the embers.</p>
<p>The fire went out, producing billows of white smoke, which all present gazed at as it rose towards the sky.</p>
<p>After a while, the smoke vanished and Lierno and Arno cast a spell. The water created by their magic surrounded the remains and transported them to the sea.</p>
<p>As the ashes melted away in the seawater, the charred logs sank to the bottom.</p>
<p>With some final words by Lierno, the funeral ceremony was concluded.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“I will move Celciutos, then build a settlement in its former space, okay?”</p>
<p>After Jesta’s funeral, Shin went to move Celciutos right away.</p>
<p>As Shin would provide a new barrier and settlement, there was almost no objection about taking Celciutos from its inhabitants.</p>
<p>“I expected more people to protest though.”</p>
<p>“No one here would dare protest to a High Human’s words. Everyone knows that Marshill could barely fight against you too.”</p>
<p>“Ah…was I maybe too violent?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, I think it was a good thing that everyone witnessed your strength. Marshill is by far the strongest of our tribe: seeing him overwhelmed like that, everyone will have to just accept the reality. No matter how fond they are of Celciutos, they surely understood how terrifying it would be to have its legitimate owner as an enemy.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? You make it sound like I’m threatening you…”</p>
<p>Shin had no such intention, but the way Arno spoke, it appeared like he was trying to strong-arm Celciutos from them. In their first encounter with Marshill, the atmosphere had gotten rather tense, so it would be difficult to deny it completely.</p>
<p>“That’s the best way to convince those who would oppose without an actual reason. Celciutos was something we had borrowed. In effect, we have been enjoying all the advantages it offers very one-sidedly. Many have forgotten this, however, so I believe that even a harsh reminder could be necessary. If the owner says to give it back, it must be done. The immediate danger we have been facing has been solved too: to repay such kindness with spite would be simply unthinkable!”</p>
<p>Arno maintained that the situation was improving from before: there was no risk of the merpeople and fishpeople losing everything with Celciutos gone, as Marshill had said before. Shin offered to create a new barrier and a settlement, so what were they really unhappy with? Arno frowned.</p>
<p>There was also the fact that fishpeople and merpeople could not, in effect, do anything with Celciutos. Even if Jesta had entrusted them with it, they were only able to “watch over it” rather than actually “make use” of the ship.</p>
<p>The barrier itself was fueled by Celciutos’ magic power. In case the barrier was breached, Celciutos was set up to escape.</p>
<p>The barrier had been preserved without problems until now, so even if Jesta hadn’t met the merpeople, leaving it deserted, it would have probably managed to hold back the miasma until Shin’s group found it.</p>
<p>“Well, even if they understand it in their heads, their hearts might lead them to protest the change all the same.”</p>
<p>No matter how reasonable something might sound, emotions aren’t settled so easily: Shin had experienced this himself, so he thought that it was something inevitable.</p>
<p>On the bridge, Shin switched the engine from the current low-output mode, which maintained the barrier, self-purifying systems, and a few other functions, into the high-output mode for navigation.</p>
<p>Celciutos’ hull trembled slightly before starting its first voyage in 500 years.</p>
<p>After making sure that there were no merpeople or fishpeople in the surroundings, Shin moved Celciutos.</p>
<p>As the ship had been anchored to the surrounding rocks and coral, Shin pulled in the anchor, levitated Celciutos, and slowly moved towards the open sea. In sea stages, ships often got stuck on coral reefs, so game era ships, big and small alike, were equipped with short-duration levitation functions.</p>
<p>A ship of Ceciutos’ level could travel, levitating above land, for about an hour. They say that some players, after witnessing this feat, tried to build an airship.</p>
<p>“OK then, I’ll make the settlement first.”</p>
<p>Shin used his architect skills to start building prefab homes in the cleared space after moving Celciutos. He could have created more comfortable housing but, according to Lierno, it was more than enough. The fishpeople and merpeople, albeit slowly and gradually, would soon start move to Barbatos after all.</p>
<p>The former Celciutos residents were surprised to see the houses ready in less than 30 minutes, but no one expressed dissatisfaction. The reason was probably because they usually lived in water and would frequently move. They moved into the temporary houses with a speed that left Shin surprised too; Then he went to find a place to hide Celciutos.</p>
<p>“Looks like it can sail just fine, at least for now. Good thing only the cannons seem to have problems.”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled to himself while looking at a map of the Kuwain area and its surroundings on the ship’s bridge.</p>
<p>Since Shin and his party were around, it was not a problem even if Celciutos’ offensive equipment did not work: it would have been much worse if there was trouble with the engine or the power source. Jesta had chosen to keep the miasma sealed because he didn’t know if Celciutos’ reduced offensive power was enough to repel miasma-corrupted monsters, or so Shin guessed.</p>
<p>Celciutos was a powerful weapon, but — barring rare exceptions — it was only used offensively in battles between guilds.</p>
<p>In the game era, it was not possible to fight dungeon boss monsters like Ishkar with a guildhouse.</p>
<p>Now, however, things were different.</p>
<p>For example, when Shin faced the Skullface Lord in the Wraith Plains, it was possible for dungeons that were supposed to be underground to emerge above. The possibility of dungeon bosses appearing above ground was thus not zero.</p>
<p>If used effectively, Celciutos could even destroy Ishkar without giving it a chance to retaliate; at present, its main artillery — main cannon, sub cannons, etcetera — were not working, so in the worst case it could even sink.</p>
<p>Jesta probably considered all this when he decided to seal in the miasma.</p>
<p>“In this area, we could hide Celciutos…here, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin found a suitable location from the map saved in the database. There was a location with massive rocks jutting out of the sea surface. If the data was correct, they were large enough to hide Celciutos.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the location, they indeed found a group of large rocks towering over the sea. With a combination of building and Earth skills, Shin carved the rocks, reinforced them, and then hid Celciutos among them.</p>
<p>Shin also attached Crystal Stones, a barrier, and an illusion skill that camouflaged the barrier with its surrounding environment, thus hiding the rocks. In case anyone came dangerously close to it, Shin also placed a Crystal Stone with a magic attachment that drove away both monsters and people.</p>
<p>With Celciutos as its power source, the magic attachments could last semi-permanently.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, you have acquired many production-related skills other than blacksmithing ones, but have you never thought of mastering them?”</p>
<p>Zazie’s question came after the preparations for Celciutos’ concealment were completed. Just as she said, Shin could have raised one or two other skills, like building or farming, as high as blacksmithing.</p>
<p>“If you master blacksmithing, related skills like alchemy are also at rather high levels too though. It’s not like we never discussed it, but in general we never touched the skills other members were specialized in. Except if it was needed to perfect our own specialization.”</p>
<p>To be able to handle anything production-related was an attractive prospect, but to do the same thing as others was not at all.</p>
<p>It was a coincidence that all Rokuten members headed in different directions with their specializations, and also that all of them shared a dislike for doing the same thing as others.</p>
<p>Rokuten members had sometimes spoken to each other about it in casual conversation.</p>
<p>“Everyone also felt differently about to what extent they would perfect their skills. Since it’s related to blacksmithing, I did a lot of alchemy in my time, even though it was Hecate’s specialty. About Cook’s farming or Reed’s doll making, however, I might know something about it but my skills are beginner-level at best.”</p>
<p>Shin’s farming skill level for example was just II.</p>
<p>“Why did you ask that, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I was wondering if Rokuten members did not aspire to cover all aspects of creation, by cooperating with each other. I could never ask my master, you see.”</p>
<p>“….I see.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that Zazie would have surely wanted to ask Cook about something like that.</p>
<p>In the game, she couldn’t express her own will. For a support character, a better understanding of her master was surely a dream.</p>
<p>So thought Shin, who could now spend time with his support characters, like Schnee and Girard.</p>
<p>After hiding Celciutos and setting the teleportation point, Shin’s group rode the magic-powered vessel and returned to Barbatos.</p>
<p>They had told Zigma that they didn’t know when they would be back, so they used 【Hiding】 on the ship close to the port, then swam to land, with the ship safely stored in Shin’s item box.</p>
<p>They had concealed their presences when they reached land, so there was no risk of anyone seeing them and finding them suspicious.</p>
<p>Their first destination was Shigureya.</p>
<p>“Where do you want me to set it up?”</p>
<p>“There are a few rooms for the staff in the back. Let’s prepare a dedicated room.”</p>
<p>Guided by Lapwing, Shin arrived at a room in the back of the restaurant, which was also used as living space. Shin set up the teleport point and connected it to the one placed on Celciutos: now it was possible to freely move between Shigureya and the ship.</p>
<p>“Finally, let’s place a magic-powered lock on the door…there.”</p>
<p>Shin locked the room with the unique key he also used for Tsuki no Hokora’s storeroom, setting it so that only Shin himself and the support characters of Rokuten members could open it. No one else could enter the room this way.</p>
<p>“Thank you for doing so much for us.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, really. Besides, now I have one less weight on my shoulders too.”</p>
<p>Finding and securing the lost guildhouse had been quite the lucky happenstance. Shin’s group would also have had trouble managing Celciutos during their travels, so having Lapwing and the others take care of it was yet another stroke of good fortune.</p>
<p>The group had no intention of going anywhere that day, of course, so they had dinner at Shigureya and stayed in the inn they had used before departing.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>The next day, Shin’s group split up to do their own things.</p>
<p>Shin had to visit the guild and report about his actions in the Kuwain area, but the other members didn’t have any pressing matters to attend to.</p>
<p>Arno was supposed to have returned to the guild already: Shin had already arranged with her to report that they had not made any significant discoveries.</p>
<p>“If anything urgent happens, just send a message via Mind Chat.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin left the inn and went towards the guild, accompanied by Yuzuha who was half dozing on his shoulder.</p>
<p>He thought Schnee would have wanted to go as well, but unexpectedly said she wanted to go gather food for the journey.</p>
<p>The other three, Shibaid, Filma, and Tiera, said they would go train on Celciutos. Shibaid and Filma would act as instructors for Tiera’s combat training. The poor elf will probably be put through the wringer.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since I went out on my own.”</p>
<p>Shin realized that lately there was always someone else with him. Yuzuha was with him, but partner monsters were considered as one with their master, so he felt like he was acting on his own.</p>
<p>“So, Miss Arno, then.”</p>
<p>Shin arrived at the guild and looked for Arno at the reception.</p>
<p>“….she’s not around.”</p>
<p>He thought she used the teleport to return, but unexpectedly Arno wasn’t behind the reception counter. It would have been a pain to come again later, so Shin went to the closest open counter he saw. If his memory was correct, behind the counter was the female worker who was next to Arno when he first visited the guild. Animal-like ears poked from her semi-long brown hair, so she was highly likely a Beast.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I went to the Kuwain area, so I would like to make my report.”</p>
<p>“The Kuwain area? Oh, you must be from the group Arno was in charge of. She’s on leave today, so I will handle your report in her place.”</p>
<p>Shin followed the receptionist to a private room and gave his report as planned.</p>
<p>“I see, you have been to the shallow part of the Kuwain area. I can understand how you could return safe and sound. You didn’t notice anything else in particular?”</p>
<p>The receptionist nodded. The girl, who said her name was Mizet, had joined the guild at the same time as Arno and was apparently good friends with her.</p>
<p>“No, nothing in particular. The rain, wind, and waves were much fiercer than expected, so it was impossible to voyage further. It wouldn’t make sense to lose our lives just to risk that, so we came back.”</p>
<p>“A sound decision. By the way, I apologize for changing the topic, but did something happen to Arno?”</p>
<p>Shin asked what she meant: apparently, Arno had been strangely restless after checking Shin’s ship. Some receptionists were attracted by dangerous-looking adventurers, so they were worried that the same thing happened to Arno.</p>
<p>Shin said that nothing in particular had happened, and Mizet stared at him for several seconds. She probably realized that he was hiding something. Shin was thinking about how to get out of the situation, when Yuzuha cried.</p>
<p>“(I’m hungry)”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for boring your little friend. We haven’t got much information about the Kuwain area, so if you remember anything, we would be grateful if you reported again. If you ever go on another expedition you will need to submit the request again, so please be careful. If you don’t, the patrol ships will stop you.”</p>
<p>Only Shin could hear Yuzuha’s words: Mizet probably took her cry as meant to make Shin hurry up. She probably thought that Yuzuha was the small fox-type monster often kept as a pet.</p>
<p>“Just one more thing. Unrelated to the Kuwain area expedition, there is a request for you from the shipwright Zigma.”</p>
<p>“A request for me?”</p>
<p>Shin took a look at the request form, wondering why it was necessary to go through all the work of submitting a request specifically for him. The request was for Shin’s cooperation in building a new ship.</p>
<p>There was no mention of magic-powered vessels inside. Since the guild didn’t know the circumstances, it was probably viewed as a request for the adventurer to look for necessary parts.</p>
<p>However, Shin knew Zigma, and immediately understood that something else was being asked of him.</p>
<p>“Sir Zigma apparently vehemently insisted that this request be given to you when you came. I wonder what happened to him?”</p>
<p>“Zigma…”</p>
<p>Shin tried not to show it, but mentally wondered what had gotten over the shipwright.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I planned to go the shipyard later, so I’ll ask him directly. I’ll decide then whether to take the request or not.”</p>
<p>“Very well, please take the request form with you then. That is all, thank you for your time.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be on my way, then.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Mizet and left the guild. Thinking that he might find Schnee, he decided to pass through the market on his way back.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>While Shin was talking in the guild, Schnee was shopping alone in the market. She was using her usual illusion skill, so no one could find her true identity, but people would turn and look at her rather often. Schnee remembered that Shin once told her that she was beautiful even when transformed, and a small smile appeared on her lips.</p>
<p>That smile, however, did not last long.</p>
<p>“……sigh”</p>
<p>A sigh escaped her mouth. She had done her best not to show it in front of Shin. Because of that, whenever she was alone she would suddenly feel down. It had happened before, albeit very rarely. Lately, or to be precise, from the previous day, it happened much more frequently. The reason was clear: the barrier that had stopped her during the fight against Ishkar.</p>
<p>Tiera, Kagerou, and Yuzuha could go help Shin: Schnee could not break the barrier until Ishkar was defeated.</p>
<p>It was like trying to pierce through the earth itself, a barrier so sturdy that it was impossible to even think it could be broken through. Schnee could not do anything.</p>
<p>There was no way for her to be able to do something against a barrier that easily repelled even Shiden martial skills. There was also a high chance that similar barriers would separate her from Shin again. In such a case, she would not be counted among the members that could help Shin.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Schnee silently did her shopping, putting the items in the item box without being seen. She kept thinking throughout the process. However, her train of thought was elsewhere. There were also other things that she couldn’t help being concerned about.</p>
<p>Those were Ishkar’s words about an “undesired return”. They pointed to Shin’s return to the real world, did they not?</p>
<p>Shin must have realized that possibility too.</p>
<p>When she met him again in the Wraith Plains, Shin answered Schnee’s “Would you go back to your world if you could?” with a yes.</p>
<p>Not to rely too much on Ishkar’s words, but if they found a safe way for Shin to go back to his world, what would he choose to do?</p>
<p>“Shin has reasons to return.”</p>
<p>Marino’s last words. The family and friends left behind, all the other people connected to him.</p>
<p>The other side is Shin’s homeland, the place he belongs to. Schnee understood that his presence in this world was an irregularity.</p>
<p>“Does he have reasons to stay here…?”</p>
<p>…..yes.</p>
<p>So she was trying to say.</p>
<p>Shin has reasons to stay in this world. Something important enough to compare it with the other world.</p>
<p>I will be that reason. So she wanted to say.</p>
<p>Schnee’s mouth, however, could not pronounce those words. Only sighs escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“I…Shin, I…”</p>
<p>Like you. Very much.</p>
<p>I can say with confidence that I love you.</p>
<p>But what about you?</p>
<p>What do you think of me?</p>
<p>Schnee expressed her emotions clearly, but on the other hand Shin rarely expressed such things in words. Unfortunately enough, he often just laughed apologetically.</p>
<p>—-All you can do is to make him fall for you hard enough that he won’t feel like going back anymore.</p>
<p>Filma’s words troubled Schnee.</p>
<p>Her appearance was all decided by Shin. Judging from his initial reaction, it was clear that it was just as he idealized. His look going to her chest area couldn’t be her imagination either. Being shown affection by her shouldn’t be unpleasant for him.</p>
<p>The strategy Filma had proposed, half joking – to approach him asking him to take her – might succeed too. Even if it did though, would it be enough to hold Shin down?</p>
<p>In the game era, physical interactions with his lover, Marino, were limited by the system. In Schnee’s eyes, however, they truly loved each other.</p>
<p>The appearance of the physical body called avatar could be changed, apparently. It was not something you could rely on to decide whether opening your heart or not.</p>
<p>What connected them, however, was not the body but the heart. A deep place that could not be easily touched, that was where they truly sought each other.</p>
<p>Even if she offered him her body, even if her face was to his liking, her body was better, Schnee did not think it would be enough to keep Shin back.</p>
<p>“I…I’m…”</p>
<p>What do I want to do?</p>
<p>What do I want Shin to do?</p>
<p>I have more than enough wishes.</p>
<p>I wish for him to be happy.</p>
<p>I wish to see his smile.</p>
<p>I wish for him to hold me.</p>
<p>For him to kiss me.</p>
<p>I wish for him to look at me and me only.</p>
<p>To want me and me only.</p>
<p>Maybe they were more desires than wishes. But they were Schnee’s true feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe because she felt uneasy, the desire to have her loved one all for herself grew stronger. At the same time, she was reminded of Shin’s lover, Marino.</p>
<p>She wanted to be like her. That’s what Marino was to Schnee.</p>
<p>Schnee thought about Marino, who became Shin’s mutual lover. She thought, thought harder, finally understood.</p>
<p>The person closest to Marino was Tiera.</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Maybe Shin had also realized that, somewhere within Tiera, Marino’s shadow was present.</p>
<p>The kiss back at Black Priestess Shrine, the bypassed barrier during Ishkar’s fight. Something else that Schnee didn’t know about might have happened too. It probably did.</p>
<p>If Marino cooperated with Tiera, Shin’s heart could be led to her. Looking at Tiera, it was clear she didn’t dislike Shin, with or without Marino.</p>
<p>Whether she was aware of it or not, Tiera’s gaze went towards Shin as frequently as Schnee.</p>
<p>Schnee was aware enough of her surroundings to notice it.</p>
<p>“….what am I even thinking about now.”</p>
<p>Her train of thought had completely derailed, her thoughts scattered. Schnee realized it and sighed again.</p>
<p>She had probably been walking absorbed in her thoughts: before realizing it, she had arrived on top of a hill overlooking the city of Barbatos. It was probably set to be a place to enjoy the view from: there were some toys for children and benches.</p>
<p>“No one else is around though.”</p>
<p>A place with such a nice view, deserted before lunch time.</p>
<p>It was Schnee’s first time there, so she could not be completely sure, but it felt strange for no one else to be there at this time of the day. As she was wondering about the suspicious situation, she caught a presence heading towards the hill. Someone walking calmly. Schnee looked in that direction.</p>
<p>“Am I being watched?”</p>
<p>The person was probably using 【Through Sight】. Schnee clearly felt the unseen stranger’s gaze on her.</p>
<p>Schnee used 【Through Sight】 herself and looked at the mysterious observer.</p>
<p>“It can’t be…!?”</p>
<p>Schnee was surprised to see who was walking up the hill.</p>
<p>Gentlemanly clothing with dazzling decorations, white hair with a gold-rimmed silk hat. White gloves holding a stick, the appearance of a true gentleman.</p>
<p>A handsome looking face with an innocent, boyish smile. Schnee noticed, however, how his light brown eyes were not smiling at all.</p>
<p>Without disguising himself or paying any attention to the surroundings, the criminal wanted throughout the continent, Hameln was leisurely strolling up the hill.</p>
<p>As soon as Schnee realized the man’s identity, she sent a Mind Chat to Shin and the rest of the party.</p>
<p>“(I saw Hameln. We will come in contact soon.)”</p>
<p>Schnee also relayed the location to the surprised group. There were no monsters around, as far as she could see. If possible, she wanted to bring him down then and there.</p>
<p>She was concerned, however, about the reason why he would appear before her like that, in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Scouting jobs like Hunters and Ninjas were said to possess high ability in visual detection skills. Players had even performed various tests to see if there weren’t hidden stats based on race and job.</p>
<p>Using 【Through Sight】 with no other countermeasures on a Kunoichi -the female version of the Ninja- like Schnee was just like publicly displaying one’s location.</p>
<p>Hameln was surely aware of that: he must have been definitely plotting something.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you graciously waited for me. Surprising. I was sure you would ambush me, you see.”</p>
<p>Hameln affected surprise with his whole body.</p>
<p>Seeing through Schnee’s disguise like nothing was expected of a former player like Shin.</p>
<p>“You know well that it would be pointless, as I have captured your position. I’ll ask just in case, what is your aim?”</p>
<p>Schnee engaged Hameln in conversation to buy time until Shin and the others arrived. Shibaid and Filma would probably take some time, but Shin should arrive in a few minutes.</p>
<p>“My aim, you say. I suppose that would be you.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did come to this world too after all. I was thinking of testing something that has been bugging me, you see.”</p>
<p>Opposite to Hameln’s stick wielding left hand, a card appeared on his previously empty right hand.</p>
<p>As soon as she saw it, Schnee grabbed the hilt of her 『Blue Moon』 and put more distance between them.</p>
<p>Other than item cards, there were also offensive cards that sealed magic spells.</p>
<p>“Please, do not be wary of me, there is no need to worry. This is just a little trick, I have no intention of harming you. That would be ‘meaningless’.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s suspicion made Hameln’s smile deepen. He pointed the card towards Schnee.</p>
<p>As he did, the card disappeared and Schnee’s body started glowing.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Schnee noticed her body’s sudden glow and started moving even before thinking. She instantly dashed next to Hameln and swung her 『Blue Moon』 without hesitation.</p>

<p>“My, oh my, your speed has improved tremendously. Your weapon has been reinforced too.”</p>
<p>Hameln, who had escaped the full brunt of Schnee’s attack, retreated a few steps while clutching the spot where his left arm used to be. The stick he had tried to use to defend himself was on the ground, cut in half.</p>
<p>“If the item hadn’t shown its effect, I would already be down for the count. I suppose I underestimated you. I shall reflect on it for the future.”</p>
<p>Hameln spoke in a tone hardly fitting someone who had just lost an arm.</p>
<p>In the game era, because of freedom of movement and AI performance, he was probably superior. From this exchange, however, Schnee realized that she could defeat him now. That was, however, beyond what she could do in her current condition.</p>
<p>“What did you…do to me…!”</p>
<p>Schnee felt her strength leave her body. Not only that, she could also feel something different, something irreplaceable, disappearing. Something she couldn’t put in words. She could not ignore it either.</p>
<p>More than Hameln, this unknown sensation enveloping her whole body was far more terrifying.</p>
<p>“Only players could tell what this is, pretty much. I have no intention of keeping secrets, so let me tell you what is happening. Maybe you have experienced it once, but this is an item that resets support characters’ affection level to zero. In the game, it only affected one’s support characters, but it appears that restriction does not exist anymore in this world.”</p>
<p>Schnee had never heard of the item mentioned by Hameln. She instinctively understood, however, how it would be a fatal weakness for her.</p>
<p>“Kh….aah….”</p>
<p>Her body glowed for several seconds. She could not speak another word though.</p>
<p>Schnee’s hand let go of 『Blue Moon』.</p>
<p>Before the clanging sound of the blade hitting some stones could get her attention, she felt a dull shock behind her head. She then noticed that she had collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>“Well well, mission complete. Oh yes, I should ————- that too. ——-me effect on the other ———port characters…”</p>
<p>She caught bits and pieces of Hameln’s words.</p>
<p>Her consciousness was fading. Her eyes wouldn’t stay open.</p>
<p>“SCHNEEEEEEE!!!”</p>
<p>Right before completely losing consciousness, she heard someone’s voice.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 1 – Part 4</p>
<p>Some time prior to Schnee’s encounter with Hameln, Shin and Yuzuha had gone to the market, after finishing their business at the guild.</p>
<p>All sorts of people and species filled the market: a human girl was negotiating prices with a vendor, a male fishman was inspecting wares, a Mermaid was calling out to the passing crowd, a Beast frowning because of the pungent fish smell.</p>
<p>Shin looked around aimlessly, recognizing fish he knew from the game era and others he had never seen before. The great variety of foodstuffs on display also included seaweed, seafood, dried food: a collection of typical marine goods packed on the racks, a true feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>“(All look, so tasty)”</p>
<p>“(There’s some amazing looking stuff too. Can you really eat that?)”</p>
<p>In this world, there were many creatures with appearances barely matching their flavor, especially if they came from the sea. If they were on sale, they were surely edible, though.</p>
<p>“(Hungry)”</p>
<p>“(It’s still a bit too early for lunch. Be patient.)”</p>
<p>“(Kuu…)”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, mostly drained of all her energy, lay powerless on Shin’s head. Her front paws covered his eyes, so Shin gently grabbed her by the waist and moved her to his right shoulder.</p>
<p>“We took some time back at the guild, I guess Schnee’s already gone?”</p>
<p>Shin checked the map while walking down a street near the center of the market. If Schnee was close, he would see her name near her marker. All the markers he could see, however, were colored green, as in, neutral. No sign of Schnee.</p>
<p>He could probably find her if he expanded the map’s range, but if she wasn’t in the market she was probably back at Shigureya, so Shin did not search further.</p>
<p>Here and there, however, Shin heard men commenting things like “I saw a crazy gorgeous blonde just now” or “That was one smoking hot body!”.</p>
<p>He couldn’t be 100% sure, but Shin felt positive that they were talking about Schnee’s camouflaged form. Despite always trying his best not to glance at Schnee’s chest, Shin couldn’t help sneaking peeks from time to time. According to Filma, she had grown even more from the game era. It wasn’t something Shin could forget or ignore.</p>
<p>“…what the heck am I thinking about, anyway.”</p>
<p>A men’s impure thoughts had probably affected him. Shin firmly shook his head to drive such delusions away.</p>
<p>The embrace at Black Priestess Shrine, the kiss at Fuji, her swimsuit figure at the Castle of the Depths.</p>
<p>Shin too was a man, after all: thinking of the softness of the female body and the voluptuous swimsuit figure he saw in the dungeon, he couldn’t exactly keep his cool.</p>
<p>“(Kuu, Shin, pervert.)”</p>
<p>“What!? Yu, Yuzuha, what did you just..!?”</p>
<p>It was like Yuzuha had read Shin’s thoughts: surprised, he forgot about Mind Chat and reacted loudly.</p>
<p>“(Schnee, beautiful. Just take her.)”</p>
<p>“That’s….not so simple.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t anything he disliked about Schnee. His objective, however, was to return to his former world: he felt it wasn’t right to lay his hands on her.</p>
<p>He knew it was cruel of him to let her have hopes about him. Even so, he did not refuse Schnee’s direct shows of affection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he gave up on going back and settled in this world, the dilemma with Schnee would be resolved.</p>
<p>In his current situation, however, it wasn’t even clear why he had been transported to the current world. If he gave up and then was somehow transported to the former world, it would be simply unbearable.</p>
<p>“(Shin, you like Schnee?)”</p>
<p>“Of co…”</p>
<p>Shin was about to say “of course”, when he noticed various sets of eyes looking at him as if he were weird. From other people’s standpoint, it looked like he was walking while mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>“(….of course I do. But you know, in the game there was this thing called affection level…if that is still influencing Schnee’s feelings, you could say that it’s like I have her under mind control…)”</p>
<p>Shin switched back to Mind Chat and continued talking.</p>
<p>The same could be said for Shibaid, Filma and the other support characters. At the time of their creation, support characters only have the bare minimum level of loyalty.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be a problem if the player just wanted them to act as clerks, but if they were to fight alongside the player, as Shin’s support characters did, things were very different.</p>
<p>If the affection level was low, the range of available commands was limited.</p>
<p>Acting together and using items to raise affection level gradually removed such limitations.</p>
<p>When affection level is maxed, as proof of such bonds the player obtains a 『Drop of Erathem』 fragment. One per support character for a maximum of five, so five support characters total.</p>
<p>When put together, they were still not enough to forge an Ancient-grade weapon, but they were still very rare items. Some players turned them into earrings or rings and gave them to their support characters.</p>
<p>“(Could I be twisting Schnee’s feelings? …is what I think, sometimes.)”</p>
<p>In the past, he had given her great quantities of affection-raising items at once, in order to increase it quickly.</p>
<p>In the game, it was just a stat going up, so nothing to worry about. To remove the command range limitations, to gain rare items. It was all for himself.</p>
<p>But this world was real. If Schnee was influenced by his actions during the game era or from the game…</p>
<p>Looking at Schnee, Shin was starting to have doubts.</p>
<p>“(Schnee likes Shin. She’s not controlled.)”</p>
<p>“(Well, I sure hope so.)”</p>
<p>Shin answered Yuzuha without much conviction, his shoulders dropping. Whether he returned to his former world or not, he wanted to make that clear.</p>
<p>“(No matter what happens, Yuzuha is with Shin.)”</p>
<p>“(You can’t be sure of that. If I go back to reality, you won’t be able to…)”</p>
<p>“(Yes. I come with you.)”</p>
<p>Shin objected, stating something he thought was obvious, but Yuzuha interrupted him, fully confident.</p>
<p>“(Yuzuha wants to be with Shin, so I do. I didn’t get any items. Kuu!)”</p>
<p>Yuzuha wrapped her tails around Shin’s neck and pecked at his cheeks with her front paws. Her light, padded strikes tapped him repeatedly.</p>
<p>Yuzuha expressed that she wasn’t with Shin because she was manipulated.</p>
<p>“(…well, do as you want. It’s not like I have proof or anything.)”</p>
<p>There was no way of finding out if someone was influenced or not by affection level.</p>
<p>Schnee said that she even remembered the first day that Shin logged in THE NEW GATE.</p>
<p>If so, it wouldn’t be weird that she really liked him. There was the possibility that her present affection level was true affection.</p>
<p>It was a problem that couldn’t be solved, no matter how long he thought about it.</p>
<p>“Well, enough wandering around. Time to go back, I guess.”</p>
<p>No sign of Schnee. As soon as Shin turned around, towards Shigureya, he received a Mind Chat message from her.</p>
<p>“(I saw Hameln. We will come in contact soon.)”</p>
<p>Schnee’s voice echoed from afar. It was a mass transmission, a message sent to all registered users.</p>
<p>“Hameln? He can’t be trying to unleash a pack of monsters here, can he!?”</p>
<p>Shin slipped in a nearby back alley, activated 【Hiding】 and kicked the ground hard. Jumping straight above the buildings, enlarged the map, confirmed in which direction Schnee was and started running.</p>
<p>Contrary to his predictions, Schnee was on top of a hill near the town. Near her there was just one more marker, colored neutral green. It had to be Hameln.</p>
<p>“There are presences of monsters around Barbatos, but it’s not a pack large enough to attack the city. So I guess that it’s not his objective this time?”</p>
<p>Shin ran, slicing through the wind.</p>
<p>He tried to guess what Hameln would be trying to do, but in the end Shin did not have enough information about him. In the game, Shin had exterminated the monsters and delivered the final blow, but until the end he did not learn exactly what it was Hameln wanted to do.</p>
<p>A few seconds before Shin reached the hill, Hameln’s marker changed to red.</p>
<p>“What’s going on now?”</p>
<p>The map couldn’t show the markers’ behaviour in detail. What was clear is that Schnee had brushed right next to Hameln, then stopped.</p>
<p>Schnee and Hameln were on a hill of moderate height. Thinking it would be a waste of time to go around, Shin jumped down from the roof, then kicked the ground again to boost himself up, hard enough to leave a crevice.</p>
<p>What Shin saw on the hill was Schnee collapsing and Hameln missing an arm.</p>
<p>“Schneeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!”</p>
<p>As soon as he saw her, Shin found himself screaming.</p>
<p>His desperate call managed to barely reach her before she fell.</p>
<p>Smoothly, Schnee’s body rose again, and without a sound moved behind Hameln. Her hands gripped 『Blue Moon』, the weapon she had dropped moments before.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Hameln had been distracted by Shin’s shout and noticed Schnee’s approach only at the last moment, moving away instinctively.</p>
<p>She had apparently been damaged enough to cause her to collapse. Schnee’s attack lacked sharpness: it only managed to wound Hameln’s chest.</p>
<p>Hameln, now at a certain distance from Schnee, saw his coat tear in half. There was no blood, though: the slash likely failed to reach his body.</p>
<p>“Schnee!! Are you all right!?”</p>
<p>“Yes, no problem.”</p>
<p>Shin checked Schnee’s condition, while glaring at Hameln. She did not appear injured anywhere. Her level and status were the same as always too.</p>
<p>“Quite the speedy arrival, my friend. I must say I did not think we would meet again, though.”</p>
<p>Hameln spoke to Shin in a cheerful tone.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t care less. What did you do to Schnee?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s hardly something worth mentioning, really. I just used an affection-resetting item. Honestly speaking, I doubted it would actually work, you know. I thought you would have reset it already during that event, to collect items. It only works once, as you know.”</p>
<p>“….the 『Cursed Tag of Crippling』!”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly.”</p>
<p>Hameln’s smile widened and Shin materialized 『Moonless』. He was worried about Schnee’s condition, but it would have been much more troublesome to let Hameln go.</p>
<p>“Where did you get it? It should be impossible for players to create them.”</p>
<p>“The Kishimi clan, was it? They’re in this world too, you see. The item I used is something I found in their settlement, after wiping them out. Oh, do not worry: the one I used on Schnee was the last one I had. I have no other items to reset affection level.”</p>
<p>Hameln continued talking in a whimsical tone, but Shin did not hesitate and attacked him with 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>He would not kill him, as there was information to be extracted.</p>
<p>Before Shin could strike, however, a shadow appeared between them.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>Shin clicked his tongue as he swung down 『Moonless』 and cut the intruding shadow in two. Because of the unexpected mass of the target, however, Shin’s sword slash did not have its usual speed.</p>
<p>The shadow’s identity was a monster with damage-reducing capabilities, Mad Shadow.</p>
<p>As the name said, its damage reduction ability allowed it to decrease the damage it received to one third, and worked both on physical and magic attacks. In addition, it could also wrap itself around swords and lances to make it more difficult to fight.</p>
<p>As it just happened to Shin, the monster could also slow down attack speed: it was hated by players especially when encountered in time attack events.</p>
<p>Its level was fixed at 100 and it had no offensive capabilities at all: on the other hand, its VIT was said to be over 800.</p>
<p>The Mad Shadow didn’t manage to completely wrap Shin’s 『Moonless』, but lowering Shin’s attack speed allowed Hameln to move away from his attack range.</p>
<p>“You probably wanted to capture and draw information out of me, but I had no intention of hiding anything from the beginning, so I guess I’ll have my say and go. It’s possible to make items to return affection level to what it was. Whether the item works or not, however, is all up to luck. Of all the times I’ve tried it on support characters until now, it worked about half the time. Other choices would be event bosses that are not confirmed to exist here too, but you could always try looking for them, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“….why did you tell me all this?”</p>
<p>“What effect would it have on a High Human’s support characters? Will it really go back? That’s what I’d like to see. I did not have the smallest inkling of wanting to erase Lady Schnee. The exchange just now took me by surprise, but it would have been boring to continue. I am sure you will understand that I am speaking the truth, dear Shin?”</p>
<p>Just as he said, Hameln probably just wanted to see the results of using the item. His words and actions seemed exactly the same as they were during the game.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Hameln did not seem to particularly care about anything other than his own objectives.</p>
<p>He frequently acted as MPK (Monster Player Killer) because he enjoyed looking at people struggle: whether his targets survived or died as a result, it was of no concern to him.</p>
<p>Considering his past, it did not seem like he was lying.</p>
<p>“Well then, I shall take my leave now. I’m looking forward to the next time we meet.”</p>
<p>Hameln had been talking behind a large quantity of Mad Shadows he had summoned as a barrier, but his presence now vanished. His way of disappearing did not make it look like he had used high-speed movement or 【Hiding】: he had probably used teleportation. Without a marker, there was no way of tracking a teleported target.</p>
<p>Shin took care of the remaining Mad Shadows, then talked to Schnee.</p>
<p>“What exactly happened here?”</p>
<p>“I do not know anything more than what Hameln said. He said he used a Cursed Tag, but I do not feel anything wrong with my condition.”</p>
<p>Schnee answered matter-of-factly to Shin’s question. She did not seem to be in a serious condition, nor to be enduring anything. It was probably true that there was nothing wrong with her.</p>
<p>Her matter-of-fact behavior, however, was a stark contrast with the usual Schnee. She was far too expressionless when talking about her condition.</p>
<p>“….do you remember me?”</p>
<p>“I remember that you are my creator and the lord whom I should serve.”</p>
<p>“….just that?”</p>
<p>“It has been less than an hour since I appeared on this location and begun my activities, so I would say that there is nothing more to add.”</p>
<p>Schnee answered Shin’s somewhat upset question without changing her expression a bit.</p>
<p>Her gaze did not have the usual warmth anymore: it was simply observing the being known as Shin. Shin felt his blood turn cold.</p>
<p>“Like that I left you in charge of Tsuki no Hokora for all that time.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean the base?”</p>
<p>“We went to Falnido, Hinomoto, lots of other places too, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“I do not remember, but…”</p>
<p>“….even Filma and Shibaid?”</p>
<p>“Who would they be?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s expressions clouded after Shin’s barrage of questions. It was not an act, she really did not know.</p>
<p>“Are you serious….?”</p>
<p>Finally, Shin sighed.</p>
<p>Judging from her words, it looked like Schnee had returned to the stage just after a support character has been created, her memories reset. She could use her equipment without problems, so her level and stats must be unchanged.</p>
<p>Affection level rose little by little as the player stays logged in: if the support characters acted alongside the player or certain items are used, it can increase by large amounts.</p>
<p>If affection level is reset, related memories and memories experienced when affection level was high are probably erased along with it.</p>
<p>Schnee was Shin’s first support character. They were together most of the time since he started playing, so her affection level was pretty much constantly growing.</p>
<p>Thing would have probably been different if he just had her manage the store, but it was likely that for Schnee resetting affection level also meant erasing all her memories.</p>
<p>“Do you have any other questions?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s wait for Filma and the others to arrive first. Let me tell you first that Filma is a support character, like Shibaid.”</p>
<p>“Support characters other than me? I am supposed to be the first in order of creation, though.”</p>
<p>Schnee seemed puzzled to know about other support characters being created all of a sudden.</p>
<p>With her memories reset, it was no wonder that she did not remember about the support characters created after her.</p>
<p>For Schnee, the time spent in that world was almost zero. She probably found it bizarre for multiple support characters to exist.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you will believe me, but you have actually lost your memories. Once Filma and the others learn about it, they will probably ask you the same questions I just did, but please bear with it.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will be on standby, then.”</p>
<p>Schnee said nothing else and fell in complete silence. It seemed she had no intention of actively engaging in conversation.</p>
<p>She stood upright, her hands lightly resting on her skirt, not the smallest movement. If she didn’t blink, she could be passed for a very well done doll.</p>
<p>“Kuun…”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, to whom Schnee had not paid the slightest bit of attention, emitted a lonely growl.</p>
<p>(Memories disappear, huh.)</p>
<p>Shin could have asked more questions to grasp Schnee’s current situation, but he didn’t find himself able to. He was more shocked than expected at hearing Schnee call him “lord” with that blank tone and expression.</p>
<p>He could feel a sort of respect from her, but nothing more. The smile she had just a few hours before was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>(The 『Cursed Tag of Crippling』. To reverse its effects, I need the 『Blessed Tag of Bonding』, if memory serves me right.)</p>
<p>The item that resets affection level, officially named 『Cursed Tag of Crippling』, had been implemented in the game during the 『Depths of Oblivion』 event.</p>
<p>It was used by enemies which targeted not players, but support characters, forcing their affection levels back to zero.</p>
<p>In more precise terms, however, their memories were not lost, but only taken away.</p>
<p>During this event, alongside with the 『Cursed Tag of Crippling』 an item called 『Blessed Tag of Bonding』 was implemented as well. Using it would restore the lost affection level.</p>
<p>If something disappears, it can’t be brought back. But if it’s taken away, it can be taken back, and memories will return too…or so the event’s description said.</p>
<p>Other than using the Blessed Tag, the way to restore memories was to defeat the evil god the Kishimi clan venerated, the event’s boss. In the game, the tags had 100% success rate, but if Hameln had been speaking the truth, it was now a gamble.</p>
<p>During this event, many players reset their support characters’ affection levels on purpose, to then raise them again and obtain more 『Drops of Erathem』. The Cursed Tags could reset affection levels only once per character. Considering the reward, it wasn’t a big loss.</p>
<p>Shin too was no different: he had reset the affection levels of all his support characters from number 2 – Filma – onwards. Schnee, however, was different.</p>
<p>Clearing the event with a support character not affected by the Cursed Tag awarded a special reward. Shin thus did so with Schnee, his strongest support character at the time.</p>
<p>(Shit!! How could I have expected this!?)</p>
<p>Schnee, the only one among Shin’s support characters that could be affected by the Cursed Tag, encountered Hameln and had the Cursed Tag used on her. Shin could have never fathomed such a possibility.</p>
<p>Shin knew what materials were needed to create the Blessed Tag, but the Cursed Tag was not something players could create. Shin scratched his head, desperately trying to recover any useful information. He could not come up with anything, however, and eventually Filma and the others arrived.</p>
<p>Even after looking at Shibaid and Filma, support characters like her, or Tiera, with whom she used to manage Tsuki no Hokora, Schnee’s behavior did not change at all.</p>
<p>“….it really looks like you forgot all about us.”</p>
<p>“So it seems. All I have is the impression of meeting you all for the first time.”</p>
<p>“Looks like you act and speak a bit different too.”</p>
<p>Ever since Shin came to this world, Schnee always had a warm atmosphere, so as Filma said, her personality could have changed too.</p>
<p>“Master….”</p>
<p>“I have no recollection of ever taking any disciples.”</p>
<p>“You simply forgot. Please remember!”</p>
<p>Tiera kept pressing, with tears in her eyes, but Schnee was simply confused.</p>
<p>If Schnee hadn’t saved her, Tiera wouldn’t be who she is now. Having lived for so long together, it was a real shock for her to be forgotten.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Tiera. It’s not like there’s no way to bring Schnee back to the way she was.”</p>
<p>Shin told the others the information he received from Hameln. The source was an enemy, but concerning the Blessed Tag, Shin had used them too during the event, so there was no mistake.</p>
<p>The problem was that even using the Blessed Tag, there was just a 50% chance of it working.</p>
<p>In case it failed, they would have to go look for the event boss, which they were not even sure existed.</p>
<p>“Is it really true that I have lost my memories?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. According to your memory, you just woke up in this world and fought Hameln, right? If so, it would be weird that your non-combat skills are leveled up too. Your Cooking skill is as high as IX, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“…indeed, I do possess many skills that I have no recollection training. So it is true that I lost my memory.”</p>
<p>Schnee checked her status and nodded, convinced.</p>
<p>Her expression barely changed, just like before, so Shin was not sure if she was really convinced or not. At the same time, he wondered if she always was so deadpan.</p>
<p>Filma then asked him a question.</p>
<p>“So, do you have the item that could recover her memory?”</p>
<p>“….I don’t have all the materials. I’m missing something called 『White Scent Nectar』, anyone heard of it?”</p>
<p>Shin checked his item box, then replied to Filma’s question.</p>
<p>Event item materials normally couldn’t be used to make other items, so there was no point in gathering them in large quantities. He had something remaining from when he made Blessed Tags for Filma and the others, but it wasn’t enough to make another one.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you try contacting the Golden Company’s Berett, first? I suppose that’s our best chance for finding it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. I’ll ask anyone I can contact first. Players like Hibineko could be carrying some too. Filma, guys, you’ve never heard of this item, right?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>“Nor have I.”</p>
<p>“I would have said it already if I had.”</p>
<p>Filma, Tiera and Shibaid did not seem to know either.</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid, however, seemed to remember about the event, so they knew what kind of item it was.</p>
<p>“In Tsuki no Hokora…wasn’t there a box materials come out of? Couldn’t there be some there?”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t create event-only materials. Checking the storehouse is a good idea, though. Let’s take a look in Celciutos’ and Rashugum’s store too.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Tiera’s mention of the material creation device, Shin decided what they would go next. He would only go visit Zigma at a later time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 1 – Part 5</p>
<p>They opted to explain what happened to Zazie and the others, saying that they would leave for the moment.</p>
<p>First, they went to check Celciutos, using a teleport stone prepared for themselves, different from the one placed in Shigureya. The group arrived in the ship and quickly proceeded to its stockroom.</p>
<p>Shin unlocked the 5-mel tall door, which slid effortlessly to the side.</p>
<p>The stockroom contained items in both card and materialized forms. Some items were kept in materialized form simply because keeping stacks of cards in such a large storeroom would give it a bleak atmosphere: a pretty meaningless reason, honestly.</p>
<p>Keeping the items in card form allowed one to store them more efficiently: in each of the room’s sections, one for each member, piles of cards were stacked.</p>
<p>One of the storeroom’s functions prevented the stacks from collapsing, as all cards kept there were rare items and parts.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent lack of care in the way the item cards were stacked, they were actually piles and piles of treasures.</p>
<p>“This is impressive…even if they’re all in card form, I feel kind of overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>The memory-deprived Schnee commented after looking around the storeroom.</p>
<p>If any person skilled in detecting magic power, other than a player or someone related to one, entered in a room like this, they would either be completely charmed or run away as fast as they could.</p>
<p>“The storeroom in Tsuki no Hokora was also unbelievable. It even had cursed weapons on display, just like that.”</p>
<p>“Is that not dangerous?”</p>
<p>Tiera commented with a sigh, but Schnee replied to her seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s fine as long as you don’t touch them. All accessories that can create mental interference are blocked from doing anything too. If any weapon gets a bit too daring, I just melt them and send them back to the forge.”</p>
<p>Shin clearly stated that there was nothing to worry about, as he had done with Kuchinashi at Hinomoto, when he showed her his storeroom.</p>
<p>“I see, our lord is well acquainted with the usage of weapons.”</p>
<p>“Er…not just weapons, blacksmithing in general. Leather, threads…I’ve also raised my skills in handling materials other than metals. ”</p>
<p>Shin momentarily found himself at a loss of words because of Schnee’s impressed comment. Her words and expressions showed that she was simply saying what she thought.</p>
<p>When he first started playing, Shin tempered iron and Schnee poured her magic power in it, to forge swords. Though she did not remember her experience now.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I’ll have to check the list.”</p>
<p>Shin returned to the mission, and, after checking the item cards in his section, asked for “permission” and started checking the stocked items’ list of the other Rokuten members.</p>
<p>He scrolled through the long list of item names, looking for the 『White Scent Nectar』. He checks each list twice, to be sure not to miss it.</p>
<p>First, he looked through Hecate’s and Cook’s lists, rich in vegetal-related ingredients. He then went to the other sections in order from the closest: Cain, Cashmere and Reed.</p>
<p>Contrary to his expectations, however, Shin could not find the 『White Scent Nectar』 anywhere.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect much, but to not even find one…I wonder if we’ll be luckier in the other places.”</p>
<p>“We have no choice but to make an attempt, though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, off to Rashugum then.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Shibaid and announced their next destination. The fastest way would be to teleport directly from Celciutos, but as it had happened when they tried from Tsuki no Hokora, it was not possible.</p>
<p>“Where is Rashugum now, by the way?”</p>
<p>“We’ll have to check with Vizzy about that. I’ll have her prepare some transportation too. If the Elder Dragons we used before are still available, there’s no need to make Rashugum come down either.”</p>
<p>Rashugum was always flying in the air, so if it was not possible to fly or teleport there, it would be necessary to make it land and start from the lowest floor.</p>
<p>It wasn’t impossible for Shin, but thanks to Vizzy and the Elder Dragons they could avoid such a troublesome method.</p>
<p>“I’ll send Vizzy a message and ask where they are. I’ll try to get her to come here or to Barbatos, whichever is closer.”</p>
<p>“As you, my lord, are the only High Human, I doubt she would refuse your orders.”</p>
<p>Schnee continued, saying that even if a member of Rokuten other than Shin had come to this world, she would surely obey.</p>
<p>Vizzy and Berett collaborated with Shin because they shared Schnee’s sentiments, maybe.</p>
<p>“I’m trying not to force people like that. And you can just call me Shin.”</p>
<p>“I cannot address my lord in such a manner.”</p>
<p>“Before losing your memory, you called me Shin, you know?”</p>
<p>“I have no such recollection.”</p>
<p>Schnee was steadfast. She wanted to clearly draw the line in their master-servant relationship.</p>
<p>Even when they left Barbatos, Schnee reproached Filma for her much too familiar manner of speaking with Shin.</p>
<p>“Schnee was pretty stubborn in this period, huh.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she was so stiff, though.”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>Shin and Filma answered Schnee’s expressionless stare, laughing and saying it was nothing.</p>
<p>“By the way, my lord, will we spend the night here?”</p>
<p>“It depends on what Vizzy and Berett tell us. I was planning on thinking about it after lunch.”</p>
<p>He hadn’t chosen where to eat yet. Schnee said that she would like him to materialize Tsuki no Hokora.</p>
<p>“I’ll go ahead and prepare lunch, then.”</p>
<p>“Okay, got it.”</p>
<p>Spurred on by Schnee, who was eager to do the housework herself, Shin materialized Tsuki no Hokora in an open space. Tiera noticed and said she would help, so she followed Schnee inside.</p>
<p>Shin went to his room to write messages for the support characters Vizzy and Berett, as well as the former players Hibineko and Shadow. Afterwards, he went to the kitchen to check on Schnee.</p>
<p>“Even without her memories, I guess her skills are intact.”</p>
<p>Schnee and Tiera were making preparations for the meal.</p>
<p>Schnee had taught Tiera not only how to fight, but also skills useful for living, such as basic alchemy and cooking.</p>
<p>Probably because they lived together for a long time, Schnee and Tiera worked together swiftly and efficiently, without bumping or inconveniencing each other.</p>
<p>“Master, you once said that for cooking technique and feelings are what’s important.”</p>
<p>Tiera, not noticing Shin’s presence, started talking with Schnee.</p>
<p>“I can understand why technique would, but…feelings…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You told me that dishes prepared with feelings for someone and dishes prepared with just technique had different flavor.”</p>
<p>“Is there an unknown ingredient to be added…?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s completely not the way to think about it…”</p>
<p>Schnee seriously reflected…in the wrong direction, and Tiera stopped her, disappointed.</p>
<p>Shin too nodded, hidden in the shadow of the corridor.</p>
<p>“Master…no, Schnee, what you put into your cooking were your feelings for Shin.”</p>
<p>Tiera stopped her hands for a moment and talked while looking at Schnee. On her face was a slight frown, as if she was enduring something painful.</p>
<p>“My feelings for my lord?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Shin disappeared, and even if you were told that he might not return anymore, you continued to wait for him. Ever since he returned, you were always looking at him. I am sure many things that I am not aware of happened between you, too.”</p>
<p>Tiera continued, frankly.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, Shin and Schnee were alone together rather often. Tiera had probably noticed it too.</p>
<p>“Back at the village, I was often told that I was slow when it came to romance…but even I could tell how you felt about Shin. That’s how important he is for you.”</p>
<p>“That’s beyond what I…I do not find it unbelievable that I might harbor feelings for my lord, but our difference of status is too great. I am but a mere servant, would my lord ever look at me?”</p>
<p>Schnee closed her eyes and talked with her hands resting on her chest.</p>
<p>It was simply preposterous: so suggested Schnee’s behavior.</p>
<p>“Oh, you were quite open in showing each other your affection. Despite……..what others might feel.”</p>
<p>Tiera thought to talk in a light, casual way, but probably couldn’t hold back anymore, and blurted out a complaint. She had said it almost in a whisper, but it had reached Schnee’s ears.</p>
<p>“Is that so. I do not feel that way as of now, but…it is the same for you, yes?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Er, I…….yes….”</p>
<p>Tiera was stuck in a long pause after Schnee’s question, but finally answered in a very feeble tone of voice.</p>
<p>After hearing her reply, Schnee put down the frying pan she was holding and, with a small smile on her expression-void face, hugged Tiera.</p>
<p>“You are very kind.”</p>
<p>“….eh? Er, I….”</p>
<p>Schnee hugged Tiera with just enough strength so that she could break free anytime she wanted, then continued to speak softly.</p>
<p>“After talking with Filma and Shibaid, I have concluded that I was rather…though I do not know if this is the appropriate way of saying it…well liked by my lord. If you are fond of my lord, this loss of memory would be the perfect chance for you to express your feelings and draw him to you. Despite this, you are trying to bring me back, in your own way…maybe because you are this kind of person, the past me saved you.”</p>
<p>“No, er, I didn’t think that far…”</p>
<p>Not knowing what to do, Tiera was squirming in Schnee’s arms.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, my body moved on its own. Even if I forgot, it appears that my body remembers.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to apologize! I’m the one who has a huge debt of gratitude to you, mas…Schnee!”</p>
<p>“You may call me master if you want. We must have lived together long enough for you to call me that instinctively, correct?”</p>
<p>“Ye, yes. Thank you, very much.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s last words trembled.</p>
<p>Shin did not know how Schnee and Tiera met. As Tiera said, she not only respected Schnee but also felt indebted to her.</p>
<p>After Tiera calmed down, the meal preparations continued smoothly. Schnee’s skills had not decreased in the least, so there was no delay.</p>
<p>The eavesdropping Shin, however, had missed the timing to leave. He only meant to check on them, but encountered an unexpected development.</p>
<p>“The menu is hamburg steak, right?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, nice smell.”</p>
<p>Maybe attracted by the smell of cooking meat, Shibaid and Filma too arrived and joined Shin in looking at Schnee and Tiera cook.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, the day I met Schnee again, we had hamburg steak for dinner.”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled under his breath.</p>
<p>“Hmm, might this be Tiera’s proposal?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but she was with us too, so it could be.”</p>
<p>“Food prepared in a special occasion…I wonder if it will trigger her memories.”</p>
<p>The three continued observing the cooking team while talking.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear if Schnee and Tiera noticed them or not, as they continued working quietly.</p>
<p>Soon after, Shin received the replies to his previously sent messages.</p>
<p>“Guys, I’m leaving for a moment”</p>
<p>The former players, Hibineko et al, had not been much interested in the “Depths of Oblivion” event and did not participate in it. They added that they would research it on their own.</p>
<p>Berett said that they did not sell the 『White Scent Nectar』, but he would look for it.</p>
<p>Vizzy was back at Rashugum.</p>
<p>Incidentally, they had given Wilhelm a teleport crystal for the location near Bayreuth where Tsuki no Hokora was located. After bringing Hermie back, he had apparently used it to return to Bayreuth.</p>
<p>Vizzy and Rashugum were flying over the center of the continent: in her reply, she asked if she should head towards their location right away.</p>
<p>If she did so, she would arrive late at night. Flying with dragons was dangerous when it was dark, so Shin asked her to depart the following morning, while moving with Rashugum. Vizzy couldn’t see through Shin’s concealing skills, so he added that she should contact him again when she was close.</p>
<p>Just about that time, the hamburg steaks were cooked and ready to eat.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll go call Shin and…what are you doing?”</p>
<p>The meal mostly complete, Tiera started walking out to go call the others, but then she found herself face to face with Filma and Shibaid.</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid were peeking inside from the corridor’s shadows, while Shin, behind them, was turning around too.</p>
<p>Tiera, her apron in her hands, looked at them and sighed.</p>
<p>“We were wondering how things were going. Hamburg steak, yeah?”</p>
<p>Thinking it would be weirder to just keep quiet, Shin tried asking about the menu.</p>
<p>“Yes, it left an impression on me too, so I thought that it could maybe trigger some response. Well, my cooking can’t quite compare with what master makes when she puts her heart in it, though.”</p>
<p>Due to the memory loss, Schnee’s culinary prowess had somewhat decreased. Even so, she was still an opponent beyond Tiera’s league.</p>
<p>Shin and the party thought that the possibility of Schnee recovering her memories through the meal were low, but still held onto this tiny ray of hope as they sat down.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat, then, everybody.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that Schnee could have forgotten about this custom of theirs, but she followed with everyone without hesitation.</p>
<p>When he pointed it out, Schnee looked at him puzzled.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but…I did it without thinking.”</p>
<p>This made Shin think she didn’t actually forget every little memory.</p>
<p>“How’s the taste, master?”</p>
<p>“Good enough, I’d say. No problem.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid too commented about the hamburg steak’s deliciousness.</p>
<p>It was indeed delicious, but to Shin it seemed like something was missing. Tiera too shared his opinion.</p>
<p>It had been a while since they last ate Schnee’s hamburg steak, so it could be their imagination. Even so, they felt that there was something lacking in it.</p>
<p>“Can you remember anything?”</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry, not especially.”</p>
<p>“I see…well, I guess that’s normal. If it could return so easily, we wouldn’t need any items!”</p>
<p>Tiera was clearly faking a cheerful tone.</p>
<p>Shin then decided to comment in a joking way.</p>
<p>“If she came back like this, I would have to send messages to everyone all over again!”</p>
<p>Shin then changed to lighter topics, implying that that conversation was over.</p>
<p>Everyone else followed him too, successfully avoiding for the meal to continue in silence.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the meal.”</p>
<p>After eating, Shin and the party prepared for the following day. They had just finished a late lunch, however, so it was still too early to sleep: all members then spent the day freely.</p>
<p>Shin left the others and went to the alchemy room, located next to the smithy, to check if there were other items which could substitute the 『White Scent Nectar』.</p>
<p>He chose items that looked similar and were harvested in the same location, then tried the creation method of the 『Blessed Tag of Bonding』 with them. He stopped just once for dinner, but was cooped up in the room for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>“My lord? Are you still awake?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Shin heard a hesitating voice call to him as he was drawing the essences he needed from the items. He turned around and saw Schnee, with a gown over her pajamas.</p>
<p>“What’s up? Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“No, but it is rather late, so I thought that it was time for you to rest…”</p>
<p>Shin thought that not much time passed since he started to work again, but it was past midnight already.</p>
<p>Similar to when he was called to dinner, when he focused time really flew by.</p>
<p>“I didn’t notice at all. So that’s why Yuzuha said that she was going to sleep.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had been watching over Shin’s work, but then said that she was sleepy and would go to bed…as Shin just remembered.</p>
<p>“Please do not overexert yourself. Think of yourself before me.”</p>
<p>“That I can’t do.”</p>
<p>Shin answered immediately to Schnee’s light reproach. He wouldn’t compromise on this.</p>
<p>“That is not good. Please rest.”</p>
<p>“I will, after a couple more tests.”</p>
<p>“….if so, I will stay with you.”</p>
<p>If she left him like that, who knows how long he’d continue. Schnee realized this and sat down on a chair in a corner of the room.</p>
<p>She planned to not move an inch until she confirmed that Shin stopped working.</p>
<p>“You can go to sleep first, you know?”</p>
<p>“It is unthinkable for me to go to sleep before my lord.”</p>
<p>No matter how much Shin protested, Schnee did not budge from her chair. He eventually gave up.</p>
<p>“To your room, then. I will accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Wait, I can go to my room by myself.”</p>
<p>“It would not do for you to come back to this alchemy room.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to…”</p>
<p>Shin’s words were not very believable after he forgot about the time, lost in his experiments.</p>
<p>“I am but one of your support characters. My lord’s health must be prioritized. I am nothing to be…”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s tone grew stronger.</p>
<p>He did not talk loudly, considering the time, but the will contained in his words did not allow Schnee to retort.</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t remember, even if you have forgotten everything, I remember the feelings that you expressed towards me. What you felt while you waited for me. I just want to answer those feelings. I can’t just not do anything. For you, I don’t care how much I’ll overexert myself!! For me, you are a higher priority!!”</p>
<p>Schnee was right too in a way, but Shin couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>He knew it was one-sided, but he held her shoulders and confessed his feelings.</p>
<p>Maybe because there was no one else around, or because, tired from work, his sense of restraint had weakened. He wasn’t sure why, but he said exactly what he felt.</p>
<p>Schnee was in a corner of the room and couldn’t step backwards. He had her effectively cornered, as if he didn’t want to give her a chance of escape.</p>
<p>At a distance close enough that he could have stolen her lips if he wanted, after this kind of confession even Schnee couldn’t maintain her expressionless face.</p>
<p>“I, I…understand…you’re…too close…”</p>
<p>“Ah…I’m…I’m sorry. I kind of lost control there…”</p>
<p>Schnee blushed and whispered, looking down. Shin quickly put more distance between them.</p>
<p>“…ahem. My lord, I think I have fully grasped how you feel towards the past me. And because of that, I urge you to take care of yourself first. If the me before memory loss knew that you pushed yourself too hard for her sake, she would surely blame herself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…you’re right. I won’t push myself too hard.”</p>
<p>“Please do. Well then, good night.”</p>
<p>Schnee bowed lightly and returned to her room. She seemed to have given up on taking Shin back to his quarters.</p>
<p>Shin looked at her quickly walking away, then headed to his room himself.</p>
<p>“….hah.”</p>
<p>Schnee left Shin and returned to her room. After closing the door, she leaned on it and slowly slid down to a sitting position.</p>
<p>“As I thought…memories are not… all gone.”</p>
<p>She barely managed to complete the sentence. She held her right hand over her chest, where the heart was, and tried to calm her breathing.</p>
<p>The present Schnee did not feel any particular affection towards Shin. As he was her creator, she respected him and did not have doubts about obeying him, but did not have any romantic feelings.</p>
<p>“To feel like this even without memories…how lost was I for him before…?”</p>
<p>Schnee laughed a little at herself. She couldn’t know how she was before the memory loss, but if her body was this affected, there was no choice but to believe.</p>
<p>When Shin came up close to her, her heart started beating fast like never before. Surprise and joy swelled in her chest, large enough to make it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>How happy did those words make you? Her chest had become so burning hot that she almost wanted to ask the past her this question.</p>
<p>And because of that, she thought.</p>
<p>The present her shouldn’t approach Shin any more than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>“The Schnee who should stand beside my lord is the one before the memory loss.”</p>
<p>The present her was some sort of mirage. She would eventually disappear. If so, she will be a loyal servant, obeying her lord, until the end.</p>
<p>“Come back soon.”</p>
<p>Schnee talked to the other her.</p>
<p>It looked like it would take a while before her body cooled down.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 2 – Part 1</p>
<p>The next morning, Shin woke up before Yuzuha, despite going to bed later than her, washed his face and headed to the living room.</p>
<p>Schnee and Tiera were already up and had almost finished preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>“…..good morning.”</p>
<p>“Hey, morning.”</p>
<p>Schnee greeted Shin with a blank expression on her face, as if nothing had happened the day before. Shin tried to reply as natural as he could.</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Because of her lack of expression, it looked like Schnee was putting pressure on Shin which put him at a loss about what to say.</p>
<p>“Er….did something happen?”</p>
<p>Tiera looked, puzzled, at the two people staring silently at each other.</p>
<p>About the time when all members woke up and had finished eating breakfast, Shin received a message from Vizzy, stating that she had arrived close to their position.</p>
<p>“Vizzy’s almost here, I’ll go meet her.”</p>
<p>“Well, nothing to do here, so I’m coming too.”</p>
<p>“I shall join you too.”</p>
<p>After a word to Schnee and Tiera, who were washing the dishes, Shin, Filma, and Shibaid went outside. The map showed Vizzy’s marker, so Shin temporarily removed Celciutos’ cloaking function.</p>
<p>Vizzy seemed to have spotted Celciutos, as her marker went from moving in circles to speeding straight in Shin’s direction. Less than 5 minutes later, Vizzy and the Elder Dragons arrived before Tsuki no Hokora. Just like the previous time, Vizzy had brought 5 Elder Dragons of different colors.</p>
<p>“Hello there~~looks like you’re in quite the pickle, aren’t you~~”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t sound like you really think so though?”</p>
<p>Shin replied with a wry laugh to Vizzy’s unchanged “mellow” way of talking.</p>
<p>“But thank you for coming so quickly.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing, I was just free~~. So~~, are we going right no~~w?”</p>
<p>Rashugum was heading towards Shin’s location. Even though the wind was not in their favor, it would still reach them by evening.</p>
<p>Shin’s party had nothing else to do at Celciutos, so they decided to go to Rashugum. After changing Tsuki no Hokora back to pendant form, they all boarded the Elder Dragons.</p>
<p>Shin, Filma, and Shibaid mounted an Elder Dragon each, while Schnee and Tiera got on the same one. Learning from her past experience, Tiera wore a coat for protection against the cold.</p>
<p>“Off we go~~!”</p>
<p>The Elder Dragons, obeying Vizzy’s command, flapped their large wings. After a short approach, they all flew up in the sky.</p>
<p>Celciutos’ cloaking had been restored right after Vizzy arrived. If someone had been looking in the ship’s direction, they would have seen Shin’s group appear from nothing.</p>
<p>“We’ll go~~straight to Rashu~~gum, okay~~”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s go!”</p>
<p>The howling winds would normally make it impossible to talk, but thanks to a combination of wind magic and 【Silent Domain】, Shin’s party could converse normally.</p>
<p>The inability to talk had been an inconvenience when they flew from Bayreuth to Sigurd, so Shin had come up with this method after testing several skill combinations.</p>
<p>They passed plains, mountains, and forest areas, encountering flying monsters on their way. Most of them avoided the group, fearing the Elder Dragons, but some monsters attacked in packs…only to be blown away by Shin. He didn’t care about defeating them, so he just created a path with wind magic and flew straight through it.</p>
<p>Shin had attached spells to the Elder Dragons: they wouldn’t be affected even if the monsters tried to tackle them. The wind spell caused some monsters to crash down to the ground, but Shin’s group was in a hurry and did not bother with recovering the items they dropped.</p>
<p>During the journey the group landed once to have lunch, but started flying again right away: no detours. They focused on speed more than anything else, so they managed to arrive at Rashugum by sunset.</p>
<p>“A floating…castle…”</p>
<p>Tiera whispered her thoughts while looking up at Rashugum, bewildered.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17415 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rashugum.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>She had heard about it before, but actually witnessing such a bizarre sight brought a completely different sense of wonder. Yes, not intimidating, but bizarre.</p>
<p>Shin was used to seeing it by now, but when it was first completed he too rejoiced like a little kid.</p>
<p>Rashugum floated in midair as if a castle, along with its surrounding terrain, had been scooped up from a vase and placed there. The castle at the center stood tall and imposing like a skyscraper.</p>
<p>Around the castle, other than a series of cannons, there were also many protruding and floating objects, with unknown purpose at first glance.</p>
<p>Originally, the terrain under the castle formed the shape of an upside-down mountain. It looked like it could crumble with even the smallest shock, but it was actually duly coated with Chimeradite.</p>
<p>It was also equipped with weaponry that able to rain down attacks from above. Nicknamed the “floating fortress”, the 6th Sky Castle Rashugum was a super-weapon impossible in reality.</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t it a bit too noisy here? And…there’s a huge pack of dragons there…”</p>
<p>Tiera pointed in the direction of a group of dozens of dragons, fighting with breath attacks and magic. It looked like there were at least two opposing parties at odds.</p>
<p>Some dragons flew undeterred by Rashugum’s protective barrier, while others were kept outside of it.</p>
<p>The former group, which could pass through the barrier and, despite having inferior numbers, was made of larger dragons and seemed to be at an advantage, was composed of Elder Dragons.</p>
<p>The latter group, which could not penetrate the barrier and saw its numbers gradually dwindle because of the Elder Dragons, was made of creatures called Wyverns, types of dragons which had their front paws and wings fused together.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re not in danger, but should we help just in case?”</p>
<p>“No need to~~it’ll all be over soon anyway~~let’s land behind the castle so we don’t get caught in the fighting, okay~~”</p>
<p>According to Vizzy, from time to time packs of flying monsters came attacking Rashugum, hoping to make it into their territory.</p>
<p>Wild monsters couldn’t enter Rashugum: a castle brimming with magic and protected by a sturdy barrier, seemed to be very appealing in the eyes of monsters, especially dragons; thus they often showed up to take a stab at its defenses.</p>
<p>“They have no chance, do they.”</p>
<p>“Exactly~~besides, we don’t have only Elder Dragons on our side~~”</p>
<p>Even discounting the barrier, it would be suicide for monsters to attack a nest of high-leveled Elder Dragons. Just now, the combined breath of 3 Wyverns had been annihilated by the breath of a single Elder Dragon.</p>
<p>The Wyverns were around level 400-500, while the Elder Dragons were 600-700. If there were unique specimens like Kagerou, they could be even higher.</p>
<p>Normally, if the attackers did not come in much larger numbers, they would not stand a chance. Vizzy’s words suggested that there were even more powerful monsters in Rashugum too. Shin began to feel a bit sympathetic towards the Wyverns.</p>
<p>“Whoa…what’s that?”</p>
<p>Tiera, who had continued look at the dragons’ battle, spoke with a mixture of surprise and disbelief. She witnessed a golden beam, shot from Rashugum itself, obliterate the Wyverns.</p>
<p>“There’s an Ancient Dragon too…?”</p>
<p>A golden breath could only be unleashed by Ancient-type or superior dragons.</p>
<p>Ancient Dragons were “at least” level 800.</p>
<p>For the Wyverns, it was a fatal difference.</p>
<p>“It’s even more dangerous than last time we came here.”</p>
<p>So Shin said to himself as they passed the barrier and landed in Rashugum.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 2 – Part 2</p>
<p>“Since there’s always an expert here, I see it’s all kept in working order”</p>
<p>Shin got down from the Elder Dragon and whispered to himself while looking at the surroundings.</p>
<p>In Palmirack and Celciutos, the lack of maintenance had not caused serious problems, but in Rashugum, the aboveground part had been preserved perfectly.</p>
<p>The fact that the temperature wasn’t too low and it wasn’t difficult to breathe, despite the altitude, was proof that the atmosphere control system was working. The dragons dwelling here surely found it very pleasant too.</p>
<p>“Over here~~”</p>
<p>The group followed Vizzy to the front of the castle.</p>
<p>Shin tried concentrating on his hearing as they walked, but could not hear any sound of fighting. The attackers had either been driven away or annihilated. He checked the map and, as expected, found no sign of the Wyverns.</p>
<p>“Hey, that…can’t be…”</p>
<p>While the group was heading towards the front entrance, Tiera noticed something.</p>
<p>Shin looked in the direction Tiera pointed at; Rashugum’s flatland area, which had been added because they felt the need for some nature, and the mass of colorful creatures crawling and squirming on it.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s impressive.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered Rashugum’s nickname and understood. What they were looking at was a group of dragon-type monsters, of all kinds and levels.</p>
<p>Eastern-style dragons with long torsos, western types with powerful limbs and all kinds in between: it was like a dragon exhibition.</p>
<p>Looking more closely, there were wyverns too, but different from the ones that had just attacked the castle.</p>
<p>“T-they won’t attack, right?”</p>
<p>“They won’t, no worries. They’re a~~ll good boys and girls.”</p>
<p>Tiera was nervous, but Vizzy replied in her usual tone.</p>
<p>Some dragons noticed the group and raised their heads to look. As Vizzy was with them, the dragons probably understood that they weren’t enemies. Most dragons either went to sleep or started flying again.</p>
<p>“You could stand up to them by now, right Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, some of them you could take down on your own.”</p>
<p>“It might be, but…they’re still scary.”</p>
<p>Even if her stats had increased, Tiera had only recently become much stronger, so dragons still looked like fearsome foes.</p>
<p>Seeing so many dragons left grazing freely like that, she couldn’t help fretting.</p>
<p>“Hey, that one’s coming closer…?”</p>
<p>Tiera, who was looking at the dragons with a stiff expression, stopped walking.</p>
<p>Shin looked too and saw “something” covered in ash grey fur emerge from the pack and waddle towards them.</p>
<p>“Oh my~~”</p>
<p>Vizzy saw it and expressed her surprise. She didn’t stop it, however, so it shouldn’t be dangerous.</p>
<p>Looking at the creature better, the group realized that it too was a dragon. Even including its tail, it was still very small, about the size of a puppy.</p>
<p>The mini dragon waddled left and right, unsteady on its feet, but straight towards Schnee. Then, despite Schnee’s confusion, it proceeded to rub its face on her feet.</p>
<p>“Er…?”</p>
<p>“Oh~~This is rare~~baby Illusion Dragons rarely get close to people~~”</p>
<p>“Why would it come to me?”</p>
<p>“Actually, this baby’s parents were found and rescued by you, Schnee~~. I don’t know why their child would warm up to you, though…”</p>
<p>Apparently, the baby’s parents had a connection with Schnee. During a material gathering mission, Schnee had defeated some monsters and found young Illusion Dragons nearby.</p>
<p>Illusion Dragons had peaceful temperaments, so Schnee healed them, then talked about them to Vizzy: that is the reason why they were brought to Rashugum.</p>
<p>The parent dragons thought of Schnee as their saviour, so they were very fond of her.</p>
<p>“Since it’s come to you like that, why don’t you pet it a little~~”</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we hurry on, though?”</p>
<p>“We’ll go first. It’s not like we need lots of people for what we have to do anyway.”</p>
<p>Schnee was not sure what to do, but Shin told her that she could give priority to the baby dragon. Following Vizzy’s advice, Schnee timidly tried touching the dragon. The baby then started rubbing its head against it.</p>
<p>“Baby Illusion Dragons are so different from their parents…”</p>
<p>Shin expressed his surprise at seeing how easily the baby dragon had approached Schnee.</p>
<p>“I was surprised too the first time~~”</p>
<p>As opponents, Illusion Dragons were impossible to even touch if they weren’t tamed: they were monsters formed by smoke or fog in the shape of a dragon.</p>
<p>“Ehm, what should I do with this baby?”</p>
<p>The baby Illusion Dragon was playing by tapping its front paws on Schnee’s hands. It was a very peaceful scene, but Shin and his party had things to do. Schnee probably thought that she couldn’t just stay there.</p>
<p>“Keep an eye on the kid until the parents come back.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“The search didn’t take much at Celciutos either, right? This is a rare occasion too, why don’t you just relax once in a while.”</p>
<p>“Well, I admit it would be difficult to leave…”</p>
<p>The baby dragon cried sadly every time Schnee tried to go, making her feel guilty. Shin didn’t need much help, after all, so he asked Vizzy to stay too, for when the parents would return. Yuzuha, apparently intrigued by the mini dragon too, jumped down from Shin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Shin left her to Schnee and walked away. He didn’t need a guide to know what was where in Rashugum.</p>
<p>“Oh, here comes Raster.”</p>
<p>Shin felt a presence coming from inside the castle and stopped. At present, Vizzy and Raster were the only ones present in Rashugum, so it had to be him.</p>
<p>The map showed two overlapping light dots: he was probably riding one of his mounts. After a while, a young man riding a small dragon appeared.</p>
<p>Raster Zay, servant of the Blue Trickster Cain, one of Rokuten’s members.</p>
<p>Characterized by his silver eyes -covered by a bandana- and copper skin, Raster was a High Lord in his twenties.</p>
<p>He too was of higher race, but his stats were almost all concentrated in DEX, making direct fighting not his forte. On the other hand, he was a master at using items and supporting his allies.</p>
<p>“Come o~~n, you’re so late~~”</p>
<p>“Whoops, sorry, sorry. The Illusion Dragon egg hatched, but the baby disappeared somewhere. I knew that lord Shin’s group had arrived, but I had to look for it…”</p>
<p>“The baby?”</p>
<p>After hearing the apologizing Raster’s words, Shin’s party directed their eyes at Schnee and the Illusion Dragon baby she was holding.</p>
<p>Next to her, Yuzuha -now a fox about 1 mel in size- was looking curiously at the baby dragon.</p>
<p>“I looked everywhere, and there you are…I was worried, you know.”</p>
<p>Raster followed the gaze of Shin’s group, then sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“Well, problem solved then.”</p>
<p>Shin tried cheering up Raster, who had clearly been worried sick. Shin knew how it felt: accidents like this could be dealt with if they happened one at a time, but for some reason they tended to occur in multiples.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly it! Besides the parents were worried too, I had to go welcome Lord Shin’s party, yet I couldn’t help but worry…”</p>
<p>Shin told the apologetic Raster to not worry about anything.</p>
<p>“Okay then, I leave to rest to you guys. If Vizzy’s here, the parents won’t attack you…not that Schnee would have trouble with them, though.”</p>
<p>“That’s uncalled for. In case anything happens, I will focus on defense.”</p>
<p>According to Raster, the parent dragons were on edge because of their missing child. Normally, it would be possible to spot the baby through its presence, but there were too many dragons at Rashugum, so its presence was thin and hard to find. It hadn’t completely disappeared though, so the parents would surely come back soon, or so said Raster.</p>
<p>“Me and Vizzy have taken out resources and stuff from the warehouse, but we never laid a hand on the Rokuten members’ stock.”</p>
<p>Each member’s sections and the materials to preserve Rashugum were stored separately, so Shin and the other members’ items did not risk being used as material. Some materials, however, were difficult to find and were getting pretty low in stock.</p>
<p>“I’ll refill the stock with the spare stuff from our generator later. Let me just check the lists first.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing!! It’s great enough that you’re going to refill our stock. I’m really thankful!!”</p>
<p>Raster bowed again.</p>
<p>The maintenance materials were usually bought from Berett or gathered with the dragons’ help. Highest class items, like Drops of Erathem and Chimeradite, were always needed, albeit in very small quantities, but they were impossible to find.</p>
<p>They could be replaced by other items, but lowering the quality also lowered the overall result, so Raster and Vizzy were rather troubled.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, you haven’t learned 【Generate】 yet?”</p>
<p>“I only need a little more proficiency, but as you know, at this level you need to mess with really high grade materials to gain any points…but we don’t have enough stuff, so I can’t just use ’em up for practice.”</p>
<p>Raster’s proficiency was indeed just steps away from acquiring 【Generate】. When practicing to raise proficiency, it was not uncommon to render materials unusable, which was keeping Raster from advancing.</p>
<p>It involved using rare metals such as Chimeradite, Mithril, and Orichalcum to create things after all. All of them were very valuable in this world: using them in large quantities just to increase proficiency sounded just like something out of a videogame.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll give you some materials to practice after I’ve refilled your stock then. Our generator’s been working hard enough, so we won’t run out anytime soon. How much do you need?”</p>
<p>The items just kept piling up, so Shin made this proposal to Raster thinking of putting them to good use.</p>
<p>“Fo, fo, for real!?! As expected of a noble High Human, just like lord Cain! I cannot thank you enough!! I’ll check the items and tell you later!!”</p>
<p>After calming the overjoyed Raster, Shin and the group reached the storehouse and checked the item lists.</p>
<p>They checked all sections twice, like they did in Celciutos, but could not find the item they were looking for.</p>
<p>“Nothing here either…”</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p>Tiera was worried, but Shin laughed.</p>
<p>They hadn’t checked the storehouse in Palmirack yet. But as they barely found any event-related items in Celciutos and Rashugum, the probability of the same thing happening in Palmirack was high.</p>
<p>Just like Shin and Tsuki no Hokora, Rokuten members had homes outside their guildhouses. He couldn’t check those, however: differently from him, the other Rokuten members did not materialize their homes unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Cook’s home, Shigureya, remained intact, but according to Zazie the item they were looking for was not there. Cook never kept items unrelated to cooking, so there was nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>“…then, what about Garden?”</p>
<p>“Garden?”</p>
<p>“It’s a guildhouse focused on cultivating medicinal herbs, with also many structures to create all sorts of catalysts. A High Human called Hecate was in charge of it. It looks like it’s in a relatively dangerous area now, though.”</p>
<p>During his explanation to Tiera, Shin reflected.</p>
<p>『White Scent Nectar』 is extracted from a plant called Lily Orchid. The possibility of vegetable-related materials being stored in Garden was considerable. Higher than the other guildhouses, at least.</p>
<p>It had been abandoned by them, after all, so it was also a good opportunity to go check on it.</p>
<p>“This is the right chance. Let’s go check Palmirack first though.”</p>
<p>Shin and the party had already visited it once, so they could teleport to Palmirack directly from Rashugum. Shin was also currently registered as Palmirack’s master, so they could go straight to its storeroom.</p>
<p>Leaving Tiera and the others behind, Shin teleported from Rashugum’s to Palmirack’s teleport point, then into the storeroom.</p>
<p>Several minutes later…</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>“I can imagine what you’re going to say, but…did you find anything?”</p>
<p>Tiera guessed while looking at Shin’s expression. Filma, Shibaid, and Raster could also pretty much tell, so they waited in silence for Shin to talk.</p>
<p>“I found the item in question, but…it’s still not enough to make a Blessed Tag.”</p>
<p>Shin had actually found 『White Scent Nectar』 in Palmirack, but just 1 item card of it. Adding to what he already had, he would need at least 2 more.</p>
<p>From the bottom of his heart, Shin hoped that his search would end here.</p>
<p>“Do you know where that Garden is?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know just the place.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Tiera’s question.</p>
<p>A large forest area to the east of the center of the continent of Eltnia. Apparently, Garden -officially called “5th Daze Garden Romenun”- was at its center.</p>
<p>“I actually went there once to check too. It was a heck of a party, poisonous plants and monsters everywhere. Monsters without poison resistance couldn’t even step close to it. Even poison-bearing monsters had to be pretty strong to get close.”</p>
<p>Riding a dragon, Raster had gone on reconnaissance from the sky. Romenun’s surroundings were covered by thick poisonous fog, and even the Elder Dragon Raster was riding refused to go near.</p>
<p>Romenun itself looked unaffected and unharmed, at least from the outside.</p>
<p>“We can’t get in contact with Oxygen and Hydro, right?”</p>
<p>“Correct. But hey, considering the location, I think they’re both alright.”</p>
<p>Raster meant to say that the two were both so focused on their research that they didn’t step one foot outside. At least, they wouldn’t try to leave Romenun now that it was surrounded by toxic mists. The structure was self-sufficient, so they would not risk starving to death.</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, in case of failure when creating or developing items, the materials used normally turned into trash. In rare instances, however, unexpected results happened: dangerous items called “failures”.</p>
<p>Such items often had “Something like a…” or “Fake…” in their names and were generated more easily the more valuable the materials used were.</p>
<p>Some exploded when used, others summoned monsters, other bizarre ones changed the surrounding players into swimsuits when materialized…etcetera.</p>
<p>They were dangerous items: no one knew when they would activate or what effects they could have. The more one delved into the depths of creation jobs, the more one would encounter them. Naturally, Shin was no exception.</p>
<p>“Well, at least it seems they can’t turn into sudden death items.”</p>
<p>The failure items could have all sorts of effects, but it had been officially stated that they would never exhibit sudden death effects. Shin couldn’t be sure that this applied to the current world too; besides, Oxygen and Hydro were probably rational enough not to use failed items without thinking.</p>
<p>Trusting in this, Shin chose to stop thinking about it for the moment.</p>
<p>“Raster, does the name 『White Scent Nectar』 tell you anything?”</p>
<p>“Really sorry sir, but nothing. There is someone here who could know, though.”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>By “here” Raster referred to Rashugum, of course. Shin thought that only Raster and Vizzy were supposed to live there, but then an idea flashed in his mind.</p>
<p>“The Ancient Dragon?”</p>
<p>“Yessir. There’s one here that’s like the boss of all the other dragons. It’s been living for pretty long, so it knows all sorts of stuff.”</p>
<p>There were monsters who could speak human language in the game era too. Dragons were rather famous for it, but other than them, Element Tails like Yuzuha and Fuji’s Kagutsuchi belonged to this category too.</p>
<p>It was fairly common for dragons to communicate with humans in the novels and comics Shin read too, so he remembered easily accepting the idea in the game.</p>
<p>“Rashugum sure turned into an incredible place, huh.”</p>
<p>“I tell you, ever since Vizzy brought the dragons to live here, things turned pretty bizarre. The Ancient Dragon noticed that lots of dragons started dwelling here and appeared all of a sudden…that was a huge shock. Ah, the Ancient Dragon’s name is Tzaobath.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Tzaob….wait, really!?”</p>
<p>Raster mentioned the dragon’s name very casually, but hearing it made Shin stop in his tracks. Filma and Shibaid did the same.</p>
<p>Only Tiera failed to understand why everyone stopped, and looked at them confused.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 2 – Part 3</p>
<p>Ancient Dragon Tzaobath…Shin searched through his memories for the corresponding monster and was overwhelmed by surprise.</p>
<p>It was a silver dragon, similar to the ones appearing in western legends. Based on the circumstances under which it showed itself, many players called it “Silver Moon Tzaobath”.</p>
<p>Its level was the maximum in the game, 1000. Just like the Element Tails, it was a famous monster, both powerful and popular.</p>
<p>“I know it’s surprising, but it’s true, sir.”</p>
<p>Raster probably understood how Shin felt, as his smile seemed to be drier than before.</p>
<p>Tzaobath appeared in random outdoor fields when the moon was out. Its silhouette, descending from the skies with the bright moon as backdrop, was as beautiful as it was powerful.</p>
<p>Some players even roamed the fields at night hoping to take a screenshot of Tzaobath.</p>
<p>“Well, in this world you can talk with an Element Tail, so it’s not weird that it’s possible to speak with Tzaobath too…but why would it come to live here?”</p>
<p>“The same reason why the other dragons keep trying to take over. It’s apparently really comfortable for them here, basking in the sun all the time.”</p>
<p>“One of the most powerful monsters…taking naps in the sun, huh…”</p>
<p>Shin had also seen Tzaobath in the game era. Similar to western dragons, it had powerful arms, with a body similar to a human’s. It was covered in platinum scales; from its back sprouted two sets of wings, one physical and the other formed by pale blue light. Under the crystal-like transparent horn on its forehead shone blue eyes that clearly expressed its intelligence, as if judging whoever dared stand before the monster.</p>
<p>Shin fought it when his stats were barely over 800: charmed by Tzaobath’s silhouette descending in the moonlight, he had experienced a world of hurt…or so he remembered.</p>
<p>“Seeing Yuzuha sleeping next to you makes it all more convincing.”</p>
<p>When sleeping, Yuzuha almost always turned into small fox mode. Shibaid often shared the room with Shin when they spent the night at inns, so he had probably seen her then.</p>
<p>Shin nodded at his reasoning.</p>
<p>“That’s true. It would be a real problem if it started rampaging inside Rashugum, though.”</p>
<p>“That’d be a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Filma, who fully knew how powerful Tzaobath was, frowned at Shin’s comment.</p>
<p>“That’s where the defense system you set up does its work, lord Shin. It hasn’t gone off yet, though. Now I can say that we’d be fine even without it, but I was pretty scared at first. Also because Vizzy didn’t fear it at all…”</p>
<p>When Raster first saw Tzaobath he was really tense, thinking that they might have to fight it like that. They could use the weapons for fighting against guilds, so he knew they could win, but with a level 1000 monster as an opponent, it was impossible not to be nervous.</p>
<p>There was never any fighting however, and the dragon simply started living in Rashugum, completely peacefully. Vizzy, overheating with excitement, had charged blindly into the monster, but Raster stopped her, not knowing what she was trying to do.</p>
<p>“They say that servants resemble their masters, and that’s totally true for Vizzy. To go and hug a level 1000 monster is not what a normal person would do…”</p>
<p>“Aah…yeah, that’s just what Cashmere would have done…”</p>
<p>Shin remembered Cashmere’s tantrums during the game era, about why highest class monsters couldn’t be tamed, and laughed wryly.</p>
<p>The group went outside for a moment and Raster stepped forward.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the place next to where Shin’s group had landed was Tzaobath’s favorite spot: if they were still there, the group would pick up Schnee and the others on the way and go there.</p>
<p>After some walking, they spotted Schnee and the baby Illusion Dragon.</p>
<p>The baby’s parents were also there. Their grey silhouettes clearly formed dragon-like shapes, similar to eastern-style dragons.</p>
<p>“They look just like they did in the game after growing up, huh.”</p>
<p>The parent dragons were level 629: among Illusion Dragons, they were of fairly average strength. They had noticed Shin’s group, but as Raster was with them they just turned their dragon bone-like heads one moment, then turned again towards Schnee.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen a baby dragon get attached to someone so quickly. Dragons don’t usually get that close either.”</p>
<p>Raster was looking at Schnee gently cuddling the baby dragon and Vizzy smiling at them.</p>
<p>The baby dragon was on Schnee’s left arm, belly up. When Schnee’s right arm got closer, the baby extended its paws and tried to touch it. The parents also seemed to want Schnee’s attention and rubbed their heads against her.</p>
<p>Schnee noticed and rubbed their heads: the parents trembled a little, their body turning peach colored.</p>
<p>“They turn that color when they’re happy.”</p>
<p>Shin looked around while listening to Raster. Other than the Illusion Dragons, many other kinds of dragons were gathering around Schnee.</p>
<p>Elder Dragons, Wyverns, the green-scaled two-headed Veight Dragon, the Zeranoira — a beast looking like a more brutal rhino — , the Aquoillya, or water in dragon form, and other large dragons.</p>
<p>There were also smaller species such as Fairy Dragons, as large as a person’s arm, and Drunes, with hair like moles.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of amazing…”</p>
<p>“Schnee came here many times already, but they were scared of her then. She always looked calm on the surface, but had a sort of tension inside…dragons are really sensitive, so they felt this and were afraid of approaching her.”</p>
<p>It would be different if she was a normal person, but against someone as powerful as Schnee, they probably felt in danger.</p>
<p>“Schnee is really peaceful now though. I’m pretty sure she would be even if she hadn’t lost her memories.”</p>
<p>“You think so?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Before she was always tense because you hadn’t returned yet, lord Shin.”</p>
<p>“Ah…really. Well…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Finding out that he was the reason, Shin honestly apologized.</p>
<p>“Nothing to apologize about, sir. Schnee wouldn’t hunt down the dragons here without a reason either, so.”</p>
<p>Shin replied that it was obvious she wouldn’t, then went towards Schnee. She had noticed his arrival: after returning the baby to its parents, Schnee walked towards him too.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“I found some, but still not enough.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s expression clouded.</p>
<p>“Raster said that we could ask the Ancient Dragon dwelling here, Tzaobath, so we’re going there now.”</p>
<p>“If so, I shall accompany you.”</p>
<p>Schnee added that she was with the dragons enough time and there was no more reason for her not to go. Yuzuha had already hopped back to Shin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll take you there then. Vizzy, the rest is up to you here.”</p>
<p>“Okay, see you~~late~~r.”</p>
<p>Vizzy waved while holding the baby Illusion Dragon. The baby did not resist at all, it must have grown attached to her while Shin’s group was away.</p>
<p>“Tzaobath, was it? Will it not be dangerous?”</p>
<p>Schnee voiced her concerns.</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s alright. I know its level is what it is, and it is kind of scary, but try talking to it and you’ll find that it’s really a good bloke, no wait a good dragon.”</p>
<p>It also helped defend Rashugum: the breath attack Shin’s group witnessed when they arrived had come from Tzaobath.</p>
<p>Shin and the others followed Raster through the dragons’ hall to a large clearing. There they found Tzaobath, its large platinum body resting on the ground, with its eyes closed. It was Shin’s first time seeing Tzaobath during the day, and he instantly understood why the dragon would only appear at night.</p>
<p>“This is almost blinding.”</p>
<p>Filma and Raster nodded to Shibaid’s comment.</p>
<p>“Yep, this is something else.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I agree too.”</p>
<p>All members shared the same opinion.</p>
<p>“Eyes, hurt.”</p>
<p>“Bear with it a while.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s platinum-colored body reflected the sunlight. It was more than just bright or shining, but Shin couldn’t find better fitting words. It was hard for him too to look straight at the dragon.</p>
<p>“Mister Tzaobath! Would you mind turning the light down a bit, sir?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Raster? One moment.”</p>
<p>A deeply resounding voice replied to Raster’s plea. Just as it said, the light decreased gradually.</p>
<p>When Shin looked at Tzaobath again, the scales stopped reflecting the sunlight. They looked like they had turned a more opaque shade of silver.</p>
<p>“How is this?”</p>
<p>“Thank you sir! Sorry to barge in so suddenly, but these people have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath raised its head and looked at Shin’s group. Its mouth was large enough to swallow Shin and its entourage in one gulp.</p>
<p>“My name is Shin. I have come here in hopes to borrow your wisdom.”</p>
<p>He was talking with a dragon that had lived for many years: even if Shin was probably stronger, he felt he needed to be especially respectful, so he also bowed to the dragon.</p>
<p>“Oh, this magic power…a High Human. I remember, I remember you! You have grown much since the last time we fought!”</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s voice was like thunder, but nevertheless easy to understand. The dragon seemed to remember Shin, even if they had fought only once. His rumbling tone seemed joyful somehow.</p>
<p>“This is our first meeting in such a long time, it is proper for I too to say my name. I am Tzaobath! The wandering dragon that once donned the name of Silver Moon!”</p>
<p>Tzaobath stood up and said its name with a roar of thunder. Its intimidating presence, or majestic aura, created a gust of wind that made the surrounding trees shake. Shin felt himself instinctively prepare for battle, but suppressed it through willpower.</p>
<p>“Quite unusual for a High Human to visit together with an Element Tail. O Element Tail, do you remember me?”</p>
<p>“Kuu? I think I do…or do I?”</p>
<p>“Be clear!”</p>
<p>“I remember your name and personality.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha was still not in her complete form, so she still missed large chunks of her memories. She only remembered some details about Tzaobath too.</p>
<p>Tzaobath cried, disappointed, in response.</p>
<p>“I wanted to rejoice for this long-awaited reunion, but there is no helping that. The conversation has been derailed too. What do you wish to ask me, then?”</p>
<p>“I am looking for an item called 『White Scent Nectar』. I know it can be extracted from the Lily Orchid flower, but would you happen to know where I can find it?”</p>
<p>“Lily Orchid…ingredient for the Blessed Tag, is it not? I see, that young lady was affected by the Cursed Tag, hasn’t she.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath realized what had happened from Shin’s request. It looked in Schnee’s direction.</p>
<p>“That is correct, though I do not have any such recollection.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, yes, I know about it. Also where the tribe growing those flowers is located.”</p>
<p>Lily Orchids grew close to the settlements of a tribe called Tsumugi. Just like the Cursed Tag and Blessed Tag were opposites, the Tsumugi and Kishimi tribes were always at odds, and the former cooperated with the players.</p>
<p>Tzaobath said that it knew where they were located, adding that it was a place Shin had a connection to.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that you are a High Human, thus I shall tell you. The protector of the Tsumugi tribe is the High Pixie at your command. Her name is…Sety, was it.”</p>
<p>“….eh?”</p>
<p>Shin, along with Filma and Shibaid, couldn’t hide their surprise at the sudden name.</p>
<p>They would have never expected for the name of the last support character, currently in whereabouts unknown, to come up now of all times.</p>
<p>“She’s protecting the Tsumugi tribe?”</p>
<p>“They are originally born from spirits. For High Pixies, spirit contractors, protecting such a tribe is not bizarre in the slightest, is it.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Tzaobath’s words. The Tsumugi and Kishimi tribes both hailed from spirits that governed human emotions. Pixies, like Elves, were a race that befriended spirits. Tzaobath’s explanation was thus convincing.</p>
<p>“Where would they be, then?”</p>
<p>“Slightly south from the center of the continent, near the country you call Kilmont. In a space where nothing was supposed to be, I felt a presence there similar to yours. I descended, out of curiosity, and there they were hiding.”</p>
<p>They were probably hiding from the outside world with the Pixie’s ability to create Faerie Villages. According to Tzaobath, that was probably a special location. If it wasn’t, there was no way for a High Pixie alone to maintain a separate space, which normally required at least 100.</p>
<p>“She bragged at length about you. Quite the cheerful girl, that was.”</p>
<p>“…could it be that you knew that I would come here if I returned, and waited on purpose?”</p>
<p>This hypothesis came up in Shin’s head as he looked at Tzaobath happily talking about Shin’s support character. Maybe because Tzaobath’s eyes, which were supposed to be the violent eyes of a monster’s, gleamed in a gentle-looking light.</p>
<p>“No, this is simply a comfortable place to be. I gave quite a scare to the caretakers here, though. Anyway, you lot will head there now, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is the plan.”</p>
<p>“Get on my back then. I shall take you there.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Not only Shin, but all party members were very surprised to hear Tzaobath’s proposal.</p>
<p>Using one of the most powerful monsters in the world as means of transport had never crossed their minds.</p>
<p>“Er, we could borrow some other dragons from Vizzy to go there…”</p>
<p>“You alone would not be able to find the Faerie Village. Well, maybe Shin could, being the master, but you do not want to waste time, correct? Besides, I can fly much faster than any other dragon.”</p>
<p>Shin felt that there had to be something behind Tzaobath’s unexpected helpfulness. The other members probably felt so too: it was all too convenient.</p>
<p>“Why would you do so much for us?”</p>
<p>“Do you suspect my intentions?”</p>
<p>“I do not mean to doubt your words. However, honestly speaking, I wonder why you would help us to such an extent.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I shall answer then. There is nothing to hide.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath easily nodded to Shin’s question, so easily that the group was kind of surprised again.</p>
<p>“How much do you know about the Kishimi tribe?”</p>
<p>“Only that they venerate an evil deity. They offer the stolen memories to their god, if I remember correctly.”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned what he knew from the event. He also added that Hameln had used the Cursed Tag this time, which he had stolen from the Kishimi tribe.</p>
<p>“I see, so they have already been exterminated.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath then closed its eyes for a brief time. More than relieved, it seemed to feel downhearted.</p>
<p>“I once had a friend. A Human one. This human did not fear me nor give me excessive respect, simply being at my side. I had such a friend.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath looked up at the skies and continued talking.</p>
<p>“The Kishimi tribe…those louts used their Cursed Tag on my friend, of all people. My friend, memories gone, did not remember a thing about me. My friend started seeing me as any other monster. Even if I knew that a Blessed Tag would return my friend’s lost memories, and knew the materials needed, I did not have the skills to create it.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s tone had a tinge of sadness in it.</p>
<p>“I looked for someone with the ability to create a Blessed Tag, but could not find anyone before my friend passed, without uttering my name even once until the end. I have never felt more powerless.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath probably recalled what he felt then: he anger that leaked from within was making the ground shake.</p>
<p>“After that, for 10 years, I have sought and crushed the Kishimi tribesmen. But could not completely annihilate them, it seems. Lending you my strength is a sort of apology for not being able to destroy them all.”</p>
<p>“…I do not think there is anything you should feel responsible for, though.”</p>
<p>Anyone could understand that Tzaobath was not to be blamed. The dragon, however, simply looked at Shin.</p>
<p>“…Understood. Please give us your assistance.”</p>
<p>Shin could not win against its gaze. They did not know the exact location and could also reunite with Sety. There was no reason to refuse in the first place.</p>
<p>“Let us depart right away, then. Or is there anything you need to do here first?”</p>
<p>“No, we already did what we had to.”</p>
<p>Shin could give Raster the promised items later: they could leave anytime.</p>
<p>“Let us go, then. Climb onto my back.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath lay down again and Shin’s party climbed on its body, which was large enough to fit them with plenty of room to spare. The lack of reins or a saddle was a little worrying, but they had to make do somehow with their skills and Tzaobath’s power.</p>
<p>“I’d be no use even if I went, so I’ll stay here, people.”</p>
<p>If the Blessed Tag did not work, they would have to go look for the evil deity and defeat it. Raster’s stats were mostly below Tiera’s, so he would stay back at Rashugum.</p>
<p>“Got it. This place is in your hands, like before.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha sir! Take care out there!”</p>
<p>Raster waved as Tzaobahn soared high in the sky. Maybe because of some particular ability it possessed, the dragon just needed to flap its wings a few times for its large body to rise up in the air. Once in midair, just one wing beat greatly increased flight speed.</p>
<p>If the group looked down, they could see the mountains they had looked up to until moments ago, noticing that they had already climbed to a considerable altitude.</p>
<p>“Not being able to touch the ground with your feet makes you feel quite uneasy.”</p>
<p>Thanks to a wind skill, everyone could clearly hear Schnee’s words. She was sitting right behind Shin, so he could hear even if she whispered something to herself. He wasn’t sure if she was talking to him or to herself, but since her voice was different than the usual, he decided to reply.</p>
<p>“It’s the first time for the current you to fly, isn’t it. It’s not weird to feel uneasy after flying so high all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>There were no saddles or reins, unlike Vizzy’s Elder Dragons, so Shin understood being tense at flying this way. They were as high as airplanes in the real world, after all. The speed was much higher than an Elder Dragon’s too. If they weren’t protected by their skills, they probably would have had to desperately grab onto the dragon’s body in order not to fall.</p>
<p>“My apologies.”</p>
<p>“Speak up if it’s too tough. Tzaobath will probably adjust the height if we tell it to.”</p>
<p>Shin turned around and replied.</p>
<p>He peeked in the direction of Tzaobath’s head and realized that it had probably heard them, as the dragon’s head shook vertically, as to express assent.</p>
<p>“Then, could I please…hold onto your clothes?”</p>
<p>Schnee leant forward and asked. Because of the difference in height and her posture, she was looking up at Shin. Her pleading gaze, concealing the proud spirit she had before losing her memory, made Shin’s heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah, yeah, sure, hold onto me hard, I mean, hold fast.”</p>
<p>Shin replied in an exaggerated manner, to keep his emotions from showing. He looked forward, thinking that he could be blushing.</p>
<p>Actually, because of the 【Riding】 skill, there was no immediate risk of anyone falling. In the remote case they did, Tzaobath would surely recover them quickly, but that was a different thing altogether.</p>
<p>“Allow me, then…”</p>
<p>After her words, Shin felt Schnee moving. After about 10 seconds, though, he didn’t feel her grabbing his clothes, so he turned around. Just then, Schnee’s hands hugged Shin’s stomach, thus holding her whole body against his.</p>
<p>“Eh!? Sh, Schnee!?”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t help but voice his surprise at Schnee’s sudden hug. She was so close that Shin felt something very soft against his back. Forcing his attention not to focus on those massive presences, Shin asked her what happened.</p>
<p>“Am I bothering you?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all, I was just surprised…”</p>
<p>Before losing her memories, Schnee…not considering that there were others present…would have probably hugged him like this. The current Schnee, however loyal, was not supposed to feel romantically attracted to Shin. It was thus unnatural for her to hug him so tightly and rest her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t…understand myself. But if I don’t do this, I feel very uneasy…”</p>
<p>The voice reaching Shin’s ears did not seem to be joking at all. Shin touched Schnee’s arms, wrapped around his waist, and noticed that they were trembling.</p>
<p>“Schnee, you’re being pretty bold, aren’t…hey, you look sickly pale!”</p>
<p>Filma started poking fun at Schnee, but her tone completely changed halfway through.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t see Schnee well, as she was directly behind him, but the situation seemed worse than expected.</p>
<p>“Let’s land for a moment. Tzaoba—”</p>
<p>“I’m alright. Please go on.”</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself, if you feel bad just say it.”</p>
<p>“I’m really alright. I’ll calm down if I stay like this.”</p>
<p>Shin felt Schnee’s arms grip his waist tighter, so he couldn’t just believe her and leave it at that: he decided to contact Filma via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>“(I can’t see Schnee from here, I can only feel her arms are trembling. How do you see her?)”</p>
<p>“(I can’t tell if she’s shaking, but she looks really sick. She was always pale, but now she looks just unhealthy.)”</p>
<p>Her status did not show any abnormalities, so Shin chose to believe her and press forward.</p>
<p>He held her hands wrapped around his waist, and her shaking stopped.</p>
<p>“We will arrive soon.”</p>
<p>After less than 30 minutes of flight came Tzaobath’s announcement. Schnee, just as she had said, had calmed down after hugging Shin’s back. Shin looked down at the continent as they descended.</p>
<p>He could see cities he had previously visited: the Kingdom of Bayreuth, the capital of the Falnido Beast Alliance, the fortified city Balmel and others. East from Falnido there was the Dragon Empire of Kilmont, where Shibaid used to live.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s that impossibly large tree…?”</p>
<p>Shin spotted a very large tree located in the center of the continent, surrounded by trees of normal height.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t supposed to be anything there though.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered that in the map Schnee had previously shown him, nothing was marked in that area. Maybe it was a location that was not normally visible.</p>
<p>Shin made a mental note to go check it out when they had the time and looked at where Tzaobath was going to land.</p>
<p>“Hmm? I’ve felt this somewhere before…”</p>
<p>At first glance there was nothing to be seen, but nevertheless Shin could sense something that gave a nostalgic feeling coming from that seemingly deserted location, which made him cock his head to one side, trying to pinpoint the origin of that sensation.</p>
<p>He couldn’t say where, but his intuition told him that he had felt it before.</p>
<p>As they descended, the mirage-concealed location gradually floated into view. Tzaobath was heading straight there, so it had to be their destination.</p>
<p>“Shin, do you recognize that?”</p>
<p>“No…is that the entrance? There is a presence I can’t quite put my finger on.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, something might have changed here after the faerie village was created. I had been told that you would understand, though.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath asked this question to Shin and then held its chin, deep in thought. Looks like even dragons make that gesture when thinking.</p>
<p>It had been Sety who said that Shin would surely understand, apparently.</p>
<p>Soon enough, they arrived a few mels from the ground. Tzaobath finally gracefully flapped its wings and performed a very soft landing. Shin and the party got down from its back right after.</p>
<p>“The faerie village I know is over there.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath pointed at the location where the scenery was warped they had seen from above. It was about large enough for Tzaobath to pass through it, if it crouched, but did not seem to have any depth.</p>
<p>“That is pretty different from how I remember faerie villages entrances to be…”</p>
<p>Shin remembered to be rings of light that appeared only when the item granting permission to enter was used.</p>
<p>The other side was another world: that had probably not changed, though. The difference with his memories from the game era, however, still gave Shin a weird feeling.</p>
<p>“By the way, we do not have the entrance permission item, can we still pass?”</p>
<p>“As long as you are with me. I have been told that Shin and his ‘support characters’ won’t be stopped.”</p>
<p>There was probably no reason to block Shin, Sety’s master, and his companions from passing.</p>
<p>“It looks different than usual, but let’s go through it right away.”</p>
<p>Shin was a bit concerned, but decided to gather his courage and go through. As soon as he stepped into the distorted space, the scenery changed instantly.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>The newly appeared scenery left Shin speechless.</p>
<p>Warm sunlight, a calm breeze. A small hill peppered with trees. He looked to the right and saw the teleport point building, as he remembered. It was all just like a view he had seen before.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t believe it and looked at an area used as a flower field. There he noticed a single gravestone, standing among multicolored flowers. As he soon as he saw the gravestone, Shin ran up to it.</p>
<p>“Kuu!?”</p>
<p>“My lord!?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Shin!?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha grabbed on to his shoulder, trying not to fall off; Schnee and Tiera, who had entered after him, were surprised. Shin did not notice any of that, however.</p>
<p>He rushed next to the gravestone and looked at the name engraved on it. There was no mistake, it was “Marino”.</p>
<p>It was indeed the private area that Shin had acquired as a reward during an event, which he had used to bury Marino’s avatar.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 2 – Part 4</p>
<p>“So it still remained…”</p>
<p>Marino’s gravestone was still in that private area. Shin had lost his composure when he saw it, but thanks to the gentle, warm sunlight shining on it and the flowers around it, he calmed down quickly.</p>
<p>“Is this someone’s grave?”</p>
<p>“Yes…the person that I loved.”</p>
<p>Shin replied matter-of-factly to Yuzuha’s question. His tone both included sadness and nostalgia. After hearing the answer Yuzuha jumped down from Shin’s shoulder and looked at the gravestone for a while.</p>
<p>“My lord!!”</p>
<p>Schnee, who was shocked by Shin’s sudden dash, had followed him. As expected of a kunoichi, even in while rushing she did not step on the flowers around the grave, just like Shin did.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I kind of lost my cool there.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“This is, you see, a private area that…I mean, a particular place? Who would have guessed that Sety was here…”</p>
<p>“Is that so. You started running with a concerned look on your face, so I thought that something grave had happened.”</p>
<p>Schnee was honestly worried, so she sighed in relief.</p>
<p>A little later, Tiera arrived running too, but she had a hard time avoiding the flowers.</p>
<p>“No need to hurry. I’m sorry for surprising you.”</p>
<p>“Oh really. But why did you run off like that anyway?”</p>
<p>After Shin reassured her, Tiera calmed down and approached them while slowly walking around the flowers. Just like Schnee had, she asked Shin what had happened to him.</p>
<p>“I told you about my past and Marino, right? This is where I buried Marino’s avatar, and this is her grave.”</p>
<p>Tiera looked in the same direction as Shin was looking.</p>
<p>“…I see. Now I understand why you made that face.”</p>
<p>Shin realized that he must have seemed desperate and regretted it. It was too sudden a surprise, however, so he had momentarily lost his composure.</p>
<p>All the flowers surrounding the grave had gentle colors, which calmed the heart just by looking at them.</p>
<p>Shin had thought about this place after arriving to this world. Since the very geography of the world had changed, he thought that even if it still existed it would have been difficult to find. He had considered asking Berett to look for it, but being related to Marino, it was too emotional a subject for Shin. He thought it wouldn’t be right to bother him with something like this, so he did not say anything to the other members either.</p>
<p>“My lord, who is Marino?”</p>
<p>“I guess you forgot her too. Marino was my lover, and this is her grave. I thought that maybe she wouldn’t feel lonely here.”</p>
<p>“Lover…….!?”</p>
<p>“Schnee?”</p>
<p>After hearing about Marino, Schnee frowned, holding her temples. She stumbled as if affected by vertigo, so Tiera supported her.</p>
<p>“M-Master!?”</p>
<p>Tiera was surprised by her sudden change.</p>
<p>“Hey, why did you three run ahe….hey Schnee, what’s wrong!?”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid had lost sight of Shin and the others, as they had run to the gravestone before they could pass the portal, so they reached their position only now. Surprised to see Tiera holding Schnee, Filma ran up to her, then Shibaid asked a question.</p>
<p>“I did not feel any enemy presence, but what happened?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were just talking when she started holding her temples like that.”</p>
<p>Shin explained what happened while watching Tzaobath enter the faerie village too.</p>
<p>Schnee recovered fairly quickly, but they decided to let her rest for a while, just in case. In the meantime, Shin spoke with Filma.</p>
<p>“Marino’s grave, I see. I get why you got all shaken up, but Schnee’s reaction was pretty surprising.”</p>
<p>“Surprising?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I mean, it’s a bit weird to say, but Marino is not with us any more. Even if she could stimulate Schnee’s memories, I didn’t think that she’d react as excessively as she did.”</p>
<p>Her grave was here…she was buried here, so there was no risk that she could take Shin away, or so Filma thought.</p>
<p>“Why are you all gathered here?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath reached the group after finally managing to pass through the entrance with its gigantic body. It was still at a distance from the group, as it did not want to risk trampling the flower field.</p>
<p>“Did something happen before I came?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath was large enough that it did not need to come close in order to look down on Shin’s group, so it noticed right away that Schnee was not feeling well: it reacted like Filma and Shibaid, so Shin gave it a brief explanation.</p>
<p>“I see. Indeed it does seem a particular reaction to having one’s memory stimulated.”</p>
<p>Tzabath noted that in his experience, after being affected by the cursed tag, Tzaobath’s friend never showed any reaction to Tzaobath telling about their memories together or showing items related to them.</p>
<p>“There are, however, many differences between a High Elf female and my friend, who was a Human. I do not think it wise to treat their cases the same way.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath added that it had never seen a reaction such as Schnee’s, but no one knew what it could mean at the moment.</p>
<p>“No need to rack our brains over this any further. I believe we should go ahead and create the blessed tag.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You said that Sety was here, is she over there?”</p>
<p>Shin remembered there being only one building in his private area, a kind of shrine. However, a log house was standing next to it now.</p>
<p>Shin’s detection field picked up a nostalgic response: inside the log house, he sensed a presence that could only be Sety. Shin noted many other small markers were spinning around it: they were probably from the Tsumugi tribe, as Tzaobath had mentioned.</p>
<p>Schnee had recovered already, so the group decided to head towards the log house: that very moment, the door opened and noisy voices could be heard.</p>
<p>“Hey!! What are you making a ruckus for!! I know that Tzaobath brought people here!! Look at the fire!! I left the fire on!! I said don’t pull on my clothes!! Or my hair!!”</p>
<p>From the log house appeared a young girl carrying a frying pan, excited to the point of spilling its contents everywhere, pulled by flying creatures.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17461 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sety.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>With blonde twin tails poking out of her pointed hat being pulled around, tears were forming in the young girl’s deep red eyes. Such an entrance almost made everyone forget that she was actually a powerful mage, Shin’s fifth support character, Sety Lumiere.</p>
<p>While she was quite pretty, whe was less than 160 cemels in height, so she looked like a high school freshman or a mature-looking junior high student. Compared to Schnee and Filma, who clearly had adult looks, Sety appeared quite childish.</p>
<p>“Keep this up and there’s no dinner for you today!! Hey, wait!! I said stooooop!”</p>
<p>Even her witch-like mantle and skirt were being pulled: Sety, irritated, started threatening to not give the little creatures anything to eat.</p>
<p>The little creatures — Tsumugi tribe members stopped for an instant, but then started pulling at her again. The Tsumugi tribe looked quite fancy: cute, deformed versions of human-like upper half bodies. Thanks to their lovely appearance their lack of fingers and dark skin did not seem creepy. In the game era, many female players and even some male players had requested to be able to use them as mascots and take them into their homes or guildhouses.</p>
<p>As per the game’s settings, they all shared their memories and did not have individual names. Because of that, using 【Analyze】 on any Tsumugi tribe member would show the same name, Tsumugin. It was pretty well known among players that when this name was revealed, a thread on the game’s bulletin board was opened: “Let’s talk about the devs’ naming sense”.</p>
<p>“I feel all my strength just melting away…”</p>
<p>“They’re much more active than usual, I suppose they have felt the cursed tag’s effects, that’s why they’re taking Sety to us.”</p>
<p>Shin had been taken by surprise by Sety’s unexpected entrance, but Tzaobath reassured him that they weren’t always like that.</p>
<p>The Tsumugi tribe was very sensitive to the Kishimi tribe’s aura, and vice versa. As Tzaobath said, that was probably the reason why they were pulling Sety like that.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, we cannot leave her like that.”</p>
<p>The group nodded and followed Shin towards the loghouse: as they did, the Tsumugi let Sety go.</p>
<p>“Geez, what’s with you guys, really. I know that the house won’t burn up just because the fire is on, but…eh?”</p>
<p>Sety was fixing her hair with a brush, holding the frying pan with the other hand, when her eyes caught Shin’s group walking near Tzaobath’s legs. When Shin noticed it, he greeted her very casually.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“…hmm? ….???”</p>
<p>Sety had not noticed him right away, but soon enough she recognized Shin. Her pouting face turned into an expression of absolute surprise. She froze in place, while the contents of her frying pan started slipping out and falling out. The liquid falling out of the frying pan splashed on her legs.</p>
<p>“Ouch!! So hot!! No wait, my lord!? Oucchhh!!”</p>
<p>“Yep….that’s Sety.”</p>
<p>“Yes….Sety indeed.”</p>
<p>Watching Sety caught between surprise and heat, Filma and Shibaid nodded thoughtfully, as if hit by a wave of nostalgia.</p>
<p>“Was she always like this?”</p>
<p>“Eh, she wasn’t?”</p>
<p>Tiera was confused by the different reactions to Shin’s question.</p>
<p>“I understand the surprise, but can you calm down a bit?”</p>
<p>“It’s these little guys’ fault, for pulling me out when I was cooking. Why are you here anyway, my lord? You ditched us for 500 years, why did you even come back now!?”</p>
<p>Encouraged by Tzaobath, Sety spoke to Shin after a moment, as if her previous confusion had not happened at all. Her red face and ears clearly showed her embarrassment.</p>
<p>Her words, however, had some thorns to them.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s nothing I can say if you put it that way. Could you please at least listen to what I have to say?”</p>
<p>“Hmph. If you say that, I guess I could spare a minute or two.”</p>
<p>Shin expected her to protest more, but Sety just glared at him and scoffed, begrudgingly accepting. She was acting bossy, but the dripping frying pan robbed her of any dignity.</p>
<p>“Shin, who is she?”</p>
<p>Schnee, now fully recovered, asked about Sety, so Shin gave her a brief explanation.</p>
<p>“She’s my last support character, Sety Lumiere. She was created a bit later than you, so she’s like a little sister. ”</p>
<p>Shin also explained about the Tsumugi tribe creatures floating around Schnee.</p>
<p>“I see, so these little creatures gathered around me because the cursed tag was used on me. Now I understand.”</p>
<p>The Tsumugi had left Sety and gathered around Schnee, sometimes rubbing their bodies against her arms.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t just ignore me like that!? And you, big sis, don’t talk like you’ve met me for the first time! You’re horrible!”</p>
<p>“Big sis?”</p>
<p>Schnee was puzzled by how the protesting Sety addressed her.</p>
<p>When creating Sety, Shin had played around a bit, making her call Schnee, Shibaid, and the others big sister or brother. Apparently those settings were still effective.</p>
<p>“Eh, you haven’t forgotten, right? “Our lord” here told me to call you lady sister, but that’s too embarrassing so I switched to big sis, don’t you remember?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Sety. There’s actually an explanation for this.”</p>
<p>Sety started looking at the strange-acting Schnee with suspicion, so Shin explained what happened.</p>
<p>In the beginning Sety listened quietly, but when she heard that the affection-resetting item also deleted memories, she became furious.</p>
<p>“Whaat!? Does that creep know how my lady sister felt all these years waiting for master?? Unforgivable!! When we find him I’m going to burn him, freeze him, smash him to pieces!!”</p>
<p>Sety became so emotional that she used the “lady sister” name, despite how embarrassing she claimed it was. Her confrontational attitude vanished, Sety did not try to hide her anger, clearly showing how much she adored Schnee. Schnee herself, however, could not bear to look at her like this and stopped her.</p>
<p>“Calm down.”</p>
<p>“No way I can!! I’m going to teach Hameln that he messed with the wrong person!!”</p>
<p>Sety, however, was too far gone, so Schnee’s words just poured more fuel in the fire of her rage.</p>
<p>Thinking that she had to stop Sety, Schnee stepped in front of her, pulled her closer and hugged her tight.</p>
<p>“Nmgh!?”</p>
<p>“Calm down. Our lord and the others have come here to return my memories. I am happy that you are angry for me, but please listen to our lord.”</p>
<p>Schnee gently caressed Sety’s head while soothing her violent spirits.</p>
<p>The sudden hug had caused Sety to freeze, then shudder. A little while later, her arms and legs relaxed.</p>
<p>“Did it pass?”</p>
<p>“You’ve always been a bit too easy on Sety, Schnee.”</p>
<p>Shin was relieved that the ruckus had calmed down, and Filma added a comment. Maybe because she was the little sister of the group, Schnee had said that she always felt like hugging her.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, I was hugged too…” thought Shin while remembering what had happened at Falnido and Balmel. At the same time he remembered the softness of Schnee’s chest, so he hurriedly shook his head to dispel such thoughts.</p>
<p>“I do agree that it’s good that things turned quiet, but can you just leave them like that? I feel this happened before too…”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Following Shibaid’s question, Shin looked at Schnee and Sety. He felt a little envious of Sety, being cradled by Schnee’s breasts, but he knew that there was nothing he could do about it this time.</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t Sety tapping master’s back there?”</p>
<p>“….hm? Now that you mention it, it does look that way.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the two again after Tiera’s comment, realizing that Sety’s movements seemed strange, like a wrestler trying to tap out. Come to think of it, a good while had passed since Schnee had started to hug her.</p>
<p>However, it was a mystery why the Tsumugin were touching Sety’s body too.</p>
<p>In stark contrast with her desperate struggle, the little creatures performed completely fluffy movements and sounds..</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, Schnee couldn’t control her strength in her initial settings. Hey Schnee, she’s going to suffocate if you don’t let her go.”</p>
<p>“Suffocate? Ah…”</p>
<p>Schnee let Sety go after Filma told her to, and the high pixie panted heavily, her face completely red above Schnee’s chest. She had tasted heaven and hell at the same time, like Shin had before.</p>
<p>“Hah…hah…I…thought…hah…I was…hah…going to…die…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“O-of course, I…wheeze.”</p>
<p>Sety was desperating recovering her breath, but did not blame Schnee in any way. She knew that Schnee’s embrace expressed her gratitude.</p>
<p>“Do you lot do this all the time?”</p>
<p>“….sometimes?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath looked at Shin’s group with a sigh, and Yuzuha could only give him a short answer.</p>
<p>“S-so, my lord, you came looking for 『White Scent Nectar』, right?”</p>
<p>After recovering her breath Sety, still red because of the embarrassment she was subjected to, went to check her stock. Once again, she acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Lily Orchids, the plants needed to concoct 『White Scent Nectar』, grew in locations where positive emotions were strong or where pure streams of water flowed. The Tsumugins also cultivated it elsewhere. They too responded strongly to positive emotions and had the power to suppress negative ones.</p>
<p>In the opposite way, the Kishimi tribe could amplify negative emotions and suppress positive ones.</p>
<p>Such abilities had no effect on the players in the game era, but in this world things were obviously different: Shin made a mental note of this while listening to Sety.</p>
<p>“Exactly. According to the person who gave the information, though, there’s only a 50% probability of success.”</p>
<p>“Just 50%? It doesn’t work all the time?”</p>
<p>“Hey, I didn’t decide it. Anyway, you have 『White Scent Nectar』, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Or rather, with the Tsumugins around there’s no way you can’t find some!”</p>
<p>Sety’s tone suggested that it was pointless to ask such obvious things. Her attitude, however, was ill received by a certain person.</p>
<p>“Sety. This has been on my mind since before, but aren’t your manners towards our lord Shin too disrespectful?”</p>
<p>“Eh!?! But big sis Filma doesn’t speak politely to him either…big sis, you’re pretty different than before…”</p>
<p>Sety, wary of Schnee’s different atmosphere than when she was hugging her, instinctively stepped backwards.</p>
<p>“Filma is allowed to, though. Again, I am happy that you are angry for my sake, but that has nothing to do with your attitude towards our lord. I shall not allow any excessive friendly behavior without permission.”</p>
<p>“Eek!! I’m sorry!!”</p>
<p>Despite her smile, Schnee’s aura was rightfully frightening, so Sety instantly raised the white flag. Even if Schnee had lost her memories, the hierarchy was the same.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind that at all, and please call me Shin.”</p>
<p>Shin extended a helping hand, to which Sety nodded while stealing quick glances at Schnee.</p>
<p>“O-okay then…permission! I have permission now!”</p>
<p>Sety flaunted her newly obtained permission under Schnee’s stern gaze.</p>
<p>“Anyway, our first priority is the 『White Scent Nectar』. Where is it?”</p>
<p>Sety responded by beating her chest with her left hand, her right one still holding the frying pan, a perfectly smug look on her face.</p>
<p>“Inside my item box! Heheh, time to show your deepest gratitude to me for protecting the Tsumugins and—sorry sorry i'm sorry i over stepped my bounds!”</p>
<p>Sety was shot down halfway through by Schnee’s darting gaze and quickly apologized.</p>
<p>“Er…anyway, you’re a lifesaver. I’m really thankful.”</p>
<p>Shin calmed Schnee down, who was starting to make the mood tense again, and honestly thanked Sety. Her storing the 『White Scent Nectar』 was a real help.</p>
<p>“Here’s your 『White Scent Nectar』!……my lord!”</p>
<p>Sety materialized the item cards, prudently. Transparent bottles containing a semi-transparent liquid appeared in her hands.</p>
<p>“Turn big sis back now!…please.”</p>
<p>“Just talk like you want. Schnee doesn’t really mind either, see.”</p>
<p>Shin took the 『White Scent Nectar』 from Sety, materialized Tsuki no Hokora and went straight to the alchemy room. A few minutes later, Shin returned with several blue-rimmed white cards with patterns drawn on them.</p>
<p>“So this is the 『Blessed Tag of Bonding』.”</p>
<p>“Yes, using these should return your memories.”</p>
<p>The probability being 50%, it was painful not being able to say that the tags would definitely work. Shin wasted no time and decided to use the tags right away. He thought about using it and held it close to Schnee: the blessed tag then lit up with a white light.</p>
<p>Schnee stood still, her eyes closed. The light emanating from the blessed tag slowly traveled through the air towards her, enveloping her body. A few moments later, it popped without a sound and disappeared. A few more moments, and Schnee opened her eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 2 – Part 5</p>
<p>“….how do you feel?”</p>
<p>“It seems like it didn’t work. I feel as if I can almost remember something, but only mere fragments of the memory.”</p>
<p>Schnee lightly shook her head while speaking. There was a slight effect, but overall the experiment had apparently failed.</p>
<p>“No good, huh…will something happen if we try to use it one more time?”</p>
<p>Shin was disappointed, but quickly thought that they could try to use more blessed tags, since they had spares anyway.</p>
<p>“I never tried, so I couldn’t say. Wait a moment, let me ask them first.”</p>
<p>Sety then spoke to the Tsumugins. Some of the floating creatures nodded at Sety. Shin couldn’t tell, but she was apparently able to communicate with them.</p>
<p>After a while, the Tsumugins shook their heads.</p>
<p>“Seems like it won’t work. According to the Tsumugins, the negative forces present now are stronger, so if it fails once it won’t work anymore.”</p>
<p>“Which means, the only other way is to defeat the evil deity?”</p>
<p>“Does this ‘evil deity’ really exist?”</p>
<p>Tiera had a difficult time believing such a being actually existed.</p>
<p>In this world there were monsters acting as gods, but normally were never spotted. In the game period, players would venture into remote and dangerous areas for items or fame. Now, however, people were far less likely to perform such dangerous activities, so such adventurers and areas were currently parts of tales and legends…</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s called Adetropos. It looks…well, really creepy.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled Adetropos and grimaced. Adetropos had its upper-half appearing as a human and its lower-half the body of a snake.</p>
<p>Its bald, earless face was covered by a mask, white with three holes, standing for its eyes and mouth. The holes were fully black, so it was impossible to tell where it was looking.</p>
<p>Its right arm was extremely short from the shoulder to the elbow and the elbow to the wrist, while the fingers were 10 times longer. Its left arm was split in two from the elbow, with multiple human eyes covering it.</p>
<p>The upper half of its body was also covered by tattoos that looked like they could be used for magic rituals.</p>
<p>Its lower half was simply snake-like, but with erected scales; from the gaps between them insect and crustacean-like legs grew out, allowing it to move at high speed.</p>
<p>It was a monster famous for making first-time players, both male and female, freeze at how disgusting it looked.</p>
<p>“As a single boss it’s not that strong, but it gets stronger the more it absorbs memories. I don’t know how much it has absorbed now, so we should go all out from the start to defeat it.”</p>
<p>The evil deity Adetropos’ strength depended on the memories it had accumulated.</p>
<p>In the game era it had accumulated more than 100 or 200 memories, so its power was heavily boosted. With Shin’s current level, it shouldn’t be a problem to take care of it. Letting his guard down was a risk, but it would hardly be a difficult fight.</p>
<p>“They’re also saying that big sis is part of the problem.”</p>
<p>“I am?”</p>
<p>Sety, after talking with the Tsumugins, added this statement apologetically.</p>
<p>The situation had been caused by Hameln’s attack, none of it was Schnee’s fault. No one, herself included, had any idea how she could be part of the problem.</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“The Tsumugins saw the blessed tag and the cursed tag’s powers clash, when you used it. In the end, though, it was something else than the cursed tag…big sis’ own power that repelled the blessed tag’s effect. That’s why it failed.”</p>
<p>The Tsumugins also said that the blessed tag would have worked, had it not been for that.</p>
<p>“So, I myself have repelled the blessed tag’s effect. I have no recollection of doing anything, though.”</p>
<p>“They said they only felt that, but can’t determine the reason why it happened.”</p>
<p>Schnee shouldn’t have had any reason to resist. Sety looked at the Tsumugins, hoping they could provide more information. However most of them were caressing Schnee’s hair, attached to her shoulders and arms, apparently trying to console her. Shin understood that there was nothing to gain in questioning them further.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess all we can do is gather whatever info we have and start looking everywhere, huh? I have no idea where the Kishimi could have enshrined the evil deity in this world after all.”</p>
<p>If the geography was the same as the game world, Shin would have an idea, but that didn’t apply anymore. If the Kishimi tribe was targeting Shin’s group, they could wait for them to strike and draw the information out of them, but Hameln stated that he had destroyed their settlement.</p>
<p>He had no reason to lie, so that was probably the truth.</p>
<p>Even if he was lying, he had no reason to come in contact with Shin’s group in the first place. Even if they waited, the solution would not come.</p>
<p>“I can tell if we get close, but I have no idea how much it would take, even within only this continent.”</p>
<p>“Can you recognize the evil deity’s presence?”</p>
<p>“They taught me how to. Maintaining this place is difficult, but just wasting time would be boring, right?”</p>
<p>Sety had learned that thanks to her ability of being able to communicate with the Tsumugins. Now her detection ability had grown enough to be on their level, apparently.</p>
<p>“Is that presence different from miasma?”</p>
<p>Tiera timidly asked a question. If miasma was involved, she could probably be of some assistance.</p>
<p>“The evil deity takes away all memories, both happy and sad ones. There is no reason for that, neither ill nor good intentions in its actions. So its presence is not necessarily evil, like miasma. I too know what miasma feels like, and I am positive that they are completely different.”</p>
<p>Sety said that she became able to tell after living for a long time with the Tsumugins.</p>
<p>“In the old times, people with terribly sad memories offered them to the deity, in order to not be tortured by them anymore. That changed gradually over time though. According to the Tsumugins, the venerated evil deity wasn’t actually evil from the start.”</p>
<p>“First time I heard that. So there was a backstory we weren’t aware of, huh.”</p>
<p>The event presented the Kishimi as an evil tribe, their deity a foe to be defeated. There was some story behind it, but in the end, the evil deity was just a monster, with no story explaining the process behind its birth.</p>
<p>”Does that mean that it won’t be enough just to defeat it then?”</p>
<p>“No, it looks like it’s fine to do that. It’s not just a matter of “turning back” anymore, after all.”</p>
<p>Sety answered Shin’s question without any hesitation. The Tsumugins had already explained the details to her.</p>
<p>“It’s helpful that we can go ahead and defeat it without reservations, but we have to find it first. The shrine where the evil deity was venerated wasn’t a big place either…if only we could restrict the range a little.”</p>
<p>The shrine was probably about as big as Tsuki no Hokora: even if they asked for Tzaobath and the Elder Dragons’ help and searched from the sky, there was no way to tell how much time it would take. If it had sank underground, for example, it would be impossible to find from above.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking about the next move, when Tzaobath spoke to him.</p>
<p>“O Shin, I have an idea where the settlement of the annihilated Kishimi tribe could be. I cannot say with absolute certainty, but there may be some clues remaining.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath did not remember the locations of all the Kishimi settlements, but in a situation where they had no idea where to go, the information alone was very helpful.</p>
<p>“That’s definitely better than searching aimlessly. Could you guide us there?”</p>
<p>“I would not come here with no intention to do anything. Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>The locations, four in all, were not scattered throughout the continent, but concentrated in the upper region, to the west of Est. There were no other settlements in the vicinity, so Tzaobath had destroyed them from the air with breath attacks.</p>
<p>“That makes me think that any clues might have been blown away too…”</p>
<p>“Apologies, I did not expect something like this to happen.”</p>
<p>“No, it will be worth going nevertheless. Can we leave tomorrow morning?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Ready for battle and rest well.”</p>
<p>Traveling to Rashugum and then to their current location had already used a lot of time. Tzaobath’s speed would have allowed the group to reach their destination before night, but it would be dangerous to spend the night where the evil deity might be residing.</p>
<p>“That’s decided then. What are your plans for dinner? There are plenty of ingredients, so you’re more than welcome to join us.”</p>
<p>“You wish to feed me? I consume as much as many humans.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath probably meant it as a joke, as it grinned while saying it, but Shin replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“We have enough food for one century.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the generator producing materials over time, they had more than enough food items in store. Shin’s party used them for cooking, but the quantity was so large that there was no risk of running out anytime soon.</p>
<p>“….that is impressive. I wonder why you would have so much, but let us not inquire further. Then, I would enjoy eating a sea monster for the first time in a long while.”</p>
<p>“How about Leviathan meat then? The volume and quantity should be enough, I think.”</p>
<p>“That giant sea dragon? While not as impressive as me, I hear it is supposed to be quite powerful. Is it delicious?”</p>
<p>“I guarantee it is. It is a highly valuable ingredient after all: it is good grilled, boiled, even raw.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, then please do serve me some. I would need this much.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath then drew a circle in the air, probably enough quantity to feed thousands of people.</p>
<p>The generator had been active for 500 years, though: even using that much food wouldn’t cause a dent in Shin’s inventory.</p>
<p>Leviathan meat would become large meat weighing hundreds of kegums when materialized, so Tzaobath’s request would be easily satisfied.</p>
<p>“Hmm, eating by ourselves would be kind of strange, so why don’t we do a barbecue today? With the Tsumugins too.”</p>
<p>“Nice idea, big sis Filma!”</p>
<p>Sety happily agreed to Filma’s proposal, maybe also because it would have been a pain to cook again, considering what she had spilled from her frying pan. No one opposed Filma’s proposal, so dinner would be a barbecue in front of the log house.</p>
<p>Shin prepared the tools, with Schnee cooking, helped by Tiera and Sety.</p>
<p>Sety had trained her cooking skill to a certain extent, but she had stopped to the point of being able to cook satisfactorily. When she heard that Schnee’s cooking skill was level IX, she quickly stated that she would assist her.</p>
<p>“By the way, big sis Filma is always the same, huh?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, her cooking is edible…but that’s about it.”</p>
<p>“What are we talking about?”</p>
<p>Sety and Shibaid chatted while looking at Filma, so Shin wondered what they were saying, though he could more or less guess.</p>
<p>“I’m in charge of eating, anyway.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’d be better if you learned to, even a little, you know? Anyway, I’ll go help out.”</p>
<p>Sety addressed Filma and left to go help Schnee and Tiera.</p>
<p>“After joining up with Schnee and the rest, the food’s always been really good, so…”</p>
<p>“I agree, but there’s nothing to lose in learning.”</p>
<p>“What about you two, then? Are you going to say that I should learn to cook because I’m a woman?”</p>
<p>Shin’s comment must have irritated Filma, as she turned to her two male companions and glared at them.</p>
<p>“As long as it isn’t complicated stuff, I can cook, actually. I used to live by myself, after all.”</p>
<p>“I myself was the leader of my tribe, so I have some expertise.”</p>
<p>“Kh, why do you both have this feminine side now…?”</p>
<p>Both Shin and Shibaid were forced to learn by outside circumstances. Shin was also helped by other skills, but still compared to Sety or Schnee his cooking was pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>Thinking they shouldn’t tease her too much, Shin changed topic and asked Shibaid and Filma what they did after the Dusk of Majesty.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m smelling something really good, I guess the food is almost ready?”</p>
<p>Not only Filma, but also Shin and Shibaid were caught by the delicious smell, mid-conversation, and looked towards its source. The sizzling of vegetables, meat, and fish skewers cooking on the grill could be heard.</p>
<p>Sety and Tiera were in charge of them, while Schnee had skewered the Leviathan meat Shin had given her and was roasting it with the 【Fire】 spell.</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s nose twitched at the sight. Even the most powerful monsters were vulnerable to good food, apparently.</p>
<p>Yuzuha had been quietly sitting on Shin’s shoulder, but her patience was now at its limits: she started tugging on his clothes with her front paws.</p>
<p>“Shin! Shin!!”</p>
<p>“I know, I know.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded and walked towards Tiera and Sety.</p>
<p>“Hmm~~yes, it’s better for me to let Schnee cook, after all~~”</p>
<p>“Filma, that is quite the convenient stance, is it not.”</p>
<p>Shibaid rebuked Filma, who had wasted no time in filling her mouth.</p>
<p>Pretending not to hear, Filma quickly hid behind Tiera’s back.</p>
<p>“Well, let her off the hook for today. Let’s eat too.”</p>
<p>Shin thanked Tiera and Sety for the food, then started picking up skewers too.</p>
<p>The juicy flavor of the meat spread throughout his mouth after the first bite, mixed with the sweet &amp; sour sauce it had been dipped in, making it even more delicious.</p>
<p>“No need to hoard, Yuzuha, there’s still plenty left”</p>
<p>“Kuu”</p>
<p>Being in small fox mode probably made it hard to eat: Yuzuha changed into human form and wolfed down the food, holding as many skewers as she could. Shin thought that in human form, her contrasting looks and actions produced a jarring impression.</p>
<p>“Delicious, indeed.”</p>
<p>A bit far from them, Tzaobath swallowed the Leviathan meat Schnee cooked. While it didn’t look like it could taste it as it ate, the dragon seemed very satisfied. The mountain-like mass of cooked meat disappeared at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>“I’d love to help too, but there’s too big of a difference in skill level between me and Schnee…”</p>
<p>Shin could cook meat too, but with skill effects kicking in, even if the finished product looked the same, the taste would be completely different.</p>
<p>After tasting Schnee’s meat, Shin’s cooking would surely taste flavorless.</p>
<p>“Bis sis’ cooking can even please the strongest of monsters!”</p>
<p>Sety looked on proudly at Schnee’s cooking results. Next to her, Tiera added new ingredients on the skewers, with a troubled look on her face.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“I knew it already, but…the difference in skill level, huh…”</p>
<p>Before going to serve Tzaobath, Schnee had cooked a few skewers herself. Tiera had tasted them, but having helped Schnee since their Tsuki no Hokora days, the difference in taste made her almost feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Shin decided to try the meat and vegetables cooked by Tiera. The taste and texture might have been inferior to Schnee’s, but despite her lack of skill, they were very delicious.</p>
<p>“….yeah, the taste is not as good, but they’re still pretty good, I think?”</p>
<p>“No need for compliments. I’ll stick to cutting the ingredients.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it like that, really. Filma, guys, you try them too.”</p>
<p>Shin asked Filma, Shibaid, and Yuzuha to try Tiera’s skewers too.</p>
<p>“No, stop, I’ll just get more depressed~!”</p>
<p>Tiera’s plea fell on deaf ears: Shin was not in the mood for joking around, after all.</p>
<p>She had not grilled many skewers, so they shared the ingredients between them. After a brief silence, Yuzuha was the first to talk.</p>
<p>“It’s not better than Schnee’s.”</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>The merciless comment inflicted damage to Tiera’s confidence.</p>
<p>“It’s as good as Sety’s, though.”</p>
<p>“Eeh!?”</p>
<p>It was Sety’s turn to be surprised now.</p>
<p>“I have the cooking skill, though…and you say that it’s the same level as mine?”</p>
<p>“That can’t be, I haven’t acquired that skill after all.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s evaluation confused both Sety and Tiera. Filma and Shibaid, however, agreed with her.</p>
<p>“That’s a shocker. It means that Tiera’s good enough to rival someone with the actual skill?”</p>
<p>“Can that even happen?”</p>
<p>Tiera and Sety tasted the skewers and had to agree that what Shin had said was true, but there were still doubts left.</p>
<p>“Could it be that Tiera actually knows the skill? She cooked at Tsuki no Hokora too after all, and after joining our travels, she’s used all sorts of ingredients.”</p>
<p>“Is it even possible to learn skills without knowing, like that?”</p>
<p>Sety countered Shin’s hypothesis with a question. Newly acquired skills had “NEW” displayed next to them on the menu, so it would be hard not to notice.</p>
<p>“Tiera was a normal person at first…okay, I’m not sure if it’s the best way to say it, but her menu couldn’t be seen. Now it’s possible though, so why don’t we check?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, just a sec.”</p>
<p>Checking the menu was a habit of players and support characters, who lived in the game era, and Chosen Ones, beings similar to players.</p>
<p>Tiera did not belong to such categories, so she was not used to doing so. In her home village, she had learned that she possessed the Priestess job just because there was someone with 【Analyze】.</p>
<p>“…eh?”</p>
<p>Tiera checked her skills, only to look like she had seen something preposterous. She looked left and right, probably because she was looking at the list.</p>
<p>“How is it now?”</p>
<p>Tiera was supposed to have just a few skills: Shin thought that was taking too much time to check her supposedly short list, so he asked her.</p>
<p>“This is weird. My Cooking skill is at IV, there are also some whip skills I never used, and the dagger skills leveled up too. I can also see magic skills I never used before.”</p>
<p>“What the?”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t help being surprised at the fact that Tiera had learned so many skills she had no recollection of. Shibaid and Filma too, of course.</p>
<p>It was a fairly bizarre situation, so they decided to talk about it after the meal.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this elven maiden, is she not an inheritor?”</p>
<p>“An inheritor?”</p>
<p>The group explained the situation to Schnee and Tzaobath too, and the dragon mentioned a term that Shin had not heard before. It appeared to share the same meaning as Chosen One.</p>
<p>“I have been told that those you call “Chosen One” have an aptitude for learning skills. Maybe the skills she has no memory of were in her possession all along?”</p>
<p>“No, when Shin taught me 【Analyze】 I checked my skills and I didn’t have so many. I have never used them during our travels either.”</p>
<p>What made it all more confusing was the presence of skills difficult to learn naturally, such as the Whip skills.</p>
<p>“So if we write them all down, it’s like this…hmm?”</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>Shin tried writing down the skills and noticed something, prompting his exclamation. Schnee inquired about it, but he shook his head, implying it was nothing. He needed to be sure before making a statement.</p>
<p>“I just don’t get it. Tiera, you were Priestess of the World Tree, or something, right? Maybe that’s related somehow?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so…I didn’t use magic or weapons often for that job after all.”</p>
<p>All members tried presenting likely theories, but could not reach a conclusion. Tiera tried using the skills, and they activated normally. They were not displayed erroneously, because of bugs or glitches, as might have happened in the game.</p>
<p>“What remains as a possibility, is that, I guess.”</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>Shin took out a fragment of the『Drop of Erathem』Filma had been sealed in for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, we didn’t tell Sety yet. When we rescued Filma, a piece of this entered Tiera and the others’ bodies. That time, their stats improved too, it…seems.”</p>
<p>Just as Shin finished speaking, the materialized fragment turned into the light and entered Sety’s body. Sety tried avoiding it out of reflex, but for some reason the Tsumugins pulled on her clothes to stop her. Sety’s body glowed in gold and silver light.</p>
<p>“….my stats went up. I could even pull off close combat now. Isn’t this, like, cheating?”</p>
<p>Sety was confused by the sudden event, then checked her status and frowned at her boosted stats. In the game, it was a boost comparable to two resurrection bonuses.</p>
<p>According to the Tsumugins, the light was something that would help Sety. They did not know exactly what it was, so they could not explain where it came from, however.</p>
<p>As far as Sety could tell, however, she had not acquired any new skills.</p>
<p>Shin had Schnee and the others check too, just in case, but they had not acquired any new skills either.</p>
<p>“It’s annoying not to know for sure, but Tiera got stronger after all, so isn’t that a good thing?”</p>
<p>Tiera was concerned, but Filma tried to take the situation in a positive light.</p>
<p>“It’s just all happening without me knowing, so it’s kind of scary.”</p>
<p>“Well, the Tsumugins said it isn’t something evil, so don’t worry too much. Better use them to your benefit instead.”</p>
<p>Shin also tried to relieve Tiera’s fears. If what he had noticed looking at the list was true, Tiera would surely benefit of the skills.</p>
<p>After a while, the group dispersed.</p>
<p>Sety then said that in times like these they needed a change of pace. Tiera asked what she meant, and Sety replied that they should take a bath.</p>
<p>“Just behind this loghouse there’s an open air bath, actually. It’s not a hot spring, but it does feel good.”</p>
<p>“That does sound nice. Let’s go then!”</p>
<p>“But wait, we still haven’t cleaned up…”</p>
<p>Tiera protested that they still had work to do, but Sety and Filma forcefully pulled her away. Shin and Shibaid agreed to clean up, so that the girls could go take a bath together.</p>
<p>“You too Schnee, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“We can at least clean up here. Take care of Tiera.”</p>
<p>“….understood.”</p>
<p>She was not as enthusiastic, but Schnee followed Tiera and the others.</p>
<p>“You too, Yuzuha.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, I go with Shin.”</p>
<p>“Go with Schnee and the others.”</p>
<p>“Boo~~”</p>
<p>“No booing.”</p>
<p>“Kuu?”</p>
<p>“No mewling either.”</p>
<p>“Hmph!”</p>
<p>Schnee and the other girls’ looks hurt when Shin had let child Yuzuha in the bath with him. If he let her grown up form in, he would surely meet retribution later.</p>
<p>After Yuzuha had run off, Tzaobath spoke to Shin.</p>
<p>“She seems quite attached…very different from the Element Tails I know.”</p>
<p>“I saved her when she was in trouble, maybe that’s the reason.”</p>
<p>Shin laughed wryly while washing the grill.</p>
<p>“I doubt that is the only reason.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I’ll know once she gets to her complete form. Normally she’s like you, a being superior to us players and—–”</p>
<p>Element Tails were originally programmed not to follow players. When she recovered her memories and power, she would probably leave Shin’s side. When Shin mentioned this possibility, however, both Shibaid and Tzaobath flatly refused to consider it.</p>
<p>“It might be strange for me to say this, as I joined later, but I doubt that will happen.”</p>
<p>“And I agree.”</p>
<p>Both of their looks seemed to mean “what the heck are you saying, man?”</p>
<p>“Come on, it’s embarrassing to think that she might have feelings for me.”</p>
<p>“I can tell. That is the face of a female that desires you.”</p>
<p>“What’s with your choice of words!? ”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t help but reacting to Tzaobath’s all too honest evaluation.</p>
<p>That night, both males and females deepened their relationships.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 3 – Part 1</p>
<p>“To think that I’d come here again.”</p>
<p>The sun had set and the moon had risen in the sky. Shin, alone, stood in front of Marino’s grave. The others were probably already asleep.</p>
<p>From the clear, cloudless sky, the moon quietly shone on the grave, the flowers surrounding it, and Shin.</p>
<p>“Hey, Marino. Is Tiera somehow connected to you?”</p>
<p>Shin naturally did not expect to hear an answer, but he could not help but ask. The skills Tiera had learned were ones Shin knew well. He had seen them often, since they were Marino’s skills.</p>
<p>She had consulted with him many times before learning some of them. It would be a different situation if the skills Tiera knew were one or two…but as far as he could remember, Tiera had all of them. It was too much to be labelled as a mere coincidence.</p>
<p>“….correct. I am inside that girl.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Shin turned around, shocked. Even if it was in his private area, it should have been impossible for anyone to sneak up on the current Shin unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Tiera…no, Marino?”</p>
<p>“Yep. It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes saw Marino’s silhouette overlap Tiera’s. Tiera, or rather, her host body was looking in the distance with a hollow gaze.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ve explained everything to her.”</p>
<p>Marino understood that Shin must have been worried about Tiera and reassured him.</p>
<p>“Is Tiera your reincarnation?”</p>
<p>“I wonder? I am just inside her. I was only able to fully comprehend it after we kissed, though.”</p>
<p>She was probably referring to what happened in Hinomoto. Shin thought that Tiera had invoked Marino’s soul, but that had apparently triggered the awakening of Marino’s soul inside her.</p>
<p>Until then her conscience had been blurry, as if she was dreaming. That too had started when Tiera became a World Tree priestess.</p>
<p>“This girl seems to be able to communicate with many things. She can create connections with things that cannot be reached normally. That might be the reason why I ended up inside her.”</p>
<p>“That’s why she became the World Tree priestess…or was made one, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But it was just a coincidence that she was born like this. Same goes for the curse. That can’t be said for her meeting with you, though.”</p>
<p>Marino talked while looking straight at Shin.</p>
<p>“After her exile, she was found by Schnee because I called for her. I thought that she could be safe in your Tsuki no Hokora. My conscience was still hazy then, so it was really lucky that my voice reached her.”</p>
<p>Marino said that since her conscience was still blurred, she could not give more concrete assistance then. Marino was the reason why Tiera had been saved, however. Shin told her that she should be proud of that.</p>
<p>“Thank you. But I helped her because I had my reasons too.”</p>
<p>“Marino?”</p>
<p>Being inside Tiera, Marino would die too if Tiera did. Tiera’s expression, however, showed that Marino meant to say something else.</p>
<p>“It’s true that I wanted to help her. But I thought that, with her powers, I could maybe talk with you again. I could tell you what I couldn’t before, the feelings lingering in me.”</p>
<p>“Lingering feelings…?”</p>
<p>Her sad expression reminded Shin of Marino’s last words. Marino had died saying “Let’s go back”. Shin could not tell what her “lingering feelings” might be.</p>
<p>“The words I said that time…are tying you down. Watching you from inside her, I thought that I left you with the wrong words.”</p>
<p>“That’s not….!!”</p>
<p>Shin wanted to protest, but Marino sealed his lips with a finger.</p>
<p>“That time, I was only thinking of myself. I didn’t even think for a moment that my words could tie you down. That’s why I want to say something again, now.”</p>
<p>Faint but gentle, such was Marino’s smile as she talked.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to work so hard anymore. You kept your promise. You saved everyone. So, don’t let my words tie you down anymore. Just do what you wish.”</p>
<p>Marino, using Tiera’s body, quietly embraced Shin and told him her feelings. Even as the person hugging him was Tiera, he felt a very nostalgic sensation.</p>
<p>“….to tell the whole truth, I don’t think I have much time left.”</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Marino stated this all too casually. Shin could not just let it go, however.</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“How can I say it…I’m like the remains of a dead conscience, now. I am fully aware now, and remember most of the time we spent together. I can exist here thanks to Tiera, but I feel that my memories are gradually getting hazy. I don’t think I’ll be able to maintain this state for more than 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>Her own existence was gradually vanishing, or so Marino concluded, calmly. She had probably already accepted it: having dispelled her last regrets, there was no trace of sadness in her.</p>
<p>“You mean you’ll…disappear?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably more correct to say that I’ll fuse with her. Tiera, originally, could have been the Chosen One meant to inherit my strength…but since I remained, she couldn’t inherit my stats and abilities, turning out as a normal person with no special powers, except the Priestess job.”</p>
<p>Marino added that if she had been gone from the start, maybe Tiera wouldn’t have been exiled from her village.</p>
<p>“Who knows, maybe it’s all as you said. But thinking about it in game terms, had Tiera been stronger, she would have just been attacked by stronger monsters. There would have been even more damage, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>The monsters summoned by 【Cursed Gift】 depended on the stats of the cursed target. While there was an upper limit, the stronger the target was, the stronger the monsters would become.</p>
<p>Marino’s avatar did not have exceptionally high stats, but they were still much higher than this world’s average citizen. The monsters summoned in such a case would be far superior to the level 200 beasts Tiera mentioned. In Tiera’s village too, there probably were those who made fighting their profession. Thanks to the absence of Marino’s stats, however, the village was likely spared extensive destruction.</p>
<p>“Is, that so??”</p>
<p>“Probably, yeah.”</p>
<p>“That’s where you say ‘definitely’, you know.”</p>
<p>“I can’t be certain, but I don’t think it’s wrong.”</p>
<p>“As always, you become a realist in the weirdest moments…”</p>
<p>Marino sighed at Shin’s unconvincing answer. Her expression then turned completely serious.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin. Do you want to go back to the former world?”</p>
<p>“I wonder. Honestly speaking, right now, half of me wants to, while the other half wants to stay.”</p>
<p>“I would have expected it to be more unbalanced. This world should be much easier for you to live in, after all.”</p>
<p>“In the beginning, I wanted to go back a lot more. But, I guess after living here for a while…I can’t just abandon everything so easily now.”</p>
<p>A world that lets you live freely. That was very attractive, of course. What was important for Shin, however, was not that.</p>
<p>“Friends, family, love. Important people, a place to back to, it’s all important. Now I have those things in both worlds.”</p>
<p>Both world contained things and people important to Shin. Choosing either had become increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>“Your love in the real world is no more, though.”</p>
<p>“Even so. I promised to go meet her, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“….ah, for heaven’s sake.”</p>
<p>Marino’s serious expression crumbled, making way for a mixture of annoyance and happiness.</p>
<p>“If you keep that up, Schnee and Tie-mghmgh”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>After saying Schnee’s name, Marino suddenly started talking gibberish. Tiera’s formerly expressionless face seemed to blush a little.</p>
<p>“I got attacked by Tiera…anyway. Schnee loves you that much, so you might as well respond to her feelings, no?”</p>
<p>Marino tried to act as if Tiera’s interruption just now had never happened and proceed with the conversation. Her expression was serious again.</p>
<p>“Schnee is a support character I created with the settings I wanted. Since you were inside Tiera, maybe you know already, but I used items to increase her affection level towards me. In a way, it’s like I brainwashed her.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t think that it was all because of the items he used, but every now and then he would be reminded of their influence.</p>
<p>“Aah…why are men like this? No, I suppose it’s just you, Shin.”</p>
<p>“Eh…? Did I say something dumb now?”</p>
<p>“Looking back on Schnee, I wouldn’t have expected you to start talking about brainwashing of all things. Those are her true feelings, get a clue already.”</p>
<p>“But she might be affected, no?”</p>
<p>“No. One hundred percent impossible. You should understand at least that.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make sense…”</p>
<p>Being a woman, she could tell, or so she surmised. Shin had no idea why Marino could say that with such confidence.</p>
<p>“I want you to be happy, Shin. I don’t know which is best for you, between staying here or going back, but I’ll tell you everything I know.”</p>
<p>“Everything you know?”</p>
<p>“After all, you were flung into this world all of a sudden. Before you said that half of you wanted to go back to the former world, but you think there’s a low probability of being able to, right?”</p>
<p>“Well yeah, I had no idea what happened, and I still don’t.”</p>
<p>The death game was supposed to end, so what happened next was completely unexpected. Even if he wanted to go back, what was he supposed to do? He didn’t have any actual clues.</p>
<p>The existence of the Boundary Guardian monster and the Sacred Places, and other unknown elements, could be key in going back. Especially the Boundary Guardian, which was very different from other monsters.</p>
<p>“About that, there probably is a way to go back.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“It mainly depends on Tiera’s powers, though. As you are now, it’s like you have two containers. One is your body in this world, in game terms the avatar, and the other…”</p>
<p>“…is my actual living body.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s the result of me and my knowledge of the former world bonding with Tiera and her powers. I think there’s a way to go back, maybe your soul, or spirit…if we can separate it, you should be able to return.”</p>
<p>According to Marino, Shin’s material body in the real world was probably pulling on Shin’s spirit with more strength.</p>
<p>“Does it mean that I’d go back to the former world if I died here?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible, but don’t even think of trying, okay? If it failed, you’d just make everyone sad.”</p>
<p>“I was just thinking out loud, no way I’m going to try.”</p>
<p>It was hardly the situation to gamble on something like that. Shin’s equipment had also the ability of resurrecting its wearer once: he wouldn’t test it, however, so he was not sure that it would activate.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what I meant to say is that you don’t have to feel pessimistic about the chances of going back to the real world.”</p>
<p>“Actually, having more possibilities is just more troublesome. If it wasn’t possible, it’d be easier to give up.”</p>
<p>“I could have just not said anything.”</p>
<p>“Are you maybe enjoying seeing me conflicted?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. But it wouldn’t be fair, right? There are people waiting for you over there, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin glared at Marino, half-jokingly, but she replied with a gentle yet strict tone. His parents, siblings, and friends were there.</p>
<p>Shin was important to Schnee and his other comrades in this world, but so was he to the people waiting for his return in the other world.</p>
<p>They were probably worried, hoping he would wake up soon. How could he ever say that they were less important than Schnee and the others?</p>
<p>“In the end, whether I go or stay, it all depends on me.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes. With this, I said all I had to. Now you just have to choose whatever would leave you with the least regrets.”</p>
<p>“You should say ‘no regrets’ there, no?”</p>
<p>“Any choice would leave you with some regrets. That’s why you’re so conflicted.”</p>
<p>Marino could see through Shin’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“Okay, it’s about time for me to disappear. Just being here like this is taxing for Tiera, after all.”</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re not going to vanish just like that, right?”</p>
<p>Shin’s question was very serious: he could tell Marino’s expression had a tinge of sadness in it.</p>
<p>“…you found out.”</p>
<p>Marino probably meant to hide it: she laughed, sheepishly.</p>
<p>“When you came here, Tiera had learned skills she didn’t know before, right? Just as you guessed, those are my skills.”</p>
<p>That was proof that Marino was about to become one with Tiera, apparently. Her very existence was vague and unstable from the start, so she could have vanished anytime.</p>
<p>“So…this is goodbye?”</p>
<p>“Honestly speaking, I don’t know. But I can’t be sure that we’ll ever meet again. So I’ll say it now…goodbye.”</p>
<p>Marino’s smile was too bright for Shin. She had accepted that she would disappear, so Shin had no way to keep her.</p>
<p>“Marino…”</p>
<p>Don’t go. Don’t disappear.</p>
<p>Shin’s words stopped in his throat, then vanished in thin air before Marino’s smile. He stretched his hands, but could only touch Tiera’s body. No matter what he did, he couldn’t hold Marino in this world. Even a High Human was powerless now.</p>
<p>He had to say something, but nothing would come out.</p>
<p>It wasn’t set in stone that this was the last time.</p>
<p>Or maybe it could be.</p>
<p>Shin’s chest tightened. Hurt.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, then. My beloved.”</p>
<p>With these last words, Marino’s silhouette overlapped Tiera’s and started shining.</p>

<p>The light was gradually absorbed by Tiera’s chest, on the side of her heart.</p>
<p>“Marino….”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Marino did not answer, simply smiling serenely. Just before she disappeared, Shin managed to wring out a feeble “goodbye”.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 3 – Part 2</p>
<p>“….hn.”</p>
<p>After the light completely disappeared, Tiera’s face regained her normal expression. As Marino had said, she was spent: she would have collapsed if Shin hadn’t held her up. He then helped her slowly sit down on the ground.</p>
<p>“Thanks for lending us your powers.”</p>
<p>“….sure.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s reply was rather weak too.</p>
<p>Tiera had interfered in the conversation once, so Shin knew that her conscience was aware throughout the possession. She had to have heard their conversation too.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, do you…………..no, forget it.”</p>
<p>Tiera started saying something, but stopped halfway. She sat, looking down, so Shin couldn’t see her expression. He could tell what she was going to ask, however.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back and take a rest. Can you walk?”</p>
<p>Shin did not answer Tiera’s half-spoken question and offered her a hand. Thanks to Marino, he felt more hopeful about the possibility of going back to the former world, which made him waver all the more.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I can’t stand on my own yet. Could you take me to my room, please?”</p>
<p>The night wind was cool enough that she would risk catching a cold if she stayed out too long. It would definitely be better for her to rest in her room, too.</p>
<p>Shin obliged to Tiera’s request and carried her to her room. Thanks to his stats, she was not a burden at all. Tiera was probably really exhausted, as she entrusted her body to Shin completely, and it adhered fairly closely to his back. Having just said farewell to Marino, Shin thought he could disregard the sensation.</p>
<p>Because of his weakened spirit, however, Shin noticed that, unlike his conscious mind, his body fully felt the warmth of Tiera’s body. He knew the reason why: he wanted to feel again the sensation of hugging Marino, which he had felt minutes ago.</p>
<p>“Shin, your back…”</p>
<p>After leaving the flower field with Marino’s grave at the center, Tiera abruptly broke their silence. Her breathing tickled Shin’s ears. Maybe because of the fatigue, her voice was like a whisper too.</p>
<p>Shin had been quietly resisting his urges, so Tiera’s sudden whisper made his heart skip a beat.</p>
<p>“My back? What about it?”</p>
<p>“I was just thinking, that it’s bigger than I imagined.”</p>
<p>“Really? I can’t tell myself…”</p>
<p>Shin replied as normally as he could, trying to hide his struggle and resisting the breath tickling his ears. Tiera continued, her head on Shin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Are all men’s backs like this? Or maybe yours is special?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I feel so calm now…just by being here, I feel all my worries disappear. Or rather, I should say that I feel really comforted.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s voice was warm, serene. It was clear that she was expressing her true feelings.</p>
<p>“I end up thinking that…I’d like to stay like this forever.”</p>
<p>“That’d be troublesome, for both of us too.”</p>
<p>Shin tried a joke, but Tiera didn’t reply. That concerned him a little, but he could hear her breathe regularly, so she had probably fallen asleep.</p>
<p>“Crap, how am I going to open the door now?”</p>
<p>Shin arrived in front of the door to Tiera’s room and realized that he could not open it while carrying her, so he changed his posture a little and managed to nudge it open.</p>
<p>Tiera’s room was simple, like Shin’s: in a space about 13 square mel wide there was a bed and not much else.</p>
<p>“Hey, wake up, we’re in your room.”</p>
<p>“……mhm.”</p>
<p>Tiera was still drowsy, so her answer was a mumble.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, are you going back to your former world?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I can’t decide.”</p>
<p>“If you can go back, then you should.”</p>
<p>“…..Tiera?”</p>
<p>Shin’s question found no answer. She was sitting on her bed, rather unsteadily, so he couldn’t tell if she was really awake or not.</p>
<p>“Your father, your mother, are waiting, right? You were born there, right? If you have a place to go back to, you should.”</p>
<p>“But that’s…”</p>
<p>“And, if you don’t, I…”</p>
<p>“Tiera? Hey, Tie…she fell asleep…”</p>
<p>Tiera collapsed on the bed and fell soundly asleep before completing her rather intriguing sentence.</p>
<p>Shin wanted to know more, but didn’t feel like waking her up. He took her shoes off, put a blanket on her, then left the room. He headed to his room and found Schnee in front of the door, a gown over her pajamas.</p>
<p>She seemed to know that he wasn’t inside and had decided to wait for him outside his room.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? It’s pretty late.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking that I’d like to talk a bit. I will come another time if you wish to sleep, however.”</p>
<p>It was pretty late at night, hardly the time to visit other people’s rooms. Shin had already noticed that Schnee was waiting, when he checked the map while carrying Tiera back to her room. She was probably waiting while Shin was talking to Marino too.</p>
<p>“Well, some stuff happened, but that’s okay. Come in.”</p>
<p>Shin opened the door to his room and let Schnee inside. He changed in to his tracksuit — his usual joke equipment — as well.</p>
<p>“It seems you were talking to Tiera, but did something happen? She looked different than usual when she left, so I was a bit concerned.”</p>
<p>“You probably forgot this too, but Tiera is a World Tree Priestess, a being quite rare in this world too. Thanks to her powers, she can recall the souls of the dead and let them possess her.”</p>
<p>“The souls of the dead? Which means that you were talking to someone other than Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Something like that. This time, it wasn’t just a simple possession.”</p>
<p>Shin’s assent turned Schnee’s expression sour.</p>
<p>“Who in the world were you talking to, then?”</p>
<p>“Marino. I told you about her, right? She was my lover.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I recall you mentioning her. I had a sudden headache then, I was really surprised.”</p>
<p>“Same here. Or rather, we were even more surprised.”</p>
<p>Schnee had clutched her head in pain the instant she heard the word lover. Shin too was shocked, wondering what had happened to her.</p>
<p>“So, what did you talk with that Marino?”</p>
<p>“Well, about…many things.”</p>
<p>Thinking about Schnee’s feelings, maybe it was better to hide it. Keeping things hidden, however, can sometimes happen at the worst of timings. In such cases, the situation turns even worse than expected.</p>
<p>Such things happen with terribly precise timing in fiction and would be catastrophic in reality.</p>
<p>“…after saying not to hide anything, I can’t be the one to do it, can I.”</p>
<p>When Schnee had kept quiet about the PK matter, Shin had told her not to keep secrets anymore. He thus thought that he shouldn’t keep secrets either, so he told her everything about his conversation with Marino, after mentally reorganizing it.</p>
<p>Marino was becoming one with Tiera.</p>
<p>Because of this, it was possible that Marino’s conscience disappeared.</p>
<p>Tiera had inherited Marino’s abilities.</p>
<p>There was a high chance that it was possible for Shin to return to his home world.</p>
<p>“Is, that so…”</p>
<p>After listening to Shin, Schnee looked down, a hand covering her mouth. It was very possible for her master to go away forever. It couldn’t be a pleasant prospect for her.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what to say. Schnee would probably be reassured if he told her he was going to stay in that world, but his heart wasn’t set. He couldn’t say anything lightly.</p>
<p>“My lord…”</p>
<p>Still looking down, Schnee grabbed Shin’s tracksuit and buried her head in his chest.</p>
<p>“I want you to stay. For us….for me, there is no one but you.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s words could barely be heard. Her back was shaking slightly.</p>
<p>“Schnee…”</p>
<p>“I know it is a selfish thing to say. But even so, I want you to stay here, Shin.”</p>
<p>Shin was surprised.</p>
<p>A few days had passed since Schnee lost her memories. Her reaction now, however, was much too similar to her former self. Maybe it was because of the blessed tag, or the effects of the cursed tag were decreasing. It wasn’t clearly visible yet, but Schnee was going back to normal.</p>
<p>Shin simply waited, silently. Schnee let go of his tracksuit and looked up at him. Something was glowing in her eyes.</p>
<p>“…..I apologize. I lost control for a moment.”</p>
<p>“It’s my fault for not being able to find an answer yet. You don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“No, for a servant such as I to limit my lord’s actions is the height of arrogance.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to go that far, okay? Oh, yeah, didn’t you have something to talk to me about?”</p>
<p>It would be pointless to tell her not to worry about it any more, so Shin decided to change the subject.</p>
<p>“I have reacted several times to words that the original me is supposed to care deeply about, haven’t I? When you used the blessed tag, I have recovered some memories, albeit very little, so I thought that if I talked with you I might remember more.”</p>
<p>She was probably referring to when she had experienced sudden headaches or felt abruptly sick.</p>
<p>“I see. How much you have remembered…is hard to put in words, I guess. For example, what kind of things did you remember?”</p>
<p>Shin tried to ask with different words.</p>
<p>“Mainly small things that happened before your return. But the things I remembered the most are my feelings towards you, my lord…no, Shin.”</p>
<p>“Your feelings for me?”</p>
<p>She was just like the former Schnee now. Shin was happy to know that she remembered about her thoughts for him.</p>
<p>“As I am now…there is the Schnee that is your servant and the Schnee that loves you, together in the same body, I should say. Just by being with you like this, I am filled with indescribable joy. Yet…”</p>
<p>Schnee’s words stopped mid sentence.</p>
<p>Silently, her hands stretched to touch Shin’s cheeks. Slowly, as if touching something dangerous, her fingers traced his cheeks, as if to make sure he was really there.</p>
<p>“A part of me thinks that if I really treasure you, I should let you go. A part that thinks that I should cast away this happiness.”</p>
<p>I am confused, conflicted. So continued Schnee.</p>
<p>“Just touching you like this is something like a miracle, but I find myself desiring more.”</p>
<p>“I find myself desiring to be loved.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s gown fell from her shoulders. Her semi-transparent nightgown, which Shin had never seen before, was revealed. The moonlight from the window was enough for Shin to see Schnee clearly. It had caught his interest since they were outside the room, but now that Schnee’s silhouette was so clearly before him, Shin couldn’t help but swallow his breath.</p>
<p>“Are you, excited?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s face was close. The voice he was supposed to be used to hearing now had a sensual tinge to it.</p>
<p>“What are you…”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you do not understand?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s gaze clearly expressed how she would never believe that.</p>
<p>She put her arms around Shin and held her body against his. The confused Shin easily fell under her weight. Her face was close, he could feel her warm breath. Gravity pushed her glossy silver hair on Shin’s face, forcing him to see nothing but Schnee.</p>
<p>That was not everything, though: Schnee’s chest also pressed against Shin’s. That softness, coupled with the moan of glee Schnee emitted when they fell together, strongly attacked Shin’s capacity for rational thinking.</p>
<p>“Schnee, what’s going on with you, really-”</p>
<p>Shin managed not to be carried away by the mood and removed Schnee from him. After a brief opposition, her arms let go too.</p>
<p>Schnee was still on top of him, but the dangerous atmosphere was successfully repelled. Schnee’s change, however, was more of a concern for Shin.</p>
<p>“Schnee? Hey, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>The instant after Shin was relieved of distancing her body from his, Schnee held her head with her hands, apparently in terrible pain. That was probably the reason why she stopped resisting: judging from her frown, it was something Schnee didn’t expect either.</p>
<p>“I’m okay, it will go away soon.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that, this happened without us knowing too?”</p>
<p>Shin had witnessed it just a few times. There was the possibility that Schnee hid it, in order not to worry them.</p>
<p>“I’m alright now.”</p>
<p>After less than 5 minutes, the pain in Schnee’s expression subdued. At the very least, she did not seem to be lying. In such a situation, however, she couldn’t just pick up from where they left off. Schnee seemed to still be in pain: Shin touched her cheek and found it very hot.</p>
<p>“You did something like that despite being sick?”</p>
<p>“There is no obstacle to my activity. The fever will go away soon as well. This is more important now.”</p>
<p>”That’s not good. Just go rest. I’m not….going anywhere soon. We can talk another time.”</p>
<p>After a bit of difficulty finding the right words, Shin sat up and put his arms behind Schnee’s back and knees. Maybe because of the fever, she barely resisted to being lifted like that.</p>
<p>“I am truly sorry. It appears I lacked proper judgment.”</p>
<p>“Well…yeah, that was way too proactive for the usual Schnee.”</p>
<p>“Thinking of using my body to snare you was simply too shallow. I understand how foolish it was now, but moments before it seemed like the only way.”</p>
<p>Weakly, Schnee added that she didn’t know why she did that.</p>
<p>“Maybe your half-returned memories are having weird effects on you. I’m sorry, just have a bit more patience. We’ll knock out that evil god in no time.”</p>
<p>Shin regretted a little having relied on a 50% chance and not hunting down the evil deity right away. It would have been difficult to do when Schnee just lost her memories, though.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t gone to Rashugum to look for ingredients for the blessed tag, they wouldn’t have obtained the assistance of Tzaobath or Sety, after all.</p>
<p>“Anyway, see you tomor–”</p>
<p>“Please wait!”</p>
<p>Shin had laid Schnee on her bed and was about to leave, when she called to him. He turned around and kneeled beside the bed. Schnee’s right hand poked out of her blankets.</p>
<p>“Could you please…hold my hand, until I fall asleep?”</p>
<p>Said Schnee, half her face buried in the blankets, her aggressiveness from moments ago completely gone somewhere, the ears poking from her hair blazing red.</p>
<p>“…okay, that’s an easy request.”</p>
<p>Shin’s hand covered Schnee’s. Maybe because of the fever, her hand felt hot till the fingertips.</p>
<p>“Am I being…childish?”</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t that fine? To act a little spoiled at times like these, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Right…when I turn back…can I…as…aga….?”</p>
<p>“Sure, I promise.”</p>
<p>Shin pieced together the fragments of Schnee’s question and promised. Schnee felt relieved, or was maybe too exhausted: she fell asleep almost immediately. Thinking it would be weird to just stay there staring at her, Shin left the room, with some regret.</p>
<p>“Even in a state like that, she thinks about me…”</p>
<p>To stay or to go. Knowing that both were possible, Shin was lost as never before. However, it was also true that Marino’s words tipped the scales.</p>
<p>He couldn’t answer Schnee’s question because he wasn’t ready to cut off either of the possibilities. Because he couldn’t be sure that Schnee’s feelings were true.</p>
<p>“But I guess that’s just an excuse.”</p>
<p>As Marino had firmly stated, thinking that Schnee’s feelings were due to the affection raising items would be akin to insulting her.</p>
<p>Shin could have been unconsciously looking for a reason to go back to his former world.</p>
<p>“Putting things into words is really hard…”</p>
<p>What happened until now, what will happen in the future. If he started thinking again there was no end to it. Eventually, Shin reached the conclusion that he thought would leave no regrets. Or rather he had reached it already.</p>
<p>When he said goodnight to Schnee, he stopped for a moment because he was thinking of saying it already, but ultimately couldn’t.</p>
<p>The words that would cut his connections died in his throat.</p>
<p>“I have to tell her properly once she turns back.”</p>
<p>When Shin thought what would be the decision that brought him less regrets, the first thing that appeared in his mind were Schnee’s words when they met again: “Welcome back”.</p>
<p>The feeling of “having returned home” he felt then. The answer had probably appeared then and there.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Schnee. Give me just one more night.”</p>
<p>So whispered Shin while looking in the direction of Schnee’s room.</p>
<p>He learned the next morning, however, that he did not have any such time left.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 3 – Part 3</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>After falling asleep holding Shin’s hand, Schnee woke up in a field of flowers. On a small hill basked in light, she saw flowers she seemed to remember, lulled by the wind.</p>
<p>She quickly knew where she was. She had visited it for the first time, but Shin’s shocked expression and actions impressed her deeply.</p>
<p>It was the place where Shin’s lover rested.</p>
<p>—Yes, the place that reminds you of the woman that continues to live in your heart.—</p>
<p>“My body…!”</p>
<p>She could turn her head enough to look at the surroundings. Her body, however, was lying on the ground and would not move. It did not budge an inch, no matter how much she tried, as if she were tied to the ground.</p>
<p>Even if she had been affected by a binding skill, Schnee, in her current state, could easily break out of it, even if she had to move the ground itself. However, she couldn’t move her arms at all.</p>
<p>“What are you doing there?”</p>
<p>“…my lord?”</p>
<p>While struggling to regain her freedom, Schnee heard the voice of her beloved master, Shin.</p>
<p>Yuzuha was on his shoulder, Tiera next to him.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you behind if you don’t get a move on.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Shin walked past her, heading for the top of the hill. He didn’t seem to care about Schnee’s situation at all.</p>
<p>Tiera was walking right next to him. Upon closer inspection, someone’s shadow seemed to be overlapping her silhouette.</p>
<p>“Kh!”</p>
<p>No, that is my place. Those were the words that surfaced in Schnee’s heart as she watched them. Schnee tried desperately to stand up, but her limbs would not move, as if she was paralyzed.</p>
<p>—-Within that elf, inhabits your lord’s loved one. Naturally, she walks at his side—-</p>
<p>“My lord!”</p>
<p>Shin did not react to Schnee’s yell. He spoke to Tiera, smiling, as they climbed the hill. On top of the hill, a view that Schnee had never seen before appeared.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>She had heard about it.</p>
<p>A large human construct, so big it was hardly possible to imagine it really existed, a skyscraper.</p>
<p>An intricate structure supported by steel and powered by electricity, something that not even magic could replicate.</p>
<p>Clothes she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Metal carts that moved without horses.</p>
<p>Bridges spanning within the city, people walking on them.</p>
<p>A world without magic or monsters. A world that, despite this, created weapons that could kill millions at once. That was the “real world” that High Humans like Shin spoke about. The place Shin and Tiera were walking towards.</p>
<p>—-That is a place you cannot reach. You will be left behind—</p>
<p>“Wait!!”</p>
<p>Schnee screamed. Shin was going back to his former world. I have to go to him.</p>
<p>As she thought so, the binds tying her arms and legs vanished. Even before she could think, Schnee ran.</p>
<p>Shin and Tiera were walking a few dozens mel ahead: with her speed, Schnee would have reached them in seconds. The distance between them did not shrink, though: on the contrary, it grew wider and wider.</p>
<p>“Why!?”</p>
<p>Why can’t I reach them?</p>
<p>No matter how hard I kick the ground, the scenery does not change. No matter how much I stretch my arms, they will not reach Shin. Frustration, irritation mounting. I can see them yet I cannot reach them.</p>
<p>—You will never reach him. You will never get closer. You are not fitting—</p>
<p>“Don’t go!!”</p>
<p>Schnee couldn’t hold back her shout.</p>
<p>I have to slow him down, even just a little.</p>
<p>Her pleas, however, did not even reach Shin.</p>
<p>“Ah!?!”</p>
<p>Her body stopped responding again. She collapsed in the dirt and mud of the ground.</p>
<p>As if deriding her crawling efforts, what Schnee saw, when she finally managed to raise her head, was Shin and Tiera stepping into the other world. They were swallowed by the light before her.</p>
<p>“No….”</p>
<p>She was not chosen. He did not stay. It was one of the worst futures she could imagine.</p>
<p>“Noooooooooo!!!!”</p>
<p>Schnee screams, her hands grasping for the light. They did not reach. It was too late.</p>
<p>The light before her grew hazy because of the tears. The next instant, she woke up.</p>
<p>“….h….h…”</p>
<p>For a second, she couldn’t remember where she was.</p>
<p>Using 【Night Sight】, she could see her stretched hand and the ceiling above it.</p>
<p>After her quickly beating heart and ragged breath calmed down, Schnee sat up.</p>
<p>“I was dreaming…?”</p>
<p>After a moment of relief, Schnee remembered the content of the dream and looked around her. There was no one else in the room. Shin wasn’t there either, naturally.</p>
<p>“That…can’t have happened, right…?”</p>
<p>Schnee whispered while holding the right hand that Shin had held until she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Her fear wouldn’t go away. She thought she heard very ominous words.</p>
<p>“So cold…”</p>
<p>Her right hand retained nothing of the previous warmth. Her own hands seemed to have turned into ice.</p>
<p>“Shin”</p>
<p>Schnee called the name of her beloved. Not as her creator or her master.</p>
<p>That sensation was proof of her feelings, as one person, as one woman.</p>
<p>Or at least, it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>She couldn’t be sure of her feelings. Probably because of the cursed tag, she retained little of her memories and feelings.</p>
<p>When she called Shin’s name, she partly felt she was being disrespectful. That was her feeling as a servant, not something that was part of her original self.</p>
<p>Her original self called Shin’s name with affection. There was no sense of duty in that.</p>
<p>“Shin….Shin…”</p>
<p>Schnee got off her bed, left her room and headed towards Shin’s.</p>
<p>Her conscience gradually grew hazier, her senses dulled, her body unstable. So cold. Freezing.</p>
<p>—-If you cannot let him go, just make him yours—</p>
<p>Someone’s voice reacher her ears. She had heard it before.</p>
<p>But where?</p>
<p>Schnee did not know.</p>
<p>“Make him…mine…”</p>
<p>Schnee was supposed to be going towards Shin’s room, but all of a sudden found herself outside the log house. Her body was taking her to the exit of the faerie village.</p>
<p>—If you do so, the one you so desire will be forever by your side—</p>
<p>“Forever…by my side…”</p>
<p>For Schnee, those words were too sweet a temptation. She did not want to even think about being apart from him. She did not want to even imagine he could be gone forever. She wanted him to touch her. To love her.</p>
<p>—-even if as a silent corpse—</p>
<p>The words spoken by the mysterious voice did not reach Schnee anymore.</p>
<p>Her heart was plunged in such chaos and confusion that she could not tell what she was feeling anymore. Even in such a state, her legs moved steady, as if they had a mind of their own.</p>
<p>Wrapped in her alluring nightgown, Schnee disappeared from the faerie village.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Schnee had disappeared. Cruelly enough, the first to find out was Shin, who wanted to tell her the words he failed to utter the night before.</p>
<p>“Schnee is gone!? Are you serious!?”</p>
<p>“Calm down Filma, you’ve heard that already too.”</p>
<p>After making sure that Schnee was really gone, Shin relayed the information to the rest via Mind Chat. Even so, she couldn’t help asking.</p>
<p>For Filma, Schnee was someone very special.</p>
<p>“There’s no response in the faerie village. I think…she went outside.”</p>
<p>“But why? There was no sign about any of this last night…!”</p>
<p>Filma didn’t let Shin out of her sight. She was sure that if Schnee had done something unexpected, he must have been connected somehow.</p>
<p>“Shin. Did something happen to Schnee after dinner?”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s question put everyone’s thoughts into words.</p>
<p>Even Tzaobath, who was the least involved one in the group, had perceived that Shin and Schnee shared a particular relationship.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, did something happen after that…?”</p>
<p>“…yeah, that’s right. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, so I’ll give you the general gist.”</p>
<p>Shin told everyone about Marino’s possession of Tiera and his conversation with Schnee afterwards.</p>
<p>“Why….”</p>
<p>Filma whispered, her body shaking. The next instant, she pressed Shin for answers.</p>
<p>“Why couldn’t you tell her that you’ll stay!!”</p>
<p>“Filma!”</p>
<p>Shibaid stopped Filma from grabbing Shin and lifting him. He was physically stronger, but she didn’t let go. Both exerted their power without reserve.</p>
<p>“Why are you stopping me, Shibaid!?”</p>
<p>“Staying here means throwing away his homeland. That isn’t something you can decide so easily!”</p>
<p>Shibaid had left his country out of loyalty for Shin. He could still return, but he had chosen Shin over his country and had told some of his closer followers that there was the possibility that they would be enemies in the future.</p>
<p>Because of this, he could understand Shin’s struggle to a degree.</p>
<p>Filma let her arms drop after hearing Shibaid’s words.</p>
<p>“That’s…that’s true too, but…”</p>
<p>“You lot, there is something you should be doing now before quarrelling among yourselves, is there not?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath spoke next. The group was on the log house’s terrace, so Tzaobath could participate in the conversation too.</p>
<p>Shin and the others knew that looking for Schnee was more important than standing there talking: Filma probably couldn’t hold back anyway.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk again once we’re back.”</p>
<p>Filma took a deep breath to calm down, then clapped her own cheeks.</p>
<p>“Let’s go find big sis Schnee then. We’ll need some transport first of all…can you give us a hand, Tzaobath?”</p>
<p>Sety asked Tzaobath to carry them, as casually as if she was asking it to help with shopping. It happened when they first arrived in the faerie village too, so apparently they shared that kind of relationship.</p>
<p>“The evil deity is involved, thus I could not possibly ignore this. I shall assist you.”</p>
<p>“Transport first? Do you already have an idea where she could be?”</p>
<p>As far as Shin could remember, Sety never learned any stealth skills such as 【Tracing】. It would have required long and strenuous effort to train it to usable levels, but considering the time Shin was absent, it wasn’t impossible.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. I asked the Tsumugins and they said that the cursed tag’s presence left the village. They also said they’ll show us the way.”</p>
<p>“I see. We’ll try to locate Schnee with our skills too, if both point the same way, there’ll be no mistake.”</p>
<p>Schnee was Shin’s support character, so he could find her position or at least the general direction she was in on his map. The same could be said for the other support characters, but messages could not be sent until Shin actually met them.</p>
<p>“May we go right away?”</p>
<p>Shin asked Tzaobath for confirmation and the latter nodded.</p>
<p>“I am ready anytime. You need not address me so politely either. We will be comrades in arms from now on. It would not sit well with me to be treated so by someone I have entrusted my back to.”</p>
<p>“Understood…no, got it. Then I’ll do as you say. Sety, are you ready?”</p>
<p>Shin accepted Tzaobath’s proposal, then checked on Sety.</p>
<p>“I can go whenever too. To bring big sis back to normal, I’m ready to do pretty much anything!”</p>
<p>Sety beat her chest as she proudly made her statement. The others shared her same feelings, even if they didn’t put them into words. Filma was especially brimming with killing intent towards the evil deity.</p>
<p>“While her memories might be faulty, the girl is still a High Elf. To be able to manipulate her, the enemy surely is the evil deity itself. Have you thought of any countermeasures yet?”</p>
<p>“Please wait. Let me check what I remember.”</p>
<p>Spurred by Tzaobath’s warning, Shin gathered what he remembered about the evil deity Adetropos.</p>
<p>The first thing he remembered is that Adetropos used attacks that caused mental status abnormalities. 【Confusion】, 【High Confusion】, 【Charm】, and 【Brainwash】: the monster’s greatest and most dangerous characteristic was its tendency to fire barrages of such spells. It was even capable of generating fields that reduced the effects of status effect prevention skills and equipment by one stage.</p>
<p>Many complained about the Adetropos event, as it was more likely to be defeated by one’s own allies than the boss itself.</p>
<p>“Hand me your accessories everyone, I’ll upgrade them.”</p>
<p>Shin made this request after explaining his strategy against Adetropos. The 『Age of Gods Earrings』 Shibaid and Filma had equipped, which normally prevented status ailments, would be reduced to just increasing defenses against them when facing Adetropos: they wouldn’t be enough to prevent negative statuses.</p>
<p>In the game there was a limit to the number of equippable accessories, so players would focus on strengthening defenses or preventing only certain status effects. They would split the statuses among the party members, to prevent the danger of all members being affected at the same time.</p>
<p>In the current world, however, accessories could be powered up more than in the game era and there was no equipping limit anymore: they could take more extensive countermeasures.</p>
<p>“Filma, Shibaid, and Sety can equip multiple boosted 『Age of Gods Earrings』. With them you won’t be affected by status ailments unless something really unexpected happens. Tiera, you can’t equip the 『Age of Gods Earrings』 because of your stats, but we’ll make do with numbers.”</p>
<p>Shin thought about countermeasures for Tiera while upgrading the 『Age of Gods Earrings』. If she couldn’t count on quality, they had to rely on quantity.</p>
<p>Earrings, necklaces, rings, bracelets, hairpins, etc. Shin would have her wear more accessories, as long as they didn’t make it harder for her to fight. He tried attaching a few rings to a chain, thus turning them into a necklace, and they all retained their effects, so he used that method too. Shin also added a protection to the Geyl coin Tiera used as necklace, for added insurance.</p>
<p>“OK, Tiera should be alright now. So only Yuzuha and Kagerou are left. You can’t use the earrings either, so…”</p>
<p>“Kuu, I can. I want the ear thing.”</p>
<p>“You can?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, from Shin’s shoulder, pointed at Filma’s earrings.</p>
<p>She had worn equipment when they entered the underwater cave to go save Hermie, but that was equipment made for partner monsters.</p>
<p>『Age of Gods Earrings』 were made for players and support characters, so Shin hadn’t considered them for equipment Yuzuha could use. Besides, as far as Shin remembered, Divine Beasts were unaffected by skills causing mental status effects. In a way, they were natural enemies for the evil deity.</p>
<p>Yuzuha had still not regained her complete form, however, so Shin decided to give her the item, just in case. He gave her the boosted 『Age of Gods Earrings』 and another item to strengthen defenses against negative status effects. Yuzuha turned into human form and wore them.</p>
<p>“I see, you can use them like that.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, perfect.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha puffed out her chest proudly, then turned back to fox mode. The earrings covered part of her ears, and other items also transformed in a way as to not to get in the way of her movements. They were mostly covered by her fur and not visible, but Shin could tell that Yuzuha was still equipping them.</p>
<p>“Next is Kagerou. You can’t do the same thing Yuzuha did, so we’ll just use a necklace.”</p>
<p>It was a pretty classic method for four-legged monsters. Other types included attaching accessories to their legs or tails. Kagerou did not resist at all as Shin equipped the accessories. Afterwards, it made a few small jumps and ran a little, in order to check if they would inconvenience its movements.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask just in case, but do you need anything, Tzaobath? I’m not sure if you could equip my items though.”</p>
<p>“Do man-made items have an effect on me?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? But it seems they do on Yuzuha and Kagerou, so I think the possibility is there.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Then I shall request the same mental protection items you gave to the Element Tail. To be manipulated by that would be a worse humiliation than losing to it.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath spoke, sparks of fire burning in his breath. It was usually calmly imposing, but when it came to the evil deity, even the dragon would lose its temper.</p>
<p>“Earrings…wouldn’t work, I guess. Could you try wearing them as bracelets or rings?”</p>
<p>Thinking that a collar would be out of the question, Shin did not even mention the possibility.</p>
<p>The size of equippable items could be adjusted, so they were supposed to grow larger or smaller automatically, but nothing happened when Shin gave them to Tzaobath.</p>
<p>“Hmm, no reaction?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t any partner monsters your size after all. Maybe the size adjustment range has limits? If so, there’s not much I….ah!”</p>
<p>Shin took the item back from Tzaobath and took out another item card.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“A paint-type accessory. Drawing a pattern on the body’s surface applies a magic enchantment.”</p>
<p>In the game era, it was used as a fashion item. It could be applied anywhere on the body and did not interfere with other equipment. Paint-types too, however, used up one accessory slot, so most players usually used more effective earring, bracelet, or hair ornament types.</p>
<p>“I see, it is applied on the skin, so size is not a concern. Let us try it then.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath nimbly took the item card with its claws and materialized it. Once the pattern that appeared in midair was placed anywhere on the body, the item was equipped.</p>
<p>“This seems to be working…I feel something covering my whole body. Can you tell?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can. So paint-types work well with large sized creatures…I’ll keep it in mind.”</p>
<p>Paint-types were less effective than other accessories, but there was next to no chance of them being destroyed. Even if the arm the pattern was placed on was severed, items or Divine skills could restore both the arm and the pattern. This wouldn’t work with rings or armbands, however: if they were destroyed, they were almost impossible to restore mid-battle, barring very high auto-restoring abilities.</p>
<p>For added insurance, Shin added paint-type accessories to the rest of the group too.</p>
<p>“Attach them wherever you like, and the effect will activate.”</p>
<p>Shin then added a paint-type just above the left side of his chest. As he did, the painted pattern passed through his clothes and attached itself to his skin. He chose to apply it to his chest as, unlike arms or legs, it was a part less likely to be lost. Like Shin, Filma and the others applied the patterns to their chest too.</p>
<p>Shin, Shibaid, and Sety had little exposed skin, so the patterns couldn’t be seen, but Filma and Tiera’s chests were more visible, so the flowery patterns were partly visible.</p>
<p>Yuzuha turned into human form again to apply the patterns, then turned back to small fox mode. That form was more comfortable for her apparently.</p>
<p>Kagerou lay down on its back as Tiera applied the pattern.</p>
<p>“Okay, now all preparations are done. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The group ate a quick breakfast with food Shin had ready in the item box, then climbed on Tzaobath’s back. The faerie village, without Sety maintaining it, would probably disappear soon after she left. It was also Shin’s private area, however, so it was possible to turn it into a card and carry it. When he did, maybe because he turned the area into a card, or maybe he was the original owner, the burden of the preservation shifted on Shin.</p>
<p>“What is the direction?”</p>
<p>“That way, straight north-north-west.”</p>
<p>Sety asked the Tsumugins, then pointed towards a point in the sky. Shin’s 【Tracing】 showed the same direction.</p>
<p>“Wait for us, Schnee, we’ll arrive in no time!”</p>
<p>Shin whispered while glaring at the direction the evil deity was thought to be.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 4 – Part 1</p>
<p>The dragon instantly soared high into the sky, clearing away the clouds in its passing, ultimately reaching a height other flying monsters rarely flew at. The party rode on Tzaobath in the following order: Sety first, as guide, Shin behind her, as he also could tell which direction to go, followed by Tiera, Filma, and lastly Shibaid.</p>
<p>“No one fell off, right?”</p>
<p>Shin had already checked the map, but turned around to look just in case. He knew that riding on Tzaobath without any protection would be risky, so he had set up a barrier to protect all passengers from the wind and any bird or insect collisions. Even then, they sped through the air at an incredible rate.</p>
<p>Tzaobath had risen so quickly that during its ascent many birds and insects had been knocked off their paths by the barrier. Had Shin not put up the barrier, high STR members like him, Filma, and Shibaid would have been fine, but Tiera would have been thrown off their dragon steed easily.</p>
<p>In terms of STR, the mage-type Sety would have been in danger too.</p>
<p>“….it looks like we’re in a different world.”</p>
<p>Tiera slowly opened her eyes to look down, with a mixture of excitement and surprise plus a streak of terror. The scenery that spread before her was surely very different compared to anything she had experienced before this. The ground, usually firmly supporting her from below, was no more: more than half of her field of view was now colored blue. The ground was so far that she almost couldn’t believe that she had been standing there just moments before.</p>
<p>Tiera had ridden Elder Dragons before, but Tzaobath’s speed and height were a whole other experience. Shin felt that they were now flying in a place where only very few flying organisms could, which surely made it seem like a whole new world.</p>
<p>“It’s rare to be able to look down at the earth from this high. The rideable monsters can’t fly this high, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>He had ridden on flying monsters several times during events, but their current speed and height far outstripped anything he had experienced in the past. Their search would take much less time than expected.</p>
<p>“This feels just so unreal. I can’t even imagine what would happen if I fell off.”</p>
<p>The current situation seemed to exceed the limits of Tiera’s imagination. It was a normal response for someone without any experience riding flying monsters. When encountering a situation beyond one’s comprehension, normal people could find it difficult to even think.</p>
<p>“If you feel sick, just say it, all right?”</p>
<p>While not to the same degree as Tiera, Filma and Shibaid also seemed somewhat tense.</p>
<p>Shin had flown on airplanes in his home world, so he wasn’t as greatly affected, but the current situation could be stressful to this world’s denizens.</p>
<p>If they fell from this height, not even Shin’s support characters would be unscathed.</p>
<p>Some people felt sick when flying on a plane, even if they were not afraid of high places, so Shin warned his companions before anything happened.</p>
<p>“We’re really going fast. Won’t we arrive in no time, at this pace?”</p>
<p>Sety mumbled while looking ahead, the Tsumugins clinging to her.</p>
<p>“Can you tell the distance?”</p>
<p>“So said the Tsumugins, at least. Besides if we go this fast we can cross the whole continent in one day.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s flying speed did not come only from its wings: it was also affected by magic and skill effects, as one might expect in a fantasy world. Tzaobath’s unique abilities, however, were not the most important concern to Shin right now.</p>
<p>As long as he could reach Schnee’s location as soon as possible, he didn’t care if he was riding a monster, a jet, or anything else.</p>
<p>“We just need to go straight like this, and we’ll arrive in…about 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>Sety spoke after confirming the time with the Tsumugins. The exact distance was still a bit vague. As she said, however, they would reach their destination in about 20 minutes: Schnee’s marker appeared in Shin’s detection range.</p>
<p>“It’s over there in that area surrounded by mountains!”</p>
<p>The location Shin pointed at was to the north of the middle of the Eltnia continent. It was a plain area surrounded by rather tall mountains, though there were not enough mountains to form a chain. It was an area with thick vegetation and tall trees, but a single spot seemed to have been carved by something. As the flora was different too, that might have been the spot Tzaobath had blasted away previously. Maybe because of the evil deity’s presence, heavy clouds hung over the mountains, making the locations appear much darker than its surroundings.</p>
<p>“So this is the place.”</p>
<p>“Do you recall anything?”</p>
<p>“Yes, among the places I destroyed, this had the largest number of Kishimi tribe members. To think that the origin of everything was here…I am to blame for not bringing it all to an end back then.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath’s tone was filled with anger. The scales covering the dragon’s body began glowing in response to its growing excitement.</p>
<p>“I understand your feelings well enough, but wait until we’ve rescued Schnee. You can do whatever you want after that.”</p>
<p>“My apologies, I’ve let my feelings take over for a moment. I’ll descend now, but anything could happen. Keep your guard up.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath urged the party to be careful while focused on their destination. They had managed to reach it in less than a hour thanks to Tzaobath. No matter how high Schnee’s stats were, considering how much time had passed since she had left Shin, she had moved a distance far too great for her abilities. Shin didn’t know if she had tamed a flying monster or was teleported, but the possibility that the evil deity was in wait was very high.</p>
<p>“In any case…there’s really nothing here.”</p>
<p>Small trees grew here and there, but there was literally nothing else. Any buildings had probably been blasted away, not even leaving debris behind.</p>
<p>“Schnee’s presence…is over there.”</p>
<p>“The Tsumugins are saying the same thing.”</p>
<p>The direction Shin and the Tsumugins pointed toward was the very center of the crater.</p>
<p>The group decided to land at a certain distance away, just in case.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like there’s anything there though.”</p>
<p>“It is either hidden, or underground.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid spoke while eyeing the crater.</p>
<p>Shin looked in its direction too. He activated the 【See Through】 skill to neutralize any concealment or camouflage effects, but nothing changed in his field of view. There was nothing in hiding there, apparently.</p>
<p>Shin then narrowed his field of detection, thus increasing its precision.</p>
<p>“Looks like there really is something underground. I can’t tell how wide it is, but it seems to be pretty deep.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s presence came from a rather deep location. It did not seem to be moving. Shin couldn’t tell if it wasn’t moving or could not move, but there was no mistake that it was there.</p>
<p>“So even if the aboveground part had been destroyed, the structures underground remained. We have no choice but to have Tzaobath wait here then.”</p>
<p>“Ngh…I cannot reduce my body’s size, after all. It cannot be helped…I shall stay here and watch the surroundings. Do let me know if anything happens.”</p>
<p>Being unable to change his body size, Tzaobath could not explore underground easily, as it couldn’t go through the corridors.</p>
<p>After calming down Tzaobath’s fury at the evil deity’s countermeasure, Shin and the group headed towards the center of the crater.</p>
<p>“Must be here. It’s buried, but 【Magic Sonar】’s response is different.”</p>
<p>Sety had closed her eyes to concentrate on the ground, then announced her discovery with confidence. Shin examined the location too and found out that it was indeed different from the rest of the area.</p>
<p>“It would be a waste of time to dig a hole, should we just blow it up?”</p>
<p>“What!? Do you realize how dangerous that sounds? I can remove this much ground in a snap, just step back!”</p>
<p>Shin was ready to unleash his magic, but Sety stopped him. After Schnee’s disappearance, he was maybe acting a bit different than the usual.</p>
<p>“I’ll create an entrance, then.”</p>
<p>Sety held her hands over the ground that was supposedly covering the entrance, which started moving by itself, as if giant arms were sweeping it away, and gradually formed a small hill next to the entrance.</p>
<p>“Is this magic?”</p>
<p>“Just a variation of 【Earth Wall】. Ever since the Dusk of Majesty, it’s been possible to modify spells and apply them to various situations.”</p>
<p>According to Sety, this change did not only apply to magic: it had become possible to change martial skills too, to reduce the burden on the user or give them different effects.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The newly formed cavity leading underground was about three mel tall and two mel wide. It was not exactly large, but Shin stepped inside without hesitation. Sunlight illuminated the entrance just slightly, but thanks to 【Night Vision】 Shin could proceed with confidence.</p>
<p>“I see, so this is a secret dungeon.”</p>
<p>Shin saw the hostile response on the map and recalled knowledge about the existence of such a dungeon. Information about it had been shared on the game’s bulletin board, but there were conditions for it to appear, so Shin was actually seeing one for the first time.</p>
<p>“Well, no matter. I’ll take the lead. Filma, Tiera, Sety, and Shibaid, follow me in that order.”</p>
<p>Shin placed emphasis in the rear guard, setting Shibaid as last line of defense. They did not think their group would proceed easily without encountering any obstacles, so they were not shaken in the least. Thanks to her gradual learning of Marino’s abilities, now Tiera could use 【Night Vision】 too, like the rest of the party: no member was thus unable to see in the darkness.</p>
<p>“There was nothing like this when we went together, was there.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Filma. In your case we just defeated the monster-turned Kishimis, and that was it.”</p>
<p>“….hey, Shin. Haven’t you been acting kind of weird since we got here?”</p>
<p>“…I’m aware.”</p>
<p>Shin replied with a sigh to Filma’s blunt remark. His words were rougher, as was his demeanor.</p>
<p>He wasn’t like this when they left the Faerie Village, but he was aware that he was restless since he had detected Schnee’s presence, and it showed.</p>
<p>Schnee’s name was displayed on the map, still as a party member, so at the very least he knew for a fact that she was not dead.</p>
<p>Even so, he felt the urge to race to her side as soon as possible. Even if she was physically safe, who knew what her mental state was? She was already unbalanced to begin with, so there was no time to waste.</p>
<p>He walked while paying attention to his surroundings, but if Filma and the others hadn’t been there he would have probably sprinted ahead as fast as he could, relying on his stats and gear for protection.</p>
<p>Now that Shin was aware of his feelings, after talking with Schnee the night before, he realized how terrified he was of losing her.</p>
<p>“If you’ve fought this boss before I think it will go okay, but if anything happens to you big sis Schnee will be really sad, ok?”</p>
<p>“I know that, I’m being careful.”</p>
<p>After Filma, Sety also pointed out Shin’s restlessness, so he cooled down a bit. While they did not talk, he sensed Tiera, Yuzuha, and Shibaid watching him. Even without looking at them, he could tell they were worried.</p>
<p>“Hmph!”</p>
<p>Shin drew a deep breath, then slapped his cheeks. Haste makes waste, he told himself, trying to calm down.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, don’t you know anything about this dungeon?”</p>
<p>“I just heard bits and pieces about it. I know the route to take though, thanks to 【Magic Sonar】. The traps will be the problem.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the boss itself used various mental-type skills, the dungeon itself housed all sorts of large-scale magic attack traps, or so Shin had heard.</p>
<p>He just remembered other players complaining about them in the bulletin board, but if it was true it would be a pain, as such attacks were very difficult to defend against.</p>
<p>Some traps caused explosions via fire magic when the party reached the center of a room. There were many other traps dangerous enough in the game that would now be absolutely lethal.</p>
<p>“Well, just leave those to me. I’ve explored dungeons solo many times, my trap detection skills and abilities have been duly trained.”</p>
<p>In the game some traps could easily pierce through average status effect resistance. They rarely killed the player directly, merely slowing down their progress. Maybe because of management’s malice, these traps were always set on monster routes.</p>
<p>Being mauled to death while helpless because of 【Paralysis】 or 【Petrification】 or ambushed while attacking allies due to 【Confusion】 or 【High Confusion】, there were all sorts of triggers that could cause the party’s destruction.</p>
<p>Traps in dungeons, no matter where, were all nasty. This was a sentiment shared by all players.</p>
<p>“Stop, everyone. Speak of the devil…”</p>
<p>Shin signaled for Filma and the others to stop and picked up a pebble in the middle of the corridor. Then, as soon as he threw it, he activated the Divine skill 【Twin Branch Purification】.</p>
<p>A semi-transparent, glass-like barrier appeared before Shin. Moments later, the pebble he threw hit the ground. That same moment, an orange light flashed, immediately followed by a large explosion, big enough to completely engulf Shin’s party.</p>
<p>It was the very same trap Shin mentioned before, which caused an explosion with the party at its center. This time, the treacherous trap had been fully sealed by 【Twin Branch Purification】’s barrier, cast across the corridor.</p>
<p>Compared to the 【One Leaf Absolution】 skill Shin had used in the Wraith Plains, this barrier was even more resistant to physical and magical attacks and its resilience was stronger too: not only did it block the flames, it did not let the blast’s heat wave either.</p>
<p>Even though Tiera had heard about the trap, she couldn’t hide her surprise.</p>
<p>“I can see how scary that can be now…triggering that without knowing would be a nightmare.”</p>
<p>“You need at least two types of detection skills maxed out to pick it up too. Having maxed skills as a condition is something no one usually considers, which makes the trap even nastier. Despite this, you could even find them in normal dungeons sometimes.”</p>
<p>“It’s like they want you to fall in one…”</p>
<p>“That’s why people said that dungeon traps were made by those with malicious intent. Anyway, it’s pretty quiet here.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke with Tiera while looking around. It had been around 10 minutes since they had entered the dungeon, but all they found was just one trap, which seemed odd. The party continued to piece together a map of the dungeon via 【Magic Sonar】, heading towards Schnee’s location — the deepest part of the dungeon — through the shortest possible route.</p>
<p>The lack of monster encounters and scarcity of traps made their progress much quicker than even a normal dungeon. While they couldn’t simply go straight down, they had already covered about one-fifth of the total dungeon. The party did not know much about this secret dungeon, but it was clearly bizarre for the map and detection skills to not show any signs of a monster presence.</p>
<p>There were trap-riddled dungeons without monsters inside, but there were too few traps here for that to be the case.</p>
<p>Before entering the dungeon, Shin’s 【Magic Sonar】 had clearly showed a monster-like response too.</p>
<p>“Maybe they’re drawing us deeper? In some dungeons monsters would appear in mass after you passed a certain point, right?”</p>
<p>Filma was referring to time attack-type dungeons, where the players had to dispose of the boss quickly and teleport away, lest they would be crushed by multitudes of monsters.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. But even in dungeons like that you encountered some monsters on the way, so you wouldn’t realize that you were in one.”</p>
<p>Dungeons completely devoid of monsters were an all too clear sign that there was some trick to them. In the game, even if the monsters were there just for camouflaging purposes, there would be some prowling around, but here Shin’s detection field did not pick up even a single response.</p>
<p>Shin asked Shibaid, the rear guard, but there was no sign of anything approaching them from behind either.</p>
<p>“With things so quiet, I wonder about big sis…will she be okay?”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>No one replied to Sety’s whisper. Everyone was thinking the same, especially Shin.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, do you—”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>Receiving no response, Sety was about to say something else, but Shin interrupted her.</p>
<p>A red marker appeared on the map. It was a monster presence.</p>
<p>“Is this a test or something? Five units. Coming from the front.”</p>
<p>After Shin’s words, Filma gripped the hilt of her 『Red Moon』 and Tiera nocked an arrow.</p>
<p>The party was walking down a corridor about four mel wide: for at least 20 more mel, there were no forks in the path. The movements of the icons on the map made it clear that they were not monsters with wall-phasing abilities, such as ghosts or element tails.</p>
<p>There were few obstacles in the path. Shin activated 【Far Sight】, in order to find out the monsters’ identity as quickly as possible. As he did, he noticed something unnatural.</p>
<p>“Even with 【Night Sight】 activated, the corridor ahead is dark…there’s a Dark Summoner. Sety!”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me!”</p>
<p>Prompted by Shin, Sety casted a spell. The staff she held, about as tall as her, extended as to surround an eight-faced crystal. Sety’s exclusive weapon, 『Dusk Moon』 responded to its owner’s will and started glowing. The rainbow crystal on the tip of the staff emitted a globe of light.</p>
<p>The first globe was followed by two and three more, ultimately creating 30 balls of light which illuminated the path ahead of the party.</p>
<p>“There they are.”</p>
<p>In front of Shin, humanoid monsters clad in tattered capes were retreating, intimidated by the light globes.</p>
<p>The monsters, carrying darkness capable of shutting off 【Night Sight】 and 【Far Sight】 , were Dark Summoners.</p>
<p>They appeared humanoid, but their tattered robes contained nothing but darkness, which suffered no damage when attacked. Their actual body was the candle-like item they carried, which burned with a dark flame.</p>
<p>“Tiera, aim at the candle they’re holding! That’s their actual body. Filma, you take down the Shadow Stalkers behind them. Shibaid, keep watch on the rear. Sety, you watch the whole situation and support when needed. Yuzuha, Kagerou, protect the rear.”</p>
<p>Shin gave orders to the party, then joined Filma in fighting on the front lines.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 4 – Part 2</p>
<p>When Dark Summoners are spawned, they are always accompanied by monsters named Shadow Stalkers, which have the ability of “swimming” in shadows, as if these shadows were bodies of water. Shadow Stalkers thus had the ability to freely move through the darkness created by Dark Summoners, from which they also received stat boosts.</p>
<p>They were an annoying combination to combat, since, without a suitable strategy or sufficient stats, it would take a long time to defeat them.</p>
<p>“There’s something huge too.”</p>
<p>After cutting down a hideous Shadow Stalker, shaped like a wingless bird fused with a praying mantis’ scythes, Shin noticed a sort of pitch-black puddle of darkness, much larger than the other monsters. It was an indication that a Shadow Stalker was lying in wait: the shadow’s size directly correlated to its strength. While such puddles were normally about 60 cemel in diameter, the one Shin discovered was easily over 1 mel wide.</p>
<p>“A Dark Stalker, huh.”</p>
<p>Two red lights glowed in the puddle of darkness. Those were a Dark Stalker’s blood red eyes. In front of Shin’s party, the darkness inside the circle swelled and took shape.</p>
<p>The Dark Stalker’s upper body rose from the pool of darkness. While shaped like a Shadow Stalker, its body was covered by a sort of black metallic exoskeleton and it had four arms, each shaped like sharp blades. Unlike the Shadow Stalkers, which always attacked from the shadows, Dark Stalkers were powerful enough to face players head on.</p>
<p>【Dark Stalker Level 649】</p>
<p>Judging from the fact the monsters the party was fighting were around level 200, this new enemy was a significantly higher threat.</p>
<p>The Dark Stalker’s blades sparkled under the globes of light, as the monster observed its prey. It had no time, however, to even attempt to swing its weapons. No matter how much stronger the Dark Stalker was compared to the Shadow Stalkers, it was still far inferior to Shin and his party.</p>
<p>“….out of the way.”</p>
<p>Shin’s katana, 『Moonless』 traced an arc in the air, which effortlessly cleaved the Dark Stalker in two. He then pulled back the blade, cutting off the monster’s head in the process, and its HP reached zero.</p>
<p>“Shin! Looks like the evil deity’s getting serious!”</p>
<p>“So it seems.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the Dark Summoners’ candles being shattered by Tiera’s arrows, then beyond the monsters, when Shibaid called to him.</p>
<p>A large number of monster icons appeared both on Shin’s map and his detection range. More and more red dots filled a previously empty area. Before Shin, many Dark Summoners appeared. In the darkness around them, the crimson eyes of Dark Stalkers and Shadow Stalkers glowed menacingly.</p>
<p>“Wow…what’s that…?”</p>
<p>Tiera too noticed the large group of monsters prowling in a corner where the globes’ light did not reach. The darkness extended over the floor, walls, ceiling, the entirety of the corridor. The Dark Stalkers within it dotted every part of the corridor as well.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’ve found their nest.”</p>
<p>Looking at the map, Shin detected that a similar gathering was also present behind Shibaid. It was not clear if the monsters were under the evil deity’s command, but it was obvious that they were targeting Shin’s party. If so, the party’s response was obvious too.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, don’t let the ones behind us get any closer! Sety, keep the globes lit and support the front line with Tiera! Yuzuha, Kagerou, keep guarding Tiera and the others!”</p>
<p>“Oh? What about me?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need me to tell you, do you?”</p>
<p>After Tiera and the others replied to Shin’s orders, Filma too inquired about her orders, tilting her head on purpose. Shin looked at her and answered with a sigh.</p>
<p>“We’re taking the pack head on! After me!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, loud and clear!”</p>
<p>Shin stepped forward after making sure that Shibaid was luring away the mixed pack behind them. Sety’s light globes canceled the Dark Summoners’ darkness caused the monsters to falter, only to be cut down by Filma and Shin.</p>
<p>“We’ll go ahead and clean up the room, you get rid of any stragglers and catch up!”</p>
<p>Shin and Filma rushed beyond the area illuminated by Sety’s lights, into a larger clearing formed by several corridors joining together.</p>
<p>“What!? Hey, Shin!!”</p>
<p>Tiera shouted at the two as they plunged headfirst into danger. Before she could even finish her sentence, however, they had already reached the hall.</p>
<p>“I’ll go right, you take the left, Filma.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha!”</p>
<p>Even in complete darkness, Shin and Filma’s exchange was very casual. Their attacks, on the other hand, were simply ferocious.</p>
<p>Shin moved first, thrusting his unarmed left hand forward to activate a skill.</p>
<p>Light-type magic skill 【Sunlight Embrace】.</p>
<p>A 10-cemel wide ball of light, with a different atmosphere from the ones created by Sety, formed in front of Shin’s palm. It emitted a warm, gentle light. It was a skill that raised allies’ LUC, often learned by priests.</p>
<p>The moment Shin activated this skill, with apparently no offensive qualities whatsoever, the monsters surrounding him unleashed terrified screams. The Dark Summoners and Shadow Stalkers illuminated by the light burned to ashes, as if consumed by fire.</p>
<p>It would be a bewildering sight for anyone not familiar with the skill.</p>
<p>For monsters specialized in the Dark element, like Dark Summoners, the globe’s light burned more harshly than any flame. With Shin as its caster, the range of 【Sunlight Embrace】 was also much wider than normal. Shin had told Filma that he would take care of the right side of the hall, but even some monsters on the left side were affected and melted away.</p>
<p>“Looks like I won’t have much left to do!”</p>
<p>Unwilling to let Shin completely steal the scene, Filma quickly activated a skill too.</p>
<p>Sword/Flame Combination Skill 【Scorching Flames – Wildfire】</p>
<p>Golden flames erupted from Filma’s 『Red Moon』, as high as the hall’s ceiling, purifying flames capable of dispelling the darkness and burning the shadow monsters to cinders. While being a Flame-type skill, it was similar to the Light element. Just touching one of the skills’ sparks would cause Shadow Stalkers and similar monsters to go up in flames and vanish instantly.</p>
<p>Filma’s 『Red Moon』, now transformed into a giant fiery sword, swept through the monsters in the left side of the hall. The golden flames erupting from the sword ran across the floor and walls, turning all Dark Summoners and Dark Stalkers they found to ashes.</p>
<p>Being undead, the Dark Summoners , received as much damage as that of Shin’s 【Sunlight Embrace】.</p>
<p>“That’s about it, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Looks like there are more and more coming, though.”</p>
<p>The monsters in the corridor and hall had been wiped out, but Shin and Filma detected that large swarms of monsters still remained outside the skills’ range. The area behind the party, kept under control by Shibaid, was also riddled with red dots.</p>
<p>“It’s always the same type of monsters, though. Is it because the Kishimi are involved?”</p>
<p>In the game event too, the only monsters present were Dark Summoners, Shadow Stalkers and Dark Stalkers. The game had set these three types of monsters as the ones the Kishimi could transform to.</p>
<p>“Who knows, that’s not important right now.”</p>
<p>Shin too wondered the same thing as Filma, but he had other things to think about at the moment.</p>
<p>“Let’s fill up the hole first.”</p>
<p>Shin then created several 【Sunlight Embrace】 light globes. Shin took the globes, each of them capable of erasing more than half of the Dark Summoners in the hall, and pitched them like baseballs into the corridor. The anguished screams of the monsters, who had likely been lying in wait there, echoed through the hall.</p>
<p>The globes would keep shining until the magic concentrated in them ran out, so the monsters could not come closer to the hall for a good while.</p>
<p>Tiera and the rest of the party then caught up with Shin and Filma.</p>
<p>“….I feel dumb for worrying now.”</p>
<p>“What’s with you, all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“To barge into a location without visibility and filled with monsters…we worried and hurried here, but it’s already over?”</p>
<p>Next to Tiera, sighing because of her wasted worries, Sety laughed.</p>
<p>“Shin, Fil, you haven’t changed a bit.”</p>
<p>During the party outings in the game era, Shibaid would gather the enemies in one place for Shin, Filma and Girard to destroy physically or Shin, Schnee and Sety to blast away with magic. Shin, of course, never failed to be part of either group.</p>
<p>“Once you know their weakness, these guys aren’t anything special.”</p>
<p>The problem was their numbers, but Shin’s party could make do somehow. Even if their assault seemed reckless, none of what Tiera feared could have happened.</p>
<p>“Did you wait long?”</p>
<p>“No, not much. Let’s go on ahead.”</p>
<p>Shin lobbed 【Sunlight Embrace】 balls in the corridor Shibaid had guarded too. No monsters would be able to follow after them for a while.</p>
<p>The group proceeded forward and deeper, finding resistance time and again, but always by the same 3 types of monsters.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any other monsters?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to keep being tense like this.”</p>
<p>The monsters never changed: their levels slightly did, but the party’s strategies remained the same. It was easy to proceed like this, but if the evil deity had gained Schnee’s memories, it had to know that Shin’s party could not be exhausted by this level of opposition.</p>
<p>“Oh, is it coming now?”</p>
<p>“Shin? What are you—wahh!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, sparks flew over Tiera’s head.</p>
<p>Shin and Filma had moved at the same time, turning around and swinging their weapons to repel the blade aiming at Tiera.</p>
<p>“Hn!”</p>
<p>Shibaid too had moved at the same time: after confirming that Shin and Filma blocked the attack aimed at Tiera, he swung his 『Placid Moon』 towards the source of the attack.</p>
<p>“It dodged that?”</p>
<p>There was nothing, however, where Shibaid thrusted his halberd. The moment its attack had been parried, It had jumped away, almost weightlessly, putting distance between itself and Shin’s group.</p>
<p>“That was…”</p>
<p>“The evil deity’s doing, right? I kind of expected for something like this to happen, but actually seeing it is really irritating!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes narrowed at the sight at the attacker. Next to him, Filma grumbled.</p>
<p>The reason was that the culprit behind the attempted attack towards Tiera had Schnee’s appearance.</p>
<p>“Fil, calm down.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like it has the same abilities as her, though.”</p>
<p>“A Shadow of Desire, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin’s 【Analyze】 had revealed the true nature of the assailant. It was a monster created by the evil deity, copying players or support characters. In the game era, it was generated at random from the memories stolen by the evil deity, but this time it was, obviously enough, only Schnee.</p>
<p>The generated monster was not a perfect copy appearance-wise, only looking like a solid shadow. The silhouette, however, was without a doubt Schnee’s.</p>
<p>The monster that had its attack parried by Shin and Filma used a weapon shaped like 『Blue Moon』. The weapon vanished after being blocked, as it probably could not sustain any more damage.</p>
<p>“As expected…it wasn’t only one.”</p>
<p>After the failed surprise attack, many other Shadows rose from the ground. The new monsters, 6 in all, pointed their weapons at Tiera, Filma, Shibaid, Sety, Yuzuha and Kagerou respectively.</p>
<p>“No one wants to face me?”</p>
<p>The Shadows were ready to attack, but for some reason none tried to aim at Shin: they focused on the other party members, almost as if they could not see him. No one in the group was wounded, but being Schnee’s copies, the Shadows could not be defeated easily.</p>
<p>Not paying any attention to Shin, however, meant that they were completely open to his attacks.</p>
<p>The two Shadows that tried using as the walls as trampoline to attack Sety and Tiera from above were pierced by Shin’s Flame-type Magic skill, 【Flare Arrow】.</p>
<p>“You got some guts to ignore me.”</p>
<p>Even if struck by Shin, the Shadow did not show any particular reaction: the 1 mel diameter area around the point struck by Shin’s 【Flare Arrow】 disappeared, but the remaining shadow limbs melted back into the shadows.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>“If these things are born from Schnee, it makes sense that they can’t attack you, to me!!”</p>
<p>Filma answered Shin’s question while cutting down a Shadow.</p>
<p>“Shadows of Desire…they embody the source’s hidden wishes, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“The original wishes are supposed to be twisted by the evil deity, though.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered the event’s description and explained. Any wish ended up corrupted, in an offensive or negative manner.</p>
<p>“For big sis Schnee…are we in the way?”</p>
<p>Sety spoke with a sad tone, considering that all members other than Shin were being attacked. Even if her wish was corrupted, the Shadows’ actions suggested that Schnee did not consider anyone other than Shin to be necessary.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s it.”</p>
<p>Tiera expressed her dissent while shooting at the last remaining Shadow.</p>
<p>“I think that master simply wanted to be alone together with Shin. They were separated as soon as they met again, and after they reunited they were never by themselves.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s hypothesis was strangely convincing. No one could find any objections. It was true that Shin rarely acted together with only Schnee. They sometimes went shopping and such on their own, but it never lasted more than a day. In Hinomoto Schnee had joined him before the others, but even so they were not alone.</p>
<p>“Such a feeling too got warped negatively…”</p>
<p>Shibaid grunted, irritated, looking at shadows newly arising from the floor and walls.</p>
<p>‘I want to be with the person I like’: a feeling anyone could share. If that was their base, just the fact the Shadows were trying to hurt someone would be painful for Schnee.</p>
<p>“Shin, if these things won’t try to attack you, why don’t you go ahead first?”</p>
<p>“By myself?”</p>
<p>“We won’t be defeated by monsters of this level. I also doubt that you would succumb to the evil deity either”</p>
<p>Shibaid spoke clearly, uncaring of the Shadows gradually surrounding them.</p>
<p>“That’s right, if they’ll let you right through, then make use of their kindness. Go on already, and take her back!”</p>
<p>“Yep, just leave the rest to me. I can’t say I’m one of your entourage if I let small fry like this beat me!”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety too agreed with Shibaid and urged Shin to go.</p>
<p>Their words implied “if you won’t go, who will?”. They were not concerned by the decrease in fighting power caused by Shin’s absence.</p>
<p>“Kuu, this is something Shin must do.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, who had turned to a 2-mel size for fighting more easily, looked at Shin and spoke. Kagerou too growled in unison.</p>
<p>Tiera did not talk, but nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“…got it, I’ll go first. You better catch up soon!”</p>
<p>Shin gripped 『Moonless』 more firmly, turned his back to Filma and the others and started running. The Shadows, oblivious, continued attacking the rest of the party.</p>
<p>“I’m coming, Schnee!”</p>
<p>Shin removed all of his stats’ 【Limiters】 and kicked the ground fiercely, causing a large crack on the floor and boosting his speed in turn.</p>
<p>The Dark Stalkers targeted Shin, but they were simply powerless to stop him from hurrying towards Schnee. Without slowing down one second, Shin activated a skill.</p>
<p>“Out of my way!”</p>
<p>The Dark Stalkers obstructing Shin’s path were blown away. Their scythes and exoskeletons were shattered, as well as their bodies. Shin had not attacked them, but simply ran through. The only difference from before was the golden light veiling his body.</p>
<p>Tri-Elemental Composite Skill 【Thunder God Cloth】.</p>
<p>The skill created a barrier that enveloped the user’s body, repelling physical attacks, which was covered by high-output electricity. The skill combined Barehanded, Divine, and Lightning elements.</p>
<p>The skill’s appearance caused some players to nickname it Super Mode or Hyper Mode, with another reason being that it was damaging enough to deserve such names.</p>
<p>The physical barrier’s strength and resistance depended on the user’s stats, preventing the Dark Stalkers’ scythes from approaching, while the light emitted by Shin’s body annihilated the Dark Summoners. The monsters were nothing more than air for Shin.</p>
<p>“The Shadows won’t come out, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what that meant. Maintaining 【Thunder God Cloth】, he proceeded deeper into the dungeon. He checked the path with 【Magic Sonar】, blew any monsters away, and crushed all traps he encountered on the shortest route to his destination.</p>
<p>Finally, he arrived at the deepest reaches of the dungeon, before the room where the evil deity was supposed to be.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Wary of any attacks from inside, Shin slowly opened the door. Despite the heavy decorations on the doors, they opened easily with just a touch. What Shin found inside was at first nothing but darkness. Next, he saw silver flames. Candles at both sides of the boss chamber lit up by themselves.</p>
<p>In the most remote part of the room, it awaited.</p>
<p>The Evil Deity, Adetropos.</p>
<p>A mask over its face, empty eyes gazing into the void, irregular limbs, body covered by tattoos, and a snake-like lower body: its appearance was the same as the game era.</p>
<p>In place of his hairless head, however, flowed silver hair. From his hands grew ice claws. The greatest difference, however, was the light blue crystal on his chest, with Schnee trapped within.</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>The moment he saw it, Shin rushed forward.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 12 Chapter 4 – Part 3</p>
<p>A straightforward assault, with all of his Limiters removed. Shin had neither the time nor intention to assess the situation. Faster than a speeding bullet, he closed the 50-mel distance between his initial position and Adetropos in a couple of steps.</p>
<p>Shin’s initial target was the monster’s left arm, the symbol of the boss monster’s heavy use of mental-affecting skills and magic skills. His 『Moonless』 carved through it easily.</p>
<p>Divine/Katana Combination Skill 【Scourge Divide – Morning Star】</p>
<p>In the candle-lit room, a white-hot flash of metal sparkled for an instant.</p>
<p>The Divine/Katana skill unleashed by Shin, which would cause massive damage to evil-type monsters such as demons, devils, and the undead, cut off Adetropos’ left arm. Meanwhile, it was not clear where Adetropos was looking or if it had even realized it was under attack.</p>
<p>The ability that activated after the boss received damage, however, did not rely on its perceptions. Before Shin could use the Movement-type Martial skill 【Flying Shadow】 to continue attacking, the severed arm, right before hitting the ground, erupted into black smoke.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>Shin instantly changed directions. He moved behind Adetropos’ body, using the monster’s large body as a shield. A few seconds later, the chamber was filled by a grey light: it was 【Netherlight】, a skill that caused all status effects at once. Shin could have probably resisted its effects, but decided to dodge it just in case. 【Netherlight】 did not affect Adetropos’ body and its shadow.</p>
<p>“You’re going to move now, huh?”</p>
<p>Shin planned to attack as soon as the light disappeared, but Adetropos raised its snake-like body, supported by countless insect-like legs. The crawling monster was a really disgusting sight. Adetropos moved extremely quickly, though it was difficult to imagine from its snake-like, centipede-like lower body. In addition, it could easily travel not only on the ground, but also the walls and ceiling. It climbed up the walls, attached itself on the ceiling and spewed a deluge of status effects.</p>
<p>Its aptitude to easily avoid the players’ attacks, affect them with negative statuses, and torture them was another reason why Adetropos was hated by the players.</p>
<p>However—</p>
<p>“You thought I couldn’t reach?”</p>
<p>Shin could run on the walls and even on midair: he was a completely different opponent from the players that Adetropos had probably defeated until now.</p>
<p>Shin, as he was now, could easily reach the ceiling, using a combination of 【Flying Shadow】 and jumping. Against Adetropos, who had to use the walls, he would never lose in speed.</p>
<p>“Schnee isn’t damaged, right?”</p>
<p>Shin checked Schnee’s HP gauge while the monster climbed the wall. If she wasn’t there, he would have targeted the boss’ neck from the first blow.</p>
<p>“I’m takInG heR bAck.”</p>
<p>Shin’s words reverberated through the chamber. In the echo there was also another voice, not Shin’s or the evil deity’s.</p>
<p>Shin did not notice it, however, and leapt in front of Adetropos’ eyes as it hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>The instant Shin’s 『Moonless』, bright with 【Scourge Divide – Morning Star】’s glow, swung down on Adetropos, the blade was also adorned by purple crystals.</p>
<p>Adetropos, however, was still one of the toughest bosses: it used its right arm’s claws to block the attack. The ice claws, though not present in the game, were not enough to stop Shin’s attack.</p>
<p>『Moonless』’s slash cut off the claws, while the resulting shockwave separated the monster’s hand from its elbow.</p>
<p>“Get lost alre—-!?!”</p>
<p>Shin had slipped close to the monster, ready to slice its head off with 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>Just as the blade was about to reach the monster’s body, the blue crystal containing Schnee appeared in front of Shin.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how resistant the crystal was. If 『Moonless』’s strike was more powerful, however, the slash would end up cutting Schnee too.</p>
<p>Shin used 【Flying Shadow】 to create a temporary foothold and focused his strength on swinging his blade in the opposite direction. Thanks to his strength, 『Moonless』 stopped just before touching the blue crystal.</p>
<p>Adetropos was probably waiting for this instant: its silver hair started moving as if it had a will of its own, squirming towards Shin, attempting to grab him. The attack’s range was wide, but it was slow. Shin jumped out of the way and stood on the same wall as Adetropos.</p>
<p>“Hey…”</p>
<p>Anger-filled words escaped Shin’s mouth.</p>
<p>“You!! Bastard!! What did you just try to make me do!?”</p>
<p>Shin shouted, overwhelmed by rage.</p>
<p>It was just an angry shout, not accompanied by any skill. Shin’s roar, however, caused the flames on the chamber’s candles to flicker violently. A crack also appeared on the crystal trapping Schnee.</p>
<p>Shin had stopped 『Moonless』 before it touched the crystal, but Ancient-grade weapons could cause damage even with just air pressure, as proved by the crack in the crystal.</p>
<p>Make the person coming to save a prisoner kill them instead. Adetropos’ actions had positively enraged Shin.</p>
<p>“Your deaTh won’T be painLEss.”</p>
<p>Shin kicked the wall, breaking it apart behind him, and rushed towards the monster. Adetropos shot ice arrows, something it could not do in the game, but Shin simply knocked away the ones in his path and instantly approached the monster.</p>
<p>He targeted the monster’s insect legs this time, with which it could crawl on the walls and ceiling. Making sure to be ready to react even if the blue crystal was again teleported in front, Shin swung 『Moonless』, cutting down the monster’s legs from the left side. Thanks to 『Moonless』, it made no real difference whether the legs were covered by a protective shell or not.</p>
<p>While avoiding or knocking away all obstacles, Shin continued cutting off the monster’s legs.</p>
<p>“Time tO tRy thAt.”</p>
<p>After slicing off ⅔ of the legs on the left side, Adetropos’ lower body had grown rather unstable. Shin then stabbed the monster’s snake lower body with 『Moonless』 without hesitation.</p>
<p>It was a much smaller attack than the ones before: Adetropos did not seem to react at all.</p>
<p>“BurN frOm inSIde aNd sUFFer!!”</p>
<p>『Moonless』, having piercing the monster up to the hilt, was engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Katana/Flame Combination Skill 【Garuda’s Flame】.</p>
<p>The skill Shin activated enveloped the katana in red and gold flames, that were capable of melting even Adamantine. These flames were now burning Adetropos’ body from inside.</p>
<p>Crimson and golden light seeped through from where 『Moonless』 stabbed the monster, then its flesh started falling out. Adetropos’ body could not withstand the heat released by the blade.</p>
<p>“Looks like you can’t move the crystal inside youR bOdy!!”</p>
<p>Shin stabbed 『Moonless』 in another location and ran on the monster’s tail, with the flames following him along the monster’s body. Shin managed to run almost completely around Adetropos’ tail, enough for it to be close to falling off. Shin then changed directions, running up the monster’s back in a zig-zag pattern to avoid its attacks.</p>
<p>“xpr&amp;r”&amp;%#s!!”</p>
<p>An intelligible wail-like sound was produced by what probably was Adetropos’ mouth. Its body then turned black.</p>
<p>“Tch, so it’s just like the event now!!”</p>
<p>Because of the game settings, it was not possible to completely defeat Adetropos. It was an enemy boss, but still categorized as a deity. Even if its body was destroyed, it would eventually resurrect. Maybe because of such a setting, some of those monsters tried to surprise players with their last resort attacks.</p>
<p>In Adetropos’ case, when its HP went below a certain level, it had the nasty habit of trying to take the player down with it.</p>
<p>When Adetropos’ body turned completely black, it would start crumbling into a blob. In the game, if the player was still alive after Adetropos had completely melted away, the mission was considered complete.</p>
<p>“You’re not taking Schnee with you!!!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted and ran into Adetropos’ melting body. There was still the possibility of the crystal being teleported again, so he just held 『Moonless』 without swinging it. If he did not do anything he would be swept away by the turbid stream, so Shin activated 【Thunder God Cloth】 to break through Adetropos’ former body and reach Schnee.</p>
<p>“There’s, something.”</p>
<p>The black stream did not touch him directly, but even so Shin’s HP gauge was gradually decreasing. In the game, being engulfed by the black stream was the end: it caused instant death, no matter how much HP the player had left. The black liquid that was trying to swallow Shin and the crystal probably had similar effects.</p>
<p>“If I was together with Schnee, well…I even thought.”</p>
<p>Shin talked to himself when he reached the crystal and saw Schnee’s face. He had decided: as long as he was together with Schnee, no matter where he ended, he would have no regrets.</p>
<p>“—but I’m not easy enough to be taken down by the likes of you!!”</p>
<p>Shin activated the creation-type skill 【Alteration】 and buried his arms in the crystal. After making sure he had a firm grip, he activated the skill again. Purple lines formed a magic circle, with Shin and the crystal at its center. Several complex patterns appeared in the 5-mel wide circle.</p>
<p>The magic circle, glowing brighter and fainter, pushed away the black stream surrounding Shin and the crystal as soon as it appeared, as if it had a barrier that did not allow anything to pass through it.</p>
<p>“DisapPEaR!!!”</p>
<p>The magic circle’s light grew stronger with Shin’s shout. 6 purple flames, about 60-cemel tall, appeared on the outer side of the circle, spinning along it, all in different directions. The purple flames formed different circles and, after a few seconds, grew exponentially in size.</p>
<p>The black stream that had tried to swallow Shin gradually disappeared, as if it was erased out of existence. No matter if it was touched directly or not, the flames erased it all.</p>
<p>Flame-type Magic skill 【Purging Flame of Obliteration】</p>
<p>It was a wide range skill that caused great damage to anyone, enemies and allies alike, in a set radius, with the exception of the user. In a closed room with no way of escape, it was extremely lethal. Its effects covered the whole boss room, so Adetropos’ black stream could not escape anywhere.</p>
<p>“…there’s no response anymore.”</p>
<p>After the skill’s effects wore off, Shin scanned the area with his detection skills, looking for Adetropos’ presence, then removed his arms from the crystal. He had grabbed it firmly to avoid it being affected by 【Purging Flame of Obliteration】 , so it suffered no other cracks or damage than the one inflicted in the beginning.</p>
<p>“It’s the same as the time with Filma…”</p>
<p>It could just be a coincidence, or maybe there was a reason behind it, but the crystal trapping Schnee was actually a 『Drop of Erathem』. This one was in harmony with Schnee’s magic power and emitted a blue light. As it had happened with Filma, it would not be absorbed by Schnee.</p>
<p>Nothing was in the way anymore, so Shin decided to free Schnee first of all. He activated 【Alteration】 and changed the crystal into an item card. Even the tough 『Drop of Erathem』 was like putty before 【Alteration】: it wasn’t long before Schnee was freed.</p>
<p>“Schnee. Hey, Schnee.”</p>
<p>Shin checked her breath and pulse, then shook her lightly to wake her up. After a while, Schnee started moving.</p>
<p>“…..? …..hn…Shi…n…?”</p>
<p>Her eyelids opened slowly, then her sky blue eyes met Shin’s gaze. Her expression was still lost, as she probably hadn’t fully woken up yet. Shin looked at her gently. The boss had been defeated, so her memories should return too.</p>
<p>“Do you recognize me?”</p>
<p>“What in the world—eh? Er, ehm, why are we…like this?”</p>
<p>Schnee was currently being held by Shin, his arms supporting her back and knees.</p>
<p>“Do you remember everything? Are there any gaps?”</p>
<p>“—-ah.”</p>
<p>Shin’s words caused Schnee to turn pale.</p>
<p>“I, I do. Or, I should say that I remember everything now. What happened until I fought Hameln, and also after that.”</p>
<p>“You remember everything, then? What happened during the game, and also after I returned?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I also remember about fighting against you all, while under the evil deity’s control.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke in a feeble yet confident tone. She could have said that she did not remember anything about the time she was controlled, but didn’t. She had turned pale because she had realized what she had done: the weight of her guilt tormented her.</p>
<p>“I, I am truly sor—”</p>
<p>“Aaaahh!!! I’m so glad…!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s sudden shout cut off Schnee’s apology. He then fell sitting on the ground, relieved. Schnee, on the other hand, floated for a second.</p>
<p>“Wah!”</p>
<p>“Oops.”</p>
<p>While sitting, Shin deftly caught Schnee’s fall, then hugged her close.</p>
<p>“Eh, er, Shin…?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad….I’m so glad. I didn’t know what to do if you had disappeared because I couldn’t make up my mind.”</p>
<p>Even if he remembered info about the event, there was no assurance that Schnee would be all right. Even if she was physically okay, mentally she could have become another person.</p>
<p>She’s still alive, she’s going to be okay. Shin had continued to repeat these words to himself while on the way here. After realizing that Schnee was really alright, it was obvious for his outburst of joy.</p>
<p>“You didn’t do anything wrong. I just let down my guard.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s my fault. If I had decided earlier and told you, things would have gone differently.”</p>
<p>Schnee blamed herself, but Shin stopped her sternly. She had been manipulated by the evil deity because there was a large enough gap in her heart for it to infiltrate. And the reason behind that was Shin. He couldn’t let that slide.</p>
<p>“What I couldn’t say that night…I’ll say it now.”</p>
<p>“….yes.”</p>
<p>Shin released the embrace and placed his hands on Schnee’s shoulders. Schnee understood the meaning of his words and looked straight at him, a tense expression on her face.</p>
<p>Shin’s answer towards Schnee’s desire for him to remain in this world. That time, the words stayed stuck in his throat, but now it was different. His heart was set. He just had to say the words.</p>
<p>“I’m going to stay in this world. So would you please stay with me? Not as master and servant…but as man and woman.”</p>
<p>“…!?! D-do you mean…?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I mean…I want you to marry me.”</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes looked straight at Schnee’s. It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t just something said to buy time.</p>
<p>They were words born from Shin’s honest feelings.</p>
<p>“Eh!? Hey, Schnee!?”</p>
<p>Transparent tears flowed out of Schnee’s eyes. The unexpected reaction caused a small panic in Shin.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Ever since we met again, I always…I always thought, that I really wanted this to happen…”</p>
<p>Schnee wiped her flowing tears and looked at Shin.</p>
<p>“Are, are you really sure? Someone like me—!?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Shin sealed Schnee’s lips with his, forcefully stopping her self-deprecating words. Schnee was confused at first, but as she understood what Shin was doing, she slowly put her hands around his back.</p>
<p>“Shi…n….!”</p>
<p>The light kiss grew gradually more passionate. In the game, kissing was the greatest show of affection possible between players like Shin.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<p>Exchanging feelings, words, and breaths.</p>
<p>Schnee knew what kissing meant. She responded passionately, much more than one would expect from her. Her tears wouldn’t stop, but Shin knew that they were not born out of sadness.</p>
<p>“…hah.”</p>
<p>After a long kiss, the two separated naturally. A string between their lips vanished, as if longing for more. Looking at it, Schnee blushed – a bit too late.</p>
<p>“This isn’t, a dream, right?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t. I can pinch your cheeks if you want.”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>“For real?”</p>
<p>Shin meant it as a joke, but Schnee closed her eyes and put her face closer to Shin’s. Despite what he said, Shin couldn’t really pinch Schnee’s cheeks, so he just poked them a little.</p>
<p>“That’s not enough to wake me up from a dream, you know?”</p>
<p>“I know I said it myself, but this isn’t easy to do…”</p>
<p>“Hehe, you’re so kind, Shin.”</p>
<p>Shin wiped the last tears remaining near Schnee’s eyes, grumbling to himself. While looking at her smile, he decided once more that he would never let her cry out of sadness again.</p>
<p>“Filma and the others are here too, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they told me to go ahead.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered about his comrades telling him to go on and smiled. He wasn’t worried at all about the monsters getting the best of them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go meet them, then. I made them worry too.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s—–!?”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Schnee and was about to stand up, when the entire dungeon shook violently.</p>
<p>“What’s going on!?”</p>
<p>He looked around and noticed that several patterns had appeared in the boss room, patterns he had seen before.</p>
<p>“Is that a teleportation magic circle?”</p>
<p>“It definitely is. —now that I recall, if you don’t go out right away after defeating the boss you get teleported to a random place, I think…”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t remember clearly what he had heard about the secret dungeon, or even if it was all true. But one of the things he did seem to remember referred to this very situation.</p>
<p>“The teleport crystal…won’t work. I remember that no one was ever teleported inside a wall or something though.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I feel no malice coming from this spell.”</p>
<p>Schnee calmed down the restless Shin. Maybe because of her recent capture, she could tell such things now.</p>
<p>“Shin. Please embrace me like this.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>They didn’t know where they would end up. But if they remained in close proximity, they thought they would be sent to the same place.</p>
<p>The magic circle lit up. A bright light filled the room, and when it disappeared, there was nothing in it anymore.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>While Shin was telling his decision to Schnee, a few mels from the entrance of the dungeon, a black liquid-like substance appeared. The black ooze, which until minutes before had been the evil deity Adetropos, slowly begun to float towards the sky.</p>
<p>It had been defeated, but Adetropos was still a monster in the deity category. Thanks to having fought inside the secret dungeon, its home ground, it had managed to escape from Shin. That was the reason why bringing its HP to zero was not a condition for victory during the game event.</p>
<p>Adetropos would be defeated by players, resurrect, then be defeated again. That was its role in this world. The event’s background information stated that a deity that tried to ease people’s suffering had become an insane god and ended up confined to this world.</p>
<p>Until someone realized that Adetropos was not destroyed, and truly finished it off, the monster would not be stopped—</p>
<p>“This presence…you. You are the evil deity, are you not?”</p>
<p>Adetropos planned to leave the dungeon for a while, to regain its powers, but someone called to it from above. Shadow covered its body. Something was blocking the sunlight.</p>
<p>“I can feel Shin’s magic power. Seeing you in such a weakened state…you have fled.”</p>
<p>Adetropos felt chills running through the surface of its body. The opponent looking down on him was not an average monster.</p>
<p>“I do not fight weakened opponents. Just this time, however, I shall discard such a creed!”</p>
<p>It was not said that its end would be necessarily brought by a human.</p>
<p>Adetropos did not know that, outside the dungeon, there was a creature much more dangerous than Shin.</p>
<p>“Hm!?”</p>
<p>As if responding to Tzaobath’s arrival, the hidden dungeon emitted a flash of light and disappeared.</p>
<p>“…an escape mechanism. Shin and the others must have been teleported away.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath, feeling the magic power, moved its neck in 3 different directions. Shin’s party had been sent to 3 different locations, apparently.</p>
<p>“Shin and the others aren’t here anymore…I have no more reason to hold back.”</p>
<p>Tzaobath looked at Adetropos, which was trying to sneak away. Its wings spread wide, and the light blue wings started glowing. At the same time, part of the clouds covering the sky cleared up. Light came down from the sky, directly above Tzaobath, which the dragon received on its back. The light did not reach the ground and was absorbed by the dragon’s wings. The ray of sunlight made its body glow golden.</p>
<p>“Disappear.”</p>
<p>The golden glow gathered in Tzaobath’s maw, turning into a golden beam. A blow faster than a bolt of lighting and with more force than a meteor strike. There was nothing Adetropos could do. The light from the sky completely annihilated the evil deity, without giving it a single chance to avoid or defend itself against the attack.</p>
<p>The beam, not content with just destroying Adetropos, carved a large crater into the ground, turned trees into cinders and left another gaping wound on the recovering earth. After the light disappeared, all that was left was ground turned into glass, an enormous crater…</p>
<p>…and a sole dragon looking down from the skies.</p>
<p>“O friend. Did the memory of our days together return to your soul?”</p>
<p>Tzaobath looked at the crater in silence for a few moments, then uttered these words and flapped its wings. The dragon soared quickly above the heavy clouds and flew far away in the sky.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“….The presence of Shin and the others’ disappeared…this must be teleportation. Looks like they managed to defeat Adetropos.”</p>
<p>At the same time as Shin’s victory over Adetropos, in a dimly lit room somewhere, Hameln was talking to no one in particular.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I won’t be able to check the reaction if they get teleported. Will dear Schnee’s memories be returned? Or maybe they are lost forever?”</p>
<p>Hameln had tracked the movements of Shin’s party after being separated from them. Shin and his comrades were fully focused on finding Schnee, so they had not realized it.</p>
<p>Tracking players’ movements inside dungeons was impossible, except for a handful of particular skills. Hameln’s job did not allow him to acquire them, so it should have been impossible for him. That was in the game era, however. Things were different now.</p>
<p>“If they do not return, what will poor Shin do?”</p>
<p>Hameln, who knew Shin from the game era, grinned. He had helped Shin once before, but that was all for the sake of his objective. Being a player killer, Hameln was normally an enemy for Shin.</p>
<p>“To think that Tzaobath existed in this world, however. Shin truly is amusing to observe. It would be a pity if he changed, but what happens, happens, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Hameln, who had been looking down, raised his head before talking again.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to seeing you again.”</p>
<p>Bizarrely enough, the direction he was looking in was the one Shin and Schnee had been teleported to.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 1 – Part 1</p>
<p>In the hidden underground dungeon, Shin had successfully defeated the evil deity Adetropos.</p>
<p>While he managed to safely rescue Schnee as well, the teleport magic circle in the room had also been activated. Shin and Schnee were thus separated from their comrades, transported away to an unknown location…</p>
<p>The first thing Shin felt after being transported was a very soft sensation in his arms. Then, he sensed someone’s breath and body temperature. Next, a smell tickled his nostrils.</p>
<p>“Looks like we weren’t separated at least.”</p>
<p>After checking the surroundings for any hostile presences, Shin spoke to Schnee, who he was holding in his arms. If he hadn’t found her next to him after the teleport, he would have been beside himself with worry.</p>
<p>“Yes…are we…inside a cave?”</p>
<p>“So it would seem. I just checked quickly, but there are paths going both up and down. There are also presences moving, but not anywhere close.”</p>
<p>Shin had scanned their current location with 【Magic Sonar】 and detected some responses moving in a group. One response was moving by itself, while the other was a a group of six, packed close together.</p>
<p>“Could those be monsters?”</p>
<p>“If this is a different dungeon, they might also be adventurers. Six is the max number of people you can have in a party, after all.”</p>
<p>Monsters like goblins and kobolds moved in packs, so he couldn’t say for sure yet. Schnee had just regained her consciousness, so Shin had her drink an 『Elixir』 and rest a bit, just in case. In the meantime, he kept checking the surroundings.</p>
<p>“Are you all right already? Do you feel weird anywhere?”</p>
<p>“I’m perfectly fine. My memories were just sealed, so I didn’t suffer any damage. Aren’t you worrying a bit too much?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course I would. Our relationship is a bit different than before.”</p>
<p>“Yes…that’s right.”</p>
<p>Schnee probably remembered Shin’s confession: her sentence ended in a whisper. Her cheeks flushed too.</p>
<p>“….I’m sorry. Please give me five more minutes to settle down.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>While thinking how lovely Schnee looked with her hands covering her face, Shin returned to scanning the location for threats. Five minutes passed, without anything noteworthy happening, and Schnee stood up.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for the wait. I’m okay now.”</p>
<p>“I see. By the way, you don’t need to keep that formal tone anymore.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s become a habit.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke the same to everyone, usually, so it wasn’t like she was being polite.</p>
<p>“But…I agree with you. Sometimes it would be nice to speak in a more familiar way.”</p>
<p>“Well, take your time. For now, let’s find out where we ended up.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee switched their focus to their current situation. Their stats and equipment were unchanged: the magic circle that whisked them away was just teleport magic, so it shouldn’t have had any other effects.</p>
<p>“(Shin, where are you?)”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Just as Shin was thinking of contacting the others, Yuzuha’s voice resounded in his head.</p>
<p>“(We were transported to some cave-looking place. The evil deity’s defeated and Schnee turned back too. What about you guys?)”</p>
<p>“(Tiera, Kagerou, and Shibaid are here too.)”</p>
<p>After the events at the 『Castle of the Depths』, Yuzuha seemed to have become more familiar with Tiera too.</p>
<p>According to Yuzuha, they had been transported to some kind of forest. They all emerged unscathed from the fights in the secret dungeon, so they were not in danger.</p>
<p>“(I see, I’m glad you’re all safe. Let’s communicate again once we understand where exactly we are. Shibaid can use Mind Chat too, so do you want to come over here, Yuzuha?)”</p>
<p>“(Not now. Shin and Schnee, you can stay on your own for a while. Yuzuha’s a fox that can read the situation.)”</p>
<p>Shin very easily pictured the smug look Yuzuha had to be sporting when she said that.</p>
<p>Respecting her wishes, Shin didn’t summon Yuzuha to his side.</p>
<p>“Did you receive a Mind Chat?”</p>
<p>“Yes, looks like Shibaid, Tiera, Yuzuha, and Kagerou are all together. I’ll try contacting Filma and Sety now.”</p>
<p>“(Hello there. I guess this means you defeated the evil deity? )”</p>
<p>“(Yeah, Schnee’s all right too, we’re together. Is Sety with you?)”</p>
<p>“(Bingo. Me and Sety were transported to a beach somewhere.)”</p>
<p>Filma said that she hadn’t found any landmarks that could provide hints about their location yet. Shin told her that Shibaid and the others were safe and to let them know when she understood where they were, then cut the Mind Chat for the moment. He then let Schnee know about the rest of the party’s safety too.</p>
<p>“So everyone’s safe, I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way any of them would go down easily, after all…so, what shall we do now?”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee could teleport themselves, but the location the evil deity had transported them to also intrigued them. Shin then proposed to Filma and Yuzuha to research a bit about each of their locations before meeting again. They agreed, and Filma and Yuzuha then informed the other members.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start by finding out where we are.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I suppose we’ll go up first then.”</p>
<p>The cave was made of earth and rocks. Normally, the exit would be above.</p>
<p>“Oh, monsters spotted.”</p>
<p>Shin’s 【Magic Sonar】 picked up monster responses in front, while scanning the cave as precisely as possible. The number was just one.</p>
<p>“A Hobgoblin, I see. Could this be their nest?”</p>
<p>“This might very well be a dungeon. By the way, do monsters go into dungeons from the outside in this world?”</p>
<p>In one of the game events, dungeon monsters poured out in the open, but the opposite — monsters going inside dungeons from outside — never happened.</p>
<p>“It does. Sometimes powerful monsters happen to be near newly generated dungeons and take over as bosses.”</p>
<p>“Monsters can take over dungeons too!?”</p>
<p>Dungeons generated suddenly had random monsters as a boss, so it was apparently possible. Schnee didn’t know exactly the rules behind it either.</p>
<p>“The Hobgoblin is level 51…nothing unusual here.”</p>
<p>Shin closed in on the monster from the front, without the slightest hesitation. He didn’t even bother hiding the sound of his footsteps, so the Hobgoblin spotted him quickly.</p>
<p>“Akdobun!! Seeeurrralsa!!”</p>
<p>The Hobgoblin charged at Shin while shouting gibberish. The iron sword it held with both hands shone faintly, probably because of a skill.</p>
<p>“….all too normal. The skill is just 【Slash】 too…I guess this is just a normal dungeon?”</p>
<p>Shin grabbed the monster’s sword with one hand and planted his other fist in its defenseless stomach. He only planned to punch it lightly, but the monster was blown away, vanishing soon after groaning a bit.</p>
<p>“Hey? This way of disappearing…”</p>
<p>Looking at the vanishing monster, Shin was suddenly reminded of something.</p>
<p>In this world, monsters defeated in a dungeon would disappear after a set time. The Hobgoblin Shin just defeated, however, turned into smoke as soon as its HP reached zero. This was typical of a certain dungeon in the game, one that Shin had made good use of too.</p>
<p>“This could be a training dungeon”</p>
<p>“One of those easily approachable by beginners too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that particular way of disappearing is typical of training dungeon monsters. I used them a lot to practice new skills, so I shouldn’t be wrong.”</p>
<p>Training dungeons had been installed for players not used to operating VR avatars or who wanted to test new skills.</p>
<p>Monsters were as strong as normal, but players would receive very little damage and experience points.</p>
<p>Such dungeons were often quite populated, as they could be used to practice exploring in relative safety.</p>
<p>“If so, we might be in Erkunt.”</p>
<p>“Erkunt?”</p>
<p>“A country devoted to the diffusion of study and research, which gathers students and scholars from all over the world. If I remember well, it’s located slightly northwest of the center of the continent. It’s the only country where the presence of a training dungeon was confirmed, so I believe it is highly likely that’s where we are now. Of course, there might be undiscovered training dungeons too.”</p>
<p>“I see. There’s still a lot I don’t know about stuff like that, so you’re really a big help.”</p>
<p>Shin thanked Schnee, then looked ahead.</p>
<p>“….now that I think about it, my limiters are still all off.”</p>
<p>After a few steps, Shin remembered how the Hobgoblin had been blown away. In the fight with the evil deity he had removed each 【Limiter】, so even if he meant to go easy on the monster, the power he unleashed was still massive. (T/N: 【Limit】 has been changed to 【Limiter】)</p>
<p>He had started getting the hang of controlling his strength, but to avoid any unexpected occurrences, Shin decided to cast 【Limiter】 again on his stats.</p>
<p>“I wonder if we were sent here for some special purpose?”</p>
<p>“No idea. I heard that secret dungeons sent you to random places, so it might be just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Shin could not tell what the evil deity might have been thinking. Even if they mulled over it they might never find the truth, so he decided to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Well, now we know that this isn’t a dangerous place and there shouldn’t be restrictions for leaving either. Let’s take it easy.”</p>
<p>Judging from the monsters and traps, Shin concluded that they were in one of the higher floors of the training dungeon. Following one of the typical dungeon rules, strong monsters wouldn’t appear in such a floor.</p>
<p>Different monsters appeared in dungeons, depending on what the suggested level to explore them was, of course. Monsters of the same type also appeared at different levels. In a dungeon for players with levels at two-digits, however, nothing that could pose a threat to Shin and Schnee could happen.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep our guard up just in case, and head for the exit. Let’s use the shortest path.”</p>
<p>Thanks to 【Magic Sonar】, he had pinpointed where the exit was ‘supposed’ to be located. He couldn’t be completely sure because 【Magic Sonar】 wasn’t best suited to go above ground from underground: the skill was most useful when going underground from above or exploring locations that were only above or underground.</p>
<p>In the chance they met a dead end, the mapping function was automatic, so they would never get lost.</p>
<p>“….there’s someone fighting up ahead.”</p>
<p>After walking for a while, without finding any actual obstacles, Shin detected several responses ahead. Judging from the markers, there seemed to be three people surrounded by monsters. The players had probably triggered a “monster house”-type trap, which in turn caused a train.</p>
<p>Monster houses where traps activated when the player entered small rooms inside dungeons: the exit would be blocked and great numbers of monsters appeared. Depending on the player’s skill, they could be good sources of experience, but in most cases the monsters’ numbers overwhelmed the player.</p>
<p>Trains were caused when players, chased by monsters, ended up provoking other monsters they encountered to join the chasing group, ultimately forming a large pack of pursuers. If the players failed to lose the monsters, they could end up being overwhelmed in this case too.</p>
<p>The battle situation was difficult to judge from just the markers, but it did not seem to be favorable for the people involved.</p>
<p>“Looks like the frontline is doing everything they can to attract aggro. Wait, it’s not front or rear, though…but it looks like they’re handling themselves. If they’re adventurers we could cause trouble by interrupting, so let’s make sure they don’t notice us for now.”</p>
<p>“Yes. If the situation turns dangerous, should we help them?”</p>
<p>“If it’s dangerous, we’ll help.But if things look suspicious, we might have to reconsider that too.”</p>
<p>It might sound cold, but in the worst case there was the option of abandoning the party engaging the monsters.</p>
<p>Causing a train on purpose, making it target others, then killing them. That was one of the strategies adopted by the so-called MPK, monster player killers.</p>
<p>This world was rife with turmoil within royal families, nobles, or among privileged classes. Such troubles were something Shin wanted to stay as far away from as possible.</p>
<p>Thus, in case there were assassins in the shadows, waiting for a chance to finish their targets, he planned to leave without interfering.</p>
<p>If they were really in a training dungeon, even if the explorers’ HP reached zero the probability of their life being saved was high.</p>
<p>“This is not good.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee proceeded, concealed by 【Hiding】, when he spotted the scene of the monsters and adventurers fighting. The monsters were superior versions of Goblins, Red Caps.</p>
<p>The large, two-mel tall monster wore a tattered hat with red spatters. The axe it wielded missed chunks of its blade and was dirty with blood.</p>
<p>As a category, it belonged to the Goblins, but it was more powerful than Ogres. Its level averaged at about 200, with the one Shin was looking at being level 222, slightly higher than the average.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time seeing one since the Dusk of Majesty, but it seems like they still fight the same way.”</p>
<p>Red Caps tended to play with their prey. Many players had been traumatized by them, so it was often said to never get close to one.</p>
<p>Facing against the pack of Red Caps, standing in a clearing over the wall, were still young children.</p>
<p>Their equipment seemed decent enough, but if they were ordinary children their chances of victory were close to zero. They would be quickly crushed by the enemies’ numbers.</p>
<p>The three children, however, were in a different situation.</p>
<p>The boy wielding a spear charged into the approaching pack of Red Caps, blowing away several of them in one strike. The girl armed with gauntlets jumped down in the opened space, damaging them further. She would then quickly back away, leaving room for the other boy with a wand to cast his magic.</p>
<p>When Shin spotted them, the three children were surrounded, fighting with the cave walls at their back, but they attacked in a specific direction while moving.</p>
<p>“Their strategy isn’t bad at all…it doesn’t look there’s anyone else nearby. Let’s do it, then. Schnee, heal the boy with the spear. He seems pretty spent. I’ll take care of the Red Caps.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>The boy with the spear had probably acted as the tank, drawing in the enemies’ attacks: his HP was one-third of the total. Shin asked Schnee to take care of him, then made his move towards the Red Caps.</p>
<p>Before Shin, the girl armed with gauntlets had been caught by a Red Cap, which was about to lower its broken down axe on her. She struggled desperately to break free, but several Red Caps pinned her down.</p>
<p>Even in such a situation, she managed to kick several Red Caps away, so she surely wasn’t an average girl. In a normal situation, they would probably have never been surrounded like that.</p>
<p>“I don’t really care for gore.”</p>
<p>Shin materialized his broadsword 『Kakura』 and rushed into the Red Cap mob threatening the girl. Making sure not to hit her by accident, Shin swung his blade.</p>
<p>The corridor was packed with Red Caps both to the left and to the right. One swing of the blade and more than 10 Red Caps were blown away.</p>
<p>“……heh?”</p>
<p>Seeing the Red Caps pinning her down get launched in midair, the girl let out a lame comment in disbelief. If the pack of Red Caps could be compared to a red stream of turbid water, Shin was a black gust of wind.</p>
<p>The Red Caps blown in midair and disappearing were like branches knocked about by a strong wind.</p>
<p>“I’m not an enemy, so don’t attack, okay?”</p>
<p>Shin warned the girl, who was trying to pull herself up, then strengthened his grip on 『Kakura』.</p>
<p>One, two, three slashes.</p>
<p>The Red Caps crowding the corridor decreased in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Shin glanced in Schnee’s direction and saw her slash the Red Caps with graceful, dance-like movements, while protecting the two boys.</p>
<p>She didn’t blow them away like Shin, but froze them to seal their movements and keep them away from the children, then finished them off.</p>
<p>Just as Shin did with 『Kakura』, Schnee also used a weapon of lower level than the usual, it was the Ice-elemental short katana 『Ice Flower』.</p>
<p>Frozen flowers sprouted along the path of the blade. The sight of Schnee gleaming as she dispatched the Red Caps was eerily beautiful, it was difficult to believe she was actually fighting.</p>
<p>“You’re the last one!”</p>
<p>Shin closed in on the last remaining Red Cap and once again swung 『Kakura』. The monster tried shielding itself with the hand axe it wielded, but before a heavy weapon such as 『Kakura』 it was simply futile.</p>
<p>Even without a sharp blade, 『Kakura』’s slash — boosted by Shin’s muscular power — crushed the hand axe and sliced through the Red Cap like a knife through butter.</p>
<p>The monster was cut diagonally, its upper body slowly sliding down. Before its organs could spill out, the Red Cap vanished.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’re done.”</p>
<p>“E-excuse me!”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Shin checked to make sure they had taken care of all the monsters, then declared the fighting over. As he did, a hesitating voice called out to him. He turned around and saw the little girl that the Red Caps had surrounded. Her equipment was partly damaged, but she didn’t seem to have suffered much damage herself: she still had over 80% HP.</p>
<p>The girl had shoulder length red hair and wore an iron headband, karate uniform-like armor, and spats. Her weapons were probably arm and leg guards. Her job was 『Fist Fighter』.</p>
<p>Judging from the crystal-like horns protruding at the sides of her head and her red scaled tail, it was clear that she was a Dragnil.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving us from that dangerous situation!”</p>
<p>“We had our reasons, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>The girl bowed energetically to Shin, who replied while putting 『Kakura』 away.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had instantly pulverized the enemies that were giving the children a hard time, so the girl’s orange eyes were brimming with admiration.</p>
<p>“Hey, Myu! Just because they saved us, you’re being too careless!”</p>
<p>Just as Shin opened his mouth to explain their circumstances, the boy healed by Schnee shouted to the girl, while keeping his guard up.</p>
<p>Deep blue hair, red eyes, metal armor, and a kite shield. His hands held an iron spear. Both his shield and armor, however, were partly shattered, as was his spear’s tip.</p>
<p>When he looked at Shin, his eyes glowed strangely: he probably used a magic eye-type of skill. He appeared to be a Dragnil, just like the girl called Myu.</p>
<p>Raising his voice to attract attention and then use the skill was a good strategy, but it would be of little use before Shin and Schnee’s resistance. There was too large of a level gap between them.</p>
<p>“You too, Lecus! These people don’t have the teacher’s armband, they aren’t instructors from the institute!”</p>
<p>Unlike Myu and the boy called Lecus, the blue haired boy was wary of Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee did save them, but he quickly spotted that they did not belong to the institute and decided not to lower his guard. Another good judgement.</p>
<p>From his words, it was clear that the dungeon was part of the institute’s grounds.</p>
<p>“I can’t fight against someone who saved my life!”</p>
<p>“What are you getting all smug for! There’s no guarantee that they’re on our side!”</p>
<p>“You’re getting too heated up, both of you! Calm down.”</p>
<p>Forgetting Shin and Schnee, the boy and the girl started fighting, as Lecus tried to appease them. He was probably a mage: he carried a brown wooden wand wrapped with rope. His long ears signaled that he was likely an elf.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel any hostility from them. Besides, even if we fought, we wouldn’t stand a chance. I don’t think we could even run for 10 mel. You’ve seen him fight too, right Gian? The lady is an incredible fighter too.”</p>
<p>Lecus seemed to be a different type than the blue-haired boy, Gian, but judged the situation calmly too. After he finished talking, Myu put her hands on her hips and flashed a big smile.</p>
<p>“Right, right!! I thought of helping too, but there just wasn’t anything I could do!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear why Myu looked so happy, but the reason why Lecus said not to resist was simple.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee abundantly proved that they could easily eliminate the monsters on their own, without the slightest sign of exhaustion. There was a large difference in fighting power between them.</p>
<p>“First of all, we have no intention of causing you guys any harm. I’ll explain our circumstances, so would you please listen?”</p>
<p>When Shin turned 『Kakura』 back to card form, Gian reluctantly walked closer. His expression clearly showed how dissatisfied he was with the situation.</p>
<p>“First, please let us thank you for saving us. My name is Lecus Alvein, the leader of this party. The Dragnil girl is Myu Hamill and the rude boy is Gian Ermelt.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you!!”</p>
<p>“…hmpf.”</p>
<p>Myu greeted Shin and Schnee energetically, while Gian was still sulking a bit.</p>
<p>“I’m Shin, she’s Yuki. We have other companions too, but we got separated when we were teleported away after defeating a dungeon boss. We were just transported here, and honestly we have no idea where we are.”</p>
<p>Using the name “Schnee” could have proved troublesome, so Shin used her alias. He warned her in advance via Mind Chat and had her transform to her golden haired, red eyed figure.</p>
<p>Schnee smiled at the children to reassure them, and Lecus and the other two gazed at her, mesmerized.</p>
<p>Shin laughed wryly before talking again, and they snapped back to reality. Lecus, blushing fiercely, apologized profusely. Shin calmed him down and continued to explain their situation.</p>
<p>“Teleportation, is it. A trap that activated after defeating a dungeon boss…so there are things like that out there too.”</p>
<p>“You can even defeat a dungeon boss!? You’re too strong, Mr. Shin!!”</p>
<p>“………….”</p>
<p>Lecus and Myu were very interested in what Shin said, though one because of intellectual interest and the other because of the admiration towards the strong. They didn’t seem to doubt his words, in any case.</p>
<p>Shin expected Gian to say something too, but the boy kept an ironclad silence.</p>
<p>“We’d like to go outside, first of all, so could you show us the way? We might cause trouble if we went out on our own, and I don’t think you want to go on with your equipment in that state, right?”</p>
<p>Rather than Lecus and Myu, Gian’s equipment required repairs, or maybe even to be replaced. Shin thought that they wouldn’t proceed like that, so he made his proposal. He also told them that they would take care of any monsters that appeared on the way back.</p>
<p>“I see. It is true that we are not in our best condition, and we also have to report about the teleportation trap. Let us go together. We will have to take you to the security patrol, though. It is one of our rules, so you will have to accept it. Of course, we will duly let them know that you saved us. The patrol guards are rational people, I am sure they will do you no wrong.”</p>
<p>Even if the dungeon was meant for training, monsters still resided in it, so they had skilled guards posted at its entrance.</p>
<p>Lecus continued that, based on the situation, Shin and Schnee wouldn’t just end up being accused of trespassing.</p>
<p>“There’s no other way, I suppose. Hopefully things will be resolved quickly.”</p>
<p>They could have gone out while using 【Hiding】, but it was too late now that they met Lecus’ party. If they didn’t talk with the institute, their future movements could meet unneeded obstacles.</p>
<p>“Let’s go then. Can you walk, Gian?”</p>
<p>“….I’m okay. She healed me.”</p>
<p>Gian had been struck hard, though over his armor, so he was wobbling a little, but could still stand firmly on his legs. Schnee’s recovery abilities were enough to even restore severed limbs, after all.</p>
<p>“You’re tough, even though you just got beat up a lot.”</p>
<p>“I attracted the enemies’ attention! Besides, those damn monsters went easy on us. And Yuki’s…Ms. Yuki’s 【Heal】 is a lot more powerful than what I’m used to.”</p>
<p>Gian replied to Myu without hiding his frustration.</p>
<p>The Red Caps often played with enemies weaker than them. They targeted the unit with the most HP and toyed with it even when they could defeat them in one blow.</p>
<p>It was possible to make use of such a strategy to make the monsters fall in a trap, but Lecus and the others did not seem to have figured out how to yet.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, Ms. Yuki, are you high-ranked adventurers?”</p>
<p>Shin answered Myu’s question by showing his adventurer card.</p>
<p>“I’m ranked A, even though I haven’t taken any guild requests since I got to this rank.”</p>
<p>“Wow, rank A…that’s why you’re so strong!!”</p>
<p>Shin explained with a chuckle, but Myu was completely convinced. Lecus, however, couldn’t help but point out how weird that exchange was.</p>
<p>“No way Myu, how do you get convinced like that?”</p>
<p>“What’s so strange? The stronger an adventurer is, the higher rank they have, right?”</p>
<p>“That only works until rank B. To get to rank A and above, they take into account your contributions to the country, to the guild, your personality…things unrelated to how strong you are, basically. If you’re strong but just violent, you can’t get to rank A.”</p>
<p>“This means that Mr. Shin is a strong and good person!”</p>
<p>“….well, that’s probably right.”</p>
<p>Maybe because she didn’t think too hard about it, Myu quickly nodded in acceptance. The glow in her eyes when looking at Shin was even brighter than before. It probably happened often, because Lecus just nodded with a small laugh.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere, it would be hard for Shin to say that in Balmel he just charged smack dab in to the middle of the monsters’ swarm and let loose.</p>
<p>“Let’s go straight to level one, then. Please step on this magic circle.”</p>
<p>In the game’s training dungeons, there were normal magic circles ready to travel to the farthest traveled floor from level one: that was probably what Lecus mentioned.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll go first and explain the situation.”</p>
<p>After the group teleported to level one, Lecus ran ahead towards the light pouring in from the exit.</p>
<p>Left behind, Myu started talking to Shin, full of enthusiasm. She was like a fan who finally met her favorite athlete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gian was mostly silent. His eyes often wandered towards Schnee, however.</p>
<p>Outside, Lecus and three armored men were waiting for Shin’s group. The men’s armor had similar designs and were also enchanted. Their level was over 200, high enough to understand why they were in charge of security.</p>
<p>“Are you the people who were transported by accident?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a trap that activated as soon as the boss was defeated, so our comrades were transported somewhere else. We were close when the trap activated, so we ended up in the same location, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Did you contact your companions?”</p>
<p>“We used an item we found in the dungeon, that lets you send messages to people far away. We know that they are all safe. The item was one use only, so we only have a few left though.”</p>
<p>“I see, we understand the situation. We would like to inquire further, so please follow us.”</p>
<p>One of the guards went off with Lecus’ party, while the other two walked ahead of Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>Lecus’ party did not seem to have noticed, but other than the two guards who led Shin and Schnee, there were several other responses surrounding them. The guards were clearly very wary of them.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee were first led to the guards’ station. The building itself was reinforced, so it would not be damaged even if fighting broke out inside. It had a basement too, where Shin and Schnee would probably be shipped to if they were found “guilty”.</p>
<p>In one of the rooms of the station, Shin and Schnee explained their circumstances further. The guard asking the questions was the one who had first talked to Shin, a man named Bermann.</p>
<p>“—-thank you for your cooperation. Being transported from dungeon to dungeon must be a bizarre experience, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“I guess we were lucky enough not to get stuck in the ground somewhere”</p>
<p>“They say that luck is a part of skill, after all. Let me confirm one last thing: where is the dungeon you said you were? If, like you, other people might end up being transported here, we should make the necessary countermeasures.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think you need to worry about that.”</p>
<p>“And why would that be?”</p>
<p>Bermann’s eyes narrowed because of Shin’s confident reply.</p>
<p>“That dungeon self-destructed right before we were transported. We saw it starting to crumble and our comrades confirmed that it is no more.”</p>
<p>This was something that Shin learned by also contacting Tzaobath, after he talked with Filma. He didn’t know if it was possible to contact monsters remotely via cards, so he tried sending one just in case, and it unexpectedly worked.</p>
<p>According to Tzaobath, it had annihilated the dungeon together with the evil deity, which had crawled out. That’s when Shin learned that the final self-destruction was a last resort the boss monster used to try to escape.</p>
<p>Shin said that the dungeon “crumbled” because he was sure that no one would believe him if he said that a dragon had blown it to nothingness with a breath attack.</p>
<p>“Is that so. I thought it was used to trespass into our country, but if it’s disappeared, then our problem has too.”</p>
<p>“Do you believe us?”</p>
<p>“If you were trespassers, you would have no reason to help the students. I doubt there would be foreign agents who attracted attention to themselves on purpose like this.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true.”</p>
<p>Shin was not so naive as to fully believe Bermann’s words, but there was no point in further pressing him whether he really believed them or not.</p>
<p>After the questioning, Shin and Schnee were led in a waiting room with a sofa and a table. They were asked to stay there until a response arrived from the institute’s authorities. Shin and Schnee did not have any particular objections, so they accepted.</p>
<p>“(They’re pretty wary of us.)”</p>
<p>“(It doesn’t look like they fully trust us. But they don’t seem to have strong suspicions either.)”</p>
<p>Shin looked all around himself while talking to Schnee via Mind Chat. Around the room there were even more responses than when they left the dungeon.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee’s actions were not what someone that sneaked into the institute to perform evil deeds would do. They did not tell any lies either, so it might be difficult for the authorities to make a decision.</p>
<p>After about one hour of waiting, Bermann and a group of people with different uniforms came into the room.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Shin felt like he had seen the person leading the group before. He might be mistaken, though, so to be sure he used 【Analyze】.</p>
<p>—–Hilamee Level 255 Mage</p>
<p>“It’s really you, Hilamee!?”</p>
<p>“!! C-could you really be Mr. Shin?”</p>
<p>The female pixie leading the group, surprised, answered Shin’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s been a long time. So you came over here too.”</p>
<p>They had met a few times during the death game; in the end, Hilamee had passed while protecting children with levels lower than theirs. That’s the female player that Shin knew, Hilamee.</p>
<p>A pixie with emerald green eyes, Shin remembered that she was in a party with a dragnil boy called Masakado.</p>
<p>The Hilamee now standing before Shin was a fully grown adult woman.</p>

<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 1 – Part 2</p>
<p>“<a href="https://shintranslations.com/vol-10-chapter-3-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masakado</a> isn’t with you?”</p>
<p>“He’s out at the moment. But Mr. Shin, why…”</p>
<p>“I apologize for interrupting you. Are you two, no, you three acquaintances?”</p>
<p>A woman, part of the group that came in with Hilamee, interrupted Shin and Hilamee’s conversation with a question.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sorry. Ahem. Mr. Shin, I am currently the headmistress of this Erkunt Institute of Magic. She is the vice-headmistress, Licia.”</p>
<p>After Licia’s question, Hilamee realized that all eyes were focused on her, so she straightened her posture and introduced herself formally. Shin recalled what she had been like as a child, but that Hilamee was now long gone.</p>
<p>Shin had not recognized her immediately because she had grown beyond what he remembered. The Hilamee that now introduced herself as headmistress retained little of the feeble girl Shin remembered.</p>
<p>“Allow me to formally introduce us again too. I am Shin, she is my party member Yuki.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, I am Yuki.”</p>
<p>The group of male instructors behind Hilamee started buzzing with whispers after looking at Schnee lightly bow.</p>
<p>“I have read the report. I thought you might be agents from another country, but I see that it was a misplaced worry.”</p>
<p>“He-headmistress!?”</p>
<p>“Do not worry. Mr. Shin and his companion are not the type to be upset by such things.”</p>
<p>Hilamee honestly stated their suspicions, so Licia hurriedly tried to stop her.</p>
<p>Hilamee laughed her worry away however. Shin chuckled with a feeling of nostalgia, as most eyes in the room were on him.</p>
<p>“Licia. I’m sorry, but have them go back to the institute. We can’t have many people hear what we will be discussing.”</p>
<p>“Whatever do you mean?”</p>
<p>“There are many things I need to confirm. Mr. Shin, could Licia stay here during our conversation? She has a resurrection bonus as well and is someone to be trusted, who would never speak lightly about confidential matters.”</p>
<p>Why was Shin here, what had actually happened…there were many things Hilamee needed to ask.</p>
<p>Shin would probably need to reveal that he was a High Human: Hilamee trusted Licia enough for her to know about it.</p>
<p>“No word of this anywhere else, okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course. You understand, don’t you? Licia.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>Licia swallowed her breath because of Hilamee’s serious look.</p>
<p>“Okay, so I’ll start talking first, but let me confirm something: how much do you know about players, Ms. Licia?”</p>
<p>“I know that there was something called a “Death Game”. The headmistress told me so. The headmistress died once during it.”</p>
<p>Licia was one of those adventurers called Chosen Ones. She was not a player, however.</p>
<p>Licia and Hilamee had known each other for more than 100 years now, so she knew about what had happened in the past: about players, the death game, and the fact that the dead came to this world.</p>
<p>“If you know that much, then it’ll be quick. I was a player too, like Hilamee. Yuki was my support character, you know what that means?”</p>
<p>“Yes, beings created by players. In our world they live as normal individuals, so I have no particular feelings about them.”</p>
<p>“Good to know. Oh, by the way, Yuki is an alias, her real name is Schnee Raizar.”</p>
<p>“You possess skills that can trick 【Analyze】, I see. But…Schnee Raizar? To give the name of an individual who performed such incredible feats to a child is…no, please wait a moment. I am positive it is forbidden among elves to give your child the name of another living person. So, if you claim that name…”</p>
<p>Licia’s expression turned progressively stiffer as she talked.</p>
<p>Hilamee did not show any particular reaction. After all, Schnee was famous as the leader of Shin’s support characters among his acquaintances. In the game era, even people outside Shin’s circle knew.</p>
<p>Next to Hilamee, Licia let out a whisper: …she’s the real one?</p>
<p>“While I did it to protect my real identity, allow me to apologize for using a fake name. I am Schnee Raizar.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Schnee undid her camouflage and showed her true appearance. Licia was overwhelmed, opening and closing her mouth without uttering a sound.</p>
<p>“Licia, are you fine looking that silly?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, no, I apologize.”</p>
<p>Schnee told Licia, who had suddenly become very respectful, not to be so formal and continued to talk. She explained why they explored the dungeon and how they were transported. After the long explanation, Hilamee and Licia were deep in thought.</p>
<p>“An evil deity that steals memories. Who knew that the Kishimi tribe survived…and Hameln too.”</p>
<p>“That monstrous criminal, whose only known information is name and race.”</p>
<p>Hearing the name of the man who was said to have even destroyed a whole country, the atmosphere quickly became very serious. Hilamee and Licia had the responsibility to protect the students too.</p>
<p>“Even during the death game I had a hard time defeating him. In this world, finding a single person is very difficult. He’s really good at hiding too.”</p>
<p>Shin would have liked to be done with him once and for all, but it was presently difficult. The only way was to wait for him to act and counterattack.</p>
<p>“There would be no point in thinking about this matter further, so let’s leave it at that. What are your plans now, Mr. Shin? Will you regroup with your comrades?”</p>
<p>“No, everyone will gather here. Let’s say they…read the situation well.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, Filma, and the others decided to let Shin and Schnee be on their own for a while.</p>
<p>“So you will stay here for a while?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the plan. I don’t know exactly how long, but I think that it’ll take one week at most for everyone to arrive.”</p>
<p>“If so, there is something I’d like to ask you to do!!”</p>
<p>Learning that Shin would stay for a while, Hilamee suddenly leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Headmistress, could you mean, that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Licia. Even if something happened, Mr. Shin would definitely be okay.”</p>
<p>Even if Shin had said that he wanted to leave immediately, Hilamee planned to ask him to come back to Erkunt after he had regrouped with his party, apparently.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I’m not going to stick my neck in anything troublesome, okay?”</p>
<p>Thanks to Yuzuha and the others, Shin finally had time to spend with Schnee, so he didn’t want to have to deal with trouble.</p>
<p>“Please, I beg of you. It won’t even take half a day. Could you please just listen to what I have to say?”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee sighed and agreed to listen to the very serious Hilamee. If it concerned the students’ safety, they had no way to refuse to at least listen.</p>
<p>Hilamee said that she wanted the institute’s health officer to participate in the conversation. She wanted Shin’s opinion on whether they were dangerous or not.</p>
<p>Shin had heard from Myu that the institute also organized combat training, and students got injured often. The infirmary in the institute was much more familiar to students than an ordinary one in the real world was. It was bizarre that the person in charge of such a facility could be dangerous.</p>
<p>“That officer is actually a monster.”</p>
<p>“Monster? I remember that some of them functioned as support, but…”</p>
<p>Monsters were normally enemies to be defeated; among them, however, there were some which did not antagonize humans, gave hints about quests, or even fought alongside the party temporarily.</p>
<p>Element Tails were the apex of such monsters: they fought against players in trials, and if they recognized the players’ strength they awarded them with items or equipment.</p>
<p>“No, in the game it was absolutely an enemy. There were events in which monsters you normally fought assisted the player, but this monster was not included.”</p>
<p>“What’s that monster’s name?”</p>
<p>“It’s one of the devils of the Seven Deadly Sins, Lust. Now it goes by the name of Luxuria.”</p>
<p>“A devil as a health officer…oh, I see, ultimately they achieve human form, don’t they.”</p>
<p>Greed, Lust, Sloth, Envy, Anger, Gluttony, and Pride.</p>
<p>Each one of the devils bearing these names are ordinary monsters at the beginning. As their level increases, they grow to a form more resembling a devil, and for some reason ultimately turn to a humanlike form.</p>
<p>In the game, the devils would very rarely grow so much: Shin had only seen their human form in a video.</p>
<p>“It appeared out of the blue three years ago, now it’s just like one of the other instructors. It has vast knowledge of medicine and alchemy, so honestly speaking it’s great at its job, but…”</p>
<p>If it went on a rampage on a whim, the institute would be destroyed, concluded Hilamee.</p>
<p>When they reach human-like form, the devils are at least level 700. Even a former player like Hilamee wouldn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p>“I see, you can’t let others know that there’s a level 700 monster freely walking about at school after all.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to throw it out just because it was a monster. It had passed the entry exam with flying colors, performed its daily duties without problems, and was trusted by the students too.</p>
<p>They wanted to confront it directly, but were afraid to trigger something which would cause things to go wrong, so they could not make the decision until now.</p>
<p>“So basically you want me as bodyguard. If it goes wild, I need to stop it, is that it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll have all students leave the grounds on the day we talk with it. The institute was originally a guild, so if we increase the barrier output to the maximum there will be no damage done outside, even if fighting breaks out.”</p>
<p>The preparations had already been done, apparently. The students would soon leave for a long holiday period, so there would be few in the institute: it was the right chance.</p>
<p>“….I see. There’s no harm in checking out how the Deadly Sins look like in this world. What do you think, Schnee?”</p>
<p>“I agree too. I don’t know how devils think, but I can relate to worrying about the safety of your students.”</p>
<p>“Th, thank you so much!”</p>
<p>Hilamee thanked Shin and Schnee profusely, seemingly relieved from the bottom of her heart. Next to her, Licia sighed with relief too.</p>
<p>“I would like to set tomorrow as the day, then. Mr. Shin, what will you do today?”</p>
<p>“I’ll find a lodging and rest, I guess. What time should I come?”</p>
<p>After Shin explained how they were transported to the training dungeon, Hilamee stated that they would not be charged with trespassing, so Shin planned to find a lodging outside the institute, in order not to stand out.</p>
<p>“We’ll come pick you up. I’ll write you a letter of introduction to a certain inn, so please use it. All its services have a very high reputation.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll take you up on your offer then. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Depending on how tomorrow goes, we might have to thank you even more, so it’s all right.”</p>
<p>Compared to a fight against one of Deadly Sins, arranging an inn was nothing, said Hilamee, a little tired. They would go pick up Shin and Schnee the next day at 9.</p>
<p>Shin said that he would prepare equipment effective against devils, then left.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for having you take us all the way.”</p>
<p>Shin headed to the inn right away; concerned that they might get lost in an unfamiliar city, Hilamee had Bermann accompany them.</p>
<p>“This much is nothing. Tomorrow we’ll be in your care after all.”</p>
<p>Bermann was one of the most skilled fighters in the institute, so he had already been informed of the plan. His expression was stiff, probably imagining what would happen if they had to fight the devil.</p>
<p>The inn Hilamee mentioned was not too far from the institute, just about 10 minutes on foot. It was a building with four floors, the first one Shin ever saw in this world.</p>
<p>The hotel was in a luxurious neighborhood: all stores around it perfectly clean and tidy. It was probably an area that the high society often visited.</p>
<p>Probably informed in advance of Shin’s arrival, as soon as he saw Bermann, one of the hotel workers opened the hotel door swiftly and gracefully. Like with real world hotels, it was made mostly out of glass.</p>
<p>“I’m Bermann, from the Erkunt institute of magic. I brought guests of the institute.”</p>
<p>“We have been expecting you. Welcome to hotel Morgana. Sir Shin, Lady Yuki, our warmest welcome to you.”</p>
<p>The four workers who welcomed Shin and Schnee bowed in perfect unison. Their immaculate uniforms made Shin feel like he was visiting a luxury hotel in the real world.</p>
<p>The staff’s extremely formal movements stood out, but no one seemed to pay much attention to them. They probably acted like this often.</p>
<p>“Okay, a room for two, pl—”</p>
<p>“We would like to stay in your best suite.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Interrupting Shin, Schnee specified the type of room she wanted.</p>
<p>She had never asked for a specific type of room before, no matter where they stayed, so Shin was a bit surprised.</p>
<p>“I was informed that you were likely to make such a request. The payment has already been completed, so I shall accompany you to your room right away.”</p>
<p>The “information” had come from Hilamee or Licia, probably, but Shin had no idea why they would say such a thing. He couldn’t fully grasp the situation, but if that was what Schnee wanted, it was fine with him, so he did not object.</p>
<p>“Wow, this is really something.”</p>
<p>It was like renting a whole floor in a luxury hotel of Shin’s home world, the suite was large and well-furnished enough to host a family comfortably.</p>
<p>Illuminated by the sunlight, the tables reflected a dull shine. Shin was in no way an expert in regards to furniture, but the room’s interior decoration gave a very neat and refined impression.</p>
<p>“Please ring the bell on the table if there is anything you require. We will send someone immediately.”</p>
<p>After a brief explanation about the facilities, the hotel clerk left the room. As expected of a luxury hotel, the room was equipped with a large bathtub too.</p>
<p>“We can see the whole city from the terrace. Hm? Isn’t that wall taller than the rest?”</p>
<p>Shin followed Schnee out on the terrace and noticed that part of the castle walls was clearly taller than the surrounding fortifications.</p>
<p>“That’s the border with the capital of Erkunt. This section of the city, where the Institute of Magic was erected, has been built next to the Erkunt castle walls.”</p>
<p>According to Schnee, the Institute of Magic was right outside the Erkunt castle walls: to go into the capital one had to pass through that wall. The institute had been built next to the castle walls in order to save on materials and efforts to build outer fortifications, apparently.</p>
<p>Another reason was a large number of spies from foreign countries among the exchange students, called “grass”. When the institute was built, the people in charge mentioned that its presence would attract such people inside the country.</p>
<p>Shin thought that, regardless of the existence of a learning institute, “grass” was found everywhere, but there was little point in pursuing this matter, so he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“What would you like for dinner?”</p>
<p>“Since we’re here and all, let’s go to the restaurant.”</p>
<p>The hotel also had a restaurant headed by a chef with the Cooking skill. The hotel clerk had recommended it too, so Shin and Schnee dressed up a bit to match the atmosphere before going.</p>
<p>Shin wore a white military uniform with red decorations, Schnee a light blue mermaid dress.</p>
<p>“It’s really good…but…”</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong?”</p>
<p>All dishes were worthy of being served in a luxury restaurant. Shin, however, did not feel fulfilled after tasting them: on the contrary, he found them somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because I’m used to your cooking, I just feel these need a little more work.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Schnee smiled at Shin’s implication that her food was better. It was the same smile as before she lost her memories, but to Shin it was brighter than ever.</p>
<p>After the meal, Shin and Schnee returned to their room right away. As it always happened, they attracted quite a bit of attention from the other guests in the restaurant. No one went to talk to them, as expected of the courtesy of guests in such a restaurant, but some kept looking at Schnee throughout the meal.</p>
<p>Also considering the Deadly Sin monster matter, they wanted to avoid trouble as much as possible, so they left quickly. Back in their room, Shin and Schnee sat on the sofa and talked about their plan for the following day.</p>
<p>“A devil health officer…who passed the exam without help to boot.”</p>
<p>“Quite different from the devils we’re used to, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t find it too weird…if this was a manga, that is.”</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, demons and devils were considered separate categories.</p>
<p>Demons were born from human emotions and lived to cause suffering to people.</p>
<p>In contrast, devils were born from human desires, but their way of life was not fixed. In a way, it could be said that they enjoyed more freedom.</p>
<p>“Let’s go with anti-devil equipment, just in case. I’ll have yours ready too.”</p>
<p>Kunoichi anti-devil equipment was a ninja garb with high skin exposure, but its stats and abilities were very high. The next day, Shin would have Schnee conceal herself as she stayed behind him.</p>
<p>“Shin, what do you know about the devil Lust? Luxuria, was it?”</p>
<p>“Well, I only fought against Gluttony, Wrath, and Pride. I just know that Lust is a female-type monster that used Drain skills…that’s about it.”</p>
<p>Shin had participated in Deadly Sins extermination quests only a few times, so he didn’t know much about the topic.</p>
<p>“Could it have infiltrated the institute in order to use 【Drain】 on the students to gather energy to grow further?”</p>
<p>“No, if it is in human form, it has already reached the limit of its growth. I don’t think it could achieve anything by doing that now…”</p>
<p>Shin shook his head to Schnee’s hypothesis. In this world even monsters lived differently, so he had no idea what was actually going on in this case.</p>
<p>“Could it be that…no, that can’t be right.”</p>
<p>“Is there something on your mind?”</p>
<p>“Nothing!! Nothing related at all!”</p>
<p>“Really now?”</p>
<p>Seeing that Schnee had turned a fierce red, Shin was very interested in what she had come up with.</p>
<p>“No matter if it’s unrelated, tell me all the same.”</p>
<p>“I-it’s really completely unrelated!!”</p>
<p>“Why are you so flustered? Very suspicious…tell me, come on. It’s okay if there’s no connection at all.”</p>
<p>Shin had no intention of seriously listening to her anymore. They were finally alone, so he planned to enjoy Schnee’s blushing expression to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>“It, it’s really…something trivial…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t be disappointed or anything.”</p>
<p>Shin’s insistence caused Schnee to blush even more.</p>
<p>Her reactions intrigued him, but her flushed face was so cute that he chose to go even closer. As he did, Schnee moved away. The sofa was large, but eventually Schnee was backed into a corner.</p>
<p>Schnee was about to stand up to go away from the sofa, but Shin was faster: he grabbed her arms and pushed her down on the cushions.</p>
<p>“It’s not like you to run away like that. I am very interested in what you came up with.”</p>
<p>“T-that’s…”</p>
<p>Chasing Schnee’s eyes up and down was becoming increasingly entertaining for Shin: he was teasing her, plain and simple.</p>
<p>“I thought the devil might want to…have carnal relations with the students…”</p>
<p>“….is that so..”</p>
<p>Shin was convinced by Schnee’s words, thinking that it was the lust devil, after all. What surprised him, however, was that Schnee had come up with such a theory.</p>
<p>(I would understand if she proposed the monster charmed the students to hold them under her control, but…)</p>
<p>Shin would never have thought that Schnee’s personality allowed her thoughts to consider sexual matters. Meanwhile Schnee, too embarrassed after saying something like that to Shin, was doing her best to look away. Even her ears had become bright red.</p>
<p>“Shin, you’re a bit mean now.”</p>
<p>“Am I? Well, I guess so.”</p>
<p>Who would ever imagine Schnee held down on a sofa, blushing like that? She kept her cool in most situations after all. Seeing her like this made Shin want to look at her more and more.</p>
<p>There was no one else in the room. Shin confirmed it for himself again, then put a hand on Schnee’s cheek, turning her gaze towards him.</p>
<p>“Er, Shin?”</p>
<p>“I want to look at this Schnee I don’t know a lot more. I didn’t know you were this cute.”</p>
<p>“W-wha!? Aaaah….!!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s sudden confession made Schnee turn even redder, if that was possible. She tried to say something, but her mouth just opened and closed, without a sound. That was simply too lovely in Shin’s eyes, so he waited for her to calm down.</p>
<p>“….Shin, you want to see a part of me you don’t know…?”</p>
<p>5 minutes had passed, probably. Schnee, a bit calmer than before, asked Shin this question.</p>
<p>“I do”</p>
<p>“You might be disappointed if you do, though?”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>Shin replied immediately to Schnee’s worry. He wouldn’t struggle for words in a situation like that.</p>
<p>“——-”</p>
<p>“Hm? Sorry, I couldn’t hear.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s lips barely moved. The words she whispered, however, were too faint for even Shin’s hearing capabilities to catch.</p>
<p>“…………me.”</p>
<p>“Sorry again, say it one more time.”</p>
<p>“I said, I…..wan…….me.”</p>
<p>Schnee mumbled again, but the most important words weren’t audible.</p>
<p>Shin asked her to repeat a few more times, to no avail. He had started thinking about what else he could do, when Schnee’s eyes changed.</p>
<p>She quickly sat up and reversed their positions: she pushed Shin down on the sofa, holding his arms down.</p>
<p>“I said!! That I want you to make love to me!!”</p>
<p>“Eh!?”</p>
<p>The sudden declaration surprised Shin. He never imagined he would hear such words from Schnee’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Shin! You said you wanted to marry me!”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>“And I agreed to that!!”</p>
<p>“Y-you did.”</p>
<p>“So this is essential!!!”</p>
<p>Schnee was speaking loud and clear, but her face was redder than ever.</p>
<p>After saying that much, Schnee held Shin’s face with her hands and kissed him gently, in complete contrast with the enthusiasm she had shown just before.</p>
<p>“I want you to make love to me. Do you think I am lewd by saying such a thing?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s eyes were lightly glazed. Her expression and atmosphere were more than enough to convey what she desired.</p>
<p>“….how could I ever think that. I was just a bit surprised. I suppose I have to show that I too want to make love to you.”</p>
<p>Shin then sat up and lifted up Schnee in his arms. She didn’t resist in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Is it really fine for me to be so happy…?”</p>
<p>Schnee whispered as Shin headed towards the bed. In response, he held her more strongly, closer to his body.</p>
<p>“That’s my line.”</p>
<p>Shin replied while feeling her body’s warmth.</p>
<p>“Someone like me, who couldn’t protect Marino, is really allowed to love someone else? I’ve been thinking about this forever. I can hold my head high and say that I love you now, but it’s all thanks to you, Schnee. Your love for someone like me…makes me really happy.”</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p>Shin’s words caused tears to swell up in Schnee’s eyes. He laid her down on the bed, then wiped her tears.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>Schnee held her arms towards Shin, to embrace him, and pronounced her confession.</p>
<p>“I love you too.”</p>
<p>Shin replied, his body over hers. There was no need for any other words.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>“….hm?”</p>
<p>The morning after Shin and Schnee became one. Shin woke up feeling something touching his lips. He opened his eyes to see an unfamiliar ceiling and Schnee quickly distancing herself from him. She was still close enough for their foreheads to touch, so there wasn’t really any distance between them.</p>
<p>Remembering the sensation that woke him up, Shin realized what she had done.</p>
<p>“Good morning.”</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>
<p>Schnee reciprocated the greeting, the blanket covering her naked body. The sunlight pouring in through the windows made her silver hair glow.</p>
<p>Though still drowsy, Shin thought she was really beautiful.</p>
<p>“I’m not awake yet…I need another one.”</p>
<p>“So you noticed.”</p>
<p>“Just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped, can it?”</p>
<p>Schnee came closer and gave Shin a very soft kiss, her lips barely touching his. However, it was more than enough for Shin’s chest to be filled with happiness.</p>
<p>“Okay, time to get up. In the worst case scenario we might end up having to fight against the Deadly Sin, so we cannot afford to be found unprepared.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. Carelessness is the worst enemy.”</p>
<p>Shin focused on their next mission. He wouldn’t let anyone or anything destroy that happiness.</p>
<p>If the devil went on a rampage and caused damage to the institute, Shin and Schnee would be concerned too. They finally had time to spend alone, so they did not want it to go to waste.</p>
<p>After ordering breakfast to be brought to their room, they discussed what to do in case a fight broke out.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s only me and you, so the strategy we can take has to be necessarily simple.”</p>
<p>“That’s the only way.”</p>
<p>Shin said so while sipping on tea after the meal. Schnee nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>It was just the two of them, so Shin would face the devil while Schnee helped Hilamee and the others escape, then join him in the fight. For a strategy, it was far too simple.</p>
<p>“To take down a devil one-on-one isn’t something normally possible though.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give it my all, so leave that to me.”</p>
<p>While Shin could somehow manage, for Schnee it would only be possible with the help of specialized equipment. Taking down a devil through sheer physical ability, like Shin could, was simply impossible for the average Chosen One.</p>
<p>“Oh, are they here?”</p>
<p>Shin detected someone arriving on their floor. There weren’t any other guests staying on that floor at the moment, so there was only one possibility. As expected, the hotel clerk knocked on their room’s door.</p>
<p>A guest had come for them, said the hotel clerk. The guest apparently knew Shin and Schnee’s name, so they followed the clerk down to the lobby, where they found the vice headmistress Licia.</p>
<p>“Good morning. We will be counting on your help today. Er, where is lady Sch…Yuki?”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Licia’s polite greeting and boarded the horse carriage stationed outside. They didn’t know how high the devil’s perception capabilities were, so Schnee had decided to conceal her presence since she was in the city.</p>
<p>He told Licia about this after they boarded the horse carriage.</p>
<p>“Are the preparations complete in the institute?”</p>
<p>“Yes. All students have been made to leave, with the pretense of maintenance of the institute’s facilities.”</p>
<p>The only people present in the institute were Hilamee, the devil health officer, a few instructors to communicate with the outside in case anything happened, and the dungeon security guards.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of being rocked by the carriage, Shin once again entered the Erkunt Institute of Magic. He tried expanding his detection field and confirmed that there really were only a few responses.</p>
<p>“This way, please.”</p>
<p>Shin followed Licia through the institute. Its grounds were fairly wide, so it took about 15 minutes to reach the building where the health officer in question was supposed to be. The conversation would be held in the infirmary. When Shin and Licia arrived, they found Hilamee waiting in front of the door.</p>
<p>“I’ll be counting on you today.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me. By the way, the infirmary is basically a health officer’s home, right? Is this really okay?”</p>
<p>“We have already confirmed that there aren’t any traps or such.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Hilamee asked if he was ready and Shin nodded. She nodded in response, then opened the door to the infirmary.</p>
<p>“My? I see we have unexpected guests today.”</p>
<p>In the infirmary, a woman in a white lab coat was sitting on a chair, a book open before her.</p>
<p>When she raised her head, her waist-length wavy black hair fluttered lightly. The woman in charge of the infirmary, the Devil of Lust Luxuria smiled, the crimson eyes behind her glasses gazing at Hilamee and Shin.</p>
<p>“There is something important we need to discuss with you today, Doctor Luxuria.”</p>
<p>“The atmosphere seems a bit too tense for a simple discussion though.”</p>
<p>Crossing her arms under her chest, Luxuria calmly looked back at Hilamee. Pushed up by her arms, her voluminous chest stood out even more through the sweater.</p>
<p>Luxuria wore a thin pink sweater under her white lab coat and a tight skirt.</p>
<p>Even if she didn’t cross her arms, it was clear that she had a voluptuous body line many men would lust after. Her skirt was pretty short too, so if she moved one leg over the other, guests would be treated to quite a risque view.</p>
<p>Her voice was on the deep side: Shin felt like she was whispering next to his ears. The mole under her eye was the icing on the cake, a cake probably a bit too stimulating for a boy going through puberty.</p>
<p>Shin thought that some students might get injured on purpose just to visit.</p>
<p>Despite the intense sexy allure she emanated, there were no Mental skills in play.</p>
<p>The erotic charm surrounding Luxuria all came from her clothing, gestures, and atmosphere. At the very least, there was no ill will to be detected.</p>
<p>“Is the scary man behind you involved too?”</p>
<p>“He might be, yes.”</p>
<p>“My my, that’s a tense discussion all right.”</p>
<p>Luxuria closed the book she was reading, placed it on the table, and faced towards Hilamee with her whole body. She seemed to have understood what Shin’s equipment meant.</p>
<p>She just laughed wryly while dropping her shoulders, though, with no sign of nervousness.</p>
<p>“Since you didn’t attack yet, I suppose there is some room for talking?”</p>
<p>“Personally, I would be glad if we could just do that.”</p>
<p>“Really? If so, I will surrender, so could you let me keep working here?”</p>
<p>Luxuria raised both hands, to show her willingness to surrender, and asked Hilamee.</p>
<p>Her seemingly carefree attitude confused Shin a little, though he did not show it.</p>
<p>“…if you wanted to, you could stay here even without my permission, couldn’t you? Honestly speaking, I cannot understand why you would go all the way as to pass the employment exam.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, well, I actually don’t like forceful ways like that…even if I antagonized you, there would be nothing in it for me. That’s why I took the exam. I know it’s weird for me to say it, but I make a pretty excellent health officer, don’t I?”</p>
<p>“I admit that, but…”</p>
<p>Luxuria chuckled, proudly sticking her chest out, while Hilamee was even more lost.</p>
<p>Despite being a devil, Luxuria did not seem to be trying to deceive or trap them.</p>
<p>“Young man, if you have that gear on you, it means you know who I really am, right?”</p>
<p>Luxuria left the confused Hilamee alone and talked to Shin. It would be pointless to lie, so Shin chose to reply succinctly.</p>
<p>“…I do.”</p>
<p>“I have no intention to do battle, but will fight back if I’m attacked. I think the Institute will be damaged if it comes to that, but do you want to fight all the same?”</p>
<p>“That depends on you. We just want to know why one of the Deadly Sins would want to work in a school as a health officer. If your reason involves causing harm to someone, I would have to fight you.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Luxuria’s question after making eye contact with Hilamee.</p>
<p>“I see…well, from a normal person’s perspective, I’m a monster after all. Okay, I’ll talk then.”</p>
<p>“Eh…?”</p>
<p>Hilamee couldn’t believe the ease with which Luxuria was ready to talk. It was hard to think that the woman before them really was one of the Deadly Sins.</p>
<p>【Analyze】, however, clearly showed her name as 『Deadly Sins Devil – Lust』. Her level was 700, with stats that no normal person could ever hope to match.</p>
<p>“My deadly sin is lust. I draw energy from the emotions born from people’s sexual activities. So it is better for me to live alongside people, not be against them. The fewer the people, the lesser the amount of energy I receive.”</p>
<p>“In the past, however, you collaborated with the other Deadly Sins to destroy humanity, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>If what Luxuria said was true, she had no reason to fight against humanity. In the game, however, things were different.</p>
<p>“Aah, the deadly sins from a few generations back? I suppose it would be 4, 500 years ago for you. Until then, doing that felt like the right thing…it was like a sense of purpose? An urge, maybe? Anyway, there was something like that. After a certain event, however, it completely ceased and everyone started living freely. That was also when us Deadly Sins gained personalities.”</p>
<p>“Personalities?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We all have different ways to draw energy, depending on the deadly sin we house in our bodies. The only thing in common is that it all comes from people’s emotions or mental state. For me, it’s as I said before; Sloth and Gluttony are similar too. The more people there are, the better it is for us.”</p>
<p>The two other types mentioned by Luxuria could gain energy regularly even without making contact with people. She also added that she happened to meet Sloth once, finding it a relaxed, slow-paced fellow.</p>
<p>“The ones who actively come in contact with humans are Greed, Envy, Pride, and Wrath. I haven’t met the current ones, but thinking back, they’re all types I dislike.”</p>
<p>“So even among your deadly sin peers, there are likes and dislikes?”</p>
<p>“Monsters are much more free than what you think. Some fight against people, some fight and live alongside them. Some just stay on their own. I finally gained my freedom too, so I want to enjoy my life.”</p>
<p>The more they talked with her, the harder it was to think that she really was a devil. Thinking about it, Yuzuha was a type of monster that collaborated with players, but Tzaobath attacked them indiscriminately. Hinomoto’s Kagutsuchi, Munechika, and the others are types that originally could never cooperate with people.</p>
<p>Shin realized that, thinking back about the monsters he met until now, he had no grounds to object to Luxuria’s explanation.</p>
<p>“In that case, if this institute is ever targeted by other countries or organizations, will you assist the people here in defending it?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin!?”</p>
<p>Hilamee reacted to Shin’s question faster than Luxuria could.</p>
<p>“That’s unexpected. You don’t doubt my words, and even ask for me to be an ally?”</p>
<p>“I have met my fair share of monsters, you see. Other than demons, they are all living freely, like you said. I even flew on Tzaobath’s back recently.”</p>
<p>“Eh…? By Tzaobath, you mean…that Tzaobath!?”</p>
<p>“To ride on the Silver Moon Death God’s back…isn’t a funny joke at all.”</p>
<p>Shin’s offhand remark caused Hilamee to be even more surprised and Luxuria’s expression to become clouded. Tzaobath and his strength were still very well known.</p>
<p>“Hilamee, I told you that the dungeon crumbled before I was teleported, but actually that was Tzaobath’s doing, he wiped it off the map. I learned about it by communicating with him through message cards. Sorry for hiding it until now.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s…all right, but…is it really true?”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, I have no physical proof, but if I ask him I think he’ll come here?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that since they cooperated to defeat the evil deity, Tzaobath would grant him such a favor once. Then, a perplexed Luxuria interjected.</p>
<p>“Ms. headmistress? If what this man says is true, isn’t he much more dangerous than me?”</p>
<p>“W-well…it’s Mr. Shin, so…unlike a monster, he would never be hostile…right?”</p>
<p>“Hey, do you really need to ask that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I know how you were at that time, so…I got a little worried. Honestly speaking, I think that you’re more dangerous than any Deadly Sin…”</p>
<p>“I can’t dispute that, but you could be a bit more diplomatic.”</p>
<p>Hilamee knew of Shin’s “Death God” phase, so she probably became anxious. Shin wanted to clearly say that he didn’t kill people indiscriminately, but it wasn’t something to talk about in front of Luxuria, so he decided to leave it for later.</p>
<p>“Sigh…I felt a terribly powerful presence, so I got tense, but I see it was all for nothing. Headmistress, I promise to take care of my duties seriously, so could you allow me to continue working here?”</p>
<p>After hearing Shin’s conversation with Hilamee, Luxuria fully raised her white flag. She was a level 700 devil, after all: she had grasped how powerful Shin was as soon as they met.</p>
<p>“So even devils get tense…understood. It would be painful for us too to continue in this situation, so let’s get along, please.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be in your care too.”</p>
<p>After a chuckle, Hilamee and Luxuria shook hands. Things developed quite differently than he had expected, but they reached an amicable agreement and Shin thought it was good enough.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, er, Mr. Shin? Your companion isn’t with you today? There’s something I had to ask her.”</p>
<p>“…I never said that my companion was a woman.”</p>
<p>Luxuria said “her” as if she knew about the gender of Shin’s companion from the start. Before replying to Shin’s question, Luxuria’s mouth formed an arc.</p>
<p>It was a charming smile, with a slight devilish quality to it.</p>
<p>“I can tell. You made love to each other last night, didn’t you.”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s comment froze Shin completely.</p>
<p>“I’m a devil, but the energy I feed on isn’t evil itself. I can take both energy coming from actions based on mutual affection and actions born from one-sided feelings that ignore the partner’s will.”</p>
<p>Luxuria explained that she did not differentiate if the act itself was good or bad.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why exactly, but I can tell where the energy I feed on comes from. I’m the devil of lust, right? If I feel such powerful emotions, I get curious about how you sought each other. To make even me feel like that, you must really love each other, don’t you.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know if she was serious or joking: Luxuria’s questions could be interpreted either way.</p>
<p>“Besides, if she can keep up with you, your companion must be very strong too, right? I don’t think I can match her, so I would like to just talk to her a bit.”</p>
<p>“How can you tell she’s strong?”</p>
<p>“It’s a kind of bonus when absorbing emotions. Your energy…in monster terms, you’d be level 1000? Your emotional energy is like boiling magma. Normal people are a warm soup at most, so I can’t be wrong. With emotional energy as strong as yours, a normal woman’s would get swallowed up and disappear. But yesterday was different, I could clearly tell the existence of another energy besides yours.”</p>
<p>“It might not have been as strong, but it wouldn’t appear alongside yours without sufficient strength. That’s how I could tell that your companion is strong too.”</p>
<p>Luxuria explained with confidence, but Shin had no idea what emotional energy could be. He had no idea he emanated something like that either.</p>
<p>“You can talk in her place, it’s fine by me. It must have been a night of deep, intense passion, right?”</p>
<p>Luxuria, holding her face with her hands, had a dreamy expression.</p>
<p>Shin asked why she was so interested, and Luxuria replied that, regardless of quantity, the energy born from acts of people who loved each other was more “delicious”. It was just the difference of being delicious or not, but as Luxuria fervently explained, Shin and Schnee’s was apparently “a real delicacy”.</p>
<p>Her insistence in having them confess was still very far from the oppressing image one usually had of the Deadly Sin devils.</p>
<p>“To even make a devil fall for you like this…Mr. Shin, whatever did you do last night?”</p>
<p>“You too, Hilamee!?”</p>
<p>Hilamee had been listening in silence, but couldn’t keep herself from asking anymore.</p>
<p>Shin was thus pressed by two beautiful women, but now that he had become one with Schnee, he wasn’t flustered in the slightest.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to talk about such private matters. Give me a break.”</p>
<p>Shin quickly distanced himself from them and flatly refused to speak.</p>
<p>“Aww, don’t be embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“Right, right!”</p>
<p>“You’re already getting along well, huh?”</p>
<p>Where did the tense mood from before disappear to? Asked Shin, just to receive incomprehensible replies such as “Well, you know?” “Right, that’s right!”. They looked like very good friends to him.</p>
<p>“I guess I can just go now.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, you can come on your own next time. I’ll gladly be your partner.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t funny, just stop.”</p>
<p>Shin stopped Luxuria’s sultry advance with a sour expression. Behind him stood Schnee, concealed. He didn’t want her to misunderstand.</p>
<p>“Ok, job over?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you very much. One less thing to worry about for now. I still have doubts, but it looks like things will go well.”</p>
<p>After leaving the infirmary, Hilamee voiced her conclusions, making sure no one was around to hear. She had joined Luxuria in her jokes, but it wasn’t like all her suspicions were suddenly cleared. Like Shin, however, she didn’t think Luxuria was lying.</p>
<p>Hilamee stayed in the institute, saying that she still had work to do. They chatted as they headed towards the gate, where Shin spotted some familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Oh, here they are! Mr. Shin!”</p>
<p>“Stupid! Not so loud!”</p>
<p>The three kids Shin and Schnee had rescued in the dungeon were standing before the gate.</p>
<p>Differently from when they first met, they were now wearing military uniform-like white clothing with blue and red patterns. Gian and Lecus wore the same, so it was probably the institute’s official uniform.</p>
<p>Myu was waving at Shin, smiling. The tail poking out of her skirt was cheerfully swinging left and right.</p>
<p>Gian scolded her for being too loud: the attention of the people near the gates all went to her. Naturally, Shin and Hilamee’s did too.</p>
<p>“They’re our students. Oh, you rescued some in the dungeon, right. Could it be?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s those three. They weren’t supposed to know that I would come here today though.”</p>
<p>The last time Shin had seen them was after leaving the dungeon, and he hadn’t contacted them since. He couldn’t tell Hilamee why they were at the gates at the moment.</p>
<p>“We were suddenly told to go out of the institute, so we thought that it might be related to you being teleported here!!”</p>
<p>Myu cheerfully answered Shin’s question about why they were there. Gian and Lecus nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The other students also seemed to have suspicions about the announcement.</p>
<p>“So? Did you wait here to confirm your theory?”</p>
<p>“No! I waited here because I have a request for you, Mr. Shin!”</p>
<p>“A request? What about the other two?”</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to be interested about Shin being teleported there. Shin asked the other two kids, who also nodded: Gian unwillingly, and Lecus apologetically.</p>
<p>“Well actually, if possible, we would like to ask you to impart us your teachings!”</p>
<p>They remembered that Shin introduced himself as an adventurer, so Lecus, in Myu’s place, asked if they could make a request of him to undertake this “quest”. They had been overwhelmed watching Shin and Schnee’s strength in the dungeon apparently.</p>
<p>“I see, that’s a great idea.”</p>
<p>“Why are you so eager?”</p>
<p>“We’re in the middle of a long vacation, during which students usually practice by themselves. They normally have seniors teach them or go into the training dungeon. But the dungeon is temporarily closed for inspection and these three are more skilled than average, so there is no one that can spar with them.”</p>
<p>Their stats were still low, but Hilamee said that all three of them were Chosen Ones. While they were still far from Shin’s level, they could deal with an average person easily.</p>
<p>A well-trained normal person could match them as they were now, so they were usually coached by a veteran instructor. Shin wondered why they couldn’t be taught by this instructor now too, but Lecus replied that they had gone back to their family during the vacation.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see, it wouldn’t be nice to interrupt that.”</p>
<p>Instructors had private lives and families: that was why the group had tried exploring the dungeon the day before, and almost risked a very bad outcome.</p>
<p>“I heard of some fool who just blindly charged in, just because they knew they wouldn’t die.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on!! I apologized already!!”</p>
<p>Glared at by Gian, Myu’s expression turned sour. From their exchange Shin knew that the mechanism to prevent fatal wounds was still intact.</p>
<p>“Anyway, is it okay to hire people from outside?”</p>
<p>“During vacation periods, some students even work as adventurers, so that their abilities don’t suffer. There is no problem at all. If you pass our check, you can use the training dungeon too.”</p>
<p>“Is that really okay? You know, with foreign people and all.”</p>
<p>“We give our permission to people with proven experience and references. Not that we’d need to check on you, Mr. Shin.”</p>
<p>Shin wondered if that was really okay. You could never tell if a person you met after a long time was the same as before.</p>
<p>“I can tell that you haven’t changed by seeing how you look at Ms. Yuki. Right? Ms. Yuki.”</p>
<p>“Is it so easy to tell? You too Yuki, don’t just laugh and speak up!”</p>
<p>Shin asked Schnee -who had undone her concealment after they left the infirmary- for help. Her answer, however was far from what he expected.</p>
<p>“Hehe, I can vouch that Shin’s eyes don’t lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant…”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what to say to Schnee, who was laughing with Hilamee.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know it would be so easy to get permission. So, Mr. Shin, what will you say?”</p>
<p>“Please!!”</p>
<p>Lecus and Myu asked again, after hearing the conversation between the three adults. Gian had no objections either, and bowed his head in silence.</p>
<p>(Even if you say that, I have no idea how to train Chosen Ones, you know?)</p>
<p>(These kids find it hard to even fight at full power. So I think that even if you just let them do that, it will be good enough experience. They’re still very young and sometimes overconfident in their powers. I want you to show them that there is always someone stronger out there.)</p>
<p>Shin whispered his question to Hilamee and received this reply.</p>
<p>In this world, the stat gap between normal people and Chosen Ones could often be overcome through skill.</p>
<p>Because of that, many did not have a clear idea of exactly how strong they were. Others, instead, gained a too high opinion of their prowess. That was one of the reasons why Myu and the others had fallen into a bad situation in the dungeon.</p>
<p>“I see…okay, I can help them train until my comrades arrive or the vacation period ends. It’s important to know exactly how strong you are after all. What do you say, Yuki?”</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, Shin asked for Schnee’s opinion.</p>
<p>Even if Filma and the others had left time for them to be alone, it would be a waste to just lay about. He might as well raise his quest completion ratio a bit. Shin thought that because of the vacation, there would be few students about and less risk to stand out. Of course, if Schnee disapproved that was the end of it.</p>
<p>“Then, how about this? Battle training in the morning, review your weaknesses and train individually in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“That works. How about training three days and resting one, to let the body recover?”</p>
<p>Shin made this proposal, thinking that everyone had to have other plans too; as there were no objections, it was approved as final. As an extra item, it was agreed that if there were other applicants, they too would be trained, as much as possible.</p>
<p>Making it a request from the institute -instead of from Lecus’ group- meant that the reward would be paid by the institute. Hilamee probably thought that it would be a waste to let just Lecus and the other two make use of this opportunity.</p>
<p>“Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“You might have to use the training dungeon, so it would be great if you could also check it out for any anomalies.”</p>
<p>“You’re a shrewd one, aren’t you…”</p>
<p>The institute staff would check it themselves: the security soldiers were currently taking turns inspecting the dungeon.</p>
<p>Hilamee knew that the evil deity teleported to random locations, so it was just a precaution, as she whispered to Shin.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’ll start tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left the institute with Myu’s cheerful greeting echoing behind them.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for accepting that so easily.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s fine. You were worried about them, right?”</p>
<p>“You read my mind.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized for reducing the time they could spend together, but Schnee smiled.</p>
<p>She had noticed that since they were too used to the training dungeon, Myu and the other two kids did not have a sufficient sense of danger.</p>
<p>Not dying even if HP reaches 0. That was like re-spawning in the game era. In this world equipment would be damaged, but it was still nothing compared to losing one’s life.</p>
<p>There was no risk of dying, but the risk of losing one’s sense of danger was very present. It would be fatal in a battle to the death.</p>
<p>“I find it weird to worry about them, since I barely know them, but I saw them in danger the other day, so…”</p>
<p>Myu and the others could also have experience of actual fighting. Gian’s mention of “some fool who just blindly charged in, just because they knew they wouldn’t die” was a source of concern for Shin, especially because the “fool” was Myu.</p>
<p>“You had plans to do something anyway, so I’m not going to complain about the quest. In exchange, I’m going to have you spoil me a bit during our days off. Make sure you’re ready.”</p>
<p>Schnee then locked arms with Shin, almost hugging him, her soft body pressed against his, giving birth to a sensation of happiness.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t ask for more.”</p>
<p>Shin wanted to know more and more sides of Schnee that he didn’t know. That moment, he started looking forward to what expression she made when she wanted him to spoil her.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 2 – Part 1</p>
<p>“Good morning!”</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>
<p>The day after Schnee’s “spoil me please” day, Shin and Schnee went to the institute. Their destination was the school’s training grounds. More precisely, the training field used mainly for party vs party mock battles.</p>
<p>“Okay then, let’s start with the training. Let’s do a quick one-on-one first, then switch to party battle.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, I see you two have different equipment than yesterday, but is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that equipment would have made things too dangerous.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Lecus’ question. Myu and Lecus were wearing the same equipment they had in the dungeon, while Gian’s was clearly of inferior quality. It was probably a spare or gear he borrowed from the institute. The type of equipment was the same however.</p>
<p>Myu and Lecus were wearing their best, in contrast to Shin who wore a blue/green jacket with cargo pants that had a rather neat design. Schnee was wearing a similar outfit too.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee both wielded handmade 『Sponge Blade』 weapons, albeit of different length.</p>
<p>Made of sponge, they looked just like wooden swords. Part of the “Sponge” series, these weapons would cause very little damage even if Shin swung them at full power: in a way, they were an exceptional item.</p>
<p>“Sponge” versions existed for all types of weapons: depending on shape and type, they had different denominations. Long swords were “Sword”, katanas were “Blade” and so on.</p>
<p>“First of all, let me see how much you can fight. Even if you hurt me I can be healed right away, so come at full power. Use skills if you want. I’ll be your opponent first, then Yuki will.”</p>
<p>Shin’s implied “I’ll go easy on you kids” made Gian’s eyes flare up. Differently from Myu and Lecus, he had harbored a certain hostility towards Shin ever since they met in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Shin’s words were like a taunt for him.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll—”</p>
<p>“I’m first.”</p>
<p>Myu raised her hand, eager to fight Shin, but Gian stood in front of her. Myu was annoyed by the interference, but feeling the fighting spirit emanating from Gian she stopped in her tracks, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“That’s rare for you to be so openly hostile.”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Gian spat back at Lecus to be quiet and readied his spear. He lowered his center of gravity and concentrated all of his fighting spirit in Shin’s direction.</p>
<p>His solid stance, fitting for the party’s shield, made it seem like he could counter attacks from any direction. His gaze towards Shin was now void of hostility, but simply very serious.</p>
<p>(He’s not planning to hide his strategy, huh.)</p>
<p>Shin waited for Schnee to move away, then readied his blade. While it looked a little silly, it was tough enough that even Gian’s former equipment wouldn’t scratch it.</p>
<p>“I’m ready anytime.”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Gian moved as soon as Shin spoke. His spear closed in on Shin very quickly, leaving after-images behind. It was hard to believe that he was still under level 200 by how fast he moved.</p>
<p>Shin calmly calculated the spear’s trajectory and hit its tip with the blade. Despite the soft “poff”-like sound made by the clash, Gian’s spear was smacked out of his hands and fell down on the ground.</p>
<p>“Crap…”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the spear and realized his mistake. Because of the shock from hitting the ground, the part connecting the tip and handle of the spear had bent.</p>
<p>“That can’t be helped. Use this, as replacement for the broken spear.”</p>
<p>Shin said he would fix the bent spear and return it later, then pulled out of his jacket -actually, from the item box- a card and gave it to Gian.</p>
<p>The boy was looking at his hands and the spear Shin knocked down, with a grave expression, which changed to perplexion when he materialized the card Shin gave him.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“It’s a 『Sponge Lance』, a weapon made for training. It looks soft, but it’s actually tougher than Adamantine. With this, we won’t have to worry about breaking weapons anymore.”</p>
<p>Shin was the most worried about this though.</p>
<p>Gian swung the new weapon a few times, then was convinced and nodded.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start again. Feel free to use skills or magic too.”</p>
<p>Shin pointed the tip of his blade towards Gian and got into a fighting stance. Gian too pointed the lance towards Shin.</p>
<p>Gian had lost his weapon in the previous confrontation, but his strike did not rely on physical strength only. His footwork, movement of the center of gravity, and concentration of strength were definitely fruit of many days of training, as Shin was impressed to notice.</p>
<p>“I won’t hold back.”</p>
<p>Gian thrust his lance towards Shin again. His expression did not reveal how he had received Shin’s words. When Shin aimed at the tip of the lance, to knock it to the ground one more time, the lance’s blade started glowing yellow.</p>
<p>“Gian’s getting really serious.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Myu and Lecus’ whispered conversation reached Shin’s ears. They seemed to know what Gian was about to try.</p>
<p>Just like before, the blade knocked the lance down. What followed, though, was not the same outcome. Yellow blades shot from the lance, following the path it had before being knocked down, headed towards Shin.</p>
<p>Shin’s kinetic vision did not miss the crackle on the blade’s surface before the yellow blades were hurled at him. They were, in fact, made of lightning: their speed was nothing to underestimate either.</p>
<p>At the same time as Shin dodged them, Gian had pulled back his weapon. He had anticipated that it would be knocked down, so he did not drop it as before, but had it ready for the next strike already.</p>
<p>“Are you a monster…!?”</p>
<p>Even if he looked cool and composed, however, the whisper that escaped his lips revealed his true thoughts. Gian wouldn’t give up yet though: He thrust the lance again…at a distance that would never reach Shin. When he did, just like the second strike, yellow blades sparked from the tip.</p>
<p>“This brings back memories.”</p>
<p>Shin parried the blades this time, then whispered to himself.</p>
<p>What Gian had used was the Spear/Lightning combination skill 【Tri-Edge】. This skill was a Spear/Lightning composite, but there existed 【Tri-Edge】 skills with other elements and weapons: it was a skill common to all bladed weapons.</p>
<p>It allowed the attack to change elements depending on the foe, so it was used in various ways by beginners and veterans alike. The skill’s effect was to add elemental follow-up attacks to weapon attacks.</p>
<p>“It’s not over yet!”</p>
<p>Gian looked at the lightning blades parried by Shin and swung the lance. He drew a cross, then added a horizontal stroke. The strikes, drawn as to divide Shin in six parts, burned bright red. Gian didn’t stop there however: he quickly pulled back his weapon, then thrust it again. This time the tip released a blade of wind, difficult to discern with the naked eye.</p>
<p>“You can use combos too?”</p>
<p>Shin dispelled the flames and blade of wind headed towards him with a swing of his weapon, then went to attack Gian, a pleasantly surprised impression on his face.</p>
<p>Some skills, when used in quick succession, became combinations: Gian had used one such technique, which the players called combo.</p>
<p>“Damn it!!”</p>
<p>Even if he used skills, Shin only had to swing his weapon to neutralize them.</p>
<p>Gian witnessed this reality and cursed it. That too, however, was put to a stop when he blocked Shin’s blade. Sponge weapons did look soft, but when Gian blocked Shin’s blade with the handle of his lance, the impact was strong enough to make his body shake left and right.</p>
<p>The boy managed to parry Shin’s attacks three times; the fourth time his arms went numb, and on the fifth the lance’s handle was pushed into his body, which flew in midair.</p>
<p>“Gian was using his skills, but was pushed back all the same…it looked like he was flying along the ground, but will he be okay?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin said that he would with that equipment, so I think so. Look, Gian’s standing back up.”</p>
<p>Lecus looked worried, but Gian was already on his feet again. He touched the spot struck by Shin’s blade with some confusion.</p>
<p>“You don’t have any damage except sliding on the ground, right?”</p>
<p>“…yeah.”</p>
<p>It felt very strange to Gian to not have suffered any damage after an attack like that. Shin checked Gian’s HP gauge to be sure, but it really had not decreased at all.</p>
<p>“Next is my turn, then!!”</p>
<p>Leaving Gian aside, the even more excited Myu ran up to Shin. They knew already that her gauntlets and leg guards could not sustain Shin’s attacks, so she had switched to Sponge Knuckles and Greaves.</p>
<p>“I’m going all out!!”</p>
<p>Differently from Gian, Myu used skills since the start. The aura enveloping her body was probably 【Ki Manipulation – Living Lightning】. The relative stability of the aura showed that it was a Skill, not an Art.</p>
<p>Her physical abilities boosted, Myu prepared to jump straight close to Shin…not that he would ever allow it. He lowered his blade on Myu’s frontal charge, but she made no attempt of defending herself or dodging it.</p>
<p>If hit, she would be knocked to the ground, but the blade simply passed through Myu. Like smoke swept away by wind, Myu simply vanished.</p>
<p>“Oh, 【Ki Strike】, huh.”</p>
<p>Behind the vanished Myu, the real one was not about to punch Shin. Knuckles and Greaves wrapped in flames, if she punched or kicked flaming versions of her fists and feet would extend for about 30 cemel.</p>
<p>Myu’s illusion had been created by the barehanded martial skill 【Ki Strike】, while the flame attack range extensions by the Barehanded/Flame combination skill 【Flame Kata – Crimson Lotus】.</p>
<p>Myu went for a right jab, a left jab, then crouched down and did a leg sweep. As all these attacks were dodged by Shin, Myu continued with a spin kick, making use of the sweep’s momentum.</p>
<p>【Flame Kata – Crimson Lotus】 lasted for 60 seconds. Myu’s aggressive offensive made it look like she was on fire herself, but Shin blocked it completely calmly. The flame attacks had physical mass, so they could be stopped by Shin’s blade.</p>
<p>“Mmghh!!”</p>
<p>Myu was frustrated to see all her attacks miss, but she remembered about the skill’s time limit, so she stepped away from Shin. Without waiting another moment, she gathered fire around her greaves.</p>
<p>“How about this!!”</p>
<p>Myu drew an arc in midair with her leg, turning into a backflip. When she landed, she unleashed a flying kick towards Shin. On the spot where she had done a backflip, two balls of fire formed close to the ground and also headed towards Shin.</p>
<p>“Oh, not bad.”</p>
<p>It was a method to perform an attack from multiple directions alone, very popular in the game era. Usually, long-distance attackers such as mages or archers used it, but depending on how it was used, the skill was suited to close distance fighters like Myu too.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit of nostalgia, Shin ignored the flames and focused on countering Myu’s attack.</p>
<p>The skill Myu used was the Barehanded/Flame combination skill 【Crawling Fangs】, which allowed the user to shoot flames from the feet, at one’s preferred timing.</p>
<p>The flames heading for the target, however, were 20% a physical mass and 80% a magical object, so closer to magic, which meant that they were pretty much meaningless before Shin’s high magic resistance.</p>
<p>“Look out!”</p>
<p>Lecus, who was not aware of the flames’ actual composition, shouted towards Shin, who stopped Myu’s flying kick only.</p>
<p>Myu meant it when she said that she would go all out: the ground-crawling flames had a rather high temperature. If they hit, Shin would be fine, but Myu herself risked to be hurt.</p>
<p>Before Myu, her leg caught by Shin, could protect herself, Shin stomped his feet on the ground. With a powerfully echoing sound, the ground formed a rift. The vibration caused the rift to rise even higher, and the flames clashed against it and disappeared, never reaching their target.</p>
<p>Only faint sparks of lingering heat remained, brushing against Myu’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“Game over. I’m going to let you go now, okay?”</p>
<p>“You’re so amazing, Mr. Shin…”</p>
<p>Myu landed without trouble. She had experienced Shin’s strength firsthand, so more than anything else, her respect towards him increased. Her thirst for a battle had settled down, so she now looked at him like she was looking at a hero.</p>
<p>“Hey, is she always like that?”</p>
<p>“Well, actually, it’s my first time seeing Myu like this…”</p>
<p>Shin asked this question to Lecus, who stood before him as the last opponent, but the boy was just as confused.</p>
<p>“Once, she said that she likes strong people, so that might have something to do with it.”</p>
<p>“I see…oh, sorry, that wasn’t something to ask before training.”</p>
<p>“No, despite knowing her for a while I was perplexed too, so I understand your question, Mr. Shin.”</p>
<p>Personality-wise, Myu tended to favor strong people, but it was apparently the first time she showed such a sudden change of attitude.</p>
<p>“Let’s start then. As I said before, no need to hold anything back, all right? I’ll be okay even if you hit me with all your power, so do that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>Lecus was not worried anymore about hurting Shin. He had seen how Shin had remained unscathed from Myu’s 【Crawling Fangs】, so he knew that he wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>Lecus was a mage, so he started his battle strategy from a more distant position than Gian or Myu.</p>
<p>“O magic filling the air, gather in my palm…”</p>
<p>(O magic residing in my flesh, rush to my foes…)</p>
<p>Lecus started chanting. Just like he had done for Gian and Myu, Shin let him make the first move.</p>
<p>“So this happens when you do multiple chanting.”</p>
<p>Shin’s ears picked up Lecus and one more voice doing the chanting. He knew it was because of the 【Multiple Chanting】 skill, but wondered how it exactly happened. Shin possessed the 【Instant Chant】 skill, which if used with 【Multiple Chanting】 made it possible to use multiple spells at the same time without chanting.</p>
<p>He had no need to waste time chanting thanks to it, so he did not know how 【Multiple Chanting】 worked by itself.</p>
<p>“…well, it’s the right chance to try.”</p>
<p>Using 【Instant Chanting】 was the norm, so Shin had never tried 【Multiple Chanting】 alone. Since the timing was just right, he tried chanting with the same timing as Lecus.</p>
<p>“Come hither, frozen lands. What I seek is…”</p>
<p>(O dew traveling in the mist, gather in my palm…)</p>
<p>It was a very peculiar sensation: Shin’s mouth chanted the words to create a magic ice barrier, while in his head resounded the chant to create magic ice bullets, overlapping with the chant he actually pronounced.</p>
<p>(I can do it, sure, but…)</p>
<p>To think while chanting was something he never did normally, but as it turned out, it was not problematic at all.</p>
<p>Soon enough, the chanting ended. Shin had started a bit later than Lecus, but they finished at the same time.</p>
<p>Lecus had chosen the spell 【Air Bullet】, which as the name says launches bullets made of air, and 【Thunder Line】, which allows the caster to shoot lighting bolts in any direction they wish.</p>
<p>Shin, on the other hand, had chosen 【Ice Wall】, which creates a barrier of ice, and 【Water Bullet】, which shoots a barrage of water bullets.</p>
<p>The first clash was between the water and wind bullets. Shin’s water bullets struck the invisible wind ones one by one, as he could see them. That was possible thanks to the 【Magic Vision】 skill, which let the user see magic power. In the game, it was a skill pretty much all players had to learn to compete.</p>
<p>“There is too much difference in the power of one single blow, I see. But in this situation…”</p>
<p>Seeing five of his wind bullets being destroyed by one of Shin’s water shots, Lecus realized that he could never win in terms of firepower. His eyes, however, showed that he hadn’t given up yet: he probably wanted to try to strike a 【Thunder Line】 through the spot where the wind and water bullets clashed.</p>
<p>The trajectory the caster could have 【Thunder Line】 travel through varied from person to person. Inexperienced casters could only make it travel in an arc or change directions two to three times only. As the caster gained experience, they could make the lightning take more complex routes: a very small number of players could use it as if the lightning itself avoided the obstacles on its path.</p>
<p>In order to test Lecus’ skills, Shin divided his ice barrier into several smaller ones, setting up several icicles while the water and wind bullets clashed. The bullets would obviously hit the icicles too, making it harder to target Shin. In such a case, even moderately experienced users would decide to make the lightning bolts take a roundabout path.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Each one of Lecus’ palms produced a lightning bolt. The bolts traveled straight through the field where the icicles and bullets were still clashing.</p>
<p>“That’s something.”</p>
<p>Dodging the bolts out of sheer physical ability, Shin let out a comment, impressed. The lightning’s streak clearly showed the difficult path they took. The bolts lasted for mere seconds, but to imagine two different ones in a field where magic forces clashed was a very arduous task.</p>
<p>Very few players could draw such complicated trajectories during battle.</p>
<p>“Hahah…he avoided them…not even blocked them..”</p>
<p>In contrast with Shin’s impressed tone, Lecus was both dejected and confused.</p>
<p>Lightning and Light-type magic spells were often a surefire hit, unless the caster missed themselves, as they traveled at the speed of light, much faster than a person’s reaction speed, thus unavoidable…or at least, supposed to be so.</p>
<p>Some people could do just that, actually: by reading the opponent’s movements, limiting the timing and direction of their attacks, detecting magic power, “somehow”, etc. The reasons were many, but each allowed them to avoid such attacks.</p>
<p>In Shin’s case, he somehow “felt” them coming through pure instinct. It could be an extension of his detection of danger. Because of this, he could not explain how he avoided them.</p>
<p>Lecus had witnessed Shin dodge lightning during the battle with Gian, but did not think that he could do it even while magic was clashing and icicles blocked his field of view.</p>
<p>“Let’s end this here, okay?”</p>
<p>“Aah, yes. If you can avoid that, I have nothing else I can do.”</p>
<p>Even if they continued, Lecus would be simply overwhelmed by Shin’s 【Water Bullet】 barrage, so Lecus accepted Shin’s words without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Okay, the final battle is with the whole party. Do you have any other members, by the way?”</p>
<p>“We three are the only regular members. Sometimes we join with other small parties or let solo adventurers join, but it never went well.”</p>
<p>The other students can’t keep up with Lecus’ party: the difference in base ability was that large.</p>
<p>Even the mage Lecus, from a normal person’s perspective, was as strong as a physical fighter.</p>
<p>There were other Chosen Ones in the institute, but for some reason they didn’t blend well together.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, there’s nothing I can do about party members. For the time being, let’s focus on powering you guys up.”</p>
<p>Individual training and team battle practice. Based on what he had seen in the dungeon, Shin thought that they had many things they could improve.</p>
<p>“I’ll say it again, you don’t need to think about holding back.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke after preparing his blade in a fighting stance.</p>
<p>Gian and Myu stood side by side, with Lecus behind them. All three of them looked very serious.</p>
<p>They couldn’t make Shin lose his composure a bit one-on-one, so it was clear that they were thinking of pulling it off together. Maybe because they were fighting as a party now, only Gian had a new piece of equipment, a Sponge Shield.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this!!”</p>
<p>Following Gian’s shout, Myu and Lecus started moving too. Gian charged forward, holding his shield high, using it to hide his lance from Shin’s view. He planned to not let Shin anticipate his attack until the very end. Over Gian’s head, Myu unleashed a flying kick.</p>
<p>Two attacks at the same time…thee, counting Lecus chanting behind them.</p>
<p>Shin caught Myu’s flying leg, spun once and threw her in Gian’s direction.</p>
<p>“Nwah!?”</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<p>Gian instinctively moved his shield and lance to block Myu’s fall. When Shin attempted a follow-up attack, the surroundings were filled with mist.</p>
<p>“Get back, quick!”</p>
<p>The mist disappeared around Shin, but Gian and Myu had followed Lecus’ order and retreated, so he could not see them. Knowing that Shin would block the offensive, Lecus had prepared a magic spell to block his field of view.</p>
<p>“So, what are you going to do next?”</p>
<p>Shin knew where they were, thanks to presence detection. It looked like they would attack from three different directions. Maybe wary of Shin’s reaction, they took around 30 seconds to slowly move around him. One was right in front, the other two diagonally behind Shin.</p>
<p>They had probably decided the timing to strike. Without any particular signal, they all started attacking at the same time.</p>
<p>The attacker from the front, piercing through the mist, was surprisingly Lecus.</p>
<p>“【Triple Bullet】!!”</p>
<p>Fire, water, and invisible wind bullets shot from his hands.</p>
<p>From behind, Myu sent 【Crawling Fangs】 and Gian used 【Tri-Edge】 before both of them charged towards Shin. Knowing that normal attacks would never damage him, they tried to strike him all together.</p>
<p>“You’ve thought this through.”</p>
<p>In response to the three young warriors’ offensive, Shin walked towards Lecus. Magic would barely affect Shin, especially if Lecus was the caster. As this was battle training for them, Shin advanced while knocking the bullets down, then struck Lecus’ neck, who was trying to retreat. That meant that Lecus had died. Myu and Gian “died” too after a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Aah…not even one hit…”</p>
<p>“Crap…”</p>
<p>“Just completely out of your league. Asking you for training was the right idea.”</p>
<p>Myu and Gian did not even try to hide their frustration. Lecus had understood that they would never match Shin in the first battle and was thinking if there was a way for them to get back at Shin.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s review the battles until now. Then Yuki will be your opponent.”</p>
<p>As long as they didn’t lose all enthusiasm because of losing, they could improve. So Shin felt while he talked to the kids.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 2 – Part 2</p>
<p>“Good morning. The sun’s up, rise and shine.”</p>
<p>“Hn….? Ah, good morning.”</p>
<p>A gentle voice and hands shook Shin mostly awake. He got up from the bed and noticed that Schnee had already changed.</p>
<p>“Ever since we were teleported here, you’re always waking me up.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Shin cocked his head to one side, wondering if he found it harder to wake up. Usually they would have breakfast right away, but today was a rest day, so they could take it easy.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you sleeping when I wake up…”</p>
<p>“Why such a serious expression? That’s perfectly fine, isn’t it. I can see your sleeping face, after all.”</p>
<p>“No, I must protest! I too want to see your sleeping face!”</p>
<p>“What protest is that…really…”</p>
<p>Shin’s childish retort left Schnee almost at a loss for words, but her expression was very peaceful.</p>
<p>“At night I can see your sleeping face more though.”</p>
<p>“T-that’s because you’re always so—aah, what are you making me say!?”</p>
<p>“My my, I just meant to say that you always sleep early and wake up early. Whatever were you thinking about, dear Schnee?”</p>
<p>Schnee was probably not used to such jokes yet: Shin’s little trap made her blush to her ears. He smiled, thinking of how adorable she was.</p>
<p>“Kh…euh….if you keep saying things like that, I won’t cook you breakfast anymore!!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!! Please forgive me!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s advantage lasted mere seconds. The room they were staying in was equipped with a kitchen, so it was possible to make simple dishes. Before, they used to have breakfast in the hotel’s restaurant, but Shin started to miss Schnee’s cooking, so she would prepare breakfast every day now.</p>
<p>With his weakness — the stomach — struck, Shin surrendered immediately. He was bowing to Schnee on the bed, a sight no one would believe a High Human would produce.</p>
<p>“Do you realize your mistakes?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am, I most surely do.”</p>
<p>“…good grief. You should think a little more before teasing me.”</p>
<p>“How do I say it? I never get tired of seeing you embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I’m sorry! I said too much!”</p>
<p>Feeling that the mood was not one for jokes, Shin quickly bowed his head again. A few days had passed since they became one, but Schnee’s way of addressing Shin was starting to become less and less courteous, reducing the distance between them.</p>
<p>Coupled with their reciprocated feelings, being alone together allowed their relationship to change from master and servant to man and woman very quickly.</p>
<p>“Enough about that, what will we do today? There’s no training, so we can take it easy.”</p>
<p>“Right…”</p>
<p>Schnee’s tone suggested that she wanted them to spend a relaxing day together. Shin had no objections, but since they had an entire day, he would like to do some sightseeing.</p>
<p>The Erkunt Institute of Magic engaged in studies in various fields: items to improve people’s lifestyle, techniques to improve production technologies, etc. They did not, however, study real world sciences. They considered it dangerous to further studies in such disciplines in a world where magic existed.</p>
<p>More realistically speaking, Hilamee and Masakado were only junior high school students in the real world, so their knowledge only reached a certain extent.</p>
<p>As far as Shin could remember, that world always tended to explore different directions than the original world’s technologies, so he was interested in taking a look at what they were studying.</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, I was just thinking.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized, then told Schnee what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>“I see. We can take it easy here whenever we want, so we might as well go out today.”</p>
<p>“Is that really okay with you? We can always do this another time.”</p>
<p>“No problem. For me, the most important thing now is to be with you.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s words warmed Shin’s heart. For a brief instant, he saw Marino’s silhouette overlapping Schnee’s, but that disappeared quickly. She wasn’t Marino’s replacement. Shin hadn’t forgotten his former lover, but seeing her in Schnee was wrong, or so he thought.</p>
<p>“Thank you, let’s do that then.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee hadn’t gone sightseeing since they were in Hinomoto. Schnee changed into a pink sweater and white long skirt with an accessory bag slung over her shoulder. Her hair was held with the hairpin bought in Hinomoto.</p>
<p>She would stand out in a town crowded by adventurers, but in shopping and residential districts, there were many people dressed in a similar way: it was a relic of the game era, when all sorts of clothing were on sale.</p>
<p>Clothes were classified as accessories, but there were many examples that were difficult to imagine existing in a fantasy world, such as bunny girl costumes or nurse attires.</p>
<p>The clothes chosen by Schnee were categorized by the system as “townsfolk clothing”.</p>
<p>Normally, their defensive powers would be next to zero but bizarrely enough, they boasted resistance to bladed weapons, fire, and thunder on par with iron armor, since they had been made by Rokuten’s Cashmere.</p>
<p>Being much sturdier than they looked was a common characteristic in Rokuten-made equipment.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reason why they were not equipped with water resistance was that Cashmere claimed: “wet clothes sticking to the body is just so sexy”, to Shin and Hecate’s enthusiastic approval.</p>
<p>In the game era, such a pointless effect (clothes sticking to the body) did not exist, so Cashmere’s choice was nothing short of meaningless.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s okay if I go out like this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that looks nice on you.”</p>
<p>Shin wore navy blue pants, a white shirt and jacket, clothing more modern than fantasy-like, in order not to let Schnee stand out too much. It was a kind of outfit he had seen in a fashion magazine before.</p>
<p>“I thought we’d stand out more.”</p>
<p>“Players spread their clothing styles extensively after all.”</p>
<p>The town of Erkunt was just like a western Europe town, similar to ones Shin had seen on TV. Leaving science and technology aside, clothing and everyday items were not difficult to recreate, so many wore designer clothing just like Shin’s attire that day.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because the institute’s head of research &amp; development, Hilamee, was a former player, but many people in the city wore clothing very close to modern fashion.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like this in Bayreuth or Falnido though.”</p>
<p>“This type of clothing is not always popular, after all. They’re not appreciated at all in certain locations. This town’s people seem to like it quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“You have a point. The textile industry is more advanced than I thought here. The institute’s uniforms could easily pass as real world ones, well, you’d only find them in manga or light novels though…”</p>
<p>The uniforms could easily be confused for cosplay costumes.</p>
<p>“So, where are we going?”</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry for picking this as a date destination, but I wanted to check out a weapon store. Other than Hilamee, the close combat-oriented Masakado is here too, so I figured they must have progressed in that field too. I wanted to see how developed they are.”</p>
<p>Shin’s real reason was another, but he was too embarrassed to say it clearly. He was actually worried that Schnee’s mood would turn sour.</p>
<p>“I see, let’s go to a store that deals in armor and accessories too then. You can probably draw all sorts of information just by looking at the items on sale.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, that’d be great.”</p>
<p>Shin was relieved to hear a proactive proposal from Schnee. He also agreed to go to a restaurant serving unique dishes without hesitation.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left the hotel and headed towards a store in the institute district, said to be the best. They followed the map drawn by a hotel clerk and arrived at a street lined with glass shop windows.</p>
<p>Looking at Shin’s automatic map, they would need to make a slight detour to reach the store. They had told the hotel clerk that they weren’t in a rush, so they probably drew a longer route to let them enjoy the city’s sights.</p>
<p>All sorts of items were displayed inside the shop windows. Most of them were clothes worn by mannequins in various poses, just like in the real world. Shoes, bags, and accessories were laid at their feet, stimulating the shopping impulses of the people passing by.</p>
<p>Shin felt like he had been transported back to his former world.</p>
<p>“Hilamee designed this street apparently.”</p>
<p>“…I see. I guess she couldn’t forget.”</p>
<p>After a slight surprise, Shin was convinced. When Shin first met Hilamee and Masakado, they were still junior high school students in real life. In the death game, they had died while protecting players younger than them. After coming to this world, what did they feel in their hearts as they lived on? Shin could only try to imagine.</p>
<p>Hilamee might have become headmistress of a learning institute because she felt attached to the “school” environment, thought Shin as he felt somewhat conflicted.</p>
<p>“Shin, you look so deep in thought.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I know nothing comes out of just thinking, but…”</p>
<p>Every time he met a former player, Shin couldn’t help thinking. If THE NEW GATE hadn’t become a death game, if they had returned to their everyday lives, what would have happened?</p>
<p>“Whoops! Schnee?”</p>
<p>Shin was scratching his cheek when suddenly Schnee grabbed his right arm, holding it tight to make it stretch straight. Shin lost his balance a little, leaning towards Schnee.</p>
<p>“You were thinking about what would have changed if the Death Game never happened, right?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Shin was shaken to know that his thoughts had been completely seen through.</p>
<p>“Is that not so?”</p>
<p>“Well, a bit.”</p>
<p>Shin understood that he couldn’t deceive Schnee’s pressure. He answered honestly and she hugged his arm tighter, strong enough that a normal person’s arm would have been twisted in a weird direction.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17619 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SchneeHuggedShinsArm.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>“If that never happened, I would never have touched you like this. So, for me—!?”</p>
<p>Shin was confused at first, but quickly caught on what Schnee was going to say and sealed her lips. He was not completely unaware of her feelings.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to talk about what happened or not happened, not anymore. In the death game, I also acquired many new bonds.”</p>
<p>If the game remained such until the end, some relationships with other players would have never become so deep. Even if it was a death game, not everything that happened was negative.</p>
<p>Shin’s words probably calmed Schnee, because she relaxed the grip on his arm. Calming down, however, they started noticing things they didn’t until a few moments before.</p>
<p>“That was too forward…”</p>
<p>“Show-off…”</p>
<p>“Shit! I want to be that guy!”</p>
<p>“My my, so passionate.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had been walking down a quite crowded street. People, not knowing the circumstances, would think that Schnee pulled Shin closer to make him kiss her.</p>
<p>“…let’s speed up the pace.”</p>
<p>“…yes.”</p>
<p>Laughing embarrassedly to the surrounding people, Shin quickly pushed the violently blushing Schnee forward. The surrounding whispers had colored her expression a red more violent than ever before. Schnee’s personality would never let her show her affection so clearly in front of so many people normally.</p>
<p>“First, let’s settle down a bit.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Even if camouflaged, Schnee’s good looks attracted attention. The two took shelter in a narrow alley, but Schnee was still blushing hard, looking down with one hand grabbing Shin’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“Er, no, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kissed you in a place like that.”</p>
<p>“N-no! I was the one who made you worry, and I didn’t hate, I mean, I didn’t hate it, so…”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t see her expression, but the ears poking out of her hair were progressively redder.</p>
<p>He felt that he had seen this expression a lot the last few days. Maybe she was relieved, her worries gone, or maybe she had lowered her defenses with Shin…no matter what the reason was, Shin was more than satisfied to be able to see such adorable moments so often.</p>
<p>“Schnee, won’t you show me your face a little?”</p>
<p>Schnee expected to be scolded, but heard an unexpected question instead. Her embarrassed expression was starting to become one of his favorites.</p>
<p>“Nn…you’re much nastier than I thought…is it so fun to see me embarrassed!?”</p>
<p>Schnee buried her face in Shin’s chest, to prevent him from looking at it, but peeked up just a bit to protest. Her eyes, glazed by tears caused by the embarrassment, glared at him.</p>
<p>She probably meant to accuse Shin, but he just found her all the more lovely. He couldn’t help but pat her head, thinking of a random excuse to do so. One of his favorite pastimes lately was to pat her head when they were alone in their room.</p>
<p>“Hn…don’t think you can change the topic like that!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really…so I guess I can’t do it in our room either…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>Schnee silently rubbed her head against Shin’s hand, as if telling him to do it more. Yet another side of Schnee that Shin didn’t know.</p>
<p>He found it very pleasant to pat her too, so he was completely in favor of continuing.</p>
<p>They were in a narrow alley without much traffic, but from a third party’s perspective they looked just like any other flirting couple.</p>
<p>“…it’s a bit of a shame, but we should go.”</p>
<p>“Right. Let’s continue when we get back to the hotel.”</p>
<p>Shin was the first one to come back to his senses, realizing how other people must have been looking at them. Thinking that they couldn’t just continue flirting like that, he let go of Schnee’s hair and pointed at the street. She nodded and they headed once more towards the store.</p>
<p>After they walked for some time, Shin realized that what they would do once back in the hotel had been decided. When Schnee decided that she would have Shin spoil her, her usual cool demeanor always vanished.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 2 – Part 3</p>
<p>“So, here we are…is this the right place?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the storefront, then checked the map again. The surrounding buildings matched the characteristics marked in the map. What puzzled Shin was that he couldn’t find any sign indicating the building was a shop.</p>
<p>“The door’s open, so let’s try going inside.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. If it’s not here, we’ll just start looking again.”</p>
<p>Shin put a hand on the door handle and peered inside. The map was right after all: he could see all sorts of weapons displayed inside. Once they entered, they saw another row of weapons lined up along the wall, which they had not been able to see from the doorstep.</p>
<p>These included longswords, twin swords, long and short spears, bows, and axes. The swords and spears were all Legend grade, the bows and axes Unique grade. A quick glance around the store revealed that the weapons, other than the ones lined along the walls, were all of Normal grade, with some Rare ones here and there.</p>
<p>“Looks like this is the place. I don’t see any clerks though.”</p>
<p>Each weapon had a price tag next to it, so Shin was sure they were for sale. The absence of a clerk was probably justified by the anti-theft skill attached to the store. If someone tried to grab a weapon and run, they would be prevented from taking it outside.</p>
<p>“Excuse me! Is anyone there?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please wait a moment!”</p>
<p>Shin called towards the back of the counter and a reply came back right away. Soon, a man in his twenties, wearing overalls and with a towel wrapped around his head came out.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. Did you have an appointment?”</p>
<p>“No, I heard that this is the best workshop in town, so I wanted to have my weapons repaired.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be right to just barge in and demand to see their work, so Shin planned to pick a half-used weapon from his item box, ask them to repair it, then see what level of skill they had.</p>
<p>“Who recommended this store? If you have a letter of introduction, I would like to see it.”</p>
<p>The young man was very polite. Shin pictured such workshops as places where people didn’t care that much about manners, so he was a bit surprised. From the young man’s physique, Shin figured he was the blacksmith or an apprentice.</p>
<p>“I heard it from the staff of hotel Morgana. I haven’t asked for his name though.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t have a letter of introduction, so he just said that he heard about the workshop from the hotel staff. He had just asked about weapon stores to a passing clerk, so he didn’t know the name.</p>
<p>“Morgana, I see. We are a bit busy at the moment, so it might take some time, is that alright with you?”</p>
<p>“How long would that be?”</p>
<p>“We would be able to start tomorrow afternoon. It appears that lately the monsters’ turf around town changed: the new monsters that appear are much more powerful than before.”</p>
<p>The young man explained that because of this, requests to repair weapons and for new equipment increased exponentially, so at present they lacked manpower. Shin asked if this sort of thing happened often, but the young man replied that that was not the case.</p>
<p>In that world too there were areas where powerful monsters spawned, but Erkunt was not one of them. Sometimes there were reports of mass monster migrations, a possibility which was being currently investigated.</p>
<p>“Our boss is a blacksmith skilled enough to have donated a prized sword to the king, but even so, there is a limit to what he can do. At present, we only accept orders from clients who can wait.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. I didn’t know about that monster business. Time is not an issue for me, so please.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Can you let me check the status of the equipment? Please place it on the counter.”</p>
<p>The extent gear could be repaired naturally depended on how damaged it was. Sometimes there were clients who presented items beyond repair, so blacksmiths always checked the item in need of repair before deciding whether to accept the job or not.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee did not seem to be carrying any weapons, but the young man acted as if they did. He had probably guessed that they had weapons in item card form.</p>
<p>Shin had no intention to keep him guessing, so he took out an item card and materialized it. The young man did not bat an eye at the process. Once he checked the weapon, however, he quickly lost his cool.</p>
<p>“What the…!?”</p>
<p>The young man let out a surprised mumble. As expected of an artisan, he understood right away what kind of weapon Shin had materialized.</p>
<p>What Shin had placed on the counter were a long spear and a short sword.</p>
<p>The spear was the lower Unique grade 『Hollow Spear』, the short sword the lower Rare grade 『Azoth』.</p>
<p>『Hollow Spear』 had a chance of inflicting paralysis if the opponent’s STR was lower than the user; 『Azoth』 slightly increased the user’s magic power.</p>
<p>Both had been used during the training with Lecus and the others, enough to require repairs.</p>
<p>“Not the slightest imbalance in magic power distribution, and not even one impurity? What the…”</p>
<p>“Can I count on you, then?”</p>
<p>“Please excuse me, I need to call the boss. Could you please wait a moment?”</p>
<p>The young man had probably concluded that the job was too much for him. He went behind the counter and was about to enter the corridor in the back, when he noticed something and stopped.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is there something wrong, boss?”</p>
<p>“I just felt a bizarre presence. You were coming to call me, right? The reason is…you, right?”</p>
<p>A man in his fifties appeared from the corridor. He was shorter than the young man, but his arms were twice as thick as the young man’s arms.</p>
<p>Based on his experience, Shin guessed that he was a Dwarf. Maybe he was in a bad mood, because his expression was nothing short of fierce.</p>
<p>“Never seen your face around here. I’m Vulcan, the owner of this workshop. So, what happened?”</p>
<p>“It’s about these, I can’t really decide by myself.”</p>
<p>“Really? *You* can’t?”</p>
<p>Vulcan looked at the young man with an amused expression.</p>
<p>The fierce-looking man, wearing an outfit suited to the boss of a pack of mountain bandits, looked like a boy who had found a new toy. The sharp glint in his eyes showed that he was gauging what kind of person he was dealing with.</p>
<p>“…I see, now I know why you were flustered.”</p>
<p>Vulcan took the 『Hollow Spear』 from the young man’s hands, looked at it for a while, then spoke. He did not add anything else and proceeded to check 『Azoth』.</p>
<p>He examined the blade and decorations for several minutes, then placed it back on the counter.</p>
<p>“You want us to perform maintenance on these?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, is there a problem?”</p>
<p>Vulcan’s serious expression made Shin wonder if there was anything off with the weapons. Vulcan did not answer immediately, looking intently at Shin instead.</p>
<p>“Ehm…”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you better suited to take care of these?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Shin instinctively flinched because of the unexpected question. He had come all the way to a smithy, it would be normal to think that he couldn’t repair them himself. Vulcan, however, asked again, with absolute confidence.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re trying to do here, but you’re a blacksmith, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Shin was at a loss for words, but Vulcan’s tone was completely positive. Nothing about Shin’s appearance was supposed to suggest that he was a blacksmith.</p>
<p>“You look like you don’t know how I can tell. Well, if you examine me you’ll find out right away, but I can tell if the person before me is a blacksmith.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to brag, but I’m pretty well known in the business. There are plenty of types that pretend to be normal people or adventurers to get close to me and steal my techniques. Thanks to that, I guess my eyes got good at spotting them, the people like you who come up here hiding their job.”</p>
<p>“That’s, well, impressive.”</p>
<p>“Spare the compliments. So, what did you come here for anyway?”</p>
<p>“…I wanted to see how skilled this town’s blacksmiths were. I wanted to know if there were techniques I didn’t know, but I didn’t plan to steal anything.”</p>
<p>Shin realized that it would be useless to try to pull the wool over Vulcan’s eyes, so he stated his purpose with total honesty.</p>
<p>Techniques were always the fruit of long processes of trial and error. Shin had decided that he would never try to steal such a thing. He could tell a number of things from looking at the finished product, but couldn’t steal a technique with just that. He had planned to negotiate to achieve that, if possible.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Like you said, I’m a blacksmith. It’s just that I’m not familiar with recent smithing techniques, so I wanted to ask about it.”</p>
<p>Vulcan seemed to be slightly confused, and Shin started to feel doubtful too. Trying to test their skill had been a bad approach, maybe, so he started to feel concerned.</p>
<p>“Recent smithing techniques, huh. You talk like a long-living species.”</p>
<p>“Do you think so?”</p>
<p>“The lady over there is an Elf, but you’re just a Human, right? You look just a bit over 20. Even if you were holed up in a smithy since you were a brat, you couldn’t have a presence of fire this strong, nor smell like iron like this, you…you can even forge Legend, no, Mythology grade weapons, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“Grandpa!? What are you saying!?”</p>
<p>The young man couldn’t help reacting to Vulcan’s question. He was his grandson, apparently.</p>
<p>“Did your trained eyes tell you that too?”</p>
<p>“No, this is a special skill of mine. Blacksmiths gain a particular presence from the furnace and materials they use. The stronger their furnace, the stronger fire presence they have. If they use high grade or rare materials, they smell different than iron or steel. Of course, without sufficient skill no one can have that presence or smell. Yours is a lot stronger, much more powerful than even the chief I used to work for. Makes me almost doubt my instincts.”</p>
<p>Sweat streamed down Vulcan’s cheeks, but it wasn’t because of the heat coming from the furnace room.</p>
<p>“I must say that I’m really surprised. How did you acquire such a skill?”</p>
<p>“This is just what my senses tell me. I’m proud to say that it never failed me, though. So, what do you say? Not that I want to force you to talk.”</p>
<p>“No, I was the one that tested you after all. It is true that my skills are something that shouldn’t be revealed openly, I think. But that’s only what my master told me, I really don’t know about modern techniques. My master was from the old generation…how can I say it, he was something like a hermit.”</p>
<p>It would be troublesome to reveal that he was a High Human, so Shin explained that he had learned his skills under a master. His companion, Schnee, was from a long-living species, so it was a bit more convincing.</p>
<p>“I see, a long-living master from the old generation…they probably knew heaps of lost techniques we have no idea of. If you were his disciple, well I guess that explains it all.”</p>
<p>Vulcan didn’t seem fully convinced, but since he had just made it up, Shin laughed sheepishly, acting as if he couldn’t say anymore.</p>
<p>“…fine, I’ll show you how I forge. But in exchange, you’ll do the same too, deal?”</p>
<p>“Grand—I mean boss! Is this really okay!? I know that your senses are sharp, but you’ve just met this man!”</p>
<p>The young man had listened quietly to Vulcan and Shin’s conversation, but finally interrupted. Things had been proceeding really quickly, so Shin was also wondering if it was really all right, a suspicion that turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Vaal. It frustrates me to no end to say this, but the skills this man learned make mine look like child’s play. Don’t tell me that you haven’t realized it after looking at those weapons.”</p>
<p>“That’s…right, but…”</p>
<p>Vulcan clearly stated that looking at a weapon was enough to learn of the skills of its creator. The young man, Vaal, had no objections about that point, but was perplexed about the situation.</p>
<p>“Well, we plan to stay in town for a while, so you don’t have to decide right away…”</p>
<p>“Can’t do that. With the union as it is now, even if they see these weapons, not all of them will understand what I said. They’re always boasting that their mission is to improve Dwarf techniques and technology, but there are always the types that get lost in faction quarreling. I don’t want those in the way.”</p>
<p>Dwarves too had their own circumstances.</p>
<p>Shin remembered that the union was an organization for the sharing of techniques and technology, created by Dwarves instead of forming a country. Dwarves were normally solely focused on improving creation-type skills, but in an organization, authority and position always came into play.</p>
<p>“But boss, if you show your skills without permission, we might be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Just shut up and we’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“No way!? You want to make me into an accomplice??”</p>
<p>If it was for the sake of learning new techniques, Vulcan didn’t give a hoot about the union’s rules. It seemed like he thought that Shin would not cause trouble, but as a union member, it was a problem nonetheless.</p>
<p>“You say that, but you want to see too, don’t you? How a man that can forge weapons like these actually tempers the iron?”</p>
<p>“That…that’s…”</p>
<p>Vaal looked away, very clearly conflicted because of Vulcan’s question. He still glared at the very eager Vulcan, but he actually shared the same desire.</p>
<p>“So what are you going to do? This sort of chance won’t come twice, you know?”</p>
<p>“Nnh…nngh….”</p>
<p>Vaal grimaced, as if fighting against something. Vulcan kept pressing on, grinning widely. Shin, on the other hand, stepped away from them.</p>
<p>“…okay. Today he…er…”</p>
<p>“The name’s Shin.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Today, Mr. Shin never came here. Let’s put it like that.”</p>
<p>Vaal finally surrendered. Between unknown techniques and the union’s rules, the curiosity towards the unknown won.</p>
<p>“Is this okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes. As boss said before, he was assistant to the Dwarves’ chief before. If he says that this was an exchange of techniques aimed to improve Dwarven technology, things will be settled somehow. Fortunately, you too are a blacksmith, Mr. Shin, so it wouldn’t be strange for such an exchange to be held.”</p>
<p>Vaal looked a bit concerned still, but Shin was very eager to see Vulcan’s skills, so he pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>After Vaal agreed, things proceeded even quicker. Vulcan would show his technique first, then it would be Shin’s turn.</p>
<p>“It may be too late to ask, but is this really fine? It seems like you agreed so fast…”</p>
<p>Vaal talked to Schnee, who was smiling behind Shin. He was involved too, so he felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He had frozen for a moment when he saw Schnee, but thinking that she had to be connected to Shin, he didn’t get strange ideas about her.</p>
<p>“When Shin seeks new techniques, it’s always for our sake. I have nothing to say.”</p>
<p>“Is, is that so.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s reply radiated trust. It couldn’t be helped that Vaal felt a little envious.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Schnee. Please wait a bit.”</p>
<p>“I know that it’s like a sickness you have. I’ll wait, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized profusely, but Schnee simply looked at him as if she was thinking “he just can’t help it”. She sat down on a chair Vaal took out for her, opened a book with a blue cover and put on glasses with a red rim. The book, 『Book Maker』, automatically searched for the story that the holder desired and displayed it; the glasses, an item called『The Eyes』, were a support accessory.</p>
<p>“Schnee with glasses…not bad.”</p>
<p>Shin let this comment slip when he saw Schnee take out items to pass the time. Just putting on a pair of glasses gave the wearer an intellectual atmosphere; it was a mystery. Another reason was probably that Schnee usually did not wear glasses.</p>
<p>“Stop being silly and get this over with quickly!”</p>
<p>Schnee pushed Shin in the corridor to the furnace room, to hide her blushing face. When the blacksmiths disappeared in the shadows of the corridor, she said to herself “maybe changing my look once in a while would be nice…” as she tried to cool down her flushed cheeks, unaware that Shin heard that all too well.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 2 – Part 4</p>
<p>“Right, I’m starting then.”</p>
<p>Once they arrived in the smithy, the men’s atmosphere completely changed.</p>
<p>Shin, Vulcan, and Vaal all fell into complete silence. They looked like different people than when they talked with Schnee moments ago.</p>
<p>“The furnace and iron are ready.”</p>
<p>Vaal, who was checking the fire burning inside, spoke to Vulcan.</p>
<p>Even in the game, without skills blacksmithing was pretty much the same as real life. Materials, forging techniques, and goals changed, but tools and equipment were by and large the same.</p>
<p>Furnace functions, however, varied very much. Tsuki no Hokora’s furnace would imbue magic into the iron it produced automatically, so even just tempering metal could create high level weapons.</p>
<p>Vulcan’s furnace was a special type, close to what Shin had in Tsuki no Hokora. The iron it produced was of high purity and was imbued with magic.</p>
<p>“I’ll start now.”</p>
<p>After saying this, Vulcan grabbed the iron with tongs and heated it up. His hammer was specially made: every time he swung it down, sparks and magic power danced in the surroundings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17642 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BlacksmithVulcan.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>Vulcan also possessed the Blacksmithing skill: just like Shin, he was really quick with his hands. That speed was probably what made it possible for them to accept orders for new items on top of repair and maintenance requests. Of course, each request was handled with maximum care.</p>
<p>Until now, it was all work that Shin was already familiar with.</p>
<p>“Start.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>When the blade shaping process started, Vaal joined Vulcan in tempering the iron. As Vulcan and Vaal swung their hammers, the magic power imbued in the blade changed little by little. They both tempered the metal by pouring their magic into the hammer.</p>
<p>Pouring magic inside tools was something that Shin did as well, but compared to when Vulcan was doing it alone, the blade’s strength and magic power were higher now. It was like the two blacksmith’s magic power resonated, forming something greater than the sum of their powers.</p>
<p>(Their magic powers are overlapping? You couldn’t ever figure this out if you worked alone.)</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how it exactly worked, but he understood how their magic powers interacted with each other. Based on his experience, he felt that their magic was far too attuned when swinging their hammers: the tools themselves must have had some special trick, or so Shin guessed.</p>
<p>(They make their magic overlap and create layers, huh. What effect could this have?)</p>
<p>Looking at the two blacksmiths work, Shin wondered what effects it could lead to. He imagined it would increase the weapon’s sturdiness or sharpness. Another possibility was, in case of magic swords, an increased rate of magic-related effects even without being attached with particular skills.</p>
<p>While thinking about the possible effects, Shin also wondered whether he could use this technique himself. He had never seen this technique before, so he wanted to make use of it somehow. A method to use this new technique to reinforce weapons was already beginning to form in Shin’s head.</p>
<p>“Phew…we’re done.”</p>
<p>One hour had passed since they started working. From inserting the iron in the furnace to sharpening the weapon, the process was now complete. From a purely blacksmithing viewpoint, it was an unfathomable speed. For a skill or art user, however, it was nothing but normal.</p>
<p>“So, did you see anything you didn’t know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a very educating experience.”</p>
<p>The finished product was the middle Legend-grade 『Long Sword』. It was a basic item that all sword users in the game had wielded at least once. Vulcan had probably chosen it on purpose: a basic shape could show differences more clearly.</p>
<p>Shin examined it more closely and, as he had expected, noticed that sturdiness and sharpness were higher than if magic power had been poured into it normally.</p>
<p>“So it’s my turn next.”</p>
<p>Shin was exceptionally allowed to use the workshop’s tools, but prepared his own hammer. It did not have any special effects, but it had been specially forged by Shin himself.</p>
<p>He grabbed the metal with tongs, heated it, and struck it. He repeated the process and struck again.</p>
<p>The process itself was the same as what Vulcan and Vaal did, but there was one clear difference: Shin was hitting the metal with his hammer, and nothing more. He changed the striking point a bit, but there was a phenomenon happening that such actions could not explain.</p>
<p>“What the…the iron is changing shape all by itself…”</p>
<p>“Grandpa, I can’t believe my eyes…”</p>
<p>Every time Shin swung his hammer, the metal progressively changed its shape into a sword. What shocked Vulcan and Vaal was that spots that Shin did not strike changed shape too. It was a mysterious sight, as if the iron was changing shape on its own accord. The same thing happened when Shin showed his techniques to Kanezuka Araki in Hinomoto: no blacksmith worth his salt could miss such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>“It’s complete.”</p>
<p>Shin stated that the weapon was complete, before even touching the whetting stone. Normally, it was impossible for a weapon to be complete before sharpening, but the sword Shin was holding looked as sharp as if it was whetted by a master of the craft.</p>
<p>What Shin forged was a higher Legend-grade 『Long Sword』.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Vulcan and Vaal must have heard Shin, but showed no response. What they just saw must have been just that shocking.</p>
<p>“Er, would you like to have a closer look?”</p>
<p>“Damn right!”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Vulcan and Vaal shouted their replies to Shin’s question together. They seemed extremely excited, but handled the sword as if it was a very fragile treasure.</p>
<p>“I never saw him temper the tip, but the shape is well done…did the iron change shape by itself, because of magic? That would explain the balance…”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t explain the blade’s edge, though. It can get sharp to a degree even without whetting it, but this? This is the work of a master artisan…”</p>
<p>A heated debate started, with Shin’s 『Long Sword』 at its center. Vaal seemed to be well trained enough to be allowed to temper alongside his master: the debate evolved to technical analysis quickly.</p>
<p>“Nngh…sir Shin…could it be possible for you to leave this piece with us?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, but with the grade what it is…”</p>
<p>For Shin it was just a 『Long Sword』 without much importance, but for the people of this world it was a national treasure level item. He had been living in this world for a while now, so he had become familiar with the circumstances concerning such topics.</p>
<p>Vulcan probably had no such intentions, but Shin couldn’t just give away an almost Mythology-grade weapon without thinking carefully.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right…but from just this one blade, we could learn so much…”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>“This is packed with unknown techniques. It’s not like those weapons found in dungeons or ruins, which we don’t know who made them or how they made it. This has been made by a person, with my furnace and iron. It’s a lot more valuable than some powerful, and nothing else, national treasure. No way you could leave it here…kkh, I know, I understand it in my head, but…”</p>
<p>Shin planned to refuse because it was too powerful, but Vulcan’s words made him understand the true importance of the sword. Vulcan and Vaal had also witnessed the process behind its creation: even if they couldn’t understand it completely, it was still a lot better than not seeing anything at all.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, you are an adventurer, yes? Could you grant us your teachings, even just while you stay here?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m already teaching some students at the institute, I just don’t have the time…”</p>
<p>If he started being involved here too, his free time would disappear. Having too much of it wouldn’t be good, but being too busy would be worse.</p>
<p>He had accepted to act as instructor for Lecus and the others so he could avoid slacking off too much, but if he ended up having to give up on spending time with Schnee, he would effectively be defeating his main objective.</p>
<p>“Teaching? Were you hired by the institute?”</p>
<p>“Just as a front. I agreed to give some students battle training, just until my comrades arrive here.”</p>
<p>“If you can handle weapons like these, you have to be quite the fighter yourself, but…that young lady is a quick worker, isn’t she…”</p>
<p>“Do you know Hilamee?”</p>
<p>“I sure do, I’m the one that does maintenance on her partner, Masakado’s sword, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin was surprised, but understood how they were connected.</p>
<p>The dwarf chief Vulcan acted as counselor for what could be compared to a king: someone directly under someone in this position was definitely skilled.</p>
<p>If Masakado still used the weapon he had when he died, it was a middle Legend-grade broadsword, something an average blacksmith and furnace could never hope to handle.</p>
<p>“Hmm, what a shame, what a shame…”</p>
<p>“Boss, I understand your feelings, but we can’t trouble him anymore…”</p>
<p>“Nngh…!!!”</p>
<p>Looking at the mumbling Vulcan, Shin was reminded of Barbatos’ shipwright, Zigma, and thought that artisans really were the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Blacksmiths and shipwrights built completely different things, but their passion, personality and feelings were quite similar. If they found new, unknown techniques, they couldn’t help crave to obtain them.</p>
<p>“In any case, I’m sorry to say that I can’t come share my master’s teachings, but I’ll come whenever I have the time.”</p>
<p>“Please, you must. I haven’t had this much fun in ages.”</p>
<p>“Boss, don’t push yourself too hard now…”</p>
<p>Vaal’s shoulders dropped as he looked at Vulcan’s almost menacing smile. Based on Vulcan’s words and actions until now, Shin realized that he would probably start working right away, maybe even forgoing to eat and sleep.</p>
<p>“Till next time then.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for today. I’ll do some trial and error on my own too.”</p>
<p>Shin collected the sword he tempered in exchange for the materials used, waved goodbye to Vaal, and left the workshop. As he noticed while leaving, the smithy’s name was 『Anvil of Steel』.</p>
<p>The time was still a bit after noon, so Shin and Schnee had lunch in the restaurant she mentioned wanting to try, then took a walk around town. Maybe because the institute was also a research facility, there were lots of shops selling monster materials, minerals, various kinds of catalysts, and much more. The guild also had facilities both in the institute’s district and the district where the king supposedly resided.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere sure changes from street to street.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, they are really divided neatly into categories. If similar shops are grouped together, it’s surely more convenient for everyone too.”</p>
<p>If you wanted something, you just had to go to the area where they sold it, or so Shin figured. Vulcan’s workshop too was located in a street that could be called “weapon store avenue”.</p>
<p>“There are still places we haven’t seen, but let’s call it a day. No need to see it all in one day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s save it for another day.”</p>
<p>There was still some time before Filma and the others could arrive. It would be different if they were moving at max speed, but they were going at a leisurely pace, enjoying the trip.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee still had plenty of time to spend together, so there was no need to hurry.</p>
<p>They walked back to the hotel, enjoyed dinner, spent the evening together, then went to bed.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin made sure Schnee was asleep, then quietly went outside. His objective was just outside Erkunt’s castle walls.</p>
<p>Using 【Hiding】 to make sure no one saw him, he materialized Tsuki no Hokora.</p>
<p>“Here we go…”</p>
<p>Shin had taken out Magic Steel and iron imbued with magic power. Holding them in place with tongs, he swung his hammer. He held nothing back this time, so the Magic Steel started changing shape quickly, turning into a 『Long Sword』.</p>
<p>Shin placed it on a piece of cloth and examined it. Differently from the one he forged before, the magic power imbued in the blade was irregular, thicker and thinner in places.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess that’s how the first time goes.”</p>
<p>Shin had tried imitating Vulcan’s technique. As he was forging by himself, he couldn’t use it the same way, but he thought that he could adapt it in his own style.</p>
<p>Things didn’t go smoothly right away, naturally; the 『Long Sword』 he tempered was simply of lesser quality than the usual.</p>
<p>“To make layers of magic power, I guess doing it with another person is necessary…?”</p>
<p>Shin continued striking the iron while doing trial and error.</p>
<p>In the empty smithy, only Shin talking to himself and the sound of struck iron could be heard.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 2 – Part 5</p>
<p>“Good morning, time to get up.”</p>
<p>A clear, gentle voice caressed Shin’s ears. Usually, he would wake up promptly with just this sound, but today Shin was heavily afflicted with sleep. Recently, he often ended up falling asleep again after waking up the first time.</p>
<p>“Just five more…no, 10 more minutes…”</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare breakfast and come again in 15 minutes. But if you won’t wake up then, you’re skipping it.”</p>
<p>The words he received in reply seemed kind, but they actually contained a very firm warning, which Shin clearly noticed. Before, he had overslept for five minutes and really gone without breakfast.</p>
<p>The reason behind his need to rest was simple: every night he would sneak out of the hotel and work hard in the smithy. He kept it a secret from Schnee because he wanted to surprise her with something after he learned the new technique.</p>
<p>“Morning…”</p>
<p>Shin was suppressing a yawn as he sat down at the table. Thanks to his high stats, even with a severe lack of sleep, the only disadvantage was a slight drowsiness in the morning.</p>
<p>After the meal, Shin was sipping tea on the sofa, thinking of a training menu for Lecus and the others, when Schnee came up from behind and put her hands on his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Shin, there is something you have to tell me, yes?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Not really…”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s tone changed. Shin reacted instinctively and tried to stand up, but Schnee was faster. Her grip on his shoulders became stronger and kept him from standing up, moving to hold his neck.</p>
<p>“Aah…er, you see…”</p>
<p>His back to the sofa, Shin couldn’t escape if Schnee held him from behind. Because of the sofa’s size, in that position Shin’s head would inevitably rest against Schnee’s bosom.</p>
<p>From a third party’s perspective, it looked like Schnee was holding Shin’s head. She was just wearing a thin shirt, so Shin’s head was enveloped in the soft sensation of Schnee’s mounds. He even ended up thinking that it wasn’t so bad a situation to be in.</p>
<p>“No secrets, we’ve talked about this before, right?”</p>
<p>“…okay, okay, you win.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t make any objections to that.</p>
<p>Because of her skills and main job, Schnee was very sensitive to the presence of others. She had probably noticed Shin’s nightly outings very soon.</p>
<p>“You probably know already, but every night I go to the smithy to practice a new technique. I saw Vulcan use it the other time, and realized that I can still improve.”</p>
<p>After repeated trial and error, Shin’s technique was still an imitation, but it had started to take shape. His Blacksmithing skill was helping his attempts. If not, it would be impossible to imitate techniques so easily.</p>
<p>“Shin, I won’t tell you not to push yourself too hard. I know that when you do, it’s always for someone else’s sake. This time too, it’s for me…no, for us, right?”</p>
<p>If Shin’s blacksmithing skills improved, he could reinforce their weapons and armor further. In this world there existed monsters that not even Shin and Schnee could match, so Shin did not want to miss any opportunity to reinforce their gear.</p>
<p>He wanted to do so as soon as possible, to lessen any risks as much as he could. Ever since Shin arrived in this world, Schnee’s equipment was much stronger than it had been in-game.</p>
<p>“I am happy that you are thinking about us. But in that case, let me assist you too. Maybe I can’t do anything, but I don’t want you to bear the burden alone.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s embrace grew stronger. He couldn’t see her expression, but her voice was enough to understand how she felt.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry for making you worry. Actually, I was thinking that it would be a lot better if you could help me. But, you know…”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t want to stubbornly hide the truth, but there was a reason why he preferred to.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason why you can’t tell me?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. Honestly speaking, I wanted to keep it a surprise, a present.”</p>
<p>“A present….? Wah!”</p>
<p>The topic shifted from reinforcing gear in an unexpected direction, so Schnee was confused. Shin felt her grip loosen and he drew her closer to him, without letting her finish.</p>
<p>With a perfectly useless show of skills, Shin made her spin in midair and sat her on his lap. It looked just like Schnee had jumped over the sofa to sit on top of him.</p>
<p>“Er, what…?”</p>
<p>Schnee could have fought back if she wanted, but since her ‘opponent’ was Shin, she leaned on him. She was still confused, but she buried her face in his chest.</p>
<p>“I mean that, what I’m trying to create is not equipment, but something else.”</p>
<p>“Something else?”</p>
<p>“Yes. After defeating the evil deity, well, I confessed, right? You said okay, right? So we’re like, husband and wife now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Shin was rather embarrassed to say the words “husband and wife”, but Schnee replied with a smile beaming with happiness. He coughed a little, then started talking again while looking straight into her eyes.</p>
<p>“So…you know? It’s not like I want to prove it, but…I’m thinking of making wedding rings. Since I’m at it, I wanted to properly learn this new technique first. After I craft the rings, I want to enhance them with as many buffs as possible.</p>
<p>“Wedding…rings…!? ……!? Let’s make them!! We must!!!”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t seem to understand right away, but as soon as she did, she grabbed Shin’s lapel and stared at him, her eyes sparkling.</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, sure. So please give me a hand.”</p>
<p>“Of course!! Leave it to me!!”</p>
<p>Schnee never looked so eager. Thanks to her assistance, Shin’s understanding of Vulcan’s technique progressed rapidly too. Because of this, it couldn’t be helped that Shin started wondering if Schnee was blessed with a natural talent for blacksmithing too.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 3 – Part 1</p>
<p>“We’re starting to see results of your training, and you’ve gotten better at fighting together too. I think it’s time for a trip to the dungeon.”</p>
<p>Almost two weeks had passed since Shin began training Lecus’ party. Thanks to training with Shin as an opponent, they had been able to give it their all without reserves, so they had already improved a lot. The dungeon’s inspection had concluded too, so Shin decided that it was about time to go.</p>
<p>“By the way, how far have you been in the dungeon?”</p>
<p>“The deepest part, floor 200. Rare monsters appeared and took residence there. We challenged them, but there were just too many, so we retreated before they overwhelmed us. Because of those monsters, no one has gone beyond floor 200.”</p>
<p>Among the monsters that spawned in dungeons there were also rare ones that dropped valuable items and equipment. They appeared in a few spots, and it was not easy to encounter them, but as all players knew, if you found them you had to take them down.</p>
<p>Rare monsters, however, had higher stats and levels than normal ones: sometimes even superior versions of the regular monsters appeared. Such monsters appeared ignoring any and all “suggested levels” for the dungeon, naturally, so sometimes the situation would reverse, with the players becoming monster prey.</p>
<p>Shin recalled that rare encounters seldom happened in training dungeons, but the possibility was still not zero, so he simply thought it wasn’t such a strange occurrence.</p>
<p>“It’s a large mob of enemies, I see. Do you know the monsters’ names?”</p>
<p>“As far as I could tell, there were Mob Ant Soldiers, Knights, Searchers and Archers. I think there were others in the back too, but I couldn’t identify them.”</p>
<p>Among all insect type monsters, ant and bee types were known for their large numbers. Hearing this, however, Shin had a bad feeling about the situation.</p>
<p>“I see, the typical large mob monster, that’s for sure. Those aren’t rare monsters, though, so the ones in the back must be. How did all the Mob Ants look?”</p>
<p>“Well, they were much stronger than the Mob Ants we were familiar with. Both attack and defense power were far higher than normal. Even the Searchers, who aren’t supposed to be strong, withstood Myu and Gian’s attacks, and retaliated.”</p>
<p>“They were that different? Even if there were Queens or Commanders around, you guys should be strong enough to take out most ant-type monsters in one blow, though.”</p>
<p>The monsters Shin mentioned had the ability to boost the abilities of Ant-type monsters under their command. Commanders could boost their subordinates’ abilities more, but Queens had the ability to increase their numbers.</p>
<p>Mob Ants, however, were the lowest rung of Ant-type monsters. Unless there was an immense quantity of them, Lecus’ party should hardly have difficulty defeating them.</p>
<p>“Any other particular details?”</p>
<p>“No, not that I remember…what about you, Myu? Gian?”</p>
<p>“…no, I can’t recall anything special.”</p>
<p>“Me neither…but! I remember something weird when I fought them!”</p>
<p>Myu continued explaining the source of her weird feeling.</p>
<p>“Some of them felt different than the others. Their fangs and features were sharper, like they had more thorns too…”</p>
<p>When Mob Ant Soldiers were attacked, some had their carapace split open, while others just suffered some cracks, or so Myu said.</p>
<p>Myu’s 【Analysis】 was not as thorough as Shin’s, of course, so she couldn’t see the monsters’ characteristics in detail, but even so she clearly stated that there weren’t large differences between each monster’s level.</p>
<p>“A difference in strength despite no difference in level…I can’t say it’s impossible, but what Myu said about what happened after attacking bothers me.”</p>
<p>One blow from Myu should suffice to defeat any monster up to level 200. Monsters without carapace or armor would be blown away too.</p>
<p>Monsters in training dungeons had levels corresponding to the floors they were in: while there might be some variations, the max level in this dungeon would be 200.</p>
<p>Based on Shin’s experience, there had to be at least a 100 level difference between the monsters who had their carapaces split apart and the ones who just had it crack. For Myu and the others, it was a pretty important gap.</p>
<p>“They can boost their allies’ stats, so…there might be Commanders.”</p>
<p>There was the possibility of rare versions of Mob Ant Commanders, which had the ability to buff their allies, to have appeared.</p>
<p>Some rare monsters sometimes gained unique abilities, at the expense of reduced stats compared to their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>“By the way, why is the institute not doing anything about them? Won’t people start doubting they can properly manage the dungeon?”</p>
<p>“If the monsters turn out to be impossible for us to overcome, a teacher from the battle department is dispatched. In cases like this, they just monitor the situation for at least six months.”</p>
<p>They could afford to not do anything about the monsters for such a long time thanks to the status being a training type one. Fighting monsters different than the regular ones would be beneficial for the students: rare monsters too, were part of the subjects taught in the institute.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, let’s go fight in a floor a bit higher, for starters. If there aren’t any problems, let’s take a crack at them.”</p>
<p>If the “test” battle didn’t seem to go anywhere, they’d just retreat. Shin thought that he could help them that much.</p>
<p>“Hehehe…we’re not the same anymore! Time for revenge!”</p>
<p>“Sure, if we have to run away again, we’ll be faster too.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Gian! Don’t say stuff like that!”</p>
<p>Myu, feeling the improvements from their training, very eagerly punched and kicked the air. Gian dampened her enthusiasms with a sarcastic remark, so she pouted back at him.</p>
<p>“Come on, you two, you’ll be left behind at this rate.”</p>
<p>Prodded by Lecus, Myu and Gian followed behind Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>“Hm? You are…”</p>
<p>“Thanks for your assistance last time. We have proper permission today.”</p>
<p>“Who would think we’d meet again like this. I heard about it already, just write your names here.”</p>
<p>At the entrance of the training dungeon, Shin found a man he had met before: the security guard Bermann, whom they had met when they were first transported into the training dungeon.</p>
<p>This time, Shin and Schnee’s identities were verified, so there was no room for suspicion. Lecus and the others also knew him, so his demeanor was more relaxed.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had limited access to the institute’s facilities, so it was only their second time meeting Bermann.</p>
<p>The training dungeon was located at the edge of the institute’s grounds, so even if Shin walked around the institute, they would probably never meet.</p>
<p>“You won’t die inside this dungeon, but let me say this all the same. Make sure you stay on your toes!”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>This wasn’t probably the first time they had this exchange. Gian, Myu and Lecus answered Bermann in unison.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee nodded to Bermann, then entered the dungeon. In training dungeons, you could teleport directly to floors you had already visited as soon as you entered.</p>
<p>Shin judged it too rushed to go straight to floor 200, so he decided to start from five floors above, floor 195, which looked just like an average cave, the same where Shin and Schnee were first transported to.</p>
<p>“By the way, those Red Caps were a lot more than the usual too. What was that about?”</p>
<p>“Er, well, that…”</p>
<p>“That bimbo over there opened a chest without paying attention and triggered a monster house.”</p>
<p>“Aaah!! You didn’t have to say it!!”</p>
<p>Chests in dungeons are often armed with booby traps. Disarming them would allow the explorers to obtain the contents, but if they failed they would trigger the trap, which was more dangerous the more valuable the chest’s contents were.</p>
<p>As far as Shin could remember, in training dungeons it was possible to tell if the chests were armed with traps even without trap disarming skills.</p>
<p>If what Gian said was true, Myu had probably opened the chest without watching for the trap, thinking that things would somehow turn out okay.</p>
<p>“If this wasn’t a training dungeon, you might have all died, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yes…I’ll be more careful…”</p>
<p>Myu was aware that she had messed up, so she answered feebly to Shin’s rebuke. She seemed to understand her mistake, so Shin didn’t say anything else. Honestly accepting a scolding, without rebelling or talking back, was one of Myu’s good points.</p>
<p>Her movements were larger than usual, probably because there were no monsters around. Among the three, Myu had the highest detection skill.</p>
<p>“Is this floor always like this? The floor we were transported to had more monsters, if I recall.”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned this as he could not pick up any monster presences in the dungeon. This continued in the 195th and 196th floors too, which was clearly unnatural.</p>
<p>“It’s the first time for us too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, like Gian said, it has never happened to not encounter even one monster like this.”</p>
<p>Lecus and the others, who used this training dungeon daily, found the situation bizarre too.</p>
<p>“Mngh!! Monster presence detected!”</p>
<p>Finally, on floor 197 they picked up a monster presence. Myu, who had the highest detection skills of the three, pointed in a direction in the cave. She didn’t know what kind of monster it was, so she quietly called for the others’ attention.</p>
<p>Myu, Lecus and Gian would mainly engage in fighting. Shin and Schnee would assist them in case of an emergency and look for ways for the students to improve their battle abilities.</p>
<p>“It’s coming!”</p>
<p>A few seconds after Myu’s warning, a one-mel tall Mob Ant Searcher appeared in the corridor.</p>
<p>Mob Ants were the lowest level of ant-type monsters. They looked like normal ants, just larger, with thicker antennae. Their major characteristics were shells with high defense and durability and the ability to summon their brethren if the fighting continued for a long time.</p>
<p>“It’s different from before…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it didn’t have a pattern like that on the shell.”</p>
<p>“Maybe the monsters below came up. Mr. Shin, Ms. Yuki, I think that is one of the monsters related to the rare ones. What should we do?”</p>
<p>Shin first used 【Analyze】 on the Mob Ant Searcher, to find out what level it was, but the displayed name was different than what Shin expected.</p>
<p>【Mob Ant – Avarice Level 206】</p>
<p>“Avarice?”</p>
<p>The monster looked like a Searcher, but the patterns on its shell and the displayed name suggested it was a different monster. The patterns were red lines running all over the monster’s body, like the tribal markings native Americans or shamans would use, or so was the impression Shin had.</p>
<p>“The monster changed? This and the lack of monsters above are giving me a nasty feeling.”</p>
<p>Things were taking a turn for the worse, without anyone realizing it: so Shin felt when he saw the Mob Ant – Avarice.</p>
<p>Lecus and the others wanted to fight, but the name change concerned Shin, so he decided to fight first. He told the kids to stand back and watch, then stepped in closer to the monster. A flash of 『Kakura』 and the monster was cleaved in two, completely cut down.</p>
<p>The Mob Ants in the back too were defeated in quick succession.</p>
<p>For Shin, the Mob Ant – Avarice was just like any other small fry monster: maybe because he remembered what Myu said, though, he thought that their shell was a bit harder than normal.</p>
<p>“What the…?”</p>
<p>What surprised Shin’s group the most, however, was what happened after the monsters were neutralized. Monsters inside dungeons normally never left their remains behind. The Mob Ants’ corpses, however, showed no signs of disappearing.</p>
<p>After a few moments of observation, Shin noticed that the Mob Ants’ remains started vibrating.</p>
<p>“Parts of the corpses still have HP?”</p>
<p>According to 【Analyze】, the shaking monster parts all showed to have HP, which meant that they were still alive. It was bizarre, however, for the scattered corpse parts to each have HP left.</p>
<p>Insect-type monsters could sometimes survive even if their torso was cut off, but there was no way that just one of their legs was programmed to have an HP bar.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, please look at that!”</p>
<p>Shin was trying to make sense of the situation, when Lecus’ voice, indicating surprise, reached his ears.</p>
<p>“…I see, so that’s why even a single leg has separate HP.”</p>
<p>The corpse Lecus pointed at melted in a puddle and formed a Mob Ant. Its shell had the same patterns as the Mob Ant had before being defeated.</p>
<p>The only difference was the size: maybe because it was born from part of the original monster’s body, just one leg too, it was just about 30 cemel long.</p>
<p>However, in place of one Mob Ant, now 10 of them, of various sizes, had appeared. If they had different sizes, but shared the same strength, they would be quite a menace.</p>
<p>“Even if they’re defeated, their corpses come back to life? This doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>“Could they increase in numbers the more they’re defeated?”</p>
<p>“Could be.”</p>
<p>Looking at the Mob Ants increasing in quantity, Lecus and the others retained their will to fight but were very confused. They had experienced Shin’s strength directly, so it was shocking to see that the monsters were not defeated by his attack.</p>
<p>“It’s still too early to get nervous. Luckily, there are still few of them. Let’s see if there’s an effective way of defeating them.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Shin’s tone was calm.</p>
<p>“But won’t they just increase more?”</p>
<p>“We’ll test that too. To what size they change, if there’s a limit to the times they can change, what happens if we burn or freeze them with magic, there’s still plenty of things we can try. We won’t get overwhelmed by numbers just yet, so it’s our best chance to find out how to fight them.”</p>
<p>Shin grinned to show his confidence, and Lecus’ party calmed down a bit. They looked at the Mob Ants: in terms of individual fighting strength, Shin’s party was definitely superior, so as long they were careful of the enemy numbers, they would still be okay.</p>
<p>“First, the size. Let’s see if they can come back even if they get turned to pinky size. After that, we’ll burn them up and freeze them with magic, bury them, shatter them, see if anything changes. When you find unknown monsters, never charge in without a plan.”</p>
<p>With stats like Shin’s, it would be different, but the basic ironclad rule was to never push oneself too far and to test which attacks or elements were the most effective.</p>
<p>Too many players had been punished harshly for just charging in the enemies’ ranks.</p>
<p>“Here we go!!”</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p>“Make sure you don’t get in Mr. Shin and Ms. Yuki’s way.”</p>
<p>Following Shin’s orders, Lecus’ party attacked the smaller Mob Ants: Myu with punches and kicks, Gian with slashes, Lecus with lightning attacks.</p>
<p>Lecus’ magic was the most effective, followed by Myu’s blows. Thrusts and slashes like Gian’s were not very effective against monsters with shells or carapace: it depended on the user and the weapon’s rank too, but players normally defeated such enemies by breaking down their armor first.</p>
<p>“Magic slows them down, but apart from that, it’s the same as before.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go around crushing ants, so we can see if there’s limit to how many times they came back.”</p>
<p>“There’s no other way, I guess. I’ll make sure none escape.”</p>
<p>Shin watched the students, deciding what strategy each of them would take, nodding as he turned the Mob Ants to cinders. Most insect-type monsters were weak to fire: Mob Ants too were weak to fire in the game.</p>
<p>Shin tried shooting a 【Fireball】, but there was too much of a level gap between him and the Mob Ants, so he couldn’t tell if it had been effective or its attack power was that high.</p>
<p>“I guess I should turn the power down a notch.”</p>
<p>Shin adjusted his 【Limiter】 and magic power control as he continued to burn down the Mob Ants. Even at very low firepower, the effects were present: if they were burned down, the monsters wouldn’t come back to life.</p>
<p>“So fire works, after all.”</p>
<p>“Freezing them does too, apparently.”</p>
<p>Schnee added her own information to Shin’s assessment: she had been freezing the ants close to him. If they were frozen till their insides shattered, they would not come back to life.</p>
<p>“Lightning can work too, depending on the power. It’d be harder with wind or earth though, I guess.”</p>
<p>Wind and earth magic often involved slicing and stabbing, so they would be hardly effective. Magic skills that caused status effects or petrification would work, though.</p>
<p>“Light and darkness are…just as expected.”</p>
<p>High firepower beam attacks and attacks that made the opponent disappear altogether, typical of light and darkness magic, did not leave physical remains behind, so resurrection was impossible.</p>
<p>“Looks like they need to retain their original form, at least partly, and their tissue intact to be able to resurrect.”</p>
<p>After using both physical and magical attacks to test the Mob Ants’ reactions, Schnee made a conclusion. If they used elements in their attacks, Lecus and the others would be able to deal with the Mob Ants as well.</p>
<p>With 【Flame Kata – Crimson Lotus】, 【Tri-Edge】 and other skills practiced during Shin’s training, they defeated the ants one after the other.</p>
<p>The Mob Ants they had initially encountered were not many, so Shin’s group overwhelmed them from start to finish.</p>
<p>“Wow, I feel so light!!”</p>
<p>Myu expressed her glee at realizing the fruits of her training.</p>
<p>“Yes, both of you move much better than before, I think.”</p>
<p>“We got beaten down so many times, of course we’d get better at fighting together.”</p>
<p>Lecus also seemed to have noticed their progress. Gian’s tone was spiteful, but he seemed happy too.</p>
<p>Not everyone could move in the same way during training and actual fighting, but there was nothing to worry about with Lecus’ group, apparently.</p>
<p>“No trouble if this is all we have to expect. The problem is further below.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard of monsters with “Avarice” in their name. He had never heard that they could regenerate from their body parts to increase their numbers, though. Having them roam around a training dungeon was extremely dangerous, he thought.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 3 – Part 2</p>
<p>“Let’s proceed a bit more and check the situation. Depending on what we find, we might have to go back to the Institute and make a report.”</p>
<p>The training dungeon was different than expected and not normal: this was Shin’s hunch, so he wanted to go on a bit more to see if he was correct, thinking that either he or the Institute would take care of it.</p>
<p>If he had to make a report to the institute, he needed more information. He regretted not taking a screenshot before. He had barely used that function in the game too, so he engaged in fighting right away. As an instructor for Lecus and the others, it wasn’t a good decision, he told himself.</p>
<p>“I wonder what’s happening? I never heard of monsters with ‘Avarice’ in their name.”</p>
<p>“You’ve never fought against Deadly Sin monsters, right Schnee? If I remember well, all monsters under Greed’s command have it in their names. Which means what we’re dealing with here is not just the appearance of rare monsters.”</p>
<p>For added safety, Shin took the lead and Schnee took the rear, putting Lecus’ party in charge of defense. They were all Chosen Ones, so they wouldn’t be defeated easily.</p>
<p>“Halt.”</p>
<p>Shin, who had taken the front, whispered.</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of monster presences up here. I’m talking about triple digits.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Lecus’ question and thought about what to do. About 200 mel from their position there was a fairly large hall, dotted with so many monster icons as to appear dyed in red. Only one of the corridors leading out of the hall showed red, so Shin guessed that it was the way to the floor below.</p>
<p>Based on what he heard from Lecus and the others about the previous battle, Shin predicted that it was a swarm of ant-type monsters.</p>
<p>“If those escape from here, things will get nasty fast. Do monsters ever come out of this training dungeon?”</p>
<p>“No, not that I know of. If that could happen, they wouldn’t leave it near the institute, not even at its edges like now.”</p>
<p>“Right. This disaster is just a matter of time though. They could spill out at any moment.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed with Lecus’ opinion, but knew he couldn’t leave such a large mob of monsters alone. According to his detection skill, what was happening in the room before them was a prelude to the monsters spilling out of the dungeon.</p>
<p>In the game era, Shin had experienced such events a number of times. A large group of monsters gathers in one place, but they do not fight each other. Just like a balloon pumped with air to its limits, they wait and finally explode out.</p>
<p>“Should we go back and report?”</p>
<p>“This situation is going to rupture while we do that. Okay then, Lecus, Myu, Gian: you three go back up and tell Bermann what’s going on. From the guards’ post they can probably use a fast horse or an item to contact the institute quickly.”</p>
<p>“But we can fight too….sir!”</p>
<p>“No, what we’re going to do is not fighting, but it is more like an extermination. We’ll use magic to annihilate them all at once, it’s not going to be one on one.”</p>
<p>Myu was eager to do battle, but Shin dashed her hopes calmly. He was going to perform a sort of mass slaughter via magic. While the opponents were monsters, it wasn’t something he would have liked to show them.</p>
<p>“…let’s go back, Myu.”</p>
<p>“Gian?”</p>
<p>Gian grabbed Myu’s shoulders and stopped her attempts of getting Shin to let them go with him.</p>
<p>“We’d just be in the way.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It would be different if the monster count was just 10 or 20, but there are too many this time.”</p>
<p>They hadn’t seen the enemies with their own eyes, but none of the students doubted Shin’s words. The time they had spent with him was still short, but they knew that Shin wouldn’t joke or lie in a situation like that.</p>
<p>“Nnh…okay. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Stopped by her companions, Myu calmed down too. She was a bit reckless, but to not lose her fighting spirit despite knowing about a very large swarm of monsters was something positive. If she could learn to make calm decisions, her fearlessness would be a strong point for her in the future.</p>
<p>“We’ll come back up after exterminating the monsters. There’s still the chance of monsters spilling out after we leave this floor, so when you come back down, teleport to a higher floor.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Please be careful.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded in response and proceeded deeper in the training dungeon, accompanied by Schnee. The monsters they had encountered before were probably a few scout units which had run ahead: there was no trace of monsters in the corridor they were crossing now.</p>
<p>“This is really something.”</p>
<p>“It’s almost a mystery that they don’t come out, even amassed like that.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee, hidden behind a corner of the corridor, peeked into the hall. Inside, various types of Mob Ants crowded together. On the floor, on the walls, on the ceiling, simply everywhere. On the floor, some Mob Ants were even piled one on top of the other, while the Mob Ants on the floor joined legs to form a net that acted as another layer. On the walls, too, the Mob Ants stacked one on top of the other.</p>
<p>The various types of Mob Ants present were many, but mostly composed of lesser variants, such as Searchers, Archers, and Soldiers. Sometimes they saw superior kinds such as Knights or Generals walking on top of the stacked lesser types.</p>
<p>Shin knew what they looked like, so he could tell which types they were, but all of them had “Avarice” in their names.</p>
<p>“Is Greed plotting something here? Luxuria didn’t say anything though…”</p>
<p>“Maybe she didn’t notice, or hid it on purpose…it’s hard to say.”</p>
<p>Shin whispered while taking a screenshot and Schnee replied. He doubted that Luxuria was hiding anything. Lust could coexist with people, while Greed could not: there was nothing to gain for them to join their forces.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s take them down and ponder the situation later. We can’t just leave them alone like this.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, there is no reason to ignore them.”</p>
<p>The monsters’ numbers were great, but they were so densely packed together that destroying them all at once would be easy. Schnee would seal the exits from the hall to the corridors, while Shin would burn the mob down.</p>
<p>They couldn’t reach the units in the corridors or beyond them, but if they checked the map and picked up any remaining presences, it wouldn’t be difficult to get rid of the Mob Ants completely.</p>
<p>Thanks to his map and detection skills, an almost cheat-like combination, Shin could tell how many Mob Ants were left on the floor, without any doubt.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Shin formed a bluish-white flame in his palm, about the size of a softball. At the same time, Schnee used ice magic to block the entrances to the hall. The Mob Ants noticed the bizarre phenomenon and tried charging and biting the barrier, but the beautifully transparent ice wall did not budge.</p>
<p>In a very short time, all the tunnels leading out of the hall had been sealed except for the entrance Shin and Schnee had come from.</p>
<p>Schnee glanced at Shin to give him the signal: he nodded back and pointed the bullet of fire hovering over his palm towards the center of the hall.</p>
<p>Walls of ice extended from the floor and the ceiling, to seal off their exit. An instant before the barrier was fully formed, Shin let go of the fire bullet, which flew straight towards the middle of the hall.</p>
<p>Blue and white flames rampaged throughout the hall, turning the Mob Ants into cinders in a matter of seconds. Level and type did not matter. Searchers, Archers, Soldiers, Knights and Generals turned equally into ashes.</p>
<p>Shin’s magic attack was so powerful that some of the ice barriers blocking the exits started cracking. Even so, they had been created by Schnee: the ice walls fulfilled their sealing duty until the flames died down.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee waited for the heat to decrease, then entered the hall. The floor was covered in ash and scorched Mob Ant remains, making it hard to walk. There would be no way to look for items, so Shin used Earth magic to create a path for them to walk along.</p>
<p>“There’s a few left in the corridors. Guess we’ll have to take them down individually.”</p>
<p>“Shall we move separately?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s not so many left, besides it still worries me that they were under a Seven Deadly Sin devil’s command…let’s not split up.”</p>
<p>Shin had never faced Greed directly, but he had heard from an acquaintance that while its HP was among the lowest between all the Seven Deadly Sins, its many drain-type skills made it seem like it had much more.</p>
<p>If its stats were the same as it had in the game, Schnee could easily bring down Greed by herself, but if it had absorbed other Deadly Sin devils, things would be much different. It would be much more powerful and capable of using the abilities of other Seven Deadly Sins, making the battle unpredictable.</p>
<p>Shin thought that Greed might have been in hiding, waiting for the right opportunity to strike, so he judged it unsafe to act separately.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee quickly took care of the remaining Mob Ants: the real problem was the many Mob Ants in the lower floors, which were likely to come up as well. There were still three floors to go before reaching the location where Lecus and the others said they had spotted the rare monsters.</p>
<p>“Even if we went back now, they’d petition for our help, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It would be fine if there were just rare monsters, but there’s the possibility of Greed, a Deadly Sin like Luxuria, being involved, so Hilamee will not rely only on their own fighting strength.”</p>
<p>Even a former player like Hilamee could not handle a grown Deadly Sin by herself. If it also had other monsters under its command, she would need all the help she could get.</p>
<p>“First of all, let’s proceed while checking if there are any swarms of monsters like the one we encountered just now. If there are just rare monsters on floor 200, the cause could be a different one, so we’ll leave them alone for the moment. If not, we’ll take them down. Well, I seriously doubt the cause behind this will be something other than rare monsters spawning, though.”</p>
<p>“Yes. If they are planning to do something in this dungeon, we’d better get rid of them quickly.”</p>
<p>The training dungeon was on the institute grounds, close to a city. It would be a disaster for monsters to break out of it.</p>
<p>It was probably a coincidence for such a thing to happen while Shin and Schnee were there, but even so, Shin thought they couldn’t ignore the situation. As far as Shin knew, the devil Greed was very belligerent towards people.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee continued deeper into the dungeon, wary of their surroundings. Using their detection skills, they filled the map as quickly as possible and proceeded to the floor below.</p>
<p>On every floor, however, there were no monsters in the corridors, just swarms of them packed in larger areas.</p>
<p>“In a game, situations like this are clear signs that something’s going on, usually a trap.”</p>
<p>“But even if you know that, you go on all the same, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>While relaxing a bit with some light banter, Shin and Schnee reached the location where the rare monsters were supposed to be, and found a very different sight.</p>
<p>“Well, this is pretty amazing.”</p>
<p>“The monsters in the halls were probably getting ready to welcome the Queen.”</p>
<p>Floor 200 was completely covered with Mob Ants, up to the entrance. There were Mob Ants all over the floor, walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>They were not piled on top of each other like in the previous halls, but they completely covered the corridors, so much that it was rather disgusting to look at.</p>
<p>Shin’s detection skill showed that, like in the floors above, the Mob Ants were especially amassed in the halls.</p>
<p>“We can’t just burn them all down this time.”</p>
<p>“I suppose freezing them would be better.”</p>
<p>Blowing them up all together presented the risk of blowing away the mastermind behind the incident too, preventing them from knowing who or what caused it.</p>
<p>Because of this, Schnee, more adept in water-related magic, stepped forward. She held a hand forward and the corridor before them started turning white. The Mob Ants on the floor, walls and ceiling froze instantly, a crackle-like sound being the sole echo in the corridor.</p>
<p>A white wave swept through the corridor, as if flooding the dungeon.</p>
<p>After a while, all sound disappeared from the corridor. The Mob Ants’ screeching noises, the sounds of their claws scratching the walls and ceiling, the dull sound of the Mob Ants bumping into each other, all disappeared.</p>
<p>“We’ve defeated them all, in the end.”</p>
<p>“When we were above, I would have never thought that the situation would be this awful on floor 200.”</p>
<p>If all they found were just rare monsters, they would leave it to the institute, but they didn’t have the time to deliberate on what was the proper course of action: the monsters were just too many.</p>
<p>“Just in case, let’s check the final hall, where the boss was supposed to be.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee walked down the corridor lined with Mob Ant ice sculptures. As the corridors were filled with them, they shattered the statues to open a path. Nothing was standing in their way anymore, so they quickly reached the corridor before the largest hall.</p>
<p>“Amazing, there’s only higher types here.”</p>
<p>In the hall, frozen still, there were Knights, Generals, Commanders and other advanced kinds of Mob Ants. What attracted the attention most of all was a large monster, protected by Generals.</p>
<p>It was about 10 times larger than the Mob Ant Generals, which were already fairly large compared to other Mob Ants: the Mob Ant Queen, the mother that gave birth to other Mob Ants.</p>
<p>As Shin expected, the patterns drawn on her body were more complex than other Mob Ants.</p>
<p>“So this is the culprit behind it all. Let’s take a screenshot.”</p>
<p>Compared to other Mob Ants, the Queen’s large body was easily distinguishable. After capturing the image, Shin checked if the item drops had changed.</p>
<p>“Queen Ant Fangs and Claws. Magic stones and shells. Let’s skip what we know already…and this one?”</p>
<p>Among the drop items, Shin found something clearly unrelated to ant-related goods. It was a palm-sized yellow crystal, called 『Piece of Avarice』. It was a very precious rare item, especially for artisans, dropped my monsters that Seven Deadly Sin devils had shared their power with.</p>
<p>“Now we have proof that Greed’s involved.”</p>
<p>“Could it be in the city?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I wonder. Even players can use this item, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while fiddling with the 『Piece of Avarice』. If it was used on a monster, it would be changed to a much superior counterpart. The monster did not only grow stronger, but the experience points and items it awarded increased too, so some players used them on purpose to farm items and exp.</p>
<p>The 『Piece of Avarice』 was a rare item dropped by the Greed devil, so it was rare to find it on sale anywhere. Even if it was, larger organizations would buy it quickly.</p>
<p>“Do you mean that there might be someone in league with the devil?”</p>
<p>“In the game, there were people that sided with them. It isn’t that strange for people to give in to greed, anyway.”</p>
<p>Luxuria was even working in a school at present; it wouldn’t be unthinkable for the greed devil to lure in people and manipulate them. Rather, it sounded like a realistic strategy.</p>
<p>“I see…though it is quite sad.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, we’ve defeated the ones that were prowling here, things should be okay for the time being. Besides…with due apologies to the people in this town, this works great for me.”</p>
<p>“How does this ‘work great’, exactly…?”</p>
<p>“Because I can get a 『Drop of Avarice』 from Greed’s body. If you use it, the skill cost on equipment is lowered, which means that we can add more skills to the ring.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s expression had clouded, but Shin turned the topic in a brighter direction.</p>
<p>It might sound egotistical, but judging from the current situation, it looked just like Greed had waited for them to arrive to make its move. If so, they might as well use the situation to their own advantage, so Shin mentioned the drop item.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new technique he was learning, the equipment created by Shin would become even more powerful. If he could also use items to increase skill slots, the ring would become much more than a simple proof of wedding vows.</p>
<p>Shin said to Schnee, with a cheerful grin, that they might as well think of the Greed devil as a sort of “bonus” for them.</p>
<p>“…who else but you could see things like that, I wonder.”</p>
<p>You’re just beyond help, or so Schnee’s expression seemed to say, as she showed a small smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s catch it quick and turn it into an item even quicker. It might go like with Luxuria, so there’s the chance that we won’t fight right off the bat. If this dungeon turned out like this because of Greed’s will, however, things will surely turn rough. Depending on the opponent, we could use it to see just how much Lecus and the others have grown.”</p>
<p>Shin’s clear intention of using the enemy as a test subject made Schnee smile even more. Rare monsters were like treasure chests filled with rare items. Shin’s unchanging stance probably reminded her of the game era.</p>
<p>“No monster presences on this floor. Let’s check the next just in case, then go back up.”</p>
<p>“Understood. What should we do with all these Mob Ant materials?”</p>
<p>Schnee asked Shin while looking at the frozen Mob Ants all around them. They were frozen till their insides, so unless they were turned into cards, the only items they could extract were magic stones.</p>
<p>“We have to turn them into cards, there’s no other way. We could get Hilamee to help us, but there’s just so many. Besides, some researchers might get strange ideas…”</p>
<p>Normal Mob Ants could be left alone, but the ones Schnee froze had 『Piece of Avarice』 items in their bodies. Shin felt it would be risky to leave them to their fates.</p>
<p>All floors except the 200th had been scorched to the ground, so there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>“We don’t really need the parts, so let’s wrap them all up together.”</p>
<p>When the monsters’ quantity was too large to pick up items one by one, players used a technique to turn all monsters in a set range into cards.</p>
<p>In such a case, however, the items recovered would be random, with the exception of magic stones and unique items. The players didn’t use it often, so some even forgot such a method existed.</p>
<p>Shin was only interested in the 『Piece of Avarice』 items, so he chose to use this technique.</p>
<p>“Let’s be quick, we don’t know when the institute’s people will arrive.”</p>
<p>Even if Hilamee was on Shin’s side, the institute side would probably not find it too pleasant that Shin kept all the 『Piece of Avarice』 items for himself: thus they would pick them all up first, then report about them to Hilamee only.</p>
<p>The institute inspection and support squad arrived when Shin and Schnee had finished collecting the items and checking the floor below. Lecus, Gian and Myu lead a group of 6 security guards, with Bermann among them.</p>
<p>“Might we assume that the situation is already under control?”</p>
<p>“As far as we can see, yes. We were looking for stragglers, so we haven’t checked the floor below yet.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had explored the 200th floor for the items, but they had no intention of saying that honestly, so they said that they just went around killing monsters.</p>
<p>“So that is why we have not encountered a single monster until here. The students told us that you met monsters never seen before…or should we say, mutated monsters?”</p>
<p>“We have taken photographic proof of those. Please give these to the headmistress.”</p>
<p>Shin took the screenshots and gave them to Bermann. He seemed to be aware of their existence, as he received them without showing any surprise.</p>
<p>“They show bizarre patterns, unlike normal Mob Ants. I’ve seen my share of the world in my adventuring days, but I have never seen or heard about such patterns. This Queen too is much larger than normal, judging from its size compared to the Mob Ants around it.”</p>
<p>“There’s something I want to confirm, so please tell the headmistress that whenever she has time, there is something I would like to discuss with her.”</p>
<p>“Understood. We will leave a message for you at the hotel.”</p>
<p>The institute forces would inspect the 200th floor and below, so Shin and Schnee left the dungeon. The dungeon was their territory, so Shin and Schnee -since they had also confirmed that there was no danger anymore- chose not to overstep their bounds.</p>
<p>“The previous inspection just finished, but now I guess that they’ll close it again…”</p>
<p>“They didn’t find anything in the previous inspection, right?”</p>
<p>“So I heard.”</p>
<p>Students like Lecus and the others had partial access to information about the dungeon. As Shin and Schnee were part of the cause of the first inspection, Lecus probably thought that it was okay to share the information with them. Either the inspection party had really not found anything, or something happened during the inspection.</p>
<p>“Let’s just do normal training today.”</p>
<p>“Sigh, just when we could finally go in the dungeon…”</p>
<p>Myu was eager to test the results of their training, so Shin’s proposal made her shoulders drop in disappointment.</p>
<p>“Since you seem still full of energy, I suppose today’s training will have to be stricter.”</p>
<p>“Gwagh!?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s calm smile delivered a sneak attack to the sullen Myu. The dragnil girl was happy, but Gian and Lecus’ shocked response clearly reflected how strict training was going to be.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 3 – Part 3</p>
<p>After training, Shin and Schnee headed out of the institute grounds.</p>
<p>“Those kids sure have gotten better.”</p>
<p>Shin could still hear their pained voices after the training ended. When they first started they didn’t even have the strength to talk, however, so they had clearly made progress.</p>
<p>“That’s right, they’ve also made large improvements in controlling their strength.”</p>
<p>They hadn’t trained against monsters, but they had become able to win against normal opponents without injuring them.</p>
<p>Lecus and the others didn’t know their own stats in detail, but they could make close estimates based on their speed and power. Based on this, Shin had advised them on how to use 【Limiter】 to adjust their stats.</p>
<p>“We don’t know when we can go to the dungeon again, so we might as well go out.”</p>
<p>“Some students hunt monsters as adventurers too, so I think it’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>They had already looked up what kind of monsters appeared around Erkunt. One concern was the fact that recently, monsters unlike the usual ones were appearing, as Shin had heard from various sources.</p>
<p>Vaal from the smithy had also said that the monsters’ territory seemed to have changed, causing equipment creation and repair orders to increase exponentially.</p>
<p>There were risks, but risks existed everywhere. Training dungeons without the risk of dying were more abnormal in that sense.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Shin was thinking that, in case of emergencies, he and Schnee were there to help, when he spotted a familiar face, who had already noticed Shin and Schnee and was walking closer, waving at them.</p>
<p>“I thought you might be around, because of your presence, turns out it was true.”</p>
<p>“What are you up to?”</p>
<p>Luxuria, one of the Deadly Sin devils, approached Shin. She smiled, her long black hair fluttering in the wind. The eyes behind her sharply-designed black glasses housed a suspicious glint.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence, meeting you here. Perfect for me though.”</p>
<p>“Perfect?”</p>
<p>What could be perfect for a devil? Shin started having a bad feeling about the situation.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be so wary, please. I just meant that I was looking for you, so the timing is just perfect.”</p>
<p>“Do you need something from us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. Would you mind coming with me? It’s not something to talk about standing around here.”</p>
<p>Since she was a devil, Shin couldn’t help but keep his guard up, though she did say she wasn’t hostile. Thinking it bad to be too suspicious, Shin decided to follow her for the moment.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s still early.”</p>
<p>“They serve light meals here too. Besides, alcohol is only served at night.”</p>
<p>Luxuria led them to a bar with a rather nice atmosphere. He didn’t know if she chose it on purpose, but the inside of the store couldn’t be seen from outside. Depending on how one looked at it, it might also look like an elegant tea shop. The bartender seemed to know Luxuria already as the group was led to a private room.</p>
<p>“Let me continue, then. I was looking for you two because I have something of a request.”</p>
<p>“A request?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Just after you were teleported into the dungeon, Greed…now they use the name Avaritia. A man under their command visited me.”</p>
<p>“Good thing the situation didn’t turn hairy.”</p>
<p>Greed was the second most belligerent Deadly Sin, after Wrath. If someone introduced themselves as their cohort, it wouldn’t be strange for them to be captured.</p>
<p>“He was a pretty fast runner, you see. He said something about wanting to become one with me, so he probably chose not to move in large numbers to avoid the risk of causing trouble in the surroundings and being refused by me.”</p>
<p>“The thing about devils fusing to become more powerful, right? Is that something you can refuse? I thought it happened automatically when two devils were close enough.”</p>
<p>“It did before, but not anymore. Probably because we have stronger egos now. If our personalities are different enough, it’s like the stronger absorbs the weaker. Their level was higher, but I’ve been absorbing energy here, so our fighting strength is more or less the same. They probably judged that we could end up just going down together.”</p>
<p>If devils fused together, their max level was raised by 50. It was said that if all devils fused, the resulting level would reach 1000. In the game era, however, they were always exterminated before they could do that, so Shin had never witnessed it.</p>
<p>“So that’s why he thought of another strategy”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We went down in the training dungeon today, and the rare monsters there were under Greed’s command. Here’s proof.”</p>
<p>Shin took out a 『Piece of Avarice』 from the item box and showed it to Luxuria.</p>
<p>“The dungeon…my detection range doesn’t reach there, so I never noticed. Thank you for taking care of it before something serious happened. I’m really grateful.”</p>
<p>“That was just a coincidence. Besided, if you weren’t here, Greed…no, Avaritia, right? It might have attacked this place. We could say that this city has been safe because of your presence. Having people I know here, I feel like I should thank you.”</p>
<p>If Luxuria had cooperated with Avaritia.</p>
<p>If Luxuria hadn’t come to Erkunt.</p>
<p>It was difficult to imagine that Avaritia would just ignore Erkunt. When Shin and Schnee arrived, they might have found nothing but ruins.</p>
<p>“My, if you wish to thank me, then tonight…”</p>
<p>“That will not do.”</p>
<p>Luxuria leaned over the table, looking deep into Shin’s eyes, when Schnee finally broke her silence, stopping the devil from finishing her sentence.</p>
<p>“Oh my, I do not mean to take him away, you know? I surely cannot do it by force, and charm doesn’t work either.”</p>

<p>“That. Will. Not. Do!”</p>
<p>Schnee replied very sternly to Luxuria’s teasing tone. She grabbed Shin’s arm, pulling him towards her, glaring at Luxuria all the while.</p>
<p>“My my, please, do not be like that. Or could it be that you don’t have much confidence?”</p>
<p>“Hey, that’s enou–”</p>
<p>“I will not allow any loveless acts.”</p>
<p>“If you keep chaining him like that he’ll end up hating you, you know? Can you really satisfy him, anyway? It doesn’t look you have much experience yet…”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Luxuria and Schnee’s verbal contest had passed Shin’s ability to keep up. Luxuria’s last retort had left Schnee blushing violently.</p>
<p>Luxuria took advantage of this and slipped closer to Shin, grabbing his other arm. Her movement was far too smooth, considering she was sitting across the table. It was also probably on purpose that she locked Shin’s arm between her bountiful breasts.</p>
<p>“If you want, I can teach you. Doing it with three of us together might be nice once in a while.”</p>
<p>Luxuria possessed words and a body that would sway both men and women’s minds. Shin then told Schnee to let go of his arm.</p>
<p>“Shin!?”</p>
<p>Schnee looked tense, shocked by what she heard, but Shin smiled at her that it was all right. He then formed his hand into a knife-like shape and brought it down on Luxuria’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Ow!!”</p>
<p>The very subdued chop struck, forcing Luxuria to let go of Shin’s arm and hold her head in pain.</p>
<p>“I know you were joking, but you went too far.”</p>
<p>“You…could have crushed a normal person’s head with that…”</p>
<p>Luxuria was crouching, but as expected of a Deadly Sin devil, she hadn’t lost *too much* HP.</p>
<p>“If you looked for us to tease Schnee, then we’re going.”</p>
<p>“No, no, wait a moment. I’m sorry, I apologize, really! I still haven’t gotten to the main topic…”</p>
<p>Luxuria noticed that Shin was serious, so she hurriedly apologized.</p>
<p>“I can guess what that is, though. You want us to help take down Avaritia, right?”</p>
<p>“Correct. I bet you could defeat Avaritia with your little finger now. I’d like you to do it before it tries any other pranks.”</p>
<p>“I would have never thought of hearing a Deadly Sin devil asking for another one to be defeated…”</p>
<p>Shin argued that if Luxuria defeated Avaritia, she would gain a power boost, but she turned his proposal down.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of absorbing that thing. Besides, if it had already absorbed the others, I’d become the complete form, right? I’d lose myself in the end, so I’m never going to do that.”</p>
<p>Achieving the complete form was supposed to be any Deadly Sin devil’s ultimate wish, but Luxuria flatly discarded it.</p>
<p>“It’d be nice if they all thought the same way as you…”</p>
<p>“Don’t remind me, it’s troubling me too, you know.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Okay, first we’ll investigate the surroundings and look for clues. I heard that monsters that never used to appear around here are increasing, so we’ll go searching around Erkunt, while training Lecus and the others too.”</p>
<p>“I heard about that too. It turns out the new monsters are a bit too much for average adventurers to handle too.”</p>
<p>According to Luxuria’s information, there were some monsters that surpassed level 150 as well. In Hinomoto they would get exterminated without trouble, but in Erkunt the average level was not as high, so there were more and more injured adventurers.</p>
<p>“I heard that the headmistress is going to address the monster issue during the next training session. I don’t think she’ll tell you to bring students with you though.”</p>
<p>“I planned to have them experience actual fighting soon, but if I tell her that they’d have to fight monsters stronger than usual she’ll probably worry. There’s no need to go look for trouble, after all.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll take them, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they can handle it. Besides, it’s better for them to try actual fighting as soon as possible — a real battle, where the danger of death is very real.”</p>
<p>Shin would employ certain insurances, of course, but he would not tell the students about them. He didn’t want them to rely on Shin to rescue them every time something happened.</p>
<p>Shin knew of the institute’s policy, so there was the chance that they already experienced actual fighting before. New types of monsters had apparently showed up, though, so he thought that it would turn out to be a valuable experience either way.</p>
<p>“Those children have surely grown stronger.”</p>
<p>“We’ve put them through the wringer after all.”</p>
<p>“They often come to the infirmary for light injuries, so I’ve become pretty familiar with them.”</p>
<p>Luxuria spoke with a gentle, motherly smile, very unbecoming of a devil.</p>
<p>“Really, if you didn’t do things like just now, you wouldn’t look like a devil at all.”</p>
<p>“A good while has passed since I achieved human form, it would be a problem if I still looked like a devil. I don’t like the devil form either, it’s too stocky and snake-like. I wanted to look more sultry after all.”</p>
<p>Worrying about appearance was very human-like too.</p>
<p>“Well, this is nothing compared to the problem of Avaritia arriving. A complication could be that he feels your presence and leaves the area. I would run away instead of fighting too, honestly.”</p>
<p>If they fought head on, level 700 was far too low to stand against Shin and his party. Luxuria had also seen Shin’s anti-devil equipment, so she was even more wary.</p>
<p>“A devil, run away?”</p>
<p>“Even if we can resurrect, it’s not like we don’t have a sense of danger, you know? When we first met, you were really scary. I’d like you to know how nervous I was then.”</p>
<p>“Really now.”</p>
<p>“Honest. Well, Wrath would fight all the same though. As far as I can remember, they cared more for fighting than surviving.”</p>
<p>There were clearly differences between each devil, but their basic characteristics hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>Among the devils that proactively interacted with people, Wrath and Greed were the most belligerent. The difference between them was that Wrath only dealt with people, while Greed attacked monsters too.</p>
<p>“In any case, we have to gather intel first. The headmistress and the others are moving too, but we haven’t found anything important yet. Anyone who was behind the dungeon incident isn’t around anymore too, I suppose. I’m counting on you two.”</p>
<p>“We’ll do what we can. Defeating Greed is important for us too after all.”</p>
<p>Shin and Luxuria then smiled at each other. She hoped for the town and its people’s safety, while he thought of weapons and obtaining items. Normally, someone would point out that their goals were completely different, but Schnee just shrugged as she looked at the two.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 3 – Part 4</p>
<p>“What did you think of what Luxuria said?”</p>
<p>Shin asked Schnee as they were walking back to the hotel.</p>
<p>“Would you too like to do it? All three together?”</p>
<p>“Not that!!”</p>
<p>Not expecting for that topic to come back again, Shin inadvertently raised his voice. Luxuria was a beauty that was not inferior to Schnee, even if it only looks. Shin would certainly have been interested in her before his relationship with Schnee had advanced to where it was today.</p>
<p>However, things were different now. With Schnee at his side, he would never lay hands on other women, let alone a devil. There was also the fact that Schnee would become quite scary if he ever did.</p>
<p>“I’m just joking. Personally, I don’t think she was lying. Knowing her real identity, we can’t help being suspicious, but she didn’t say anything strange. I thought that she might plan to absorb Avaritia after we weakened it, but if she did she would become not only our, but also Erkunt’s enemy. It wouldn’t make sense for her.”</p>
<p>With Shin’s party and all of Erkunt as enemy, no amount of absorbed energy or increased level cap would be enough.</p>
<p>“As she said, we have to gather info first. Right now, we just know that someone with a 『Piece of Avarice』 infiltrated the institute.”</p>
<p>It could be a teacher, a student, or simply someone who sneaked past the security guards and into the dungeon. It was still a complete mystery.</p>
<p>According to Luxuria, the man claiming to be one of Avaritia’s subordinates was a young man with short red hair and brown eyes, called Hexen.</p>
<p>Being a monster, Luxuria can’t use 【Analyze】. Because of this, they couldn’t know if Hexen was a real or false name.</p>
<p>“Even if with an item, he still managed to escape from Luxuria. He has to have about 600 AGI.”</p>
<p>“Could he be a former player?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible. If there are people that see this world as a continuation of the game, it’s not too weird that some might think of siding with the devils. But I’ve never heard of someone called Hexen before.”</p>
<p>There were tens of thousands of players, so only very few were well known. Shin remembered the names of famous players, or at least the players that interested him, but they would be less than 1% of the total. It wouldn’t be strange if Hexen was an advanced player Shin simply didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Let’s check the names of people when we are outside, I guess, though I don’t think it’ll help much.”</p>
<p>“We should also talk again with Hilamee. This Hexen might have waited for her to go away before making his visit.”</p>
<p>Hexen’s visit happened just when Hilamee was in the royal castle, apparently. While not among the most advanced players, Hilamee was still one of the strongest individuals in this world. Her equipment had come from Shin, so she would be stronger than someone else with similar stats. In a battle, she would be much more dangerous than the average person.</p>
<p>If Hexen really waited for Hilamee’s absence to visit Luxuria, there was the possibility that fighting was not his forte.</p>
<p>Some players preferred to focus on a single stat, like STR or AGI, so they could only show their true power in specific situations.</p>
<p>If Hexen had focused on AGI, mages that could compress space itself were a natural enemy. Hilamee could do just that, so he would have surely wanted to avoid her.</p>
<p>“…let’s keep that as one possibility. He might be a devil worshipper, who did not lay hands on Luxuria as she’s a devil herself.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t enough information to make a proper assessment: the only thing they could do now was to keep their eyes peeled.</p>
<p>“Oh? Isn’t that Bermann?”</p>
<p>A horse carriage was stopped in front of Shin and Schnee’s hotel. Bermann, whom Shin had given a screenshot to and asked to relay a message to Hilamee, was talking with a hotel clerk, but noticed Shin and started walking towards him.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m sorry to bother you when you’ve just arrived, but could you return to the institute?”</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“No, just that it would be best to talk about that in the institute grounds. Some also objected to have the headmistress come see you herself, as unwanted rumors would arise.”</p>
<p>Luxuria said that the headmistress would probably contact them the next day, but Hilamee was quicker.</p>
<p>Hilamee knew 【Hiding】, so she could have come to the hotel without being noticed. Though, as headmistress, there was a risk her movements would be tracked by foreign spies, thus causing trouble for Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>Some foreign agents were specialized in seeing past skills such as 【Hiding】, so there was the possibility that they could see past Hilamee’s too.</p>
<p>“If so, we’ll come with you.”</p>
<p>“I apologize. We don’t want to bother you either.”</p>
<p>Even if Shin and Schnee were extremely strong, having them take care of monsters too powerful for the institute to handle was not something they would really want to do, or so Bermann’s expression said.</p>
<p>Maybe because of their pride as security, the other guard that came with the carriage had the same expression. It was probably because of such character and personality that they were entrusted with guarding the dungeon. Shin and Schnee got on the carriage and returned to the institute.</p>
<p>According to Bermann, Hilamee had returned just minutes before he arrived to deliver the message. She had been busy welcoming students from a foreign country: Hilamee apparently had more work than Shin thought.</p>
<p>“Once this vacation period ends, the new term will start, after all. We had been making preparations to welcome the students from abroad when you arrived, sir Shin. Because of the strange accidents in the dungeon, however, we have our hands full with making sure our kingdom doesn’t get too involved in this situation.”</p>
<p>The institute bore the name of Erkunt, though it wasn’t officially affiliated with the kingdom of the same name. On the surface, they were on an equal footing, and the kingdom did not openly dictate the institute’s policies or principles to follow.</p>
<p>Among Erkunt’s elites, however, there were individuals who tried to exert their influence from the back if they could not do so from the front.</p>
<p>“The kingdom itself requested us to find out who these people are, but they must be of quite high standing, because any evidence is always carefully erased. We also cannot deny the existence of people within the institute that are trying to curry favor within the kingdom”</p>
<p>“There’s always all sorts of intents and goals within all organizations…”</p>
<p>It couldn’t be avoided in something as large as a kingdom or the institute. Those with strong ambitions or those trying to use their standing to gain favors never completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The kingdom’s elite surely possesses considerable authority and wealth. According to Bermann, at least half of them were upright people, which was already very positive.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for making you come all the way here.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t worry. I did ask to report about the Greed business, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee got off the carriage and entered the headmistress’ quarters, where Hilamee greeted them, bowing. She had probably heard from Bermann, as her expression was clouded as well.</p>
<p>“Is everything okay? I heard there’s some trouble with the kingdom too.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright, for now. You’ve defeated the monsters under Greed’s influence, so the fact that I am connected to you has helped. Luxuria is also considered personnel that I summoned here.”</p>
<p>“Putting Luxuria aside, how does knowing me help in any way?”</p>
<p>“You’re quite well known, actually. There are even traveling minstrels that sing of your feats in the Balmel defense battle. People also talk of your expedition in the dangerous sea areas near Barbatos, from which you returned without losing a single party member. Merpeople and fishpeople talk of your strength in the taverns.”</p>
<p>“…gah…”</p>
<p>Time had passed since the Balmel battle, so Shin thought that it would be forgotten by now. On the contrary, however, new topics of conversation had joined it and became known as far as Erkunt. The words merpeople and fishpeople hit too close to home.</p>
<p>“’Shin the Slashing Hammer’…you’re quite the hot topic, you know?”</p>
<p>“For real…? When I went to the guild to accept the battle training request, they didn’t pay much attention to me, though…”</p>
<p>“Did you have your weapon with you then?”</p>
<p>“No, I just visited the reception, so I didn’t bring anything.”</p>
<p>“That could be the reason. You’re pretty famous for wielding a sword that looks like a dull weapon. We’re pretty far from Barbatos here, so the people that don’t know you well probably didn’t think that you were the same Shin.”</p>
<p>『Kakura』 was starting to be Shin’s signature weapon. He had used it in Erkunt too, but only inside the institute, so probably rumors of it hadn’t reached the guild. Thinking about it, recently there were more and more students, other than Lecus’ party, joining his training sessions. Some of them looked at Shin with quite ardent gazes sometimes.</p>
<p>“Could it be that there are rumors spreading about me teaching here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Many doubted it at first, but lately the students are prioritizing your training over guild requests. We’re lucky that there are few people around because of the vacation period, or things would have become hectic.”</p>
<p>“Even you say battle feats…there’s only the Balmel thing, right? Was it really that special?”</p>
<p>So Shin asked Hilamee, thinking that there had to be other famous adventurers. He felt that she was exaggerating a bit too much.</p>
<p>“Guilds share information about the phenomenon of monster ‘floods’ from Sacred Lands. Furthermore, the event you played a large part in was classified as ‘Grand Flood’, which is many times larger than regular ones. It has never happened in recorded history for such an event to pass without casualties. When information was first made public, there were a lot of theories thrown around about who this adventurer called Shin could be.”</p>
<p>Incidentally, the feats accomplished by adventurers such as Shadow and Hibineko were mostly expected: unlike Shin’s, their names had come under the spotlight several times, so people were not surprised by their actions anymore.</p>
<p>The same was for Schnee: her feats were regarded as natural for someone of her fame.</p>
<p>“Ah…I see. A newcomer appearing all of a sudden, that’s how they see it?”</p>
<p>“Your adventurer rank was very low at the time too. A mysterious powerful warrior appeared in Balmel, that’s what everyone said. Because of the distance, official guild information is all we could get too. There’s no internet or anything in this world, after all.”</p>
<p>“So even if things are getting quieter where the information came from, in far away places it’s still the talk of the town, then? Good thing I didn’t take out 『Kakura』 outside…”</p>
<p>『Kakura』 was a weapon that stood out easily even if it was just carried. Shin would have definitely been noticed if he simply equipped it in public.</p>
<p>“If so, isn’t it a problem to give special treatment to Lecus and the others?”</p>
<p>“No, they did ask for it after all. We couldn’t train them enough until now, so this one time please let them use their strength to their heart’s content.”</p>
<p>Very few in the institute could train the 3 prodigies at full power: only Hilamee, Masakado and few others. Chosen Ones did enroll in the institute, but not many chose to remain as instructors. Even if they did, they only taught their own disciples.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you hire retired adventurers?”</p>
<p>“If they’re really skilled, countries or guilds get to them first. Even if they wish to train successors, it’s more efficient to take in disciples. Very few people would just teach their skills to anyone.”</p>
<p>For adventurers, the fighting style they had honed was an asset: they wouldn’t just give it to anyone.</p>
<p>“No one knows what the institute’s students will do after getting their training, after all.”</p>
<p>Some would become adventurers, while others enrolled into armies. There was also the possibility of them changing aspirations and aim to become researchers. The institute simply imparted its knowledge, it was up to each individual to decide if they would use it on the field or accumulate it.</p>
<p>“I’ve contacted former players too, but they always refuse without even considering it. I suppose it isn’t a very appealing position.”</p>
<p>The more she talked, the more Hilamee became depressed. There were former players who had formed guilds to help new players in the game era, so she had contacted them.</p>
<p>Very few former players outed themselves as such, however; Shin too could not tell if he did not know them already. Because of that, Hilamee had not managed to contact many.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, as long as they didn’t plan to from the beginning, not many people would think of becoming teachers in this world…if they had battle-related jobs, they’d become adventurers or military, if they had creation-related ones they’d open their own shop or workshop…”</p>
<p>If circumstances were different, Shin would have probably thought the same thing. He wouldn’t have considered becoming a teacher either.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many schools like this either, which might play a part too.”</p>
<p>“It takes a lot of money to further one’s studies, so students necessarily come from rich families. I have seen several institutions like that.”</p>
<p>Schnee added her own comments to Shin’s words. The institute needed financial resources to run. The Erkunt institute gathered finances by conducting its own research and technology development, keeping school fees low enough for not so affluent students to be able to frequent as well. It wasn’t something other schools could do easily, however.</p>
<p>Education was not compulsory in this world: very few aimed to be teachers, and even if they did they weren’t guaranteed to be able to. There was no ‘soil’ for the people Hilamee sought to grow.</p>
<p>“How about hiring graduated students? If they were taught here, they’d know already how things go, to an extent….from your reaction, I suppose that didn’t go well either?”</p>
<p>“Exactly…many come from outside Erkunt, so they mostly go back to their homelands. Others continue to pursue their fields of research, or use the skills they learned to become artisans. Very few choose to become teachers…it shouldn’t be a bad career, though.”</p>
<p>After releasing a deep sigh, Hilamee suddenly slapped her own cheeks. With the sharp clapping sound, light returned to her eyes.</p>
<p>“Anyway! I’m sorry, we’ve gone off topic enough. Let’s get on to the main topic.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Your cheeks are pretty red.”</p>
<p>“I went a little too hard…”</p>
<p>Hilamee massaged her cheeks while using 【Heal】 on herself. Her cheeks remained red, maybe out of embarrassment. Shin didn’t question her further.</p>
<p>“So, about the Greed affair. You’ve met Luxuria, so I suppose you already heard about it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we met her on our way back and heard about it. It looks like Greed, or Avaritia, tried to absorb Luxuria.”</p>
<p>Hilamee had already heard of Avaritia’s attempt: Shin made sure there were no discrepancies between what they knew, then said that, if possible, he wanted to take down the greed devil.</p>
<p>“It would be a great help for us, but…it’s kind of pathetic to rely on you so much.”</p>
<p>Hilamee looked very apologetic, her eyes lowered, so Shin interjected, a bit awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Well, actually, we have our own reasons for targeting Avaritia, not only helping you or Luxuria.”</p>
<p>“What would those reasons be…..?”</p>
<p>“Among the unique items Avaritia drops, there’s one that lowers skill costs on accessories. That’s what I’m aiming at.”</p>
<p>“There was an item like that…? I’m sure you could make incredible accessories even without it, though.”</p>
<p>“What I want to forge with it is a wedding ring, attach it with the best skills possible.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered that he hadn’t told her yet, so he announced to Hilamee that he had married Schnee. Luxuria had mentioned them loving each other and seeking each other, so Hilamee too probably knew already, but he mentioned it just in case.</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s your reason…wait, a wedding ring???”</p>
<p>“Well, things happened, so we didn’t have time to make one…”</p>
<p>“You’re way, way, way too casual about this!! That just won’t do!! You need that before proposing, don’t you know!?!”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t think it was absolutely necessary, but even if he told the excited Hilamee to calm down, she probably wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“We absolutely must defeat it, then!! A happy marriage is much more important than a devil’s life!”</p>
<p>Hilamee was brimming with enthusiasm, clenching her fists. It was good for her to have perked up, but Shin had no idea why she was that eager.</p>
<p>He looked at Schnee, wondering if she was perplexed too, but she was eagerly nodding at Hilamee’s words, not perplexed in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Don’t push yourself too hard, okay…?”</p>
<p>“No problem. For the sake of a happy marriage, we must accept any sacrifice that may occur…”</p>
<p>“Is that really not a problem…?”</p>
<p>It was a topic that probably resonated loudly within Hilamee: her eyes gleamed in a way Shin found almost scary. If this was a manga, they would be definitely glowing darkly.</p>
<p>“By the way, who did the proposal?”</p>
<p>“I asked her to marry me.”</p>
<p>The situation wasn’t romantic at all, which was Shin’s sole regret.</p>
<p>“Right!! The man should be the one confessing, right!!”</p>
<p>“Is there someone you want to confess to you?”</p>
<p>Shin could only think of Masakado, who was in the same party as Hilamee in the game.</p>
<p>“I’m doing my best to give him hints…I think he noticed, but still, there’s no progress…”</p>
<p>Hilamee sighed again, her shoulders dropping. Schnee put a hand on her shoulder and nodded once more, as if saying that she understood that frustration all too well.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t feel more uneasy.</p>
<p>“What kind of hints did you send?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see…”</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s love troubles suddenly took over the conversation. The words “fickle” and “can’t make a proper decision” popped up from time to time. Thinking that Schnee might have felt the same way, Shin received damage, even though they weren’t talking about him. He imagined their words as knives, stabbing him repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Er, could we start talking about what countermeasures to take…?”</p>
<p>Shin made a timid proposal, worried to let things proceed like that. The two ladies returned to their senses, coughed loudly and looked at him.</p>
<p>“…let us resume this conversation another time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>They looked like they still had things to talk about, but the topic was shifted back to the main reason Shin and Schnee were there.</p>
<p>“For starters, I’m thinking of going outside of the castle walls with Schnee, using Lecus’ party’s training as an excuse. Should we put anti-monster traps in the dungeon? We can make sure only monsters coming out of it are attacked.”</p>
<p>“I would love that, but it might be difficult if you set items only you can use. If they ever malfunction, no one could fix them. Besides, I cannot authorize something like that by myself. We would need to obtain permission from the institute’s directors.”</p>
<p>Even the headmistress could not act as she pleased. The Erkunt institute had several other directors, whose approval was needed for most if not all major decisions.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they would approve quickly if I told them about your actual identity, though.”</p>
<p>“Anything but that.”</p>
<p>“Right? So we should tell them that ‘Shin the Slashing Hammer’ is on our side and…”</p>
<p>“Whaaat!? Are you serious!?”</p>
<p>Surprised by the unexpected development, Shin immediately stopped Hilamee’s train of thought. Rumors about his fighting prowess were spreading, but not about his skills with item crafting.</p>
<p>“What you have is a Legend grade weapon. If we introduce you as someone also knowledgeable in the field of magic items, things will work out.”</p>
<p>“Well, that could be true, but…”</p>
<p>Feeling that the rumors might power up even more, Shin felt conflicted. Because of the diffusion of the “Slashing Hammer” nickname, the tales of his participation in the Balmel battles were spreading even more. Such rumors hadn’t reached Erkunt yet, but were very well known in Balmel.</p>
<p>Information warped as it spread, however: especially it traveled through average people, it transformed in incredible ways. At Balmel many had witnessed Shin fighting, but even so erroneous informations and rumors were spreading. He was afraid to know what things had reached Erkunt, which was quite far from Balmel.</p>
<p>If they knew who he really was, they would know how wrong the rumors were, but except his party members very few people knew that in Erkunt.</p>
<p>“If things are like this, I might as well say that I was a disciple of Kain or Hecate…no, that would only make things worse, wouldn’t it…”</p>
<p>They could say that his companion Schnee – Yuki was skilled in crafting magic items, but Shin thought that rather than doing that, it would be better for him to step forward.</p>
<p>“There’s no helping it…let’s do what you said. I’m here now, but won’t be in the future. If you’re worried about the traps malfunctioning, we’ll just use them while I’m here.”</p>
<p>The reason why the rare monster Mob Ant Queen had become a cohort of Greed was unknown.</p>
<p>There was a high chance of someone having brought a 『Piece of Avarice』 in the dungeon, but there could be other methods. In such a case, there was no harm in being cautious.</p>
<p>If the traps were used while Shin was present, he could fix them in case of any malfunctions.</p>
<p>“Understood, I will use this approach then.”</p>
<p>After discussing other minor details, Shin and Schnee left the institute. Because of having gone back and forth twice from the institute to the hotel, the sun was already beginning to set.</p>
<p>“It took more time than expected, huh. At least she offered us lunch, though.”</p>
<p>After the dungeon’s exploration and the conversation with Luxuria it was already past noon: Shin and Schnee had returned to the institute to talk with Hilamee afterwards.</p>
<p>There was still some time before sunset, but not enough to think about going somewhere.</p>
<p>“Shall we stay at the hotel tonight?”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s. Can I go do some shopping?”</p>
<p>“Sure, I’ll come with you.”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t say what she wanted to buy, but Shin figured that it was probably groceries. When Shin and Schnee went shopping together, people sometimes addressed them as if they were a young married couple. Schnee herself enjoyed very much being addressed as his wife, as she said to Shin, blushing…obviously making him blush too.</p>
<p>“Come again!”</p>
<p>Shin remembered this episode, trying hard not to grin, when he heard the shop owner say goodbye to Schnee. They were negotiating about something, but judging from their smiles, it looked like the transaction had gone well. Though she was just buying vegetables.</p>
<p>“I’ll carry the bags.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very…”</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t finish her sentence, so Shin wondered what had happened. After a brief silence, she whispered “thanks”.</p>
<p>“You see! I usually speak in a kind of formal tone, but since we’re hus, husband and wife now…well, I thought I should be less formal, so…”</p>
<p>Schnee started explaining herself quickly, but her voice gradually grew fainter, inversely proportional to her ears getting redder. Ever since they arrived in Erkunt, Schnee was much more expressive. Looking at her thinking too much and getting flustered always made Shin laugh.</p>
<p>“T-there’s nothing funny about this!”</p>
<p>“Well, looking at you talking like that, all red and all, is just too funny, haha.”</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<p>Realizing how flustered she looked, Schnee blushed even more violently.</p>
<p>“That’s good, though. It doesn’t feel right to be the only one talking casually.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, well, from now on, I’ll do my best…only when we’re alone.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can do it any other time too.”</p>
<p>“It’s too embarrassing!!”</p>
<p>Schnee had used a formal tone for more than 500 years: even if she was told to speak less formally, it had become a habit of hers.</p>
<p>Shin told her again that she could change little by little, as they headed towards the hotel. They had just finished shopping, so they attracted attention like before. Shin walked while lightly pushing Schnee forward. He was carrying the grocery bags, obviously.</p>
<p>When they arrived, he put the groceries in the item box. It was still early for dinner, so they sat on the sofa to rest a bit.</p>
<p>“It feels more tiring to just go shopping, somehow…”</p>
<p>“Maybe because people are looking? I heard from Vulcan that you’re quite the celebrity too around here.”</p>
<p>At first she was talked about as “the elf with the man that looks like the Slashing Hammer”, apparently. The students trained by them and the clerks assisting her shopping, however, started spreading rumors about her strength, personality, beauty etc.</p>
<p>The fact that she visited the workshop district with Shin helped spread the rumors too: it was an area mostly visited by men, so the chance of seeing a beautiful elf there became well know quickly, according to Vulcan.</p>
<p>Vulcan was often holed up in his smithy, but Vaal often talked with clients too, many of which persistently asked him about Schnee.</p>
<p>“The same thing happened in Balmel too. I didn’t act with this disguise, but for some reason people started talking all the same.”</p>
<p>“Tiera’s more famous there, after all, the beautiful archer who swept monsters away with a single arrow…you were fighting alongside her, so you became famous together, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s sniping from the castle walls had been talked about quite a bit, because of its high power too.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee produced more impressive battle results, but because of the appearance of the mysterious “Red” too, they were treated as skilled adventurers and not much more.</p>
<p>“They asked me a lot of questions too. Which one I liked, if it was both, all stuff like that though.”</p>
<p>At the time, Shin’s party was only 3 members, excluding Yuzuha and Kagerou. Being one man with two women, the conversation would often naturally shift in that direction.</p>
<p>“I was asked the same things too, but mostly by women.”</p>
<p>Men often asked Shin how he had hooked up with them, if they had a physical relationship and other ‘material’ questions, but women inquired more about romance, also asking how their party had been formed and what relationship Schnee had with the only man, Shin. Elves rarely formed parties with members of the opposite gender, which spurred even more questions.</p>
<p>When they explained that the party was formed because Tiera had been rescued by Shin, many women reacted with a shriek Schnee didn’t quite understand: “Oh lord!! He’s just like a prince on a white horse!!”</p>
<p>“I understand that you might give that impression, as you freed her from a curse that lasted over a century…but I too waited for you for 500 years, so I don’t really like the fact that Tiera might be your partner…and well, at the time I was hiding my identity as Schnee Raizar, so I understand that people might focus on Tiera, but—”</p>
<p>Schnee started talking quicker and quicker, clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>“H-hey! Schnee! Why are you heating up like that?”</p>
<p>“Why, you ask!? Some people even told me that I should confess already, or that you surely liked Tiera better!!”</p>
<p>Schnee, remembering things she was told at the time, pouted. Looking at her almost childish gestures, Shin smiled. After calming her down, he changed posture and put her head on his lap.</p>
<p>“No need to pout like that. We’re together now, aren’t we.”</p>
<p>“I know that…but imagining you with someone else gives me chills…”</p>
<p>Elves were normally monogamous. Schnee shared this belief too, so she never enjoyed seeing high-ranked adventurers or nobles with multiple partners. She understood that strong people were surrounded by people interested in them and did not criticize them, but would not want the person she liked to do the same. In simple words, she wanted the complete monopoly.</p>
<p>“Easy, easy.”</p>
<p>“Hn…”</p>
<p>Shin caressed her head, to which she whimpered happily. Schnee’s ears flickered, as to show her good mood. Without saying anything else, Shin just continued caressing her.</p>
<p>Schnee’s hair, illuminated by the lights, were very pleasant to the touch. Shin had started caressing her head to calm her down, but he had lost the timing to stop and simply continued.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>After a while, Shin noticed that Schnee’s reactions were odd, or rather, she didn’t react at all. He peered closer at her face to see why and noticed that her eyes were closed and she was breathing softly, asleep.</p>
<p>“Well well…”</p>
<p>She was simply defenseless. Without the flimsiest barrier or weapon, just laying there on the sofa, she was completely relaxed. Schnee would never let her guard down like this normally: she allowed herself to do so because Shin was with her.</p>
<p>He tried poking her cheeks to see if she was just pretending to sleep, but she just grunted a little: she was really asleep.</p>
<p>“Well, usually the positions would be reversed…but this feels good too.”</p>
<p>Shin talked to himself, thinking that it was usually the man sleeping with his head on the woman’s lap, but the reverse was nice too.</p>
<p>Schnee’s defenseless figure, proof of her trust towards Shin. Looking at her peaceful sleeping face made him feel happy.</p>
<p>“Guess I should cover her.”</p>
<p>The room was warm, so there was no risk of catching a cold, but Shin opted to put his mantle over her as blanket, leaving aside the question whether they could even catch a cold with their stats.</p>
<p>There was still some time left till dinner time, so Shin decided to use it to leisurely enjoy Schnee’s sleeping face.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 3 – Part 5</p>
<p>“Hey, come on, don’t be angry…”</p>
<p>“I am not angry in any shape or form.”</p>
<p>“Then why won’t you look at me?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m embarrassed!!”</p>
<p>Schnee was asleep for about 30 minutes. The fact that she had fallen asleep and that Shin had looked at her sleeping face prompted her to verbally attack him, blushing even more, about why he didn’t wake her up.</p>
<p>Schnee went to the kitchen to prepare dinner: as time passed after she had woken up, she calmed down a little.</p>
<p>“Your face wasn’t weird at all, don’t worry! …..I did take a screenshot though.”</p>
<p>“Shin? What did you just say?”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t let Shin’s mumbles go unpunished. She was facing away from him, but in the blink of an eye she had grabbed his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, you were really cute, so…my hand slipped…”</p>
<p>“Your hand what!? Don’t take photos of me sleeping without permission!!”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to get so angry…do I have to delete it?”</p>
<p>“Of course!!”</p>
<p>Schnee had started showing Shin more of her defenseless sides, but photos were still prohibited, apparently.</p>
<p>“But you show me sides like that sometimes, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t stay that way, and I show them because I trust you. Anyone could see the photos, so I can’t let them remain…and besides…”</p>
<p>“Besides?”</p>
<p>Schnee paused, so Shin encouraged her to continue.</p>
<p>“I want to look pretty before the person I love. Photos can be looked at many times…so I believe that even more.”</p>
<p>As Shin seemed to fail to grasp how a maiden’s heart worked, Schnee made him sit down properly before starting to preach again.</p>
<p>“I just don’t get it.”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing!!!”</p>
<p>In the end, they had dinner later than usual that night.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>The next day, Shin headed outside the castle walls, with Lecus, Myu, and Gian in tow. Other students had joined Shin’s training sessions, but — unlike the three with him now — they were average, so he didn’t bring them with him this time. He was planning to have them fight monsters which didn’t normally appear in the area after all.</p>
<p>“Awright, it’s time to release the frustration piled up in the training dungeon!!”</p>
<p>“You’re getting too excited again. If we die outside, it’s over, got it?”</p>
<p>“I already promised Mr. Shin that I won’t do anything reckless! And I know that, thank you very much. I’m just getting focused!”</p>
<p>“Sure you are.”</p>
<p>“Easy there, you two. Myu, don’t make us worry, okay? Gian doesn’t talk like this to people he doesn’t care about, after all. Having high morale isn’t a bad thing, so let’s be careful on our end. Myu is different from before, after all.”</p>
<p>“Got it!”</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>Myu was 100% eager while Gian looked at her, grumbling. Lecus calmed their bickering and tried to make them focus in the same direction. The three were also balanced mentally.</p>
<p>“You’ve hunted outside the castle walls before, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think we’ve fought with all the monsters that normally appear around Erkunt.”</p>
<p>Like all other students, Lecus’ party had also experienced fighting outside the institute. The monsters’ level were not very high, however, so the training dungeon was more effective for practice: they hadn’t ventured outside too often.</p>
<p>“The wolf boss was pretty strong!”</p>
<p>“There was a Forest Wolf pack, with a stronger one among them. I think it was level 150 or 160.”</p>
<p>Lecus added an explanation to Myu’s vague comment. He continued saying that they found another group of students being attacked and helped them: Gian took down the boss of the pack and chased the monsters away.</p>
<p>Their strategy consisted of Myu going wild to attract the monsters’ attention, Lecus casting 【Hiding】 on Gian and ambushing the monsters. After crushing their legs to prevent them from escaping, Lecus finished them with magic. If the spells weren’t enough, Gian would deliver the final blow.</p>
<p>“If the monsters weren’t focused on the group that was fighting them before us, it wouldn’t have gone so well, though.”</p>
<p>Lecus said that they had chased away the monsters, so even if they took down the boss they couldn’t do the same with the rest if the pack. They could have chased them down, but prioritized tending to the wounded.</p>
<p>“I think you made a good decision. The people that were fighting before you were in a pinch, right? If you pushed yourselves to chase the monsters and suffered a counterattack, your assistance would have meant nothing.”</p>
<p>Some might protest that it would have been better to chase the monsters and finish them off, to prevent other people from being attacked. Forest Wolves, however, normally appeared around Erkunt: there were likely to be other packs too, so it wasn’t so important to finish them off then and there.</p>
<p>“I doubt we’ll see Forest Wolves this time. According to guild research, the monsters spawning around here changed a lot: Mystic Wolves, and the powerful versions of Orcs and Goblins. It’s not 100% confirmed, but Baghnakh-like monsters have been witnessed too. Stay on your toes, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yessir!!”</p>
<p>Myu answered with energy, while the two boys simply nodded. Maybe not as much as her, but they were focused and eager too.</p>
<p>“What kind of monster is that Baghnakh, by the way? We have looked it up, but didn’t find much.”</p>
<p>“To put it simply, it’s like a huge mouth, about two mel tall. Imagine the head of a wolf-type monster, without ears and with a massive amount of fangs.”</p>
<p>Baghnakhs were monsters quite similar to the weapon with the same name. Their level ranged between 150 and 200, about the limit that an average person could handle. Their fangs inflicted poison and paralysis: as they bit down on their prey, the victim would taste the fear of being slowly crushed to death as their HP slowly decreased.</p>
<p>That also happened if the victim was equipped with armor to resist the bites however. Baghnakhs did not have much attack power, compared to their high HP and defense, but their biting attacks had level 200+ offensive power, which would crush to bits any armor grade Rare and lower.</p>
<p>At the same level, only defense-oriented jobs could resist their bites. It just meant that they didn’t die on the spot, however: being caught usually left no way out.</p>
<p>“That’s…pretty dangerous.”</p>
<p>“It depends on the person, but even Chosen Ones get eaten by them.”</p>
<p>Shin used a word he knew Lecus and the others would know. Even Gian, who had the highest defense of the three, had a 50/50 chance of surviving a Baghnakh bite. Myu and Lecus would have probably resisted only a few seconds.</p>
<p>“It’s not confirmed that we’ll find any, but the possibility is there. Some of them are difficult to detect even using skills, so never let your guard down.”</p>
<p>Even the easily excited Myu nodded seriously now. They weren’t in the area inhabited by monsters yet, but there might be dangers hiding everywhere.</p>
<p>Outside Shin and Schnee, Myu had the highest detection skills. There was the chance of finding monsters that, if Myu didn’t detect, would leave Gian and Lecus incapable of reacting in time. Shin’s warning probably made her realize it.</p>
<p>“Okay, Myu, you’re in front. We will only assist you if there’s danger. Even though we’re here to help you, don’t treat this lightly, got it?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>The three students answered in unison, then advanced, with Myu leading them. Gian was behind her, with Lecus in third position.</p>
<p>After a while, they started seeing trees along the road. To save time, Shin’s group picked a path that cut through a patch of woods. It was shorter, but presented a higher risk of being attacked by monsters or bandits than the more roundabout path.</p>
<p>Both for people and monsters, the woods were an ally that helped them conceal their presence. According to the information Shin gathered, the path they were walking on was the area with the highest number of reported casualties. Bandits were routinely wiped out by Erkunt’s military and vigilantes, so they rarely caused any real damage.</p>
<p>Shin reviewed this information mentally while walking, when a presence in the woods started moving towards the path.</p>
<p>“Something’s coming!”</p>
<p>When the presence was about 20 mel from their position, Myu spoke up. She had spotted the same presence Shin had noticed and stared to their right.</p>
<p>“It’s just one unit, but it seems pretty big.”</p>
<p>Myu continued focusing on the approaching presence, trying to obtain as much information as possible before the fighting began. A player would be likely to use 【Clairvoyance】 or similar skills to see the monster’s appearance immediately; for Myu and the others, however, acquiring skills was not an easy feat.</p>
<p>Looking at the three students drawing their weapons, Shin pondered whether to teach them skills or not.</p>
<p>(I know that skills can be taught in the same way as the game. But this is different from the time with Tiera…)</p>
<p>Using 『Secret Book』 was easy, but would create all sorts of problems. In this world skills were extremely precious. Shin wanted to spread them, as means of fighting against monsters, but skills could be used against other people too.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of the continent of Eltnia, conflicts and battles had broken out time and again. Shin had learned of them when he looked up the Dusk of Majesty in Bayreuth and Falnido.</p>
<p>He couldn’t know when, where, and how the skills he taught would be used, so he finally concluded that just teaching them on a whim could have ultimately worked against Lecus and the others.</p>
<p>“It’s coming out!!”</p>
<p>While Shin was lost in thought, the monster had almost reached them. It rushed through the woods. A rustling sound could be heard from the bushes. A few moments after Myu’s warning, a shadow jumped out of the shrubs, as if leaping over Shin’s group.</p>
<p>“Defend!!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted to Myu and the others, who stared at the flying shadow without moving. The shadow had launched an attack towards them from the air.</p>
<p>The students reacted to Shin’s order: he had told them that against monsters defense was the first thing to focus on, as he put them through the wringer during training. Thanks to that, Myu and Gian parried the monsters’ attack with their weapons and Lecus used the spell he was chanting to deflect it.</p>
<p>“It’s a Greygunn.”</p>
<p>Shin caught the projectile shot towards him and looked at it: it was a pointy scale. Myu and the others looked at the shadow, which had landed on the ground. It was a lion-like monster covered in lead-colored scales.</p>
<p>Its level was 248, a bit higher than Greygunns’ usual range. The size was approximately three mel long. Even with all four of its legs on the ground, its eyes were on the same level as Myu and the others.</p>
<p>Even though it looked like it was wearing armor, its movements were very quick and agile, its scales providing high defense. The large hooked claws on its front paws had very high attack power; while it didn’t use magic, shooting its scales allowed the Greygunn to launch long-range attacks.</p>
<p>Some mutated species had elemental scales, which could be recognized by their color. The Greygunn facing against Shin’s party had colorless scales, signaling the lack of elemental attributes.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen this monster before.”</p>
<p>“This guy is tough.”</p>
<p>Myu and Gian, their weapons pointed at the Greygunn, growling and ready to pounce, tried to find the ideal distance to attack. They knew that it could shoot long-range attacks, so they didn’t go too close without a plan.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, could you let us handle this?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that it was a bit too difficult for their first opponent, but Lecus asked him to leave it to them.</p>
<p>“….go ahead and try.”</p>
<p>In the future, they would probably have to fight opponents they had never seen before. Thinking that he could help them if something went wrong this time, Shin decided to let them fight on their own. Just in case, he prepared a defense skill that he could activate at any time.</p>
<p>“I’ll limit its movements with magic, so you two find an opening and strike. Attract its attention while I chant.”</p>
<p>“Got it!”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Lecus gave instructions to Gian and Myu, then gathered magic power. The Greygunn noticed that Lecus was trying to do something, so it looked in his direction. Before it could attack, however, Gian stood in its way.</p>
<p>“I’m here too!!”</p>
<p>Gian stepped to the Greygunn’s right side, while Myu struck her gauntlets together to attract its attention. Just as the monster looked in her direction, Gian struck his shield with his lance, causing a loud metallic sound to resonate in the surroundings.</p>
<p>Causing the monster’s attention to shift just before it attacked, they disrupted its timing and forced it to be wary of both of them, blocking the monster from focusing on attacking a single enemy. In the game it wouldn’t be very useful, but in the real world it was an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Myu and her party were putting in practice one of the tactics that Shin had taught them.</p>
<p>“Here I go!!”</p>

<p>The Greygunn was still undecided because of the sounds and fighting aura released by Myu and Gian, when lightning shot from behind Gian. Six bolts flew over Gian and struck, leaving the monster no time to react.</p>
<p>The bolts struck the monster’s scales: its body shook and its movements slowed down. Lecus had prioritized the number of bolts, as they did not cause much damage. The monster growled, walked a few steps and glared at Lecus, still behind Gian.</p>
<p>Its rage-filled stare focused on Lecus: the monster’s sight now probably only included the spear-wielding Gian and the wand-armed Lecus, an opening that Myu didn’t miss. She did not raise her voice or make a sound as she slid towards the Greygunn.</p>
<p>Despite her quiet approach, the Greygunn probably perceived something: it tried jumping away, but Myu’s fists struck quicker than it could move away.</p>
<p>“Haaa!!!”</p>
<p>From a crouching position, Myu’s straight burst together with her aura. Her fist struck squarely against the monster’s belly, with a blaze of flames.</p>
<p>Flame/Barehanded combination skill 【Crimson Lotus Straight】.</p>
<p>Its highest quality was destroying shell or armor via a fiery explosion.</p>
<p>Some monsters were protected by thick shells, scales or even armor: one way of fighting them was to use skills such as 【Crimson Lotus Straight】, which could damage armored parts.</p>
<p>The Greygunn they fought had no elemental affinities, so using a Flame elemental attack against the scales was not especially effective, but the flames were certainly had a more powerful effect on the body under its scales.</p>
<p>The explosion blew away part of the monster’s scales, allowing the flames to reach its body, which burned through the monster.</p>
<p>It was the status condition 【Burn】, caused by magical flame attacks. Greygunns had sturdy scales, but its naked body did not have especially high defense. It was the ideal chance to attack.</p>
<p>“Here’s one mo—whoops, that was close!”</p>
<p>Myu tried to strike the exposed part with a follow-up attack, but suddenly she rolled on the ground, putting distance between her and the Greygunn. The next moment, something flew through the space she had occupied moments before, hissing as it moved through the air.</p>
<p>“Oh, you noticed, I’m impressed.”</p>
<p>Since it was her first time fighting this monster, Myu was paying special attention to the surroundings. Shin nodded happily, glad to see that the training was paying off.</p>
<p>Myu had moved away because she noticed something coming from behind: the attack had come from the Greygunn’s tail, long and slender, with a large scale attached to its tip. The tail could bend and extend freely, allowing the monster to deliver powerful attacks from outside the opponent’s field of view.</p>
<p>Its vicious claws and fangs were easily visible, but avoiding its tail, which often attacked from blind spots, was quite a feat during the first battle against a Greygunn. Myu managed to do so thanks to her high detection skills and agility, but Gian and Lecus might have not been able to imitate her.</p>
<p>“It could have other attack methods too. Focus on its movements!”</p>
<p>Lecus cast a buff on Myu and Gian, then shouted a warning.</p>
<p>The Greygunn, after learning that Myu could break through its armor, moved away from her. Gian then ran towards the monster, followed slightly later by Myu. The Greygunn looked towards Gian, but Myu’s movements and Lecus’ chanting disrupted its attention.</p>
<p>It chose to focus on the opponents that he knew could hurt it.</p>
<p>“What, so you think I can’t do anything?”</p>
<p>Myu moved diagonally in front of the beast, which looked away from Gian: an opportunity that he didn’t let go by.</p>
<p>Thanks to the buff and the Movement-type skill 【Sliding】, Gian closed in on the Greygunn in a ready to attack stance: the skill allowed him to not change his stance as he neared the monster.</p>
<p>Depending on the user, it was possible to make it look like the attacker was not moving, something that the Greygunn was now experiencing.</p>
<p>When Gian’s spear struck the monster’s exposed neck, the creature emitted a growl as if shocked from being attacked out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“One more!”</p>
<p>The spear’s tip, still stabbed in the monster’s neck, glowed a deep purple, which then spread to the monster’s neck and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>The Greygunn jumped away, the spear fell out and blood started staining its scales, blood the same color as Gian’s weapon.</p>
<p>Water/Spear combination skill 【Venom Spear】.</p>
<p>The skill made it possible for the spear’s tip to transmit a strong poison, which inflicted another status ailment to the monster.</p>
<p>In this world, there were several types of poison: the one inflicted by 【Venom Spear】 affected magic power. Because of this, it was not very effective if the target had higher INT than the user.</p>
<p>The Greygunn’s stats, however, were mostly focused on physical aspects, so the poison did not just cause the monster damage.</p>
<p>“It’s moving slower!”</p>
<p>As Gian had struck the neck, near the heart, the poison acted quickly. The Greygunn could not react in time to avoid Myu’s next attack. She dodged the monster’s tail and struck the same spot as before.</p>
<p>“Haaahh!!!”</p>
<p>With a dull sound, the ground trembled. Myu’s strong step added even more power to her fists, causing the monster’s large body to be launched in the air, its scales scattered by the attack’s shockwaves.</p>
<p>“Don’t let up!”</p>
<p>“Gotcha!”</p>
<p>Myu wasn’t the only one to move: aiming at the moment the monster landed, Lecus shot more lightning bolts, followed by another attack by Gian.</p>
<p>The Greygunn, slowed down by the damage and poison, could not dodge the lightning. Bracing for impact, it focused on Gian. The spear’s tip was met by the scales on the monster’s forehead, the hardest it had. Since Gian had aimed between the scales, the monster figured that it couldn’t break through them: for a monster, it displayed considerable intelligence.</p>
<p>“You’re ready to receive my attack!? You got to be really confident in those scales!!”</p>
<p>Gian shouted. Powered by Lecus’ buff, the spear struck the scales and slightly stabbed them, but failed to pierce through. His movements stopped, but the attack did not.</p>
<p>“Take this!!”</p>
<p>Lightening sprang forth from the spear’s tip, burning the monster’s head. Thanks to the weapon breaking through the scales, the lightning ran through the monster’s body better than Lecus’ magic bolts. Because of the point of entry, the Greygunn’s whole body shook violently.</p>
<p>When the lightning stopped, the beast’s front right paw lost strength, causing it to collapse to the ground.</p>
<p>“You’re finish- Myu, stand back!!”</p>
<p>Gian was ready to deliver the final blow, but suddenly he jumped between the monster and Lecus, holding his shield high. Myu too quickly understood what he meant and put distance between her and the monster.</p>
<p>The Greygunn’s scales stood up: about the same time as Gian took a defensive stance, then they shot in all directions, like large throwing knives.</p>
<p>Gian blocked them with his shield, Myu with her gauntlets. Lecus, behind Gian, did not need to defend himself and continued chanting.</p>
<p>“Gian!”</p>
<p>Following Lecus’ call, Gian jumped aside. Lecus’ wand was already pointed at the monster.</p>
<p>“This is it!!”</p>
<p>A single bolt flew from the wand. A single, large bolt, very different from the 【Thunder Line】 bolts Lecus had shot at the beginning of the fight.</p>
<p>Lightning Magic Skill 【Thunderbolt】.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be used to shoot multiple bolts in different directions like 【Thunder Line】, but the damage it caused was much higher.</p>
<p>The Greygunn, unable to move, had no means of avoiding the thunderbolt: completely defenseless after shooting all its scales, it was struck directly. Without even a whimper, it collapsed completely, smoke rising from its body. Myu quickly approached it and struck it with a chop.</p>
<p>The sound of cracking bones echoed and the monster’s HP reached zero.</p>
<p>“Well done.”</p>
<p>Shin praised Myu, who had delivered the final blow. Monsters, like all animals, never gave up on trying to survive, until their last breath. Some tried to take their enemies with them, others feigned weakness to strike during an opening. It was thus important to keep attacking, even if the enemy stopped moving.</p>
<p>Shin too did not know at first, but one of the highest causes of death among adventurers was to hesitate before finishing off a monster, thus allowing them a chance to attack. To prevent this, he had often told the three students to never let up before the monster was clearly dead.</p>
<p>“Gian, Lecus, you did well too. You fought well, without letting it focus on a single target. I think you will be able to hold your own also against stronger foes.”</p>
<p>Attacking an opponent that couldn’t move could be stressful, so Shin actively praised them after the victory. They had actually shown good cooperation, so Shin thought that if it was three vs one, they could probably take one even a level 300 monster.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go. Monsters will keep attacking, they don’t care about our circumstances. We might have to fight consecutive battles, but never lose your focus.”</p>
<p>The three students answered Shin’s words with renewed energy. They weren’t exactly his disciples, but Shin was pleased by their growth.</p>
<p>“Considering the time limit, I guess we’re close.”</p>
<p>“To me, it felt a bit too long, even.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“You can’t consider this a job, can you Shin?”</p>
<p>“Well…you’re right.”</p>
<p>Twenty days had passed since Shin had accepted the training request: the institute’s holiday period would soon be over, which also meant that the training sessions with Lecus’ party would be over as well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 4 – Part 1</p>
<p>“Four more days…well no, excluding today, it’s only three.”</p>
<p>After the training, Shin whispered to himself while looking at the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>After the Greygunn encounter, the party fought against a pack of Mystic Wolves, then Shin decided to return to town. He would have liked to have the three students build some more experience in monster battles, but, maybe because the timing wasn’t right, they only found monsters that couldn’t even be considered training for Myu and the others.</p>
<p>“We managed to fight against a large group, so I think that as far as training is concerned, we have achieved good enough results.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you put it that way, I guess so.”</p>
<p>Saying they were coaching beginner players would be unfair to Lecus’ party; Shin, however, would have liked to coach them a bit more, even though their individual abilities and teamwork had improved.</p>
<p>Schnee’s words implied that he was getting too attached to them, as Shin understood too.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity, but it can’t be helped. I can’t keep training them while making countermeasures against Greed.”</p>
<p>Hilamee had said that part of planning countermeasures against the Greed devil involved collaborating with the country of Erkunt. In that case, Shin couldn’t continue training the students. Being Chosen Ones, there was the possibility of them ending up being involved.</p>
<p>If the country was in danger, they might be summoned as fighting power. It would be difficult if they were royals or nobles from other countries, but Lecus and the others did not have such social statuses.</p>
<p>“I want to try having them face an enemy that mainly uses magic attacks…some monsters use spells now and then, but wide-area-of-effect spells would be difficult to dodge. Then, mental attacks. It would be good if they could experience what it feels to be hit by one of those.”</p>
<p>Shin realized that wouldn’t be simple at all.</p>
<p>He and Schnee could let the students experience magic attacks, but mental ones were a whole different story. Skills affecting others’ mental state were prohibited by the country; even if Shin and Schnee were pretending to be Chosen Ones, on the surface, they couldn’t show themselves to be able to use such skills easily.</p>
<p>If the information spread, some would try to erase them, others to use them, others again to obtain those skills in secret: their lives would become just like an assassin’s.</p>
<p>“Then, the weapons. With those almost Rare grade ones, they can’t exert their full power.”</p>
<p>Myu and Gian had already damaged their weapons while fighting against monsters. If weapons and equipment were mismatched with the user’s abilities, they couldn’t use their powers to the fullest, as they probably already knew.</p>
<p>They were trying hard to find good quality equipment, but the monsters around Erkunt could not provide much in terms of finances, so their goal was still very far, as the students had confessed at the beginning of training.</p>
<p>Now the monsters’ spawns had changed and, with the appearance of high level monsters such as Graygunns, that problem would gradually be solved.</p>
<p>The students planned to request Vulcan’s workshop to forge their weapons, an idea that Shin supported wholeheartedly. He too planned to give them an “appropriate” accessory as a reward for completing the training. Since they had trained together, he thought it would be fine to do that much.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s Hilamee.”</p>
<p>Myu and the others were still sprawled on the ground, wheezing, when Shin spotted Hilamee coming towards them. There might have been developments in the matter with Greed.</p>
<p>Myu and the others were on the ground wheezing because, due to a lack of monsters, Shin and Schnee had sparred against them. They had been put through the wringer like never before, to the point that they barely managed to stand.</p>
<p>The other students who witnessed the sparring were relatively shocked, but Shin and Schnee didn’t mind.</p>
<p>“…er, are they alright?”</p>
<p>“Just some scratches. As long as they recover physically and mentally, they’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“I think I can imagine, but just what exactly did you do?”</p>
<p>“I just faced them head on with 『Kakura』 a bit. ”</p>
<p>“W-w-what did you say!?”</p>
<p>Hilamee howled after hearing Shin’s answer. Even a scratch from him could inflict massive damage: it was difficult to be happy that the party survived with just scratches, when a single scratch could mean a terrible injury.</p>
<p>“They might have lost limbs or worse!! It’s a huge problem!!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, I’m holding back, just enough so they’ll keep their limbs intact.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the problem!! What if you traumatized them!?!”</p>
<p>Being well aware of the difference in strength being Shin and Lecus’ party, Hilamee couldn’t keep quiet.</p>
<p>Shin was actually using 【Limiter】 to lower his stats, so the possibility of causing the students heavy damage “scratches” was low. Because of the weapon Shin wielded, the possibility was not zero, but they wouldn’t end up with mangled limbs.</p>
<p>“I was acting as a monster, after all. Half-baked training would hurt them in the long run, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Hnnggh, yes, that’s true, but…”</p>
<p>Monsters wouldn’t hold back against wounded opponents: it was important to experience this. The problem was that Shin’s power was far superior to the monsters around Erkunt, so even with 【Limiter】 active, Lecus’ party might have tasted the fear of death a bit too much.</p>
<p>As Hilamee said, if Shin went overboard he could traumatize them.</p>
<p>“Please be careful. Who knows what could happen, so really, really, be! Careful!!”</p>
<p>“O-okay, I got it…”</p>
<p>Shin backed away against Hilamee’s fierce look.</p>
<p>“By the way, you came all the way here for a reason, no?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, right. About your proposal of setting items at the dungeon entrance.”</p>
<p>In an extraordinary meeting, it was decided to authorize the items’ installation while Shin was there. There was no total consensus, however.</p>
<p>“ ‘If Luxuria is the source of all troubles, we could just exile her.’ ‘What will you do if that Shin is one of Avaritia’s followers?’ You have no idea how much I wanted to cast 【Fireball】 on them, then and there…if Shin was really an enemy, Erkunt would be a pile of rubble by now! Seriously!”</p>
<p>Just remembering the meeting was irritating enough to make Hilamee clench her fists.</p>
<p>Apparently, some upper brass elites screamed unfounded opinions, such as that it was Hilamee’s responsibility for hiring a devil, that there was no reason to trust Luxuria etc, so the meeting went on longer than expected.</p>
<p>Shin himself thought that some of those opinions were not completely wrong: if they exiled Luxuria, the enemy’s target -provided that she complied- would shift the enemy’s objective and help them buy time, so it wouldn’t be completely ineffective.</p>
<p>Shin’s innocence too would be difficult to prove to someone who didn’t know him.</p>
<p>Finally, believing a devil’s words was definitely a concern for anyone.</p>
<p>After appeasing such concerns, convincing and overturning the brass’ arguments, Hilamee looked rightfully exhausted.</p>
<p>“That must have been tough. Do you want some of Yuki’s handmade juice?”</p>
<p>“Yes please!”</p>
<p>Shin took out one of his favorite drinks from the item box, to help Hilamee recover.</p>
<p>The juice was made from fruits that did not exist in real life, with a balance of sweet and sour that was very pleasant to the tongue. Its effects included HP, MP and fatigue recovery, a genuine super drink. Shin always kept a large stock in his item box.</p>
<p>“Aaah, so delicious…”</p>
<p>“If you like it, I can share the recipe?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that would be wonderful!”</p>
<p>Hilamee seemed to enjoy it very much, so she took the recipe from Schnee with joy.</p>
<p>“So, when can I set the items? Can I go today?”</p>
<p>“About that, I’d like to ask you to do it tomorrow morning. I also thought to do it as soon as possible, but the staff in charge of the facility wants to be there too. They’re concerned, of course, because of their position.”</p>
<p>Because of their work, they would be available only the next morning. There was a training session scheduled, but the dungeon was a higher priority.</p>
<p>“Got it, so tomorrow morning we should go to the staff room?”</p>
<p>“No, we will come to pick you up. The time here is rather unclear, so it’s difficult to set up appointments.”</p>
<p>While watches existed, they were quite expensive. Since merchants and government officials were always in a rush, they often used them as well. The problem was that there was no internationally unified time system, like in Shin’s former world.</p>
<p>All watches in this world showed slightly different hours: merchants and other people adjusted them between themselves to show the same time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a completely unified time was shown by the menu former players and support characters could access. Shin had asked Shibaid and the others to confirm, but there wasn’t the slightest discrepancy, though it was unknown how it worked.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shi….n..please, us too…”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re back with us?”</p>
<p>A feeble voice made Shin turn around, and he saw Myu wobbling on her feet. Gian too was slowly standing up, while Lecus was still lying on the ground, panting. It was the difference in energy between front and back rows, probably.</p>
<p>“You’ve gotten quicker at recovering too.”</p>
<p>Stamina and recovery changed with level, but training could help boost both. Alongside with training, the students also worked out, which showed its effects. Especially Lecus, who had dropped out of the training halfway, had improved exponentially.</p>
<p>“Bwahah!!”</p>
<p>“Be quiet.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Shin’s juice, Myu recovered instantly and jumped up, full of energy. Gian glared at her: he had already drank the juice and stood up without glimpse of exhaustion.</p>
<p>“Whew, I live for a swig of this…”</p>
<p>“That’s not beer, though.”</p>
<p>Lecus sounded like he took his first sip of beer after work, so he was brought back to reality. Myu and Gian were more the physical type, so even if he was getting used to it, Lecus still couldn’t keep up with them.</p>
<p>“Well, if you’ve reached this point, I think we can say that this short-term training was worth doing. You’ve learned skills too, right?”</p>
<p>After fighting a number of monsters, Myu seemed particularly excited and Shin heard her say that.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I have—”</p>
<p>“No, no need to say it. Because of the training’s structure, I more or less know all the skills you have, so I can guess, but the sessions will end soon. I don’t need to hear that. We don’t know who’s listening…this place is more blessed than others, but skills are really really precious.”</p>
<p>It was pointless to know at that time; Shin had shown them many skills, but he warned them all the same. He knew what they trained in, so as he told Lecus he had a good idea about what skills they had learned: recovery for Lecus, offensive for Myu and Gian.</p>
<p>Many of Shin’s acquaintances knew skills, so it was easy to forget, but in this world skills were extremely rare. Even knowing just one was impressive. To learn skills just by training was nothing but boasting, from a normal person’s perspective.</p>
<p>Luckily, there weren’t other students or teachers around, so no one had heard their conversation.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of people with skills in this institute, but I heard that outside the Garden, people with skills are decreasing, so I was surprised when I first arrived…but I got used to it, I guess.”</p>
<p>“The Garden is the elves’ country, or rather, settlement, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Many people there have skills, like in Erkunt, but there are few places protected like these castle walls, so the atmosphere is more like a Pixie village. A barrier keeps the monsters out.”</p>
<p>“Is it okay for you to say that to me?”</p>
<p>“Anyone can learn this with some research.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know, but it seemed to be common knowledge.</p>
<p>He knew how the elves’ country was structured, but he hadn’t visited or even gotten close to it after coming to this world. He imagined that they built settlements on top of or inside trees.</p>
<p>“I come from a village near Kilmont! I remember that the people from my village can use skills normally too…”</p>
<p>“Hey, I just told you to stop talking about things like that so easily. Skills are really precious, never forget.”</p>
<p>Myu sealed her mouth with her hands. Her words were enough to reveal that her village was not an ordinary one.</p>
<p>There might be hidden villages with Chosen Ones or skill inheritors: it wouldn’t be too strange a concept, so Shin decided not to inquire further about the subject.</p>
<p>“One of my comrades too is a Dragnil with ties to the empire. I haven’t asked him much about the empire, now that I think about it…I guess I’ll do once he arrives.”</p>
<p>“The empire is a really nice place to live in, I really recommend it! The emperor, princes and princesses are all admirable people!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really now.”</p>
<p>Lecus added that since it was located close to a Sacred Place, the empire’s rule could not afford to be poor.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask him more details when he arrives.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person is he?”</p>
<p>“In one word, I’d say he’s a warrior. He has been fighting far longer than me, and he’s better at teaching too.”</p>
<p>Thanks to Schnee’s help, they managed to train the students even if they increased: if it was Shin alone, he would have had his hands full just with Lecus’ party.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, we never heard anything about your party, Mr. Shin. What other members are there?”</p>
<p>“A Lord, a Pixie and another Elf, plus our partner monsters.”</p>
<p>“You have Tamer abilities too!? I heard it was difficult to train them with a battle-type job.”</p>
<p>“Well, for me, just being able to make a contract is enough. I don’t have many Tamer skills, actually.”</p>
<p>Shin had often seen Cashmere use skills, so he knew them to an extent: there were quite peculiar and interesting ones, such as skills that increased in power as the monster’s affection increased or skills that let the monster possess the player to increase their stats.</p>
<p>Shin too trained them little by little, whenever he had time. He never focused too much on them, though, so they were growing at a relaxed pace.</p>
<p>“I used to think that me, Gian and Myu were pretty skilled. I want to say that we weren’t overconfident, but looking at you both, those feelings disappeared. If they are in a party with you, the other members must be really exceptional too…”</p>
<p>Lecus and the others had trouble forming parties with normal people, so he realized that Shin’s party members too had to be on the level of Chosen Ones or above.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I don’t mean to brag, but I think that they all could be ranked as top fighters, no matter which country they went to.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while thinking that only Tiera would refuse to be described like that. She always used to say that it was all thanks to Kagerou, but she had grown much stronger in her own right. Her stats, technique, skills and experience too were above the average adventurer. Right now, she could easily defeat Kaede, Shadow and Holly’s daughter in Balmel.</p>
<p>Before, she had lower stats and had to make do somehow with her techniques, but now she had equal, if not superior, stats and could win without trouble, or so thought Shin.</p>
<p>“Once all party members gather, you could even take over a country then…”</p>
<p>“Don’t turn us into insurgents now. We’re not going to fight against countries, unless something extraordinary happens.”</p>
<p>“What if they told you, “give us Yuki or else”?”</p>
<p>“Then they’re turning into ashes, no matter who they are.”</p>
<p>Shin replied instantly. He wouldn’t hesitate, even if the opponent was a noble or a royal.</p>
<p>“Of course you’d say so. You’re head over heels, aren’t you.”</p>
<p>“Why ask that now?”</p>
<p>Hilamee replied that it was a joke, but Shin found it strange. Taking over a country, having Schnee snatched away…it was all too concerning.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’m worried about, actually…I’ll tell you the details later.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I have a really bad feeling about this though…”</p>
<p>Since she had mentioned the word country, Shin figured that something might have happened at Erkunt. Hilamee had just visited it to discuss the Deadly Sin matter, after all.</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to do with your training, don’t worry. Speaking of which, we don’t have many session left, just three days actually. I plan to do a recap of everything we’ve done, and one-on-one training on the last day.”</p>
<p>“One-on-one…”</p>
<p>Gian mumbled to himself, his eyes gleaming. They had mainly trained on how to connect skills, how to use them, learned their characteristics. The first goal was to raise their individual abilities and expand the range of their strategies. Because of this, they never engaged in all-out battle like the first day.</p>
<p>Especially lately they had focused on fighting as a team, so they had few chances to go all out on their own.</p>
<p>Among the three, Gian was the most skilled in individual techniques. In the party, he fought in a balanced way between attack and defense, so he might have some pent-up frustrations. Differently from Myu, who enjoyed the act of fighting itself, Gian was more concerned about winning.</p>
<p>“Ooh, Gian’s on fire!”</p>
<p>“He hates to lose, after all.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, you two.”</p>
<p>Gian glared at the impressed Myu and Lecus, then took his spear. Shin had sparred against them after the monsters proved lacking, so it was the time they would usually go to lunch. Gian was eagerly swinging his spear, since he didn’t care at all about eating.</p>
<p>His training spear pierced the air. After the fierce training and fighting monsters, it swung sharper and faster than before.</p>
<p>“We’re going now, but what will you two do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll train a little more too!”</p>
<p>“Me too. I can’t lose either.”</p>
<p>“I see. I’m looking forward to the last day, then.”</p>
<p>Influenced by Gian, Myu and Lecus eagerly started training too. Looking at them, Shin felt fulfilled in a way different than when he coached beginner players in the game. He felt that he acted as teacher because he enjoyed this feeling.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 4 – Part 2</p>
<p>“What are you going to do today?”</p>
<p>“I have a forging discussion at Vulcan’s place. I’m also thinking of making a small accessory as parting gift for Lecus and the others. With this world’s standards, of course.”</p>
<p>Shin could easily whip up accessories that would be world-class in power. However, he had trained Lecus’ party as a request from the school, so giving them something like that would definitely cause trouble. And so, he planned to give them an accessory that could work as a memento.</p>
<p>Another reason was to make connections. Shin felt that not only Myu, but also Lecus and Gian came from special backgrounds. In a world where having even one skill was highly regarded, Chosen Ones with multiple skills were very rare.</p>
<p>Some Chosen Ones were active adventurers, so it might not apply to all of them, but Lecus’ party was still immature compared to them. Even if the institute attracted students from all over the continent, and the three students had considerable fighting strength, sending precious Chosen Ones on their own was slightly unnatural.</p>
<p>Whether they thought there really was no problem, or there was a special meaning in them being on their own, Shin had no way of knowing, but wanting to share a connection with such unique people wasn’t strange.</p>
<p>He had heard from Schnee that being a Chosen One would only help cover one or maybe two fields, which meant that very few people owned multiple skills in both battle-type and creation-type jobs, as Shin and his party did. For this very reason, many Chosen Ones were connected with others with skills they did not have.</p>
<p>For Shin, it would be fine if the people around them viewed their relationship like that: he had started to mind the reactions of other people more too.</p>
<p>It was also a small gift to celebrate the effort they put in the training. Accessories with magical properties were quite expensive even if they didn’t provide outstanding effects, at least more so than Rare grade gear.</p>
<p>“This world’s accessories are mostly just used as decorations, after all.”</p>
<p>As a creation-type job specialist, Shin wanted to object to the current thinking and state that accessories were supposed to be equipment that covered weaknesses, enhanced strengths or provided abilities you did not have. Using accessories just for their visuals was unthinkable for an adventurer.</p>
<p>There were some exceptions, such as people that had particular preferences or chose accessories that matched the rest of their equipment; but for people who earned their living through battle, using appropriate accessories would be natural.</p>
<p>It wasn’t impossible to find accessories with useful effects on the market, but they were hard to find, especially if one searched for effects useful in battle.</p>
<p>Shin had heard that this was caused by the fact that the skill level required to attach magical properties to accessories was different than the level needed for weapons and armor; obviously, accessories required higher level.</p>
<p>In this world, raising creation-type job skills required more time, money and effort than battle-type jobs, because creation-type skills required materials. Stopping after reaching a level high enough to enchant weapons and armor allowed to start crafting such enchanted gear and sell it, so the user could save time, efforts and materials.</p>
<p>Depending on the person, focusing on weapons and armor meant becoming able to imbue them with higher level magic as well.</p>
<p>“Accessories used in battle are normally retrieved from ruins or dungeons, after all. Items with abilities useful in battle are only made by artisans in royal capitals or their surroundings, and they’re also much more expensive than other gear.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess it can’t be helped, but still.”</p>
<p>You couldn’t just focus on skills and nothing else in this world. Making a living was the first priority, so Shin thought it natural that most people settled on increasing their skills just to an extent.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go see our friend Mr. Vulcan then.”</p>
<p>They arrived at Vulcan’s workshop, the Golden Anvil. Shin opened the door and saw Vaal with several other dwarves.</p>
<p>The dwarves turned around to look at the newcomers and instantly froze in place, with expressions as if they had been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Shin. The boss is in the back.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Vaal, greeted the dwarves with a small gesture and proceeded to the back of the shop. He had visited several times, with the pretense of exchanging techniques, and now they were discussing and exchanging opinions. It was a good stimulus for Vulcan, who told Vaal to let Shin through to the smithy when he came.</p>
<p>Schnee had started assisting Shin with smithy work too, so this time she accompanied him into Vulcan’s workshop. After they passed, they could hear the dwarves murmur words like “The lady’s going in too?” or “That’s got to be a goddess…”</p>
<p>Shin realized that rumors had started circulating about Schnee, who used to wait near the reception when Shin visited Vulcan. The dwarves’ objective was talking to her, apparently.</p>
<p>“This town’s blacksmiths…are a bit off…?”</p>
<p>Shin felt slightly concerned.</p>
<p>“Oh? Ooh, you came! With your elf lady friend too? She always waits up front though, do you want to make her do something?”</p>
<p>Vulcan asked Shin why Schnee came along. Many blacksmiths forbade women from entering their workshop, but Vulcan was different. There wasn’t any dislike or disgust on his face, but simple curiosity.</p>
<p>“She had talent to begin with, but recently I had her help me a bit, and she’s really good at it. I was thinking it’d be good for you to have a look at her too, maybe give your opinion.”</p>
<p>“If you say that, then she can’t be a beginner at least. Elves are good at precise work like concocting and crafting, after all. Even if the field is different, I bet she has good enough sensibility and eye for this work too.”</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, dwarves had bonuses in all creation-type jobs, blacksmithing most of all.</p>
<p>After them, elves were the most blessed race in terms of creation-type jobs.</p>
<p>As Vulcan said, also thanks to their innate abilities, elves did not lose to dwarves when it came to delicate craftwork, such as concocting potions or making cloth. Schnee’s blacksmithing skill level was low, but in skills that required nimble work, like concocting, weaving and engraving she was level VIII and above.</p>
<p>“We’re not especially gifted in handling magic, so I want our lady here to focus on checking that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Elves can see things differently from us too.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard it from Schnee while they were eating at Tsuki no Hokora. Elves could see the “life aura” of cooking ingredients, so he mentioned it.</p>
<p>“Understood. I am not yet skilled enough to actually participate in the forging, so I will focus on that.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded, then Shin and Vulcan stood in front of the furnace. A small iron ingot was put inside and melted in instants. Vulcan grabbed the resulting iron with a pair of tongs and fixed it on top of the anvil.</p>
<p>“First, let’s overlay our magic.”</p>
<p>Vulcan then raised his hammer. Shin aimed for the timing it struck and followed suit. The sounds of striking metal continued: the high-pitched sound of Vulcan’s hammer and the slightly echoing sound of Shin’s hammer reverberated in the workshop.</p>
<p>As the hammers continued to strike, the iron started changing shape. The 5-cemel sized block of iron was stretched and became a thinner 10-cemel round circle when Vulcan and Shin stopped.</p>
<p>“Hmm, as always, when I forge something with you the shape always comes out perfect. Even if the metal was round from the beginning, it’s a mystery how it can end up so completely rounded.”</p>
<p>Vulcan commented while looking at the round iron item. Such a result was caused by Shin’s blacksmith skills, which affected the item’s shape based on the user’s imagination. Even without sharpening, it was possible to create the blade part of swords or knives.</p>
<p>“The effect is, increased defense. Looks like it can project a thin barrier.”</p>
<p>Shin analyzed the item with a small smile. As a category, it was a shield, an iron shield, most probably. It could project barriers, just like Shibaid’s Great Shell Shield of Collision.</p>
<p>Shin tried equipping it and have Vulcan attack him, so they could confirm that a 30-cemel barrier really did appear, with the shield at its center. When Vulcan’s hammer struck, however, it shattered with a light sound.</p>
<p>“It’s too frail. It felt like shattering a thin sheet of ice.”</p>
<p>“We’ve made a bunch of prototypes until now, but the effects vary really wildly, huh.”</p>
<p>When Vulcan and Shin worked together, such failed experiments were frequent. More than 90% of resulting items were useless duds.</p>
<p>“When I have Yuki help, we manage to succeed about once every two times, though.”</p>
<p>“What? It’s much better than with me. Hmm, I fail to see the reason, though. Race, magic power, control, affinity, equipment, materials…it could be anything. What do you say?”</p>
<p>With only two types of samples, it was difficult to pinpoint the reason.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, we use the same materials, and since you have a high rate success with Vaal, I doubt the cause lies with the equipment. The different affinity due to our races could have something to do with it, but I feel that the difference in magic power and control is key. We strike while imbuing magic power, after all, so wouldn’t a related cause be a natural consequence?”</p>
<p>“I see, I see…between me and our lady here, the difference in magic power is undeniable, and you have buttloads of magic power too. Either mine is too weak or yours is too strong. Lady, tell us what’s on your mind too.”</p>
<p>Vulcan nodded to Shin’s reply, then asked for Schnee’s opinion too.</p>
<p>“Quantity and control of magic power, I am quite sure that these two elements are related. I saw the magic power you two imbued clash and make sparks against one another. In the end, Shin’s magic power almost fully covered the item, leaving little of Mr. Vulcan’s. When I and Shin do it, our magic powers overlap, so I believe that this is the cause behind the difference in results.”</p>
<p>“Layers of magic power, huh. I’ll be damned if I don’t envy you for being able to see what we barely manage to feel.”</p>
<p>Vulcan and Shin tried imagining the layers that Schnee explained, but far from building layers, they couldn’t even manage to make their magic power overlap, so they both had a sour look on their faces.</p>
<p>“Could you show me how you forge with Vaal? If I see a successful attempt, I might find a clearer difference.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing. With someone with eyes as good as yours around, it’d be a shame not to try it.”</p>
<p>Vulcan grinned and called Vaal. The blacksmith’s grandson had the persistent dwarf crowd leave, turned the shop’s sign to the “closed” side and started working immediately.</p>
<p>When Vulcan and Vaal struck their hammers, very similar sounds echoed in the surroundings. Being master and student, their striking styles were probably very similar too. Next to Schnee, Shin too tried to focus in catching any changes in magic power.</p>
<p>Differently from seeing magic power used during spells, what Shin could see was just a faint mist, when the hammers struck the anvil, as if he was looking at a blurred photograph, probably because he wasn’t used to it.</p>
<p>The blacksmiths continued working, their hammers alternating, small sparks of magic power flying around. Shin could catch a glimpse of a thin membrane-like object.</p>
<p>He continued to focus even more, and gradually the fog lifted.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>A thin, transparent membrane covered the iron. The red film of Vulcan’s strikes, the orange film of Vaal’s strikes formed layers upon layers. Every time they struck a new layer appeared, but the total thickness did not change.</p>
<p>When Vulcan and Vaal finished their work, the membrane had become of a color between the two and was absorbed by the iron’s surface.</p>
<p>“I guess this is it. It went pretty well.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, this has a support effect.”</p>
<p>The iron block formed a shape slightly more irregular than the one forged by Shin and Vulcan. The effect provided was +5% STR.</p>
<p>Leaving the shape aside, the effect was much more useful than what Shin and Vulcan had produced.</p>
<p>“Your magic powers overlapped neatly, just like Yuki said. In they end, they mixed together and were sucked in.”</p>
<p>“You could see it?”</p>
<p>“I focused on the item and could see it little by little, but I could see something clear only at the end.”</p>
<p>“I thought it could happen, but…never so suddenly.”</p>
<p>Schnee thought that Shin could manage to become able to see the magic power layers, as it was something related to blacksmithing, but was surprised that he had suddenly learned this ability.</p>
<p>“Shin, my man, I can’t let that slide without wondering who the hell you really are…but I’m not gonna ask any questions, and don’t you either, Vaal.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry grampa, I’m already positive that for Mr. Shin nothing is impossible.”</p>
<p>Vulcan warned his grandson after hearing Shin and Schnee’s conversation, but Vaal was apparently already beyond that. Shin wondered what made him think that, and Vaal replied that it was the first sword that Shin forged. Seeing a sword already sharp just after forging convinced him that he was looking at something from a level completely above his.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it…as far as I know, the dwarf elder is the only one who can do things like that. I guess there are lots of other famous blacksmiths in the world.”</p>
<p>Vulcan laughed loudly, declaring how happy he was to have known one of them.</p>
<p>“Will you show me you and the lady forge something next? I feel like I might grasp something new.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded and they started working right away. Schnee’s blacksmithing level was still IV, lower than Vulcan’s, so Shin had her focus on striking only the core of the iron.</p>
<p>Shin fixed the metal block and did the first hit, then Schnee followed, matching the timing with his. Shin could clearly see the overlapping layers this time. A purple film when Shin struck, a blue one when Schnee did.</p>
<p>What was different from Vulcan and Vaal’s was that Shin and Schnee’s membranes did not simply overlap: Shin’s membrane would break through our repel Schnee’s, which was likely the cause of a failed product.</p>
<p>Shin noticed it now, so he adjusted his striking power. However, things didn’t go as he hoped. Even if he held back, his magic power membrane would break through Schnee’s often.</p>
<p>The results were still better than when he forged with Vulcan, though: the resulting item had a +3% lightning resistance effect.</p>
<p>“This is pretty hard.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t adjust my strength properly either.”</p>
<p>“Despite that, you managed to create something decent. This makes me think that magic power control is more important than blacksmithing skill?”</p>
<p>Schnee could also see the overlapping magic power membranes, so she adjusted her striking power accordingly. Based on this, Vulcan hypothesized that the secret behind successful cooperative forging was the control of magic power.</p>
<p>“I feel the same. This time it went somewhat well, but rather than striking the iron, I felt I was repelled by it.”</p>
<p>“Which means, we need both a considerable level of magic power control and blacksmithing skills. Both have to be trained.”</p>
<p>Shin made this conclusion after hearing Schnee’s reasoning.</p>
<p>Vulcan was an excellent blacksmith, but had poor magic control. Schnee was an expert in magic control, but her blacksmithing still needed work. Shin produced better results with Schnee probably because her blacksmithing skills were developed to an extent.</p>
<p>“So this means that we need to practice magic control too…that’ll be hard on the youngsters.”</p>
<p>Vulcan mumbled that it was better to leave that after they had become accomplished blacksmiths. The method of imbuing magic power while forging in pairs was still relatively unknown: money and time were needed to explore it further. If beginners dabbled in it, they risked not being able to make a living.</p>
<p>“How did you two train your magic control?”</p>
<p>“I try adjusting the power of spells, and maintaining them active in a regulated state.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do things like that, maybe because elves are blessed with good magic control since birth. But I tried using magic skills in all sorts of derivative ways, so I believe it helped. Shin’s adjusting method gave me hints too.”</p>
<p>Shin told Vulcan and Vaal the method that Schnee taught him. To prevent the risks of losing control over magic, they used Arts, which had low offensive power. The two blacksmiths quickly understood how difficult an exercise it was.</p>
<p>“I see, I see. This is pretty darned hard.”</p>
<p>“But, I kind of get it. This training is essential to perfect that forging method.”</p>
<p>“No doubt.”</p>
<p>They had just started and couldn’t maintain a proper 【Fireball】, but Vulcan and Vaal were convinced that they had to do it and smiled at each other. It was probably their instinct as artisans which told them so: skipping theories and data altogether, they could feel that “this is the answer we seek”, a hunch only true artisans could have.</p>
<p>“I guess we should focus on this for a while. What are you guys going to do?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to be busy soon, so I think it will be best to work separately until things calm down.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you…naw, nothing. Let’s give it our all, all of us.”</p>
<p>Vulcan was about to say something, but stopped halfway. He shook his head and extended his hand, which Shin shook.</p>
<p>When Shin and Schnee left the workshop, the sun was almost setting: they had been inside a long time. It was common for Shin, but rare for Schnee not to realize it.</p>
<p>“Well, I was always just waiting before…I was happy to be able to work with you, so I lost track of time…”</p>
<p>“Gh, what can I say…sorry.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized to the blushing Schnee. He often lost track of time while forging: it wasn’t rare for the day to turn to night without him realizing. Schnee would always wait for him, never uttering a single complaint. Despite the fact that Schnee now would surely think that it was precious time.</p>
<p>“I have to be more careful in the future.”</p>
<p>“More careful?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing. Just my stance, let’s say.”</p>
<p>Leaving Schnee with a question mark over her head, Shin shook his head and faced forward.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 4 – Part 3</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>Hilamee said that she would send someone to pick Shin up in the morning. After preparing the necessary items, he was taking it easy by relaxing while sipping Schnee’s tea in his hotel room.</p>
<p>“Guess they’re here?”</p>
<p>Shin felt the presence of a hotel employee heading towards his room. After a few minutes the clerk knocked and announced that his escort had arrived. He went down with Schnee and found Licia waiting.</p>
<p>“I apologize for making you wait. Our preparations are complete, so we came to accompany you.”</p>
<p>“I was just relaxing while I waited, so it was nothing.”</p>
<p>Shin reassured Licia that it was no trouble and boarded the horse carriage. There he learned that both of the institute’s heads of the magic department and technology development department would be present while Shin installed the trap items.</p>
<p>After an uneventful trip, the group reached the institute. Hilamee had already left, so they followed Licia to the training dungeon. Hilamee was waiting with the guards in a security tower: she was accompanied by two male elves, one clad in robes and another in work gear. It was clear from their clothes which department they headed.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming all the way here. Let me introduce you to Iggris, head of the magic department, and Seeran, head of the technology development department.”</p>
<p>“I’m Iggris. My pleasure.”</p>
<p>“I am Seeran. If the headmistress went to the trouble of calling someone from outside, you must be quite the big shot. I’m expecting great things.”</p>
<p>Iggris greeted Shin flatly, without changing his expression in the slightest. His calm mood reminded Shin of how elves behaved as NPCs.</p>
<p>Seeran, on the other hand, reached for a handshake, clearly very interested in Shin. He looked almost like a kid that had found a new toy.</p>
<p>Both elves had once been adventurers, but, after hearing that Hilamee had started a school, they travelled to Erkunt and offered to help. Leaving their personalities aside, such a lifestyle was quite unusual by elven standards.</p>
<p>Two male elves had answered Hilamee’s call…Shin couldn’t help but think they had ulterior motives, but did not say anything. There could be all sorts of bonds between men and women outside of “that”, and it would be something very disrespectful to imply after all.</p>
<p>“I’ll start installing right away then.”</p>
<p>Showing the actual items would be faster than explaining: no objections were raised, so the group headed towards the dungeon. Shin stopped in front of the entrance and took the items out of his item box, naturally pretending to do so from a pocket.</p>
<p>“These items are used to ambush monsters. In terms of specs, they can defeat most monsters up to level 500, even monsters only affected by physical or magical attacks. If monsters focused on one of these two items, however, they could break through without being annihilated.”</p>
<p>There were several kinds of items to ambush monsters: Shin had chosen orthodox types, which released physical and magical damage light bullets when monsters approached.</p>
<p>He had prepared two types, one that shot several bullets and one that shot one powerful bullet. Setting both of them made it possible to defeat small fry with the multiple shot trap and target more powerful units with the other, thus they covered each other’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>Items like these stopped acting if the monsters left a certain radius or perished. The light bullets required stored magical power to be fired, so once it was used up they stopped functioning. The items automatically absorbed surrounding magic power, however, so they rarely needed to be manually charged. This automatic recharge was pretty slow however, so charging them manually was often quicker.</p>
<p>All kinds of trap items’ active time changed with activation frequency, number of monsters, level etc., so it was important to manage them precisely according to their location. This time, they were expected to activate only in rare situations, so it would be enough to just mark down their location.</p>
<p>“That’s all we need to pay attention to. Considering their continuous attack function, I’ll set them on both sides of the entrance’s ceiling and floor, two of each type on each side. Any questions?”</p>
<p>Iggris raised his hand to Shin’s question.</p>
<p>“How durable are the items themselves? Some monsters can attack from long distance, after all.”</p>
<p>“The items themselves do not have really high durability. It depends on the type of attack, but a level 300 monster would need 2 or 3 attacks to destroy them. However, they are protected by a barrier, so in actuality they can survive even 10 punches from a level 500 golem.”</p>
<p>In such a case, they could buy enough time to defeat even a golem like that.</p>
<p>“How much are these really worth in battle? I did my fair share of adventuring, but I can’t even imagine what a level 500 monster looks like. Could you explain in a way we can understand?”</p>
<p>“Let me see, against the monsters that spawn in this dungeon, they can hold for about two hours.”</p>
<p>Seeran looked deep in thought, and Shin made an example with the training dungeon monsters. They were level 255 at most and unlike a field the dungeon entrance was narrow, so the number of monsters that could pass through at one time was limited.</p>
<p>In this case, even monsters that appeared in large numbers, like the ants that Shin fought, would be stopped by the 16 trap items that Shin was going to install. As long as their magic power charge held, of course.</p>
<p>“That’s rather powerful. It would be troublesome if the government was informed.”</p>
<p>“Right. If the military department’s ‘nasty glasses’ officer got wind of this, they’d definitely complain and confiscate the items.”</p>
<p>“Yes…can’t argue with that.”</p>
<p>Seeran nodded to Iggris’ comment after learning of the items’ power. Hilamee looked sour as well: it would definitely not be wise to let the government know. Judging from their tone, it didn’t look like Iggris and Seeran had any intention to do so either.</p>
<p>“I’ll go ahead and install them, then.”</p>
<p>The installing process was not complicated: the items could be buried in the ground or the walls, even without needing to dig. After the item was buried, nothing suggested that there was something hidden. The only way to notice was to use trap detection skills or have very sharp instincts.</p>
<p>“And we’re done. I already charged them with magic power, so we can just leave them be. They will give a signal if they activate, so I will let you know if anything happens.”</p>
<p>“…I want one too.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I can’t let this pass without taking one for analysis…”</p>
<p>“Both of you have a lot of other things to do, don’t you? And you always say that there’s not enough manpower!”</p>
<p>“As a technology expert, I cannot overlook this.”</p>
<p>“If I could understand the structure, I could apply it to other uses as well.”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s warning barely even reached the two elves’ ears. In a way, that was a natural reaction for researchers. Even so, Shin had no intention of providing them with items.</p>
<p>“Monster ambush items” as a name sounded very appealing, but it was possible to make them target people too. The items used in guild versus guild battles, set to activate when guild houses were attacked, were the same type as the ones that Shin just installed. He couldn’t just hand them out so easily.</p>
<p>Hilamee dragged the two unhappy elves away, saying that their work there was done. Shin and Schnee waved goodbye to her and returned to their lodging.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t train Lecus’ party that day: few days remained until the final training session, but the students said that they would use the time to come up with a way to fight by themselves, so they were probably busy training by themselves now.</p>
<p>Shin was very much looking forward to what they would show on the last day.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 13 Chapter 4 – Part 4</p>
<p>The fateful final day finally arrived.</p>
<p>Shin woke up 20 minutes earlier than usual.</p>
<p>“Good morning, si…ahem. Good morning. You’re up earlier than usual.”</p>
<p>Schnee was about to give her usual polite greeting, but corrected herself halfway through. The words that followed, however, were kind of awkward.</p>
<p>“Morning. Don’t force yourself to change, take your time.”</p>
<p>“I do it because I wi..want to.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s attempts at speaking less politely sometimes met such quirky results. She only tried when she was alone with Shin, though. It didn’t go well every time: she was too used to speaking politely, so sometimes their conversations turned awkward.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s take it easy, anyway.”</p>
<p>There was no need to rush.</p>
<p>“I’ll go wash my face.”</p>
<p>Shin got out of bed and went to the bathroom. He made preparations quickly and had breakfast.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to hurry, there’s still plenty of time.”</p>
<p>“…was I in that much of a hurry?”</p>
<p>“Hehe. Just like you did in the past when looking forward to an event.”</p>
<p>Shin was eager to see how Lecus’ party would fight, that was probably why he was hurrying.</p>
<p>“I wonder why..it’s not like they’re my disciples or anything, but it’s just such fun to see them grow.”</p>
<p>“I understand, I had a similar experience too. You can’t help being happy, seeing your pupils become stronger.”</p>
<p>Schnee laughed and Shin smiled back. She had prepared some herbal tea, to help him calm down, so Shin started sipping on it to kill time.</p>
<p>“Weird, how could they be late today, of all times?”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee arrived at the institute, eager and excited, but none of the three students showed up at the appointed time. Even if they were late, Lecus or Gian would have contacted them.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee separated to go check the boys’ and girls’ dorm, only to learn that the three students had apparently already left.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like they had any other things to take care of…something must have happened after they left.”</p>
<p>Myu was especially excited about the day, so she had talked about it with friends in the dorm as well. The students’ friends, who told Shin and Schnee about their departure, all claimed they didn’t know anything about any other plans.</p>
<p>The appointed location was inside institute grounds, so it was difficult to imagine that they had been caught up in trouble on their way there.</p>
<p>“Do you think they might still be in the institute?”</p>
<p>“I want to say yes, but there’s something that bothers me.”</p>
<p>What concerned Schnee was the man that Luxuria talked about, who introduced himself as Avaritia’s follower: Hexen. He had fled without fighting, so his strength was unknown, but if he had been able to run away from a Deadly Sin Devil, he clearly wasn’t an average person.</p>
<p>“After we started training, those three went often to the infirmary, as Luxuria said. If Hexen saw them, he might have thought of using them as hostages…”</p>
<p>For Shin and the others, Luxuria’s change of heart, which allowed her to co-exist with people without hurting anybody, was very welcome. When Shin saw her earnestly concerned about people, or rather children, he was very surprised.</p>
<p>This change, however, could turn out to be not completely positive. The more Luxuria treasured people, the more her heart was closer to them, the more weakness would be generated.</p>
<p>Just as it had happened to Shin in the past, when someone close to you was targeted, you can end up becoming powerless.</p>
<p>“Schnee, please contact Hilamee. I’ll go see if anyone went out of town.”</p>
<p>If they had been taken away, it was highly likely that they would be already outside the town. There was nothing else Shin could do at the moment.</p>
<p>Even Shin and Schnee’s high battle prowess was little use when looking for someone.</p>
<p>“Shit! Tell me that we didn’t guess right!”</p>
<p>Shin expanded his detection field as much as he could.</p>
<p>“Wait…what’s that?”</p>
<p>It was a mere coincidence. While he was expanding his detection field from their location towards outside the institute’s premises, he noticed three presences moving together.</p>
<p>The three dots were heading towards the supposedly sealed training dungeon. He kept following their movements and saw that 2 of the dots gathered around the entrance of the training dungeon started moving towards the three approaching dots. They were probably security guards: eventually, they came in contact with the three dots.</p>
<p>One of the dots stopped moving, and all the other dots started drawing closer too. They were clearly fighting, which gave Shin a bad feeling about the situation.</p>
<p>“They’re fighting.”</p>
<p>“Those three presences…could it be them?”</p>
<p>Schnee probably noticed that something was off from Shin’s reaction and expanded her detection field as well.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what could be the cause, but yes, maybe. Let’s go check.”</p>
<p>They had no other clues at the time. It could be a diversion, but it was far too difficult to find to work as one. There had to be another objective in play. Shin decided to message Hilamee, then go to the training dungeon.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you all right!?”</p>
<p>When Shin and Schnee arrived the fighting was already over: Bermann and the other security guards were all lying on the ground. As it turned out, they really fought against Lecus’ party. Since the three “intruders” were students they knew and chosen ones, they managed to send an emergency message, but ended up defeated.</p>
<p>“Kh, how shameful…we couldn’t stop them…”</p>
<p>Bermann and the guards were dejected, but based on their equipment and training, they should have been able to hold on until Shin and Schnee arrived. Shin thus inquired further, only to learn that Lecus’ party moved and fought as if they were completely different people. It was clear that, after all, they weren’t acting on their own will.</p>
<p>“Will you go by yourselves? It’s too dangerous. We should wait for the headmistress.”</p>
<p>“We have contacted her already. Saving those three is a higher priority now.”</p>
<p>If they were strong enough to defeat Bermann’s group in so little time, sending reinforcements would just create more casualties. The next task was definitely Shin and Schnee’s specialty. Saying that they would just do some reconnaissance, the two entered the training dungeon.</p>
<p>The walls and floors did not seem to have changed. The traps and contents appeared to be just like the training dungeon always used to be.</p>
<p>“They have definitely gone inside. Not much time seems to have passed either. I can’t tell which floor they warped to, though.”</p>
<p>Schnee had tracked the three student’s traces with her kunoichi abilities. They had gone to the teleport device room, but it was not possible to know which floor they had gone to.</p>
<p>“We should be able to find some traces in the floor they went to. I doubt they went to one of the higher floors in this situation…it’s a gamble, but let’s try going to the deepest part, from level 200, first.”</p>
<p>If they didn’t find any traces of the students, they would be forced to check all other floors one by one. Hoping that his hunch was right, Shin and Schnee used the teleport. At their destination, they found clear traces that someone had passed.</p>
<p>“The gamble paid off, then.”</p>
<p>Their relief was very short, as they couldn’t relax just yet, and resumed tracking. Thanks to 【Magic Sonar】 they could tell how the floor was structured, so they used together with other detection skills to track the three runaways.</p>
<p>“No response in the map. But the tracks clearly lead to the deepest part of this area.”</p>
<p>In a normal cave, they could scan underground right away, but training dungeons allowed to see only the floor where one was currently located. Shin’s detection field showed that not only the three students’ responses weren’t there, but no monsters were either.</p>
<p>“In any case, something must have happened, that’s for sure…”</p>
<p>The situation was very similar to when the mob ants were amassed in floor 200. While keeping their guard up, Shin and Schnee hurried to the lower levels, but found nothing anywhere. This continued five times, but when they reached floor 205, something changed.</p>
<p>“They’re here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, without a doubt.”</p>
<p>Before the stairs leading down to floor 206, they found a door just like the ones placed before boss chambers. The three students’ tracks led here too.</p>
<p>“We can’t see inside, huh. Schnee, get ready for an ambush.”</p>
<p>They had made necessary preparations for battle while they descended. Judging it likely that they would fight devil-related foes, both Shin and Schnee equipped anti-devil gear.</p>
<p>After Schnee concealed her presence with a skill, Shin opened the door and noticed the silhouette of a man, pierced in the middle by something. He wasn’t anyone they knew. Based on the fact that the map didn’t show his icon, he had to be already dead. What pierced the man seemed to be a half-transparent tentacle.</p>
<p>It looked like the aura that appeared when Shin or Schnee used skills: its color, however, was much darker and sinister-looking.</p>
<p>Shin then looked at the base of the tentacle.</p>
<p>“What the hell’s that?”</p>
<p>The appearance was just like the 『Piece of Avarice』 that Shin found after exterminating the Mob Ants, but its size was at least three mel, much larger than the one found in the mob ant’s body.</p>
<p>The tentacle was a mutation of aura, so after being removed from the man’s body, it returned silently to the aura emanated by the piece, though it was hardly fitting calling it like that.</p>
<p>Piece of %#ice – Level 605</p>
<p>【Analyze】 revealed the name and level, and that not only its appearance was abnormal. Judging from its size and the aura it emanated, it was surely something completely different.</p>
<p>The 『Piece of Avarice』 was an item used to reinforce equipment: devil energy turned into a crystal. If used on a monster, it turned it into a stronger version under the command of the corresponding devil, but the piece itself had no fighting ability.</p>
<p>“At least they’re safe for now?”</p>
<p>Before the 『Piece of Avarice』 stood Lecus and his party, with blank expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>They were supposed to have received damage in their battle against Bermann and the other guards, but their HP gauge was maxed out. At the very least, they weren’t controlled corpses.</p>
<p>Over their heads there were 『Piece of Avarice』 with similar size as the one Shin first found. The three pieces emanated auras just like the larger one, connected in strings to the three students’ limbs. The three smaller pieces did not show name or level, so they were probably just support units of the larger one.</p>
<p>We’ll save them first, then destroy the big piece.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee communicated via Mind Chat, then looked more closely at the larger piece. It was very close to the three students: destroying it would have likely released them from its control, but if they were attacked while trying to save them, it would be troublesome.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking about how to separate the fragments from the students, but Lecus and the others moved first.</p>
<p>Myu and Gian came closer to him, with Lecus following them a few mels behind. The main piece did not move, which was unsettling, but a chance at the same time.</p>
<p>Both positively and negatively, however, the three students surpassed Shin’s expectations. The speed at which they were moving was much higher than what he remembered. They were probably powered up by something: the aura stretching from the fragments trailed after them, like afterimages.</p>
<p>They probably hadn’t noticed Schnee, who was still concealed. Myu and Gian attacked Shin from the right and left side, with a flying kick and a medium thrust. Shin grabbed Myu’s gauntlet and the tip of Gian’s spear, stopping their attacks with brute strength.</p>
<p>They were indeed faster and stronger than before, but not enough to pose a threat to Shin. He could still make short work of the three. It was because of this that he threw Myu away and pulled the spear to knock Gian on the ground. Just then, three lightning bolts flew through the air and struck him.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d attack them at the same time too, but I guess it won’t go like that?”</p>
<p>The bolts scattered before Shin’s defense power and his equipment; he then swatted away a gust of invisible wind with a hand.</p>
<p>Lecus’ 【Thunder Line】 had been shot as to avoid Myu and Gian.</p>
<p>If he really was under the devil’s control, he would probably attack with no regard for their safety…so guessed Shin, but reality turned out different.</p>
<p>The other 2 students resumed their attacks too: Gian came from the front, Myu from the back, with 2 other 【Thunder Line】 bolts coming from the sides. All attacks came with perfectly displaced timing: there was no possibility of the 2 close combat fighters to be struck by the aftershocks of the 【Thunder Line】 bolts.</p>
<p>Even if controlled, they clearly understood that if they came in contact with someone hit by 【Thunder Line】, they would be shocked too.</p>
<p>“You fight together even better than before.”</p>
<p>They weren’t moving with their free will, but even so they attacked with perfect timing. Such movements were possible because of their training, which seemed ironic in this situation. Shin thought that he would have preferred not seeing the results of their training in this manner.</p>
<p>He ignored the thunderbolts, leaving their neutralization to his gear and defense power, and attempted to destroy Myu’s fragment first, since she had the highest mobility.</p>
<p>He tried to stop her with a skill that caused paralysis, but one instant before he could strike, the aura from the fragment enveloped Myu and nullified the paralysis effect.</p>
<p>The impact of Shin’s attack wasn’t completely blocked, so Myu shook a little, but she quickly regained her stance. She was also healed, apparently.</p>
<p>If the opponent was a simple monster, Shin could take it down with one blow, but he couldn’t use the same strategy with Myu.</p>
<p>The main piece did not attack, but it couldn’t be ignored: the situation was more difficult to handle than what Shin estimated.</p>
<p>“(I can’t just waste time like this. Guess I’ll be more forceful)”</p>
<p>Shin was worried about leaving the three students under the influence of the sinister aura for a long period of time. He told Schnee, via Mind Chat, that he had to act with less concern for the damage that could be caused.</p>
<p>Gian and Myu started their third assault. Shin, however, did not defend himself. He received Myu’s kick and grabbed her head, then went on to meet Gian’s spear himself.</p>
<p>The spear was repelled by Shin’s gear, knocking Gian off his balance. Ignoring the spear, Shin advanced forward and grabbed Gian’s head too.</p>
<p>“【Purification】!”</p>
<p>Just like miasma, devil power could be erased with 【Purification】. He had caught the 2 with anti-devil gauntlets, which had started eating away at the devil power from the moment they had come in contact with the 2 students’ heads, and with 【Purification】 the aura completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Shin then used a Flame-type skill, concentrated in one spot, to attack the smaller fragments that connected Lecus’ party to the larger piece. Because of the purification, the limbs of dark aura that chained Lecus and the others vanished, then heat lines were released.</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t sure that the chains would disappear if the fragments were destroyed, so he used magic to make sure to destroy them completely.</p>
<p>After the heat lines disappeared, there was no trace of the smaller pieces. Myu and Gian fell down, as if devoid of all strength. As far as Shin could tell, they were not affected by any negative status conditions.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, I failed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be, that couldn’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Schnee had faced against Lecus, but since he was close to the main piece, a barrier was formed and, before she could attack it, Lecus had been transported before it.</p>
<p>“Devil – Killer – Arm…”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee were considering their next action, when Lecus’ mouth uttered a series of words. Differently from his previous empty look, his eyes were now firmly looking at them.</p>
<p>“Luxeria – Aura – Trust?”</p>
<p>The uttered words became gradually clearer. Then, before Shin and Schnee could move, the aura binding Lecus disappeared and the piece returned to the larger one. At the same time, Lecus dropped like a marionette with severed strings.</p>
<p>He wasn’t affected by status conditions, like Myu and Gian: the main piece had thus released Lecus of its own will.</p>
<p>“Don’t need that anymore.”</p>
<p>Normal, clear speech was heard from the main piece. Shin thought that it was trying to catch them off guard, but it didn’t seem like it was going to attack. Despite its lack of eyes, however, they could feel someone, something, staring at them.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>“Goal, complete.”</p>
<p>Despite the reply, it didn’t seem like they could actually communicate.</p>
<p>Before Shin could ask anything else, the aura took tentacle form again and attacked Shin.</p>
<p>“Schnee, take those 2 away. I’ll go rescue Lecus.”</p>
<p>Shin slashed the tentacle aura with the anti-devil longsword 『Isla』 and started running.</p>

<p>【Spirit of Pigritis Level 605】</p>
<p>【Analyze】 activated again, maybe because the piece was acting in a different manner. What it showed was clearly different from before.</p>
<p>“A piece of Sloth? Not Avarice?”</p>
<p>Shin was confused by the new name, but his opponent didn’t give him time to think. Thankfully, the aura tentacles aimed at Shin only: he avoided moving too much, so that Lecus wouldn’t become a target, and moved gradually closer while parrying the tentacles’ attacks.</p>
<p>In case Lecus was targeted, he kept magic stocked at all times.</p>
<p>“I’m back.”</p>
<p>“Looks like our friend here is very interested in me. Sorry, can you take care of Lecus too?”</p>
<p>Schnee returned, still concealed, and Shin asked her to rescue Lecus. If Shin did it himself, the tentacles might have targeted the elven student.</p>
<p>“Death, come. Me, I, greed, sloth, lust, all, can kill.”</p>
<p>The aura’s color changed. It was as sinister as before, but the faint yellow hue now turned green.</p>
<p>“OoOh, oOooh, O Death! O HuNTeR of DeAdlY SinS!”</p>
<p>An unnaturally echoing voice spread from the piece. The aura tentacles underwent a change too. They were no more just different shapes of aura: their tips changed to sharp blades, their size growing much larger too.</p>
<p>The tentacles were now 7: the many tentacles from before merged, so their individual power likely increased.</p>
<p>“I see, so this is Sloth.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the piece, split in 2 parts: it was an ability that the Sloth devil possessed. As far as Shin knew, Sloth could originally split even more, but now it was probably limited by something, and did not split into more than 2 parts.</p>
<p>All tentacles rushed towards Shin: he was the sole target just like before. 14 blades surrounded him, to attack from all sides.</p>
<p>“Yes, target me, just like that!”</p>
<p>Shin ran in the opposite direction of Lecus’ location, to make it easier for Schnee to rescue him. He lowered his stance and jumped towards one side of the tentacles, to take care of some of the blades and lower their total number.</p>
<p>The blades attacked from all sides, but their number was limited. Since they attacked from the front, back, sides and even from above, a max of three blades could attack from one direction: a number Shin could easily neutralize.</p>
<p>He stopped 2 with the longsword and another with his gauntlet. The repelled blades carved through the ground like digging through sand. They looked thin, but their offensive capabilities were clearly higher than their level.</p>
<p>Shin then slashed the aura that bound the blades to the piece, severing it as if cutting through rubber. The separated blades vanished, while the piece’s aura formed new ones. Recovery speed was around 1, 2 seconds.</p>
<p>“Death! Death!”</p>
<p>The piece continued saying the same lines while attacking Shin. It had probably completely forgotten about Lecus and the others. It felt almost obsessed in attacking Shin. The tentacles’ attacks, however, were not haphazard at all: they didn’t interfere or bump against each other, moving precisely towards Shin.</p>
<p>He avoided another barrage and went closer to the piece and kicked one of its 2 prongs. The aura was scattered and a large crack appeared on its surface.</p>
<p>Then, something bizarre happened. The HP gauge of both soul fragments decreased. As far as Shin remembered, after splitting they should have had separate HP gauges. If it wasn’t a display error, it meant that even after splitting the soul fragments retained HP in common.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s related to the voice being there or not?”</p>
<p>Shin had kicked the part that didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“You’re not hearing me, are you.”</p>
<p>Shin tried to talk with the source of the voice as he parried the blades, hoping to gather information, but received no response at all. Deciding that all he could do was defeat it, he gripped his longsword with more power.</p>
<p>He had already confirmed that Schnee had moved Lecus somewhere safe. There was no risk of involving him anymore.</p>
<p>As he made this conclusion, the soul fragment had turned back into one. Probably due to this fusion, its HP was back at max.</p>
<p>Shin faced it head on: the sharp aura blades were met with the blade of his longsword 『Isla』, which swung infused with Shin’s magic power, slicing the blades in 2. The longsword’s silver blade now had blue patterns, because of the magic power dwelling in it.</p>
<p>It was the perfect situation for the anti-devil longsword 『Isla』 to exert its full power. Maybe because of its boosted effectiveness against devils, the blades regenerated at slower pace than before. Even before regenerating, though, the tentacles continued to attack.</p>
<p>The soul fragment had returned to being one, but the tentacles were still 7. Far from being enough to stop Shin.</p>
<p>“Take this!”</p>
<p>Shin continued mowing down the tentacles, without an inch of restraint, then sunk 『Isla』’s blade into the soul fragment. Its special effectiveness manifested fully, slicing the fragment in two.</p>
<p>Just to be sure, Shin swung 『Isla』 again. 6 shattered fragments fell to the ground, melting away as soon as they touched it. Soon after, a green crystal about the size of a fist appeared.</p>
<p>“…is it over?”</p>
<p>Shin examined the crystal, which turned out to be the item 『Drop of Pigritis』, proof of defeat of the Sloth devil. In other words, even if its appearance was different, the soul fragment that fought against Shin was the Sloth devil itself.</p>
<p>The crystal’s size, however, was half of what it used to be.</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t convinced that it was truly over. His opponent was a devil: the name displayed was Sloth, but its appearance and abilities were both different than what he remembered. It could have been pretending to be defeated, only to attack again by surprise.</p>
<p>The map, however, did not show any presences except Shin’s own. He asked Schnee too, who was with Lecus and the others, but she didn’t feel anything either.</p>
<p>According to what Lecus and the others said, they were approached by a man on the way to training grounds, but could not recall what happened next.</p>
<p>That man was on the corner of the room, deceased. Shin and Schnee had arrived too late, there was nothing to do about it. He also was probably the man who had visited Luxuria.</p>
<p>Although the name changed halfway, the three students were under the control of a 『Piece of Avarice』. It couldn’t be unrelated to Greed.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee entrusted Lecus’ party to Hilamee, who had rushed to the dungeon after receiving the message, then left. Because of the nature of the incident, it would be dealt with in absolute secrecy. They headed to the institute to discuss further.</p>
<p>“By the way, Luxuria mentioned having met Sloth, didn’t she.”</p>
<p>Shin remembered this detail during the conversation with Luxuria as they were heading to the institute grounds. At the same time, he remembered what happened when he sliced the soul fragment in 2.</p>
<p>“Is anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, well…Sloth might have lured us there to decrease Greed’s power…is what I was thinking. It wasn’t as strong because it had taken Greed’s power, maybe. Not that I have any proof.”</p>
<p>Shin hadn’t failed to notice that just before 『Isla』 struck the fragment, the aura protecting it weakened. He thought it was because of the longsword’s anti-devil properties, but even so, the timing was too perfect.</p>
<p>The words “Death!”, uttered by the fragment, concerned him too. To Shin, it sounded like it was pleading to “Give us death!”.</p>
<p>“According to Luxuria, Sloth too refused to fuse. It could have been its way to fight against it.”</p>
<p>Schnee had heard those words too. Because of this, she could agree that Shin’s theory was not a far-fetched fantasy.</p>
<p>“…I’m liking less and less the fact that Greed is out there, doing whatever it pleases.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee, quietly renewing their resolve, walked towards the institute.</p>
<p>The day of the decisive battle was not too distant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 1 – Part 1</p>
<p>After the battle and victory over the evil deity Adetropos, Shin and Schnee were transported to the Erkunt institute of magic.</p>
<p>There they met former player Hilamee, now the institute’s headmistress, who plead for them to help protect the students from the Deadly Sin devil who took residence in the institute.</p>
<p>While they managed to reach a peaceful agreement with the source of such trouble, the devil of lust Luxuria, they learned that the aggressive devil of greed is baring his fangs at the institute.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the three students that Shin met in the training dungeon near the institute – Miu, Gian, and Lecus – fell under someone’s control. Shin and Schnee rescued them and defeated the puppetmaster.</p>
<p>The dropped crystal, however, did not show greed’s name, as it was a 『Drop of Pigritis』…</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee visit the institute, in order to discuss the matter of the students falling under manipulation. In the room they were shown to they find not only Hilamee, but also Luxuria.</p>
<p>“Have you heard already?”</p>
<p>After a short greeting, Shin touched upon the main topic.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is probably as you guessed: Sloth tried rebelling against Greed. Like me, Sloth wasn’t keen on Greed’s attitude either. He was waiting for a chance to rebel, I think.”</p>
<p>Luxuria had already heard about the incident from Hilamee and gave her own conclusion, in a concerned tone. Something was probably weighing on her mind.</p>
<p>“How are those three? Did they feel sick afterwards?”</p>
<p>“They drank the elixir you gave us, as far as we know they’re completely fine. They say the same themselves. Luxuria also said that they aren’t affected by the devil anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m pretty sure of that.”</p>
<p>Hearing Hilamee and Luxuria’s replies, Shin felt relieved.</p>
<p>All he could do to heal was use skills or items. He had asked Schnee to look at them too, but now that a devil like Luxuria confirmed it too, he felt his remaining concerns disappear.</p>
<p>“Let’s discuss the matter again, then. This time there are people involved too, so making countermeasures will be difficult, I think.”</p>
<p>If someone cooperated with devils out of their own free will, Shin’s items would register them as normal people: it wouldn’t be possible to repel them individually.</p>
<p>“In regards to that, I would like you to tell us any effective strategies against devils that you know. We couldn’t help Myu and the others in time, but we might be able to do something to avoid similar accidents.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know any counter-strategies, Hilamee?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately not. During the game events I always depended on others, so I don’t know much about items or attacks effective against devils. I asked other players and learned a bit, but…actually putting it into practice is a whole other matter.”</p>
<p>There were anti-devil weapons and armor, which caused extra damage to devils and their cohorts, and defended against attacks causing status ailments. Concerning status ailments, there were items that neutralized them entirely. If you could gather enough, there was no risk of being utterly destroyed, even with a wide level gap.</p>
<p>The problem was gathering enough items. Devils did not spawn here and there, like normal monsters or bosses, so there were few chances of using them. Moreover, materials were much more expensive and harder to come by now than in the game era. Even if you had the right recipe, it was difficult to find a blacksmith that could forge the gear in question. In conclusion, fighting with numbers would be difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>“Countermeasures outside of weapons and armor, huh. The quickest one would be using skills, but we can’t just teach them to the whole army…”</p>
<p>The regular way of learning them would take too much time; even if they used 『Secret Book』 items, they didn’t have nearly enough of them. One option would be to teach skills only to executives or officers, but this had probably been done already.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anything we could gather in large numbers? Especially if it’s cheap to make and requires few materials.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it would be way too easy if something like that existed…”</p>
<p>Items with low cost and low effectiveness existed, but distributing them to a whole army meant preparing a massive quantity.</p>
<p>Item creation required several skills too, so spreading them to a large number of people would be unfeasible.</p>
<p>“Gathering a small group of strong warriors and giving them the right equipment and items is the best way after all, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Normal soldiers would just get slaughtered before using the items, or fall to the enemies’ pressure and not even use them. I agree that it’s better to give them to warriors with reliable skills, like Chosen Ones. I can lend them weapons too.”</p>
<p>The enemy was a Deadly Sin devil, it wasn’t time to hold anything back.</p>
<p>Considering the penalties for insufficient stats, the gear Shin could lend would be Legend or Mythology grade. He was becoming famous already, so there wasn’t much of a point in trying to hide anymore.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame, but I suppose that’s the only way. I’ll make a list of the weapons favored by the best warriors we have. I am a bit concerned about what will happen later, after it becomes known that we have so many weapons at our disposal…I’m sorry, I don’t know how much I’ll be able to help.”</p>
<p>“Well…let’s see. Let’s say that I am the last remaining descendant of a clan of devil killers. I couldn’t just run away leaving all the trouble to you and Masakado.”</p>
<p>“—if needed, simply say that you’re connected to me. I won’t let anyone cause you trouble.”</p>
<p>Schnee, who had been listening quietly, finally spoke. If they said to be connected to Schnee Raizar, people would think twice before interfering.</p>
<p>“Is that really alright? That’s troublesome in itself, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I had decided to accept requests only until Shin came back after all.”</p>
<p>Schnee left Shin’s side only to deal with the consequences of jobs she had accepted in the past.</p>
<p>“…it might be effective to announce that Shin is my husband too.”</p>
<p>Schnee mentioned it quite casually, but Hilamee agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>“It definitely would draw attention away from the anti-devil gear or your fighting prowess, but you’d attract attention nonetheless.”</p>
<p>The fact that Schnee had found a companion would make a lot more noise than the news of someone capable of defeating devils.</p>
<p>Hilamee added that the village of High Elves would definitely move to confirm if it was true.</p>
<p>“I do not care one bit about the Elf village. Many High Elves have excessive amounts of pride, so I do not even want to get close to them.”</p>
<p>“The village’s High Elves would cry if they heard this…well, they brought it upon themselves, though.”</p>
<p>“It matters little to me, honestly.”</p>
<p>Unusually for Schnee, she reacted to Hilamee’s words in a rather curt manner. Being part of the Elf race caused her trouble in the past, apparently.</p>
<p>“You’re both pretty free-spirited, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s not exactly it…”</p>
<p>Shin was patting Schnee’s head to relieve her sour mood, when Luxuria shrugged her shoulders at them.</p>
<p>“Anyway, wouldn’t it be faster to ask Luxuria about anti-devil strategies? Being a devil, she surely knows best.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about a devil that would tell others their weakness…but it’s pretty much as you said. In terms of information quality, I might even lose to you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Luxuria was not just a monster now. She had the same intellect as a human, or maybe even more.</p>
<p>“People don’t know perfectly what magic or medicine is effective on them, or what the actual effects are, do they? It’s the same for us. I can tell by instinct if something would be fatal, but about the rest, well…who knows.”</p>
<p>“If you put it like that, I don’t have anything to say.”</p>
<p>Shin realized that he couldn’t give a satisfying answer if he was asked about what weapons or items were most effective on him. He could say to use Ancient grade weapons, or gear specialized against humans, but that was it.</p>
<p>“If you used the items Shin mentioned on me, you’d see how effective they are, no?”</p>
<p>“…is it okay to say that so casually? It’s like human experimentation, I don’t really like the idea.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I’m going to die instantly, so it’s okay. Go ahead and try, if it works on me, it’ll work on Avaritia too.”</p>
<p>“…you’d go so far…?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I don’t have the slightest intention of becoming one with that thing.”</p>
<p>Luxuria crossed her arms over her chest and shook her head left and right. Maybe because of something that happened in the past, she loathed the idea so much she even felt fear.</p>
<p>“Well, regardless of testing the items on Luxuria or not, it’d be better to go somewhere we won’t risk being seen, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>At the very least, it wasn’t something to do in the headmistress’ office. Shin wasn’t keen on the idea at all, but they decided to meet another day.</p>
<p>“Is there anything else to discuss?”</p>
<p>“Yes, one more thing. This is more important, in a way.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t seem like it’ll be something pleasant…”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s expression made it clear that it wouldn’t be.</p>
<p>“We received a message from the royal palace…they want Luxuria to appear before their inquiry commission.”</p>
<p>“An inquiry commission? Wait, how do inquiries work here?”</p>
<p>Shin had a general idea of what inquiry commissions did in the real world. In this world, however, the laws and structure of society were different. It might be something with the same name, but completely different contents.</p>
<p>“This commission examines individuals who caused problems within organizations tied with the kingdom of Erkunt, giving punishment when necessary. Luxuria is part of the Erkunt institute of magic’s teaching body”, after all. Different from our former world, it’s not really a fair organization, though…not that there was much fairness in the former world either…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?? You look tired of everything all of a sudden!?”</p>
<p>“Haha…no matter the world, there are always idiots that are only good at holding you back…someone leaked that Luxuria is one of the Deadly Sins devils…”</p>
<p>The likely culprit had already been identified. With the approaching risk of a Deadly Sins devil, Avaritia, it was nothing short of a disaster that the institute was found to be harboring another devil.</p>
<p>Even if she had no hostile intentions, many would definitely express extreme reactions to her strength and abilities.</p>
<p>“I had introduced her as someone I personally picked, which became a problem too.”</p>
<p>“Well yeah, with a high level devil in the school, I can see that…”</p>
<p>The reason why the kingdom had not simply sent someone to exterminate the ‘threat’ was to avoid instigating Luxuria, for fear that she went on a rampage in the kingdom, and that Hilamee said that Luxuria was working seriously in the institute and offered to collaborate against the Greed devil, so they could make use of it.</p>
<p>“Will she really cooperate? Is she really not hostile?…they also want to confirm other things. Luxuria being a devil, however, is a huge minus: more than half of the commission members are in favor of her being disposed of. The member with most authority is the very person who caused this problem too…I’m afraid there won’t be much of an ‘investigation’.”</p>
<p>The final verdict didn’t depend on one vote per member, apparently: votes depended on the member’s rank and title. This time, the commission members with most voting rights were in the “exterminate Luxuria” faction. Hilamee added that if things continued like this, the result would definitely be negative.</p>
<p>“One person has multiple votes and the quantity is different per member? Seriously?”</p>
<p>“It’s a relic of the age when the upper class had more privileges…from the reign of the former king, many rules have been revolutionized, and the situation has been improving under the current king though.”</p>
<p>The nobles still held onto the concept of being ‘chosen’, which blocked certain rules from being changed and created the current snag.</p>
<p>“The king is a prudent person, so he would never approve of sending an extermination party right away. Luxuria never caused any problems until now after all. She has been working with the technology development department too, which has helped create products appreciated by the people.”</p>
<p>“Well yeah, I suppose we should be glad that they didn’t go “monsters shall perish!!” right away…but if the commission judges her to be evil, then it’s the same, right? Is there any way we can unequivocally prove that Luxuria is an ally?”</p>
<p>“I tried thinking about it, but…”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s sour expression showed that she hadn’t come up with any useful proposals.</p>
<p>“Do commission members ever change?”</p>
<p>“They all have membership terms, but usually they never change. Unless they cause a scandal, at least. Which we don’t have any evidence of…”</p>
<p>Apparently they had already tried to get commission members disqualified.</p>
<p>“Another possibility I thought of was a direct order from the king…but that brings its share of problems too.”</p>
<p>“If the king ordered a collaboration with a devil, there would be a massive backlash. The current stance is to use Luxuria for defense, if possible, so it’s still okay, but…”</p>
<p>When Luxuria was exposed as a devil, Hilamee related all she knew about Avaritia too.</p>
<p>Luxuria is a level 700 devil. The fact that an even stronger devil was coming to attack kept those who wanted Luxuria exterminated in check, since she could be an effective countermeasure.</p>
<p>From the training dungeon events, it was clear that Avaritia used monsters to do his bidding.</p>
<p>There are plenty of monsters stronger than people. Once the enemy side was ready in terms of both quality and quantity, Erkunt would definitely fall. The kingdom was probably thinking that the best outcome was for the devils to take each other down.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, nothing I could say would have any effect…”</p>
<p>“They know you have skills that affect mental states after all.”</p>
<p>Mental skills are very dangerous, so it was widely known which monsters could use them. Devils were some of the most infamous examples.</p>
<p>Luxuria was capable of charming others, regardless of gender, so people could fall under her control without realizing anything. If she even just spoke, some would suspect that she was trying to charm them, so just making conversation was difficult.</p>
<p>“If Luxuria is deemed dangerous, Hilamee’s position is at risk too, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“If they accuse me of concealing a devil, well, there’s nothing I can say in return. Devils are enemies of the people, normally. I think Luxuria poses no problems though. After talking with her, I can say this with confidence.”</p>
<p>“Oh my. You might have been charmed without your knowledge, you know?”</p>
<p>Luxuria poked fun at Hilamee’s assertion, but the latter did not change expression and continued.</p>
<p>“We have been taking care of the students together for 3 years after all. Thinking about her level and stats, I was scared before, but since I knew how the devils used to be, that couldn’t be helped. If I faced her honestly earlier, I might have understood that she was no threat earlier too.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if I could have managed that though…concluded Hilamee with a chuckle.</p>
<p>If there was only her life at stake, Hilamee would have done it, or so Shin thought. In the former world too, she had sacrificed her life for others after all.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I surrender. What devil has ever seen such a smile?”</p>
<p>Luxuria looked away, to escape Hilamee’s gaze. Her side profile, after the childish gesture, showed some blushing. Yes, apparently even devils can blush.</p>
<p>“If the Avaritia business hadn’t happened, everything would have gone smoothly…”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Luxuria was a bit different than the usual, but she did not seem to be acting. Schnee agreed with Shin’s opinion and nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>“Hey! Why are you looking at me like you’re watching an emotional scene?? Don’t forget that I’m a devil!!”</p>
<p>“You acted like the cool beauty type, while you’re in fact more of a cute type? As expected of lust, truly.”</p>
<p>“What are you even talking about!?!”</p>
<p>It was rare to see Luxuria flustered. It took a few more minutes before Hilamee’s enthusiasm calmed down.</p>
<p>“So, how should we prove that Luxuria isn’t dangerous…”</p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t stop her from making fun of me, and force your way back to the main topic, I see.”</p>
<p>“…about that, I thought…”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t ignore me!! You could have done something, you know!! Listen to me or I’ll attack you! Sexually!”</p>
<p>Luxuria continued her protest, with a flustered voice that didn’t fit her former image at all. She wasn’t used to be made fun of, so she was apparently quite stressed.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see each other often from now on too, don’t get all huffed over something like this, come on.”</p>
<p>“But things like that give me goosebumps…”</p>
<p>Luxuria knit her brows, still blushing a little, and held her body tight. Her well-developed breasts were pushed up as a result, pushing visibly against the sweater.</p>
<p>“Kh, look at her, so sexy even when she’s embarrassed…I guess I just don’t have enough volume…”</p>
<p>“It’s impressive how you can think of things like that at a time like this…”</p>
<p>Hilamee spoke while looking at her own chest, and Luxuria sighed in response.</p>
<p>“When you’re in a pinch mentally, it’s hard to come up with good ideas. We don’t really have much leeway anymore.”</p>
<p>Hilamee said that she made fun of Luxuria and stared at her chest like that just to relieve her spirits a bit. Though, it could have had the opposite effect and push her back against the wall even more.</p>
<p>“So, can I go back to the topic?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>“Like I said before, about the way to prove that Luxuria isn’t a threat…I mentioned that we could say that I’m from a clan of devil hunters, right? What if we used that?”</p>
<p>Shin then explained his proposal. Hilamee concluded that it was better than her plan, pointed out some points to improve it, and then they agreed to use it.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 1 – Part 2</p>
<p>After a few days, Shin and Schnee (disguised as Yuki) joined Hilamee’s group and entered the royal castle.</p>
<p>Inquiries were usually held in a special underground chamber, but this time it would be done in a special hall for the exclusive use of people above a certain rank. They wondered if it was okay to let a devil inside the castle, but concluded that there was no other way to hold the inquiry.</p>
<p>Normally, Shin and Schnee did not have the right to participate in the inquiry, but Hilamee insisted that they had an important role in the matter, so special permission was granted. Only Shin was allowed inside, however, so Schnee would have to wait outside the inquiry room.</p>
<p>“They’re pretty spooked, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>Shin whispered while looking at the soldiers surrounding them, as they followed the soldier leading them to the hall.</p>
<p>“Obvious, isn’t it? No matter their number or how well equipped they are, I can turn them into mincemeat with a flick of my wrist. Yet they have to accompany me…working in the castle can be rather harsh indeed.”</p>
<p>“It would be enough to just have someone guide us there then. There would be just more casualties this way.”</p>
<p>“They have to save face, I guess?”</p>
<p>“You two, walk quietly. They can hear you.”</p>
<p>Shin and Luxuria were whispering, but the corridors were so quiet that footsteps could be clearly heard, so there was no way their conversation was unheard.</p>
<p>After Hilamee’s rebuke they looked forward again and found the soldiers with a stiff expression and complexion so pale they seemed anemic.</p>
<p>Usually, at least a couple soldiers would be smitten with Schnee, but this time none of them acted as if they were, they sternly looked ahead. They probably heard what Shin and Luxuria said, but there was no response. They possibly felt that if they said anything they risked turning into a target.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better if they learn that it’s possible to hold normal conversations with me?”</p>
<p>“That might be true, but…don’t scare them for nothing, okay?”</p>
<p>“Do not fret, I will never oppose my ‘master’.”</p>
<p>Luxuria then flashed a chilling smile, which she regarded as more “devil-like”.</p>
<p>She had just changed the way she smiled: she was wearing her usual sweater, tight skirt, and white coat, just like she did in the institute.</p>
<p>The major difference was the large black collar around her neck: the collar, one cemel wide, looked just like the 『Submission Collar』 used by the church in the holy woman kidnapping incident.</p>
<p> It only shared the appearance with it, however: what Luxuria wore was just that, a collar made of metal. It did not have any special effects and she could crush it with one hand if she wanted.</p>
<p>“This way, please enter.”</p>
<p>Guided by the guard’s stern voice, Shin and the others entered a room. The inquiry hall was larger than Shin expected, with the location for the inquiry subject to stand on at the center.</p>
<p>On higher seats all around this subject stand sat the commission members.</p>
<p>The member seats were placed along the round walls. At their center sat a fairly obese man in his forties and a man in his sixties with white hair slicked back, on seats higher than the other members. They directly faced the subject stand, so they were probably the members who would lead the inquiry. Their appearance was, respectively, of a typical noble used to a life of luxury, glittering with jewels, and the latter of an “old-fashioned” noble that conveyed a strong sense of authority.</p>
<p>As Shin expected, Luxuria and Hilamee were invited to go to the center. Shin could simply stand behind them.</p>
<p>“We shall now commence the inquiry of lady Hilamee Hirasato and lady Luxuria.”</p>
<p>The old noble announced the beginning of the inquiry. His low voice echoed in the hall.</p>
<p>“Presently, Ms. Hilamee is suspected of inviting the devil of lust, one of the Deadly Sin devils and personification of misfortune, into our kingdom, and concealing it for a long period. There is also the suspicion of trying to beckon the devil of greed into our kingdom.”</p>
<p>The old noble glared at the two women as he spoke in a frank tone.</p>
<p>“Sir Zear. Suspicions, you say? Are those not undeniable facts?”</p>
<p>The old noble, called Zear, was interrupted by the obese noble sitting next to him.</p>
<p>“Sir Cobal. Refrain from personal comments during the inquiry. These suspicions have not yet been confirmed as facts.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for inquiries. If that woman truly is a deadly sin devil, we are already under her influence.”</p>
<p>“That is not for you to decide, sir.”</p>
<p>Cobal was trying to hasten the resolution, ignoring Hilamee and Luxuria, but Zear did not budge. Shin quickly realized that Cobal was an enemy.</p>
<p>After a while the inquiry started again: the first point of discussion was Luxuria.</p>
<p>“We have been informed that you, lady Luxuria, oppose the greed devil and would cooperate to defeat it, is that true?”</p>
<p>“Sir Zear!? You cannot speak with a devil, your mind will fall under her control!”</p>
<p>“Do not worry, such a thing will not happen. She is already under someone else’s control.”</p>
<p>“Whatever do you mean?”</p>
<p>Zear stopped Cobal’s panic with a gesture, then looked at Hilamee.</p>
<p>“The collar around her neck limits her actions and forbids her from using mental skills or to harm people.”</p>
<p>“A devil, a monster capable of obliterating entire countries, is under someone’s control? Utterly ridiculous!”</p>
<p>“It is true, however. The adventurer standing behind her is her current master.”</p>
<p>The entire commission’s eyes turned towards Shin.</p>
<p>“I am indeed that adventurer. My name is Shin.”</p>
<p>“The weapon you carry…is that the rumored Slashing Hammer’s…?”</p>
<p>“I have been called that, yes.”</p>

<p>Shin made it a point to visibly equip 『Kakura』, as he thought that if his name was heard along with it, people would recognize him from the rumors. If no one did, he planned to introduce himself as “Shin the Slashing Hammer”.</p>
<p>“The newcomer who distinguished himself in the Balmel battle and reached rank A in one fell swoop, is it? Is what lady Hilamee said true? Is this devil really under your control?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am the descendant of a clan which earned its living hunting devils. I believe I am more knowledgeable than most about devils.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any proof? You could be under her spell yourself, could you not?”</p>
<p>Zear did not blindly believe Hilamee’s words and asked Shin to prove his words.</p>
<p>“A fair suspicion. But, as a member of a clan that thrives upon hunting devils, do you not think that I would prepare fitting countermeasures?”</p>
<p>“You probably would. Yet the devil in question is one of the Deadly Sins, a being on a whole different level than average monsters. Naturally, the power they wield is on a different plane as well. I do not think it bizarre for us to be concerned about that.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, you are right. As you are probably already aware, I am a Chosen One. I, as well as my clan, possess strong defenses against mental skills. This item further increases such defenses. In our past battles against Deadly Sins devils, no one has ever been controlled. Furthermore, while I may sound arrogant, my fighting abilities are said to exceed my ancestors: I am positive that I will never be controlled.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>The item described as increasing defenses against manipulation is the 『Age of Gods Earring』 Shin had equipped. Not only did it raise such defenses, but it neutralized these attacks unless the opponent was incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>Zear’s eyes narrowed as he scrutinized Shin to determine whether he spoke the truth or not, but Shin returned his gaze calmly.</p>
<p>The neutralization of mental skills was a huge advantage against devils: when fighting against them, the greatest danger was having your allies turn against you.</p>
<p>“Why would the descendant of a devil-hunting clan appear with such convenient timing? I have never even heard of the existence of such a clan. Have you made it all up to dodge our questioning?”</p>
<p>When Zear finished speaking, Cobal intervened. His doubts were surprisingly pertinent, considering how he had one-sidedly treated Hilamee as a criminal.</p>
<p>“I am always on the hunt for devils, so it is only natural for me to be in places where devils are or that devils target. I have only come here because I detected the Greed devil’s movements in the area. The existence of my clan is normally kept hidden, to prevent our enemies from finding us and giving unnecessary worries to the general population. Whenever we appear, a devil is nearby: this fact can give security, but also fear, a perfect gap for devils to strike.”</p>
<p>“If so, how come that devil is under your control? Could it be that you are in fact behind all this? If you can control devils, it would be easy to use them to increase your fame and reputation.”</p>
<p>“Among adventurers there are Tamers, who train monsters to fight alongside them. In a way, devils are a type of monster too, thus they too can be tamed. Normally they are not this docile, however: the most one can expect is to prevent them from going wild. This technique was originally used to prevent them from causing damage to their surroundings, or to keep such damage at a minimum. The fact that it is possible to talk normally with the devil proves that it obeys me from the heart. Using devils for our own personal gains is one of my clan’s greatest taboos. Allow me to clearly state that it is simply unthinkable.”</p>
<p>During the game era taming Deadly Sins devils was not possible. In this world, however, the rules set by the game were more lax. That was why it was also possible for Tiera to form a contract with a divine beast such as Kagerou. Following this train of logic, it was impossible to deny that Deadly Sins devils could be tamed, even if it was not possible before.</p>
<p>The suspicion of controlling devils for personal purposes too hit the mark, however, so Shin added that if the control was ever broken, the user would die.</p>
<p>“This condition was set to prevent the presence of traitors within the clan. Not even Chosen Ones can undo it. If one of us ever fell under control, this condition would activate.”</p>
<p>“Considering who your enemies are, you are in need of such countermeasures, I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes. If a hunter of devils turned evil themselves, the potential damage would be much greater than just a devil’s rampage.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed with Zear’s comment. He had discussed beforehand with Hilamee and Luxuria about the questions that might arise, so he never fumbled his answers.</p>
<p>“Devils can be subjugated. I still find it hard to believe, but if it is true, it will be an effective countermeasure against the Greed devil. Let me confirm once again, that devil cannot use mental skills now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>“If so, answer the first question we asked, lady.”</p>
<p>“My, how surprising. You believe the words of a man, coming from outside your country, from who knows where?”</p>
<p>“We have gathered our own information. I already knew that you haven’t created any casualties around you.”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s involvement and the training dungeon events were already known too.</p>
<p>Even so, speaking directly to a devil required a healthy dose of courage. Cobal and the other members silently witnessed the exchange, with stiff expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“My, I see. I had heard you were the military type, but I suppose this much must be expected from a duke.”</p>
<p>“Information gathering is vital for fighting as well. I am sure an accomplished researcher such as yourself knows that well.”</p>
<p>Zear responded to Luxuria’s grin with a smile himself. The exchange seemed peaceful, but Shin could tell that both of them were being extremely cautious.</p>
<p>“I know that much, yes. Allow me to answer, then. Greed’s objective is to absorb me, thus nearing a complete form. I am not interested in the slightest, however. You might scoff at a devil saying something like this, but I quite enjoy my current life. Greed will never be satisfied by such an answer however, and will do whatever it takes to reach his goal. I too want him to disappear. In such a case, working together would be more effective.”</p>
<p>“A devil wants to kill its brethren? O sir Zear, have I fallen prey to her spell already?</p>
<p>“Compose yourself, sir Cobal. It appears that she is not lying.”</p>
<p>Zear rebuked the agitated Cobal. It seemed clear that Zear did not doubt Luxuria’s words.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you believe a devil’s words so easily?”</p>
<p>“I am not so foolish as to believe a devil’s words so quickly. Yet, as lady Hilamee and sir Shin stated, I understand that you are not using skills while you talk to us. Besides—”</p>
<p>Zear paused for a moment and looked at Shin.</p>
<p>“With an ally much more threatening than a devil, we can be at ease too.”</p>
<p>Zear’s words and look showed that he understood that Shin was more powerful than Luxuria.</p>
<p>Maybe because of the people standing outside, Shin considered the Chosen One aura emanating from outside the room as he tried to dispel his restlessness. Hoping that it didn’t show on his face, he firmly returned Zear’s look.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see it is time to draw a conclusion. Shall we have lady Luxuria exterminated, or use her? Raise your hand to vote for extermination, do not move to vote for using her.”</p>
<p>Zear looked at his surroundings, then spoke. He probably chose the term “use” because putting it as cooperation would not sit well with some members.</p>
<p>The other members’ reactions were varied: some seemed calm, some smiled, some looked sour, others were agitated. It did not seem that they would reach total consensus. No one raised their hands, however.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all members voted for using Luxuria.</p>
<p>“Thus we declare lady Luxuria as one of the countermeasures against Greed. Lady Hilamee’s judgment will be decided at a later date, depending on lady Luxuria’s achievements. Dismissed.”</p>
<p>Zear declared the conclusion of the inquiry and all members shuffled out of the room from the doors at the sides.</p>
<p>Ultimately only Shin, Hilamee, and Luxuria remained: the soldier who guided them in then motioned at them to exit through the door they used to come in.</p>
<p>“—good work out there.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin was a bit confused in his reply to Schnee’s words. He didn’t say it because of the soldiers’ presence, but while the end result was positive, the inquiry was very different from what he expected.</p>
<p>The inquiry was almost completely Zear’s one-man show, and the extermination faction, which Hilamee was concerned about, did not protest at all. Cobal, who was probably the faction’s major member, only asked obvious questions, excluding his very first comment. It felt silly to worry so much.</p>
<p>“Hm? Aren’t we going in the wrong direction?”</p>
<p>Shin was reflecting on the inquiry, wondering if there wasn’t anything strange. After a while, he realized that the soldier was leading them towards the back of the castle.</p>
<p>“No, this is the right direction. A certain person is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, ‘a certain person’, really…”</p>
<p>“I think it’s better to stay quiet for now…”</p>
<p>Not even Hilamee seemed to know who was waiting. If they caused a commotion here and the inquiry’s conclusion was reversed it would be a big problem, so Shin’s group simply followed the soldier.</p>
<p>Even if the extermination faction waited for them to lower their guards to take care of them all together, Shin and the others could repel their ambush.</p>
<p>However, despite their suspicions, Shin’s group was led to a room that did not seem to have any traps. They found a gorgeous sofa and table, so they inferred that it was a room used to welcome guests.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>Waiting for them inside the room was Zear. He looked the same as he did during the commission, an aged gentleman, but he now carried a stick in his right hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you for leading our guests here. You may leave.”</p>
<p>Zear had the soldier leave, then turned towards Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“First, let me apologize for summoning you here without warning. I had to talk to you at any cost.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, it’s no problem, but…”</p>
<p>Shin hit Hilamee with his elbow to prompt her to reply. The group’s leader was supposed to be her.</p>
<p>“Do you have any doubts concerning the inquiry commission?”</p>
<p>“…well, yes, To be honest, we expected that we would have to argue more.”</p>
<p>“The extermination faction, yes? I understand their point myself. I understand distrusting lady Luxuria. However, there would be no point in working quietly for three years, as she did. Her abilities allow her to easily control others after all. Even if we chose to exterminate her, very few could stand up to her. The elite warriors of our country could possibly match her in battle, but how many casualties would that cause? It would also create a gap for Greed to strike through. Both in terms of fighting power and strategy, needless fighting would be a very poor move on our part.”</p>
<p>The extermination faction was eerily quiet because work had been done before the inquiry apparently. Hilamee had been unaware of this previous effort as things had been done in secret.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we had sir Cobal infiltrate the extermination faction, but he is on our side.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>As far as rank was concerned, both Zear and Cobal were dukes. On the surface, however, Zear appeared to be of a slightly higher rank.</p>
<p>“Is it alright to tell us something so important?”</p>
<p>“I thought it wiser not to keep secrets from you. That talk about being the descendant of a clan of devil hunters was a lie, yes?”</p>
<p>Zear answered Shin’s question with a question of his own, a sharp look on his face. His eyes showed that he was confident that he spoke the truth, or so Shin felt.</p>
<p>Shin glanced at Hilamee, who had perceived the same thing and nodded at Shin.</p>
<p>“…indeed. It is true that I…no, I will drop all pretenses now. I’m not a member of devil hunting clans or anything of the sort. It’s true, however, that if Luxuria ever went wild, I could dispose of her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have heard of your strength. We have done our own research. Today I have seen you with my own eyes, so I am completely sure. To shake after just looking at someone…didn’t happen to me since I met sir Shibaid, who used to serve a High Human.”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyebrows rose slightly at the unexpected mention of a familiar name.</p>
<p>Zear’s level was 255. It wasn’t clear if he was a Chosen One or a normal person, but to raise one’s level to the limits couldn’t have been easy. Zear accomplished it, however, so he had to be much more than just the old noble he looked like. Shin had also realized that the stick he held concealed a blade inside.</p>
<p>“Strength varies greatly, even amongst Chosen Ones. Those called former players, thanks to their knowledge, often win even against opponents with similar stats. Could you be one too, like sir Masakado and Lady Hilamee?”</p>
<p>“You know of players, sir?”</p>
<p>“In my youth, I did my share of traveling. Thanks to that, I learned much more than I would have if I stayed inside the country.”</p>
<p>Former players. Hilamee was the first to react to Zear’s words. They weren’t exactly secret words, so it wasn’t too difficult to imagine that a noble’s information network could pick them up. Many former players successfully used the knowledge they acquired in the game era after all.</p>
<p>“What if I was?”</p>
<p>Hilamee’s reaction outed Shin as a former player. Shin thus asked Zear the reason behind his question.</p>
<p>“Some former players do not disclose all the information they possess, to avoid being known as such. Our country, however, is currently in a difficult situation. You all could probably deal with Greed…but as you have probably heard, the monsters spawning in the surroundings have changed. Reports say that powerful monsters are increasing. Greed can enslave monsters, yes? If such monsters attack us in groups, would we be able to beat them back? Even if we did, how many casualties would there be? There are few Chosen Ones in our country. We are not always subject to such danger, unlike Balmel, so our soldiers are one or two ranks lower than other countries’.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard from Hilamee that Erkunt’s armed forces were of a decent level, considering the country’s size, but that was just because there were no hostile countries nearby and the monsters in the surroundings were relatively weak. They were not powerful enough to deal with calamities such as Greed.</p>
<p>Masakado was temporarily absent too because he had gone to exterminate a monster that normal adventurers couldn’t handle, as Hilamee had confirmed.</p>
<p>“I wish for your assistance, for the sake of our country, for the sake of our people.”</p>
<p>Zear then bowed his head.</p>
<p>For a duke to lower his head before a mere adventurer -ranked A, but without any title- was unfathomable in noble society. Shin knew that much too.</p>
<p>The assistance of Shin and his party was indispensable. Zear had enough information to understand that. At the same time, the dangers and risk of threatening the country were enough to make him lower his head without hesitation.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of just leaving like this either, as I plan to destroy Greed. Ah, let me tell you in advance, the drop items will be ours, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hah, you speak as if victory was certain. Considering lady Luxuria’s obedience, I suppose that you have that much in you.”</p>
<p>Shin expected to be told that it was too early to say that, but unexpectedly Zear just showed a wry smile. He surely knew that Luxuria was a devil, but since the commission he kept referring to her as “lady”.</p>
<p>“It might be strange for me to say, but in a bout between Greed and my master, my master has little chance of losing. As a devil, I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>“I doubt I can finish him off without letting it cause any damage though. By the way, you don’t need to call me that anymore.”</p>
<p>They had decided that Luxuria would call Shin “master” to show that she was under his control. Now that he had dropped his facade as a devil hunter, there was no need to continue.</p>
<p>Luxuria did not change it, though.</p>
<p>“You men like this kind of thing, don’t you? Would you like me to serve you more?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the right time. At all.”</p>
<p>Luxuria peeked closer to Shin’s face, and he answered by covering her face with his hand.</p>
<p>“Hmm, truly different from the devils spoken of in legends.”</p>
<p>“We just acted on instinct then, just like animals. At present, we possess enough intellect to rival people like you. That is why we can co-exist. Because of such intellect, however, we can also use methods other than brute force.”</p>
<p>Sending cohorts to Luxuria, releasing monsters in the dungeon. Such things didn’t happen in the game era.</p>
<p>“So even among people, some are fascinated by devils and decide to cooperate with them…”</p>
<p>“I believe it is already happening. Greed stimulates people’s desires, so merchants are the most prone, for example. Even if we devils don’t do anything, people act on their desires already, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“It pains me that I cannot deny that. No matter the era, money and power corrupt minds.”</p>
<p>Zear probably had someone on his mind, as his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in being negative, let’s talk about what to do next instead. Ah, but I need to say something first.”</p>
<p>“What would that be?”</p>
<p>“Luxuria can surely be an asset in battle, but I do not recommend having her fight directly against Greed. When a Deadly Sin devil defeats another, the winner absorbs the loser and grows. This includes Luxuria too. I don’t think it’s too likely, but our enemy is a devil, he could use tactics we don’t expect. So I propose Luxuria acts as bait, then when Greed makes his appearance she should focus on defending.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see. If lady Luxuria grows too strong, after this commotion settles other problems might arise, is that it?”</p>
<p>“If I draw in Greed’s power, my personality might end up changing. We definitely have bad affinity. So I’d appreciate it if someone else delivered the final blow.”</p>
<p>Luxuria talked while her shoulders dropped. Her current self probably had bad affinity with aggressive devils.</p>
<p>“Let us hear judgment on this issue too then.”</p>
<p>Zear then looked towards a corner of the room, though there was nothing but the wall there.</p>
<p>Shin, however, could see the silhouette of people standing beyond the wall.</p>
<p>A man wearing luxurious clothing and a crown, the very picture of a king, and a very young boy. With them there were also three men and one woman, all wearing armor.</p>
<p>—–Fagall Ent Level 213 Holy Knight</p>
<p>—–Sherlene Ragass Level 238 Holy Knight</p>
<p>Among the armored silhouettes, Shin was particularly interested in these two. The youngest among the male knights and the only woman. The young man was called Fagall, the woman Sherlene.</p>
<p>Fagall was approximately 170 cemel tall. He had well kept blonde hair and blue eyes brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>Sherlene, on the other hand, was a bit taller than Fagall, with hair kept neatly too, tied in a side ponytail.</p>
<p>Her features were handsome, her stance upright. If she wasn’t wearing armor, one would think she was a model. Her sharp look made her seem cold, but, unlike the slightly nervous Fagall, she did not look too tense.</p>
<p>The wall slid open, letting the group waiting beyond it inside. Fagall and Sherlene stood on each side of the person who looked like a king, ready to protect him and the prince-like boy if needed.</p>
<p>“I am the king of the Erkunt kingdom, Kreunzeit Fow Erkunt. I have listened to your conversation from the other room. I too shall take part in it from now.”</p>
<p>Just as Shin guessed, the crowned man was the king of Erkunt. He was blonde with blue eyes, rather slender but with a fierce look in his eyes.</p>
<p>The boy next to him, the prince, took a glance at Schnee after entering the room and was half mesmerized. Even after Shin and the others were introduced, his eyes were glued on Schnee. When Zear called to him, he returned to his senses and introduced himself.</p>
<p>“My name is Hawgilear Fow Erkunt. I am still young, but please allow me to join as well.”</p>
<p>“Allow me to speak as the representative of our group. My name is Hilamee Hirasato. We offer our humble strength and abilities to His Majesty the King.”</p>
<p>The king nodded in response to Hilamee’s greeting, but prince Hawgilear was still looking at Schnee.</p>
<p>Zear introduced the other members of the king’s party, but among the armored knights, only Fagall and Sherlene were introduced: the other two remained unnamed. Despite having entered the room with the rest of the group, they remained standing against the wall.</p>
<p>Zear, instead, mentioned more interesting information: Fagall and Shirlene possessed the title of “Hero”.</p>
<p>“Hero”, the title possessed also by Eline, who had kidnapped the orphan Millie and try to offer her as sacrifice. The title itself had no negative connotation, but because of that past experience, Shin did not see it in a positive light.</p>
<p>“So you are the lust devil. I see, other than your obvious beauty, you possess a certain sensual charm. You could surely make men do your bidding, even without using any skill.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you certainly know your way with the compliments. Might you be interested in putting me to the test?”</p>
<p>While Shin was trying to make sense of the situation, the conversation quickly took a problematic turn. King Kreunzeit, however, plainly refused Luxuria’s proposal.</p>
<p>“Very charming proposal, but I’m afraid I shall decline. The queen would be jealous.”</p>
<p>Zear and Sherlene visibly winced at the king and devil’s far too casual exchange. Shin shared their sentiments too.</p>
<p>“Luxuria, let’s be serious now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the much rumored king can sure recognize such a joke.”</p>
<p>“I must say those rumors are intriguing…but I believe this is no time for jest. How do you plan to oppose the Greed devil?”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit smoothly entered the conversation. His previous casual manners disappeared, as a strong aura of authority filled the room.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the pressure or killing intent emanated when fighting, but the sort of aura that made you want to kneel in reverence.</p>
<p>“Luxuria can detect Greed himself, so if he ever comes closer we’ll be able to tell. I have supplied her with tools to contact me as soon as she detects his presence. Until he makes a move, Yuki and I will inspect Erkunt’s surroundings. The spawning monsters are clearly different than normal, so there must be something triggering them; we will find that something and destroy it, to reduce Greed’s pawns as much as possible, thus also limiting potential damage and casualties.”</p>
<p>“What about the castle? I hear that the devil has allies among the people.”</p>
<p>“That falls upon the soldiers’ shoulders, I’m afraid. If they are not manipulated, but collaborating with the devil with their own free will, it would be difficult for us newcomers in Erkunt to detect any unnatural behaviour.”</p>
<p>Not even Shin could do everything by himself. Monsters were easy and just needed to be defeated, but with people things were not so cut and dry. One wrong step and Shin himself could end up becoming a criminal.</p>
<p>“Indeed, you are correct. This is our country, I would not be worthy of the title of king if I entrusted everything to an outsider. Sir Zear, I leave the castle issue to you.”</p>
<p>“We will move on our own as a mobile unit of sorts. Even if we joined the army, it would just be more difficult to move together.”</p>
<p>“That is inevitable. There is too much of a gap between the Chosen Ones and regular individuals.”</p>
<p>Things were proceeding much more smoothly than Shin had imagined.</p>
<p>Having Chosen Ones act only among themselves was a basic tactic: this happened in every country, to avoid normal soldiers to get involved in battles between Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>Once they learned that Greed was coming, the army started patrolling the areas surrounding the kingdom with increased frequency and also started specialized training. They planned to focus on buying time, leaving the extermination of the enemy to the heroes.</p>
<p>The strategy itself would not change greatly, excluding the added manpower of Shin and Schnee. There was thus no need for detailed strategy meetings.</p>
<p>After they decided how to communicate and Shin provided all necessary items, the meeting seemed to be over: just then, one of the knights standing near the wall whispered something in Zear’s ear.</p>
<p>Zear nodded and said to let the person through.</p>
<p>“Who is coming?”</p>
<p>“The captain of the royal knights, who I had asked to keep our useless nobles occupied. He is a loyal retainer who has fought side by side with His Majesty. He does not possess any titles, but his prowess in battle surpasses even heroes.”</p>
<p>“That is quite impressive.”</p>
<p>Shin was really impressed with the forces that the kingdom could muster. Two heroes would be more than enough for the surrounding countries to be wary of them, but they were hiding an even greater trump card.</p>
<p>As Erkunt housed the institute, the presence of strong Chosen Ones was apparently more of a source of relief than concern.</p>
<p>The door that King Kreunzeit’s party had used opened again, letting a man clad in stocky lead-colored armor inside. His grey hair was tied behind his head, sleepy black eyes behind a pair of sharp glasses. As far as appearance was concerned, he was not very knight-like.</p>
<p>The scales growing like bags under his eyes especially gave an eerie impression.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. These are the people in question?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they confidently stated that they can hunt down the devil. Quite reliable fellows, let me introduce you to them. This man is Namsaar Argain. He might appear somber, but I assure you that he is very capable.”</p>
<p>“I know I look like that, but there was no need to point it out. More importantly, I know that the heroes and sir Zear are here too, but to personally appear before a devil? What were you thinking, king?”</p>
<p>Namsaar spoke without an inch of restraint to king Kreunzeit. His expression suggested that what he really wanted to say would have been “what the hell, man?”</p>
<p>His eyes looking at Shin’s group were filled with suspicion.</p>
<p>“A clan of devil hunters, huh? Never have I heard of such people. I’m relieved that, at the very least, it doesn’t look like he’s being charmed.”</p>
<p>“Sir Argain, the heroes are here too. Could you have some trust?”</p>
<p>“I do. But as leader of the royal guards, it is quite troublesome not to be present since the beginning in cases such as this. No one knows when something unexpected might happen.”</p>
<p>Namsaar was looking towards Luxuria. It wasn’t clear if he knew that she was supposed to be under Shin’s control, but he was very wary of her.</p>
<p>“Let us talk about that later. We have to discuss our countermeasures against Greed first.”</p>
<p>Zear would fill Namsaar in at a different time. When he heard that the general strategy would not change much and Shin’s group would move independently as a mobile unit, Namsaar gave a small nod.</p>
<p>“I see, there is no need for me to say anything then. Having adventurers join the army all of a sudden would just make it more difficult to move as groups. What concerns me is whether these people can actually be useful or not.”</p>
<p>The final sentence completely changed the room’s atmosphere. Hilamee glared at Namsaar, while Luxuria seemed impressed by his boldness.</p>
<p>Shin, on the other hand, agreed that such a concern would be natural. Even if Namsaar knew about Shin’s achievements, defeating large quantities of monsters in Balmel, a Deadly Sin devil was a vastly superior opponent.</p>
<p>Namsaar seemed to respect Shin for the fact that Luxuria really wasn’t using mental skills and they could talk normally, but he apparently viewed Shin’s actual battle prowess as another matter entirely.</p>
<p>In such a situation, only Schnee had the same expression as before.</p>
<p>(Uh oh, she’s getting irritated…)</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit and his party, Hilamee, Luxuria, no one seemed to have noticed, but Shin could tell that Schnee’s mood was getting very sour very quickly.</p>
<p>Her atmosphere didn’t show it, nor did her expression, but Shin could clearly tell.</p>
<p>“Namsaar, try to choose your words carefully. Do you not feel anything?”</p>
<p>“I can tell that this man is capable, but only you and I, sir Zear, can. Many would not accept this.”</p>
<p>Namsaar replied to Zear’s warning without batting an eyelash. Shin could understand his argument, so he did not say anything in return.</p>
<p>“My apologies, sir Shin. This man is the leader of the royal guards, and as such does not view this matter too favorably.”</p>
<p>“No, it is difficult to believe that a single man can defeat a devil just like that, so I do not mind at all. It would be troublesome for us not to be trusted at all, however. Should I prove my actual prowess in some manner?”</p>
<p>“Let’s have you fight Fagall then.”</p>
<p>Shin expected Namsaar to say that he would confirm it personally, but he instead pointed at one of the heroes.</p>
<p>“Wait, why do I…why should I be the one to face sir Shin, captain? If you have doubts about his abilities, sir Namsaar, why not engage him yourself?”</p>
<p>“Are you not always complaining about how you don’t have enough chances to duel? If he really is as strong as he claims, he’ll be a worthy opponent. He might even easily crush you, I think?”</p>
<p>Fagall was about to complain, but Namsaar replied plainly. Probably irritated by the fact that he was expected to lose, Fagall flinched.</p>
<p>“I will lose, you say?”</p>
<p>“That’s just what I feel. To have some rootless wandering adventurer save our country in its time of need, to entrust the defeat of the devil to him…it might be inevitable, but as one of this country’s defenders, is it not pathetic? Do show sir Shin here the worth of our country’s heroes.”</p>
<p>Despite Namsaar’s long-winded speech, what he was ordering Fagall to do was to check just how strong Shin was.</p>
<p>“…ha…ha. Understood. Sir Shin, I apologize for the sudden request, but would you accept my challenge to a duel?”</p>
<p>Fagall sighed, then formally challenged Shin. His expression showed that he was apologetic, but also curious. It seemed to be true that he was not satisfied and frustrated with regular training. If Shin was indeed as strong as he said to be, he could fight to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>Namsaar probably chose Fagall also to let him release such frustrations.</p>
<p>“Yes, understood. Shall we do it right away?”</p>
<p>The discussion was pretty much over. What remained was meeting with soldiers and officers and giving them detailed instructions, so holding the duel then and there was not a problem.</p>
<p>“That’s alright with me, but—”</p>
<p>Fagall turned towards king Kreunzeit.</p>
<p>“That is quite all right. I too wished to witness his battle prowess. I authorize you to use the royal army’s training grounds. I expect a bout in grand style.”</p>
<p>“In grand style, your majesty?”</p>
<p>“Even if our heroes talk about you, sir Shin, there are those who might still not believe. If many soldiers actually witnessed you fight, however, they will have to believe. We have to have them learn that it is simply natural to entrust the important task of defeating the devil to you.”</p>
<p>“Very well, understood.”</p>
<p>Facing a devil would be the task of heroes, Erkunt’s most powerful warriors. Those who knew about devils would surely think so. Changing that required a very solid reason.</p>
<p>There were still those who did not know about Shin and his achievements. The duel was also necessary to convince them.</p>
<p>Looking at Namsaar’s attitude however, Shin could not help suspecting that he planned to make him stand out and, if all went well, use him as bait.</p>
<p>“I guess I have to do it in grand style then.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that there was no real need of hiding his true abilities anymore, as this whisper escaped his lips. It was already known far and wide how he had performed incredible feats, outside his control, so he gave up on holding back.</p>
<p>Shin followed the soldiers and king Kreunzeit’s group out of the room.</p>
<p>Hearing his mumbling, Hilamee was worried that the hero might die, but Shin did not notice it.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 1 – Part 4</p>
<p>Shin followed king Kreunzeit’s group to a training ground, a square area about 200 mels wide, where many soldiers were fighting with wooden swords and shields.</p>
<p>“Y-your Majesty!?”</p>
<p>The soldiers near the entrance reacted loudly when they saw the king. Upon hearing this, the other soldiers also stopped training and stood at attention.</p>
<p>“I must speak with whoever is in charge. Can someone go call them?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Your Majesty! Please wait a moment!”</p>
<p>“The others may resume training! Do not push yourself too hard, just because the king is watching!”</p>
<p>Fagall barked an order to the soldiers, who were still standing and saluting. Their training seemed much more intense than before, though.</p>
<p>“Hah, I wish they were always so enthusiastic… well, sir Shin. What shall we do about the weapons? Using our training wooden swords would make it difficult to duel, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“I will lend you the weapons we use for practice. Even if you swing them at full power, they barely cause any damage.”</p>
<p>“Something like that exists? May I take a look?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>Shin heard that Fagall’s main equipment were twin straight swords, so he gave him two of his 『Sponge Dagger』 weapons, which had shorter blades than the 『Sponge Blade』, similar to the weapons that Fagall used.</p>
<p>“Impressive…even if I focus my strength, there is no damage caused.”</p>
<p>Fagall tried swinging a 『Sponge Dagger』 on the training wall, but seeing that it wasn’t even scratched, he expressed his surprise.</p>
<p>“With these weapons, there is no risk of harming others, so there will be no effect on the upcoming battles. The non-lethal enchantment also affects magic: the blade part can deflect spells.”</p>
<p>“Impressive for being training weapons. To know we can go all out in this duel isn’t bad in the slightest.”</p>
<p>While talking, Fagall tried a few practice swings. His elegant, flowing form made him look as if he were dancing: his movements were clearly different than Chosen Ones who just relied on their physical attributes.</p>
<p>“We don’t have too much time, so you two should come here quickly.”</p>
<p>While Shin and Fagall spoke, Namsaar was explaining the situation to the person in charge of the training grounds.</p>
<p>The duel would be held in the center of the grounds: all soldiers could thus witness it, but considering the objective, that was an obvious result.</p>
<p>After learning that not only the king and the leader of the knights, but also the heroes were present, all the training soldiers’ attention was focused on them, expecting that something was going to start. The atmosphere was very different from the loud exchanges and shouting from moments before.</p>
<p>“Shin, I beg you, I implore you, please be careful!”</p>
<p>“What are you worrying about? We’ll use Sponge weapons, there’s no way he’ll be killed in one blow.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s you, after all…I bet you could do that even with a Sponge weapon…”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous, really. Even if I could, there’s no way I would.”</p>
<p>If he removed his limiters, it wouldn’t be impossible, Shin thought; however, the purpose of this duel was to display his strength, it was in no way a duel to the death.</p>
<p>Rather, if he ended up killing a hero, it would have a negative impact on both the battle against Greed and Shin’s own future activities.</p>
<p>“They’re talking like my defeat is inevitable, again.”</p>
<p>Shin, put off by Hilamee’s warning, heard Fagall’s mumble. He was just whispering, but Shin’s hearing could catch it.</p>
<p>Sherlene, maybe because she was speaking to a hero like herself, used a plain tone.</p>
<p>“It looks like they’re worried that he doesn’t go overboard, instead. Lady Hilamee should know how strong you are, Fagall: if she talks like that, Sir Shin must be just that strong. I can’t tell how powerful he is either. Why don’t you go ahead and give it everything you’ve got?”</p>
<p>Being underestimated wasn’t enough to lose one’s cool, but it surely wasn’t pleasant. This was what Fagall seemed to be thinking, so Sherlene gave him a piece of advice.</p>
<p>She didn’t speak openly, because of the presence of King Kreunzeit and Zear, but Sherlene was still wary of Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>Her instincts, honed through many battles, told her that Shin and his subordinate, Yuki, were truly strong. Luxuria, being a devil, was obviously powerful, but the power Sherlene felt was definitely different than Shin and Schnee’s.</p>
<p>“I’m planning on having him show the strength that supposedly surpasses even devils. With these weapons, I can go all out, after all. Sherlene, what do you think of sir Shin?”</p>
<p>“…I can’t tell. My instinct, however, is telling me to be more wary of him than of Lady Luxuria.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, they must be really skilled. I get the same feeling from both sir Shin and lady Yuki. While sir Shin leaks more magic power, I thought lady Yuki was more powerful.”</p>
<p>Shin’s magic power control had improved, but Schnee was still far above him in that aspect.</p>
<p>It all depended on experience, trial &amp; error, and time spent in training it, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of magic power and MP quantity, however, Shin was overwhelmingly superior, so his magic power was much more difficult to control than Schnee’s. If he had an average player’s MP quantity, Fagall would have probably seen them as equal.</p>
<p>“We do not have much time. Are you both ready?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“I am too.”</p>
<p>“Yuki, the barrier, please.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>The training soldiers were informed that the duel would soon start, so they retreated to a safe location. Before them, a blue semi-transparent wall appeared. The wall was generated along the training grounds’ own walls, leaving only Shin and Fagall inside.</p>
<p>“There will be no need to worry about stray spells like this.”</p>
<p>“God, I knew you weren’t ordinary people, but a barrier like this would require all of our specialists, and even then I’m not sure if they could manage it or not. With this, however, we could seal the devil in and fight it. Was it really alright to show it here?”</p>
<p>“Not a problem. Devils inherit the memories of past battles, so I think they know about it already. Barring escape routes with barriers is a common tactic, I’ve slain many of them with it.”</p>
<p>“I see, so it’s a strategy we are basically expected to use.”</p>
<p>There were monsters which tried to flee when they were at a disadvantage. Some devils belonged to this category too: players tried various methods to not let them flee, such as inflicting status ailments to limit their movements and block their escape routes with barriers.</p>
<p>Judging from what Luxuria said, she clearly remembered past events. Thus, it was easy to imagine that the devils would remember about such tactics too.</p>
<p>“If you know how they fight, I would appreciate it if you told me too. Could you spare some time later?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you have my cooperation.”</p>
<p>Shin and Fagall finished talking and headed to the center of the grounds. There was nothing else to do now: they both quietly created some distance between them and wielded their weapons.</p>
<p>Shin held one 『Sponge Blade』 in both hands, holding it vertically before himself.</p>
<p>Fagall had one 『Sponge Dagger』 in each hand, pointed down, with his left arm in front and right in the back.</p>
<p>“Begin!!”</p>
<p>Namsaar made sure they had taken their stances, then gave the signal to start.</p>
<p>As soon as he did, Shin quickly stepped in towards Fagall, quickly enough that an average person couldn’t follow. The Chosen One and hero Fagall, however, could react: he stepped backwards to avoid the 『Sponge Blade’s』 swing, then kicked the ground to go on the offensive.</p>
<p>Shin had paused one moment, then accelerated again. The 『Sponge Blade』 and 『Sponge Dagger』 clashed and were repelled.</p>
<p>Shin and Fagall did not fight against the impact and slid to the right, once again creating distance between each other. Their speed, however, did not reduce.</p>
<p>In the training grounds, those who managed to catch this lightning-quick exchange were only Schnee, Hilamee, Luxuria, Sherlene and Namsaar. Shin and his opponent’s movements were clear to them, but normal knights and soldiers couldn’t keep up with their speed.</p>
<p>Based on Fagall’s reaction speed and the feeling of their weapons clashing, Shin more or less grasped his stats. He had done it to figure out what kind of anti-devil gear to give him, so he did not need to know Fagall’s exact stats.</p>
<p>He blocked Fagall’s 『Sponge Dagger』, who had attempted another direct strike, and forcefully beat it back.</p>

<p>Shin was currently shackled by 【Limiter】 level 2. Fagall’s strength, even if boosted by the acceleration, wasn’t enough to break through Shin’s defense.</p>
<p>“As expected by someone who can wield a heavy weapon like that…I couldn’t push you back, huh.”</p>
<p>“It’s too early to say I’ve shown my power.”</p>
<p>Fagall’s attacks felt terribly light to Shin. His fighting style and speed were excellent, but he severely lacked in strength, or so Shin was about to conclude.</p>
<p>Fagall, however, was a Chosen One blessed by the Hero title. He had to be capable of more. Shin kept parrying Fagall’s attacks with his 『Sponge Blade』, one after another.</p>
<p>At first glance it looked like Fagall was unleashing a neverending barrage of attacks; his expression, however, was grim.</p>
<p>He wasn’t using his full power yet, but his weapons wouldn’t advance an inch. It wasn’t like Shin couldn’t move from his spot, he simply didn’t. They were fighting with only weapons, but Shin was still very much unfazed.</p>
<p>“So tough…I feel like I’m fighting against a block of Orichalcum.”</p>
<p>“I have to show what I can do, or people will interfere.”</p>
<p>“I see…I better make sure people don’t think I’m holding back, then!!”</p>
<p>As Fagall uttered these words, his body started glowing gold.</p>
<p>The light that completely enveloped his body was a clear sign of a physical boost due to his title and skills. Furthermore, Fagall’s weapons started emitting a black glow.</p>
<p>Based on his experiences of fighting one on one, Shin guessed that he had used a Darkness elemental combination skill.</p>
<p>“Here I go!”</p>
<p>The ground burst under Fagall’s feet. He ran around Shin with irregular patterns, much faster than before.</p>
<p>The darkness enveloping his blades left a trail: to the eyes of the spectators, it looked like golden and black lights flashed around Shin.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t move, waiting for Fagall’s next move. The latter feigned approaching him a few times, then moved behind Shin’s back and abruptly changed directions.</p>
<p>Fagall’s quick turn was almost a full 90 degrees, but Shin had predicted it and calmly reacted: He used his left leg as a pivot and turned, then blocked Fagall’s strike with his 『Sponge Blade』.</p>
<p>“Pretty heavy.”</p>
<p>The pressure on the 『Sponge Blade』 was much higher than Fagall’s previous attacks. Shin’s arm strength and 『Sponge Blade』 could easily withstand it, but the ground couldn’t.</p>
<p>In a 20 mel diameter around Shin, the ground was eroded and formed a vase-like shape.</p>
<p>The skill Fagall used, Sword/Darkness combination skill 【Gravity Edge】, was a skill that had its power halved when used upwards and doubled when used downwards.</p>
<p>To sway the opponent with speed and deliver a single powerful blow, compensating stat gaps through skills, was a nostalgic strategy for Shin.</p>
<p>Combining skills like 【Gravity Edge】, which increased in power under specific conditions, and physical boost was a tactic Shin often employed in his player days.</p>
<p>“Not even flinching…I don’t see what’s funny, though.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, it’s been a while since I last saw something like this, so I started enjoying it.”</p>
<p>Shin apologized to Fagall for unconsciously smiling. This duel served the purpose of showing his actual strength: it wouldn’t be proper to look like he was looking down on Fagall.</p>
<p>“It’s my turn, then.”</p>
<p>“Wha-!?”</p>
<p>Shin forcefully knocked away the 『Sponge Dagger』 pressuring him towards the ground. Usually they would slide over to the right or left, freed from the shackles of gravity, but, within the same movement, Shin also knocked Fagall away.</p>
<p>“What ridiculous power!!”</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment!”</p>
<p>Shin kicked the ground and leapt up.</p>
<p>Fagall recovered and was now standing on the edge of the vase-shaped area, where the ground hadn’t caved in. Shin had jumped diagonally over Fagall, as to leap over him.</p>
<p>“You went in midair yourself?”</p>
<p>The black glow enveloping Fagall’s weapons turned a red hue: Fagall swung his two daggers twice. Every time they drew an arc in the air, crescent-shaped flame slashes attacked Shin.</p>
<p>The number of slashes corresponded to the times the daggers were swung: it was the Sword/Flame combination skill 【Red Moon】.</p>
<p>Shin could have easily avoided it using the Movement-type skill 【Flying Shadow】. Fagall was apparently aware of the existence of this skill, however: he was trying to guess the direction Shin would fly to.</p>
<p>The number of flame slashes 【Red Moon】 could launch were four per weapon. Fagall wielded two weapons, so he had six slashes left, more than enough to target Shin as he changed directions in midair or landed.</p>
<p>In addition, Fagall had an 【Ice Arrow】 spell ready, in case 【Red Moon】 missed. The Sponge weapons rendered magic spells non-lethal as well, but he was seriously going all out.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is really fun.”</p>
<p>To knock an opponent in midair off balance and do a follow-up attack.</p>
<p>In the game era, Shin did it every day. Thanks to the Sponge weapons, Shin didn’t have to worry about killing his opponent, so he was feeling quite carefree.</p>
<p>A duel was still a duel, though. Shin felt a bit sorry for Fagall, but he decided to crush his predictions straight on.</p>
<p>Jumping without any preparation was just asking to be targeted. It was natural to think that an advanced player would have something up their sleeve.</p>
<p>Without a care for 【Red Moon】’s blades of fire, Shin swung his 『Sponge Blade』 in the air.</p>
<p>His blade was enveloped in a red glow, just like Fagall’s daggers. He launched fire slashes, just as Fagall had done, but their size and power were much greater.</p>
<p>“What the !?”</p>
<p>Fagall’s slashes were approximately one mel wide: in comparison, Shin released giant fire slashes extending to three mel each.</p>
<p>Fagall’s slashes were easily swept away, as Shin’s attacks flew straight towards Fagall’s position.</p>
<p>He gave up on canceling Shin’s slashes with his when he saw how they vanished, then evaded their trajectory.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the red slashes struck the location Fagall was standing in. The hardened ground was gouged by deep, crimson gashes, followed by a tall burst of flames.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t check the aftermath of his attack, moving at high speed towards Fagall.</p>
<p>“Kh!”</p>
<p>Shin’s leap was much faster than his first one, so Fagall couldn’t react in time. Without time to shoot flame slashes, he blocked Shin’s attack with his daggers.</p>
<p>Offense and defense had switched places since the start of the duel. One major difference, however, was that Shin’s attack blew Fagall back. Shin followed with the next attack, so Fagall released the 【Ice Arrow】 he had kept at the ready.</p>
<p>However, the spell’s effect was halved, as Shin was already next to the caster. The frozen arrows turned to snowflakes, leaving trails behind.</p>
<p>Shin swept away the remains of the spell and swung his weapon at Fagall. The 【Red Moon】 glows remaining in their weapons drew arcs between the two fighters.</p>
<p>One clash, two clashes, three clashes.</p>
<p>Fagall held his daggers to defend against Shin’s slashes. The sponge weapons’ light, soft sounds echoed through the training grounds.</p>
<p>If they had used normal weapons, the sound of their clashes would surely boom like thunder. That’s how much power the spectators felt through the barrier.</p>
<p>The two combatants did not only cross swords, but fought with magic too.</p>
<p>Spells that missed their mark would sometimes fly towards the spectators, but Schnee’s barrier blocked them without budging.</p>
<p>Some of the soldiers who were watching also practiced magic; looking at the level of the magic that was exchanged between Shin and Fagall, they had turned pale as ghosts.</p>
<p>What surprised the spectators the most, however, was that the hero Fagall was slowly but surely falling in disadvantage.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it…”</p>
<p>Someone whispered a sentiment shared by most of the spectators, excluding the very few who already knew his actual strength.</p>
<p>The heroes and leader of the knights were Erkunt’s most powerful warriors. In terms of stats, Sherlene was higher, but Fagall’s clever use of skill combinations put him on the same level.</p>
<p>Who exactly was the person currently dominating Fagall, then? All soldiers’ eyes were focused on Shin.</p>
<p>“Okay, time to shift gears then!”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>The mental burden of having to hold back was gone; the situation demanded Shin to show a certain degree of strength. He also felt safe, thanks to the non-lethal equipment in use: Shin focused his grip on the 『Sponge Blade』 , to a degree close to the game era.</p>
<p>Shin paused for a moment and the storm-like exchange of blows ceased. It stopped because Shin was on the attack and Fagall did nothing but defend.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Fagall saw Shin hold the 『Sponge Blade』 over one shoulder and a whisper escaped his lips.</p>
<p>The 『Sponge Blade』 was emitting grinding noises. The very same 『Sponge Blade』 which did not even budge during the clashes between Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>Fagall’s experience and ability as a Hero and Chosen One let him estimate just how powerful a blow Shin was about to release.</p>
<p>The 『Sponge Blade』 , which couldn’t be used to kill, appeared as a very sharp blade in Fagall’s eyes.</p>
<p>“—here I go.”</p>
<p>The sword resting on Shin’s shoulder turned into a blur.</p>
<p>Fagall’s body leaped towards the direction the 『Sponge Blade』 was being swung, before he could even think. At the same time, he swung his daggers with all his strength. Before he could tell what they hit, his body was being flung horizontally across the training grounds.</p>
<p>“Aw…crap…”</p>
<p>Looking at Fagall being shot like a bullet, Shin let out a concerned mumble. He realized, too late, that he had gone a bit overboard.</p>
<p>To make it all even worse, the barrier erected in the direction Fagall flew to boomed loudly, spider web-like cracks running through it.</p>
<p>Fagall had not received the attack head-on, but the power concentrated in Shin’s 『Sponge Blade』 would not vanish just like that.</p>
<p>A single attack so powerful to make a Hero shudder even before it was unleashed: it wouldn’t just make the air tremble a bit.</p>
<p>Shin’s 『Sponge Blade』 had drawn an arc from his shoulder to the ground: Fagall had deflected it diagonally, forcing the weakened shockwave to fly towards the barrier. As a result, the barrier was weakened to the point of collapse.</p>
<p>“Haha…he can hunt devils for sure…”</p>
<p>After carving a long path in the ground, Fagall laughed and said this to himself, while looking at the clear skies over the training grounds.</p>
<p>The soldiers beside the barrier stood still, as if time had stopped.</p>
<p>As Fagall would later say, if he didn’t deflect that attack, he would have probably died.</p>
<p>The soldiers standing near the point where the barrier cracked also added that, if the barrier hadn’t been there, they would have surely died too.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 1 Part 5</p>
<p>Namsaar judged Fagall unable to continue and announced the end of the duel. After that, Shin’s group returned to the room they had first been shown to.</p>
<p>Shin was worried that he had gone too far and wanted to leave the training grounds as soon as possible, so he was relieved.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I went pretty much all out there, but…sir Shin, you are really…something else.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha…I’m sorry, I overdid it a little.”</p>
<p>“Well…yes. I thought I was in real danger there.”</p>
<p>Fagall had witnessed a power large enough to ignore the Sponge weapons’ supposed non-lethality, so his smile was a bit strained. Even without Shin’s last powerful attack, Fagall knew he couldn’t have won, or so he thought.</p>
<p>Shin was unfazed from start to finish: Fagall figured Shin was likely to be superior to him in every stat.</p>
<p>Fagall’s attacks never put Shin on the spot. He always reacted with ease.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just because Shin’s reactions were good, or he was more nimble, since he reacted in the same way to magic too. The only possible conclusion was that his stats were superior.</p>
<p>Shin, on the other hand, was thinking that Fagall was likely trying to estimate his stats.</p>
<p>“If possible, I would like to request another duel before the battle with the devil. Because of our positions and duties, I cannot ask it easily to sir Namsaar or Sherlene. I would like to ask you not to use attacks like that last one, however. Without the barrier, the training grounds’ walls would have shattered to pieces.”</p>
<p>“I will be busier from now on too, so I’m afraid I cannot just say yes, unless the opportunity comes. However, if it does, please be assured that I will fight in earnest.. About that last attack, I really went overboard, I apologize again.”</p>
<p>Fagall hadn’t reached the level cap yet: depending on the method, he could acquire new skills.</p>
<p>Many advanced Chosen Ones had various skills in their arsenal, so Shin thought that their fighting strategy had room for improvement.</p>
<p>“Will everyone be convinced with this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there will be some who make a fuss, but with so many witnesses, I don’t think there will be any real trouble. We need sir Fagall to grow stronger too. We can’t have one of the king’s blades lose to adventurers forever after all.”</p>
<p>“You say that even after watching that duel…?”</p>
<p>Fagall mumbled a protest to Namsaar’s not-so-veiled complaining, which seemed to reach the captain’s ears: Namsaar turned towards Fagall and glared.</p>
<p>“Did you say something?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, sir.”</p>
<p>Fagall looked discontent until a moment ago, but just before Namsaar looked at him, his expression turned very serious.</p>
<p>Next to him, Sherlene looked mildly annoyed and sighed, as if this kind of exchange happened often.</p>
<p>“By the way, sir Shin. You will act as a mobile unit in the campaign, but could you join the rest of the army even just once? If we say that you will fight alongside us they will understand, but if you join us personally they will understand better, especially about what kind of person you are.”</p>
<p>If the rumors about today’s duel spread and conflated, Shin could end up being regarded as a dangerous individual, so Zear made this proposal.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is not a problem at all. What should we do with Yuki? I can vouch for her strength, and I was thinking of having her train some of the soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Training soldiers? Will she do something special?”</p>
<p>“She has some experience training armed forces, actually. She can also perfectly restore any wound, as long as it’s not instantly lethal, so I think that training more practical than what normally can be done. In case a commotion breaks out within the castle, I think it is prudent to raise the soldiers’ quality, as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>It would be a waste to use both Shin and Schnee for exploration.</p>
<p>Shin thus proposed to Zear to use as much time as possible to strengthen the army, until the Greed devil — Avaritia made his move. When he mentioned that Schnee could easily restore whole limbs, Zear’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“…I see. The barrier from before is enough proof of lady Yuki’s prowess, but…restoring whole limbs..? Even the church’s highest prelates never attained such levels…no, lady Yuki is from a species with high longevity, an Elf, so if one trains enough, it becomes possible…is it?”</p>
<p>Zear furrowed his brow at his own words.</p>
<p>Unless it was completely isolated, any city would have long-living species residing in it. Zear wasn’t convinced yet because none of the Elves or Pixies he knew of could restore missing body parts to that extent.</p>
<p>Shin had already heard that in the current world there were barely any practitioners who could restore missing limbs.</p>
<p>There were some items in circulation which could produce such effects, given enough time, but that was it. They were very valuable as well.</p>
<p>Being capable of such advanced healing skills would make any country wish to keep her at their side: that was the extent of such a person’s importance.</p>
<p>“As far as I know, it is not something even long-living species can easily perform.”</p>
<p>“I agree with sir Namsaar. I know elves and pixies who have lived over 300 years, but none of them has managed to hone their skills to the point of being capable of restoring missing limbs.”</p>
<p>“Me too…erm, I as well, excluding rumors, know only the church’s ‘Healing Holy Woman’.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded to Namsaar’s words. Fagall shook his head, as he knew only of very famous examples.</p>
<p>“Even I can only close wounds at most.”</p>
<p>“Er…a devil that uses healing skills, really?”</p>
<p>Divine skills purified miasma and devils. In some games, they were treated as the opposite element to darkness. The skills Luxuria would use as healing would purify devils, so Shin found it pretty strange.</p>
<p>“Even if you call them ‘Divine’ skills, in the end it’s using magic power to close wounds or restore limbs, right? It’s not like you pray to some god you’ve never even seen, so even devils can use them. Skills like 【Purification】 are out of the question though.”</p>
<p>“It’s surprising enough that you can use recovery skills…well, yeah, I just use them like I would do with anything useful, so I can’t really say anything about a devil using them.”</p>
<p>Even if the skills were labeled as “Divine”, there was no need to pray every time you used them, or anything of the sort. There was supposed to be a god overseeing each element, but Shin had never actually seen them. Their names were told in quest or library documents, so it was a mystery if they actually existed in this world.</p>
<p>What Luxuria said wasn’t wrong, at the very least.</p>
<p>“Sir Zear…I believe what we just discussed should never reach the priests’ ears.”</p>
<p>“Indeed…it is common sense that divine skills are god’s realm after all.”</p>
<p>Not only king Kreunzeit and Zear, but Fagall and Sherlene were also at a loss for words. The only one who did not change expression was Namsaar.</p>
<p>“Let us leave this for the moment…even so, while I understand it will be impossible, I would certainly wish for her to stay in our country. Could you consider it, even just a little? Together with sir Shin, of course.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit had been listening to the conversation with increasing interest, and ultimately made this proposal to Schnee.</p>
<p>As a country’s ruler, he could not keep himself from trying to secure a rare asset such as Schnee.</p>
<p>“I have decided to follow Shin, so I cannot answer that question.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I…I have no plans of entering the service of any country. I believe sir Zear said he did the same in his younger days, but I wish to see the world and expand my knowledge first.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. If you use Zear as an example, there is nothing more I can say. It is regrettable, but I cannot force you.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit was very serious in his proposal, but Shin’s reply made him sigh and agree to give up.</p>
<p>Zear, on the other hand, showed a slightly awkward expression.</p>
<p>“Ahem, I believe we have been sidetracked. In regards to what we were talking about before…sir Shin, how skilled are you at exploration and field research?”</p>
<p>“Approximately on the same level as scouting jobs such as shinobi or thieves, you could say.”</p>
<p>Shin’s reply made Zear raise his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Shin was clearly the fighting job type, hammering on enemies in the front lines; knowing that he could also act as an accomplished scout surprised him greatly.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be unusual to have a smattering of knowledge outside one’s specialty, but to be on the same level as specialists was normally impossible. No one could be a master of all trades.</p>
<p>Other than the jobs he had mastered during the game, Shin also possessed the experience acquired while clearing dungeons alone and hunting down PKs. When their lives are on the line, people can progress and grow at normally impossible speed.</p>
<p>“You are one surprise after the other, sir Shin…I would then request you to inspect the areas still not fully researched, together with lady Sherlene. In case you find any of Greed’s cohorts, I am sure you can dispose of them. If possible, it would be ideal to learn what exactly the devil is up to.”</p>
<p>“Understood, I will do my utmost.”</p>
<p>After being told that the actual dates would be communicated later, Shin’s group left the castle.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of sight from the gate guards, Shin stretched his body.</p>
<p>“Somehow or other, it’s over.”</p>
<p>“It went much different than expected, but at least it ended well.”</p>
<p>Luxuria sighed and Hilamee agreed with her sentiments.</p>
<p>Only Schnee didn’t seem tired and smiled, apparently in good spirits.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s call it a day…I’m exhausted, mentally I mean.”</p>
<p>“You were tense throughout after all. I’ll be taking the headmistress back then. You two get a good rest too!”</p>
<p>“Who ever thought that I’d have a devil worry about my health…”</p>
<p>“I’m the health officer, after all. If you ever feel sick, drop by!”</p>
<p>Luxuria chuckled, then walked with Hilamee towards the institute. Shin and Schnee went straight back to their hotel. When they entered their suite, Shin changed into something more casual and plopped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Phew, that was tiring.”</p>
<p>He knew it wasn’t exactly good manners, but he laid his back against the sofa. He closed his eyes and sighed, then felt Schnee’s presence next to him. He noticed that she sat down on the sofa too, then felt her pull his arm.</p>
<p>He let her take control and felt his head lie on a different kind of softness than the sofa.</p>
<p>“You did great today.”</p>
<p>“Ah…yeah.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s gentle words provoked an awkward response from Shin. She had changed too: Shin couldn’t tell what she was wearing on her lower body, but she had a white sweater on.</p>
<p>Schnee’s eyes were smiling peacefully, but Shin could only see half of them: the lower half was covered by Schnee’s soft mounds, pushing against the sweater. Because of the unusual angle, they looked even more imposing than usual.</p>
<p>“Shin? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing. Physically, I’m not tired at all. I was just worried about going overboard against that hero guy. The soldiers looked at me not like someone they could rely on, but just a dangerous guy…”</p>
<p>Shin quickly changed the topic, to divert Schnee’s attention from the fact that he was staring at her chest.</p>
<p>He hadn’t spoken to the soldiers, but noticed that they watched him with expressions full of fear. It was too late to think about it now, but he felt that the distance between them grew even wider, instead of shrinking.</p>
<p>“Our future actions here all depended on that duel, so you couldn’t hold back. They won’t think that you’re useless at least. The king and heroes recognized your strength, so I don’t think you should worry too much.”</p>
<p>“That’s true too…well, I guess we should be glad that they will cooperate. Though, I was surprised that they had made preparations already.”</p>
<p>They knew how powerful the enemy was and strived to keep casualties as small as possible. For allies, they were extremely reliable.</p>
<p>“Let’s do our best to keep casualties to a minimum. Training the soldiers is the next step, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, I can already picture them getting all smitten over you, then you put them through the grinder.”</p>
<p>Putting it bluntly, they would easily be swayed by her beauty, as Shin clearly remembered what happened to the prince.</p>
<p>Some soldiers in the training grounds were the same. They would surely think they are lucky to be trained by her…until the actual training starts, at least.</p>
<p>“Shi—n?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha”</p>
<p>“Don’t think you can laugh and change the topic!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry.”</p>
<p>Schnee glared at him, but wasn’t really angry. Her pouting expression was kind of childish, so even if he apologized Shin felt very much at peace.</p>
<p>“I always act strictly because I think it’s for their own sake …Shin?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, I’m listening, I am…”</p>
<p>Shin answered, but his eyelids were almost closing, his words unclear.</p>
<p>“We still have time until dinner, so rest until then.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re…right…”</p>
<p>Resting his head on Schnee’s lap was really pleasant after all. So Shin thought as he drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>“…good night.”</p>
<p>Looking at Shin fall asleep, Schnee smiled faintly. She was reminded that just a few days before, they were in the same situation, with reversed roles. She caressed his head, thinking that she preferred to let him sleep on her lap, rather than the opposite.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 2 Part 1</p>
<p>The next day, a messenger from the royal castle visited Shin.</p>
<p>Shin went to the appointed location at the designed time and found Sherlene along with 48 knights under her direct command and 12 scouts dispatched from another platoon, waiting for him.</p>
<p>“—am I late?”</p>
<p>“No. There is still time. Because of our numbers, we moved in advance.”</p>
<p>“Do you always go scouting in such numbers?”</p>
<p>“No, this is because of your presence. Usually, there is one more squad of scouts.”</p>
<p>Based on the scouting area and ability comparison executed beforehand, Shin was judged to possess scouting ability equal to one squad. Shin himself wondered if he really had such a level of ability.</p>
<p>“We have prepared a horse for you, but will you ride it?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern, but I will pass. I can ride, but I am faster on foot, after all. As a scout, I find it easier to move on foot too.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, is that so. Now that I think about it, I’m faster on foot too.”</p>
<p>Sherlene chuckled, maybe she thought Shin was joking.</p>
<p>The knights behind her, however, were taken aback.</p>
<p>“Hey, lady Sherlene laughed…”</p>
<p>“Lady Sherlene of all people…”</p>
<p>“Could it be that…spring has come…?”</p>
<p>“No, wait, that man has that elf with him, I don’t think that lady Sherlene…”</p>
<p>“No, you wait, lady Sherlene is a real looker too…”</p>
<p>Shin overheard the knights and glared at them to warn them not to say anymore. However, before they could notice, Sherlene turned around.</p>
<p>“Hahaha. I see we’re having a funny chat here, hmm?”</p>
<p>Sherlene was still smiling, but it was a very different smile than the one she showed to Shin: it didn’t have the slightest hint of warmth.</p>
<p>“Looks like you need more training. Once this mission is over, we’re going straight to the training grounds! Better get ready!”</p>
<p>The knights’ shoulders dropped in unison. Though, the mood didn’t change, it must have been something that happened often. The exchange would have left newcomers perplexed about how to act.</p>
<p>“We’ve wasted enough time. Let us head to the designated area.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t say anything else and collaborated with the scouts in searching the area. Excluding race perks, in the scout corps didn’t include any individuals with exceptional abilities.</p>
<p>“What’s this? There aren’t that many monsters.”</p>
<p>Shin was scouting ahead of the rest and noticed that the quantity of monsters in his detection field was strangely small. The situation was very different from the time he had brought Lecus and his party to train.</p>
<p>He stopped scouting for the moment and returned to report to Sherlene. She had apparently noticed the lack of monsters as well, after the other scouts returned and organized the information.</p>
<p>“There are too few monsters, after all. According to previous reports, this area shouldn’t be any different from the others, though.”</p>
<p>“We should assume that something out of the ordinary has happened.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Do you think this might be his doing?”</p>
<p>“Considering the timing, I think there’s a high chance of that. Or I should say, I hope that is the case. If something else was going on, we’d have a hard time dealing with it too.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Sherlene’s questions and jokingly shrugged.</p>
<p>“You’re right, hopefully that’s the case. Let us look for the cause, then. People, report anything unusual you’ve noticed, no matter how small it may be.”</p>
<p>Sherlene gave a small wry laugh, but then turned quickly serious as she addressed her knights.</p>
<p>The knights were the ones who routinely patrolled Erkunt’s surroundings: they would notice if something was out of the ordinary, through a viewpoint different from the scouts’.</p>
<p>The scouts scattered again to search, so Shin did too. He didn’t notice anything peculiar, however, except the lack of monsters.</p>
<p>“If something happened to the monsters, I guess I should focus on that?”</p>
<p>Shin thought this and decided to track a monster which was on the move. It was a zebra-like monster with bluish white streaks, with two twisted horns protruding from its temples, named Bluoth. Level 354, it was sometimes tamed by players to be used as a steed, and was known for its toughness and the crushing power of its hooves.</p>
<p>“It’s not under Greed’s control…usually they move in packs, maybe it got lost?”</p>
<p>【Analyze】 did not show the monster to be affected by Greed’s influence.</p>
<p>Not all horse-type monsters formed packs, but as far as Shin remembered, Bluoths always moved in groups. Now that the world wasn’t a game anymore, he couldn’t rule out the possibility of them acting on their own, but considering the timing, he wondered if it could mean something.</p>
<p>Shin followed the Bluoth, making sure he wasn’t spotted in turn. The monster didn’t seem to be particularly wary of its surroundings. After about 10 minutes, other monster presences entered Shin’s detection field. The new monsters were also heading in the same direction as the Bluoth.</p>
<p>“A cave? Monsters of completely different species can’t be gathering in an ordinary cave…”</p>
<p>The monsters heading in the same direction as the Bluoth were animal types, insect types and mineral types: a very diverse pack. According to the game rules, they were predators and prey, but now they were quietly proceeding together.</p>
<p>Some of the monster names were preceded by Avarice, showing that they were under the Greed devil’s control.</p>
<p>“Looks like I hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>Shin marked the cave on his map and left for the time being. He hurried back to Sherlene’s location and reported what he saw.</p>
<p>“Monsters under Greed’s control are gathering in a cave…”</p>
<p>“There must be something there that is attracting all nearby monsters. When the Bluoth I followed came in contact with other monsters, “Avarice” appeared next to its name, so I guess he’s increasing cohorts with this method.”</p>
<p>“Which means that the more time passes, the more units it will have at its disposal. We should crush them, then.”</p>
<p>Shin reported the types and levels of the monsters he saw. Even if there were more monsters, Shin and Sherlene could manage to deal with them.</p>
<p>“I will assist you.”</p>
<p>“I will be counting on you. Troops, we move!”</p>
<p>The knights quickly get in formation following Sherlene’s order. Their expertise was clearly high too, but the knights under Sherlene’s direct command were all over level 200.</p>
<p>The soldiers in the training grounds were all around level 160. Sherlene seemed to be as strictly disciplined as her looks suggested, so the knights under her command were likely to be strictly trained as well.</p>
<p>They weren’t overwhelmed, nor did they just leave everything up to the scouts. Seeing them carefully check the surroundings, Shin felt impressed.</p>
<p>“The monsters seem to be entering the cave: there are only two at the entrance. I cannot detect any other monsters in the surroundings either.”</p>
<p>When the troops arrived close to the cave, Sherlene asked Shin to go confirm again the situation ahead. The monsters near the entrance were both over level 300, thus it would be dangerous to charge in together with the knights: she had the troops stop a bit far from the cave.</p>
<p>“Judging from the level, I suppose only sir Shin and I should go. Vice-captain, you and the troops stay here on stand-by. If anything unusual happens, contact me with that item.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Please be careful!”</p>
<p>The man addressed as vice-captain saluted, then ordered the troops to keep a strict watch of the surroundings. Based on the knights’ equipment, level and expertise, they would be able to deal with monsters around level 300.</p>
<p>They would only succeed, however, if the monsters were few in quantity. Inside the cave it would be difficult to get in formation, and the number of people who could fight at the same time was limited. It would be like ordering the knights to march to their deaths.</p>
<p>The knights understood that as well and were eager to do everything was within their powers. In case a large mob of monsters swarmed the entrance of the cave, they would use the message cards secretly stocked by Hilamee to contact Sherlene and Shin.</p>
<p>“Accompany me inside, then.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin and Sherlene proceeded, using the trees as concealment, approaching the monsters without being seen.</p>
<p>Shin used his 『Kakura』 to cleave in half a mantis monster armed with 4 scythes, Force Scissors, while Sherlene thrusted her spear directly through the heart of Rock Boa, a monster clad in stone armor.</p>
<p>The monsters were defeated before they could warn their surroundings; leaving the rest to the knights, Shin and Sherlene walked onwards, with Shin in front.</p>
<p>Shin used 【Magic Sonar】 and the map to search the interior of the cave.</p>
<p>“This is pretty small…what’s going on?”</p>
<p>A large number of monsters had entered, so he thought they would find a dungeon; contrary to his expectations, however, the cave wasn’t large enough to be called a dungeon.</p>
<p>There were several pathways and small rooms: the cave resembled an ant colony. The only difference was that the pathways were not too steep and easily navigated by beings other than ants too.</p>
<p>Judging from Shin’s detection field, the various monsters gathered in small rooms, where they appeared to be simply waiting.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like there are traps. The pathways are mostly one way, so we won’t risk getting lost. The monsters are packed in small rooms, however, so please be careful.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>To proceed while crushing the monster groups was an option, but scouting the cave took priority. Shin cast the magic spell version of 【Hiding】 on Sherlene and they started sneaking through the cave.</p>
<p>Thanks to the lack of monsters with wide detection fields and the relatively large pathways, they managed to proceed without fighting.</p>
<p>When they passed the rooms on the sides of the pathways they observed the inside and noticed that the monsters were standing by, separated by species. They were neatly lined up, waiting quietly.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin. While I find it hard to imagine, that’s…”</p>
<p>“Monster platoons, I guess. In every room there’s a monster that looks superior to the others…possibly the captain.”</p>
<p>It was just like the monsters were formed in troops, complete with leader. Their numbers were not extremely high, but they looked just like an army.</p>
<p>“There are monsters which normally don’t move in packs…this is bad.”</p>
<p>Monsters powerful enough on their own, now in packs. Sherlene, who was well aware of how terrifying monsters could be, understood what a fearful prospect that was. Her expression was very tense.</p>
<p>Then, as if to put even more pressure on her, Shin and Sherlene found something unexpected in a room that they thought was empty.</p>
<p>“These are…weapons? But this shape…”</p>
<p>“They’re weapons for monsters. Normally, partnered monsters would use them, but in this situation, I bet they plan to have the monsters here equip them.”</p>
<p>The wooden boxes in the room were packed with weapons for monsters.</p>
<p>Shin’s instincts as blacksmith detected a few very strong auras. He couldn’t tell for sure without looking, but there were probably Legend-grade weapons mixed in.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here…? This is just like…”</p>
<p>An army. Sherlene’s voice died in her throat before she could finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“It looks like they have been making preparations for a while. I’m sure that there are people involved too.”</p>
<p>If all the rooms without monster presences were used to stock weapons, the stock had to be massive. Compared to the human armies, they were few, but as they were all under Greed’s control, it was a completely different story.</p>
<p>A single armed monster could easily battle against multiple fighters at the same time.</p>
<p>If such monsters equipped gear like humans, what would happen? In terms of fighting power, they could be even more threatening than a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on the current situation, it was clear that the monsters equipped with this gear were clearly set to attack Erkunt. It wasn’t strange for Sherlene to find herself unable to answer Shin.</p>
<p>“Could there be other places like this…?”</p>
<p>“It looks like this cave was dug by the monsters, so we cannot rule it out. We should be glad that we managed to find this place, however. I don’t know what would have happened if we learned about this when they actually attacked.”</p>
<p>“That’s, right. We were really fortunate to find out before the attack.”</p>
<p>They couldn’t just look at the negatives. Shin encouraged Sherlene to be more positive and she regained her composure.</p>
<p>“Shall we exterminate the monsters here, first?”</p>
<p>“Surely. Since we’re here, let’s also acquire the means to power up the troops on our side.”</p>
<p>“Power up our troops? Are you going to gather materials from the monsters?”</p>
<p>“No, I saw that there are also magic blades here, so we might as well take them for ourselves.”</p>
<p>Shin then started transferring the wooden crates packed with weapons in the item box. Thanks to the game settings still active, the items were categorized automatically.</p>
<p>Looking at the room turning empty in seconds, Sherlene was speechless.</p>
<p>“….sir Shin. I do not mean to pry, but…if you show me something like this, I feel the need to ask who you really are.”</p>
<p>“It’s an item box. I know it’s fairly rare, but there are other people who use it, aren’t there? You don’t have one, Sherlene?”</p>
<p>Shin had heard from Wilhelm that there was an item that granted the ability to use item boxes. Based on Erkunt’s scope, he was sure there had to be someone who had it.</p>
<p>“Very few, even among Chosen Ones, have one. I do not either. I knew it existed, I thought I knew about it, but it’s much more impressive than I expected.”</p>
<p>“Is it your first time actually seeing it?”</p>
<p>“I saw it before, but the user placed items in it one by one. I have never seen anyone use it like you do.”</p>
<p>Shin imagined that the use of the item box could have been different between former players and other people. There was no time to verify it now, so they set to exterminate the monsters after recovering all the gear.</p>
<p>Still concealed, Shin and Sherlene went into the rooms without monster presences and swept them clean of items, putting them all in Shin’s item box. The items included potions and ethers, so they decided to make good use of those too. Using their abilities as Chosen Ones, they gathered all items as fast as possible.</p>
<p>“With this we have recovered all items. Let’s go back to the entrance, then.”</p>
<p>“It’s the monsters’ turn, then. Are we going to ambush them at the entrance?”</p>
<p>“No, some of the monsters can dig holes, so I was thinking of eliminating them all in one fell swoop.”</p>
<p>“With magic.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>Even heroes like Fagall and Sherlene were Chosen Ones with warrior-like abilities. It would take them a fairly long time to defeat such a large quantity of monsters. Such a way would be poorly effective this time: while they fought monsters near the entrance, others could dig escape routes.</p>
<p>Shin then decided to use one of the strategies more suitable for the location. He and Sherlene returned to the entrance: they made sure that no monsters were following them, told the knights posted outside that they would dispose of the monsters in the cave and had them go farther away.</p>
<p>“Here goes nothing.”</p>
<p>Shin activated the Water-type spell 【Deluge】, aiming it towards the interior of the cave. Just as the name suggested, a massive waterspout erupted from the 2-mel wide magic circle which had formed around Shin’s right hand.</p>
<p>Normally, the forest around the cave would be affected too, but Shin directed the wave fully inside the cave. Most of the monsters inside needed to breathe. The entrance of the cave was essentially sealed by 【Deluge】’s water pressure, so the only path left for them was to drown to their deaths.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shin detected that some monsters started digging underground. The water current, despite its speed, could not fill rooms immediately. The water accumulated from the cave’s floor, so there was some time until all rooms were flooded.</p>
<p>“You’re not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>After detecting the monsters’ movements, Shin lifted his left hand. After a moment, red flashes shot out from it.</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>Lightning-type magic skill 【Split Spark】.</p>
<p>The thunderbolts, following Shin’s command, flew towards the stream flooding the cave. When the bolts touched the water surface, they disappeared as if they blended in it. The monster presences on the map then started disappearing, one by one.</p>
<p>Magically generated water was often an excellent conductor of magically created lightning. Shin used this to electrocute the monsters throughout the cave.</p>
<p>He had also used not any lightning attack, but 【Split Spark】 for a special reason. Normal lightning attacks would simply reach monsters more easily, thanks to the water, but 【Split Spark】 could travel through water spells or water, aimed directly at monsters or players to damage them. Even mineral monsters, which didn’t need to breathe, would be finished now.</p>
<p>15 minutes passed. Shin continued using skills from the cave entrance, eventually killing all monsters inside.</p>
<p>“You’re a first class user not only of physical skills, but also magic…”</p>
<p>Sherlene whispered this after studying the power and length of Shin’s spells. She knew that there were differences in power between Chosen Ones. She also knew that the same was true among those called former players. Shin’s powers, however, exceeded the Chosen Ones and former players that Sherlene knew.</p>
<p>A man that even devils feared.</p>
<p>Sherlene had been secretly ordered to verify the limits of Shin’s strength, but she started thinking that it might be impossible.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 2 Part 2</p>
<p>“Well then, let’s go look for materials.”</p>
<p>“Materials?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this isn’t a dungeon, so the monsters’ materials should be there for the taking. Since we’ve come this far, we might as well take whatever we can.”</p>
<p>“I, I see.”</p>
<p>Shin’s mischievous grin left Sherlene wide-eyed. Shin did not pay attention to her reaction, however, and told her to gather the knights and used earth magic to create a hole to drain the water in the cave.</p>
<p>【Deluge】 was a spell that just generated water, which did not have homing properties, unlike other water spells. If it did, it could be used to drain the water, but there was nothing that Shin could do at that point.</p>
<p>The most that could be done after activating 【Deluge】 was to adjust the direction the waterspout proceeded to. Schnee could probably manage to direct it to a nearby river.</p>
<p>“It will take a bit of time until the water is fully drained. I’ll go ahead and check if any monsters left the cave before we arrived.”</p>
<p>“Understood. The scouts are surveying the area too. Please cooperate with them.”</p>
<p>The scouts were checking the area around the cave, searching for monsters and traps. After making sure it was safe, they split into groups of 2 and expanded the search area.</p>
<p>After making sure that the drainage hole was large enough, Shin then headed towards an area the scouts hadn’t checked yet.</p>
<p>A cave like that was easily built by controlling monsters with digging abilities. It was difficult to imagine that that cave was the only one created for monsters and supplies. Shin studied the movements of the monsters on the map, thinking that there had to be other similar locations.</p>
<p>“I guess I better ask Schnee for help.”</p>
<p>It would be difficult for only Shin and the scouts to search the whole territory surrounding Erkunt. Without Schnee and the remaining scouts, they could not find every monster hideout.</p>
<p>“Where did they get all that equipment from anyway?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that there had to be humans cooperating with Greed.</p>
<p>Shin understood the desire to roleplay as a villain in the game, but such an idea would never come to his mind in this world. Other than the presence of a collaborator, Shin was concerned by the fact that things were proceeding without Avaritia being present.</p>
<p>“Could it have other aims…?”</p>
<p>Avaritia could be planning something else, other than attacking Erkunt and absorbing Luxuria. According to Luxuria, Avaritia’s presence was drawing closer, but it was still rather far. In the game, devils and their cohorts usually acted together.</p>
<p>Shin knew this, so he wondered if there was something he had missed.</p>
<p>“I better talk with Schnee about it later.”</p>
<p>Shin said to himself while filling the unexplored areas of the map.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“Looks like there weren’t any problems. Let’s go pick up the materials then. There aren’t any monster presences but be on your guard all the same.”</p>
<p>Shin could easily recover all materials by himself, but Sherlene ordered the knights to do it, as Shin had told her that he preferred not to make the existence of the item box too public.</p>
<p>Sherlene would probably report the item box to Erkunt’s top brass, but that was unavoidable. Just like Ancient-grade weapons, its existence was not a mystery.</p>
<p>“Understood. Troops, you heard sir Shin’s words. Our foes are monsters. Anything could happen. On your toes!”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am!”</p>
<p>The voices of the soldiers echoed in the woods. Thanks to their training, they moved deftly despite the slippery cave floor, no one fell or even slipped.</p>
<p>The knights usually moved in groups of four. As Sherlene had ordered them to, they moved carefully through the cave.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, how are the surroundings?”</p>
<p>“As far as I searched, I did not find any caves like this one. If they were built on the mountains or deep in the forest, however, they would be quite hard to find. With enough time, I am sure they can be found, but that is the one thing we do not have right now.”</p>
<p>Not knowing when Avaritia would make his move, they couldn’t just comb through the whole area. The number of available troops was limited, and even if Schnee joined them and the search became more efficient, it was still not enough.</p>
<p>“I suppose we can just narrow down the search area. To acquire all that gear, Avaritia has to have a collaborator. We should check the merchants’ movements.”</p>
<p>If there were people supplying the gear, there might be clues left over. Even if there weren’t, it would be impossible for them to act completely unnoticed, or so Sherlene said.</p>
<p>“You can’t use horse carriages around here, so it could be someone with an item box, like me.”</p>
<p>“That makes things difficult, though. Materials in card form are light and require little space, so large quantities can be transported at the same time. There would be no need to go through Erkunt either.”</p>
<p>The owner of the item box did not even need to carry item cards, which made it difficult to find any clues.</p>
<p>“It’s still better than doing nothing though. We might find clues in unexpected places.”</p>
<p>“Do you speak from experience?”</p>
<p>“Well yes, you can put it that way.”</p>
<p>As people often say, life can be quite unpredictable. Both in games and in life, sometimes things happened with unbelievable timing.</p>
<p>“Is that so…no, I will ask no more. Let’s stop today’s search here. I already sent for a carriage for the materials. Sir Shin, you may go back ahead of us.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will do that then. Ah, what should we do with the recovered items? Even in card form, there’s a serious quantity.”</p>
<p>“Please keep them for the time being.”</p>
<p>Shin asked if he could keep them indefinitely, and Sherlene said that she would send someone to pick them up.</p>
<p>“Understood. I’d like to search the weapons a bit, so can I go ahead and do it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that will be fine. With sir Vulcan, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know of him?”</p>
<p>“He’s one of Erkunt’s most famous craftsmen. The rumors of a young human and a blonde elf visiting his workshop have been spreading too.”</p>
<p>“As far as the royal palace?”</p>
<p>Shin knew that some dwarves gathered to see Schnee, but he did not expect the rumors to reach Sherlene’s ears. He expected them to circulate among blacksmiths, but not beyond that.</p>
<p>Schnee was probably called a “blonde elf” because of her disguise when meeting people.</p>
<p>“If you find out anything, please tell the person I send to recover the items.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will take my leave, then.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded at Sherlene and headed towards Erkunt. He kept his presence concealed with 【Hiding】 to avoid surprising normal people as he ran through the forest. He showed the papers identifying him as a collaborator of the knights and entered the country. His first destination was Vulcan’s workshop, of course.</p>
<p>“Hey there! Is the boss in?”</p>
<p>Shin opened the door and addressed Vaal, who was taking care of the shop. He had become friendly with Vulcan and Vaal, so his speech changed accordingly. Shin called Vulcan “boss” now.</p>
<p>“The boss is in the back, as usual. What brought you here today by the way? You look different than usual.”</p>
<p>“I found something nice actually. I wondered if the boss could tell me where these were made.”</p>
<p>Shin then materialized some of the gear he found in the cave. He thought it wouldn’t be good to materialize weapons for monsters then and there, so he picked more orthodox swords, probably prepared for human-like monsters, since there existed monsters which could use gear made for players too.</p>
<p>The swords were Unique grade, with the blade extending from the hilt getting gradually thinner. Shin’s appraisal let him know the weapon’s grade, stats and name of the creator. Though, he could not find anything else.</p>
<p>A weapon with this design was made by a certain school: the blacksmiths in this world could surely tell, but Shin didn’t know.</p>
<p>“An orange blade, that’s pretty unusual. They probably added monster materials to magic steel. As a weapon, it’s rather high quality…I’d wager it’s from either the Baiden or Reishin schools.”</p>
<p>Being Vulcan’s disciple, Vaal was also very knowledgeable about the subject. He looked intently at the blade and mentioned names completely new to Shin.</p>
<p>According to Vaal, both schools specialized in mixing materials with iron.</p>
<p>“The engraving was destroyed, so I thought you might know something. I don’t really know much about this stuff.”</p>
<p>Shin said while looking at the blade with Vaal.</p>
<p>“We can’t tell everything either, but with the information gathered by the union, it’s still better than nothing. If our skills are recognized, we have the chance of learning new techniques from the union’s collected information.”</p>
<p>“Instead of having a country, they are located throughout the world and share the information they found, that’s what dwarves do, right.”</p>
<p>Dwarves lived as citizens of other countries, with most of them belonging to an organization called the union. They had built an international information network, very similar to the real world.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Human countries.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Elven countries.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Lord countries.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Beast countries.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Dragnil countries.</p>
<p>Sometimes in Pixie countries.</p>
<p>Gathered information is compiled by the various branches of the unions, then sent to headquarters, where its leaders reside. It was just like the union had spies all over the world or so some people whispered about the dwarves’ union. According to Vaal, it was just an association of artisans.</p>
<p>“A dwarf spy…? I would like to see one, honestly.”</p>
<p>Shin asked about the spy rumor, half joking, and Vaal replied with a wry laugh.</p>
<p>Dwarves weren’t suited at all for stealth: they could manage it if they continuously boosted their stats, but only Chosen Ones or former players could.</p>
<p>“It is true that we gather information about technology. Ever since the Dusk of Majesty, precious technology was lost because of wars or monster attacks. Dwarves have developed this network to preserve technology and revive lost ones. People do say that a small number of dwarves have a monopoly on technology, but there are many dangerous ones which could be used for shady purposes, so we cannot just make it all public. There are other organizations engaged in similar activities too.”</p>
<p>“Right. In this world there aren’t weapons of mass destruction after all, though it might be possible to create them.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Vaal’s fervent speech. Because unique techniques of magic existed, there were items as dangerous as missiles. In a world where war existed, monsters would not always be the targets.</p>
<p>“It seems that people used them normally in the world before the Dusk of Majesty, though. When I heard that, I was glad to not be born in that era, honestly.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…..that’s right.”</p>
<p>Shin, who had used such weapons in the past, gave a vague answer. He had thrown items which attacked friend and foe indiscriminately where his allies were fighting enemies. It was a strategy possible because his allies were High Human, who would suffer little to no damage. An item like that would be capable of erasing a whole castle if used in this world.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I’ve kept you too long.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, it was a very interesting conversation.”</p>
<p>Shin told the apologetic Vaal not to worry, then went to Vulcan’s forge. As he walked, he felt the heat increase and heard the sound of a hammer striking. Vulcan was forging a sword, so Shin hid his presence and waited, not wanting to disturb him.</p>
<p>They were allies, but he had no intention of secretly watching Vulcan’s work, so he looked towards the corridor. Vulcan was in the finishing stages of forging, so soon enough the sound of his hammer striking the iron stopped.</p>
<p>“Come on in.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you noticed.”</p>
<p>Vulcan had apparently noticed Shin’s presence. Shin had not exactly tried to completely hide, so he wasn’t too surprised.</p>
<p>Shin entered the workshop and found Vulcan holding two swords, still not sharpened. Depending on how they were sharpened, he estimated they would turn out Unique grade.</p>
<p>“If you’re busy, I’ll come another time.”</p>
<p>“No, I just have to hand them to the sharpener now, my work is done. So, what brings you in? Aren’t you the busy one?”</p>
<p>“It’s something related to that. Take a look.”</p>
<p>Shin showed the sword he had already shown Vaal to Vulcan.</p>
<p>“Oh, not bad at all. What about it?”</p>
<p>Vulcan studied the blade and hilt closely, then asked Shin what he had in mind.</p>
<p>“I found it in a certain place, but the blacksmith’s engraving was erased. I was wondering if you could tell me something about whoever made it.”</p>
<p>“It’s been made using monster parts mixed with iron, a technique that several schools are researching, that’s for sure. Without any unusual characteristics, however, I can’t tell who made it.”</p>
<p>The weapon’s quality did not suggest that it had been forged by an especially skilled blacksmith. Vulcan added that he could think of several that could have made it, so it was impossible to pinpoint it.</p>
<p>Limiting the scope to Erkunt only, however, narrowed down the selection. Vulcan said that he would say their names to Shin later. They were all famous, so there was no need to hide it, apparently.</p>
<p>Maybe the blacksmith that supplied weapons to Avaritia wasn’t among them, but there was no harm in checking them.</p>
<p>“That’s all you needed?”</p>
<p>“No, there’s one more thing, actually. If you have time, I wanted to ask you to make weapons using these.”</p>
<p>Shin then materialized the gear recovered from the cave.</p>
<p>“What the…so many Legend grade weapons? The others are all high quality too…and they come from the same place as the sword from before…Shin, is this related to the incoming attack on the city?”</p>
<p>Vulcan noticed that many weapons were made for monsters and looked at Shin in the eyes.</p>
<p>Shin was surprised, but Vulcan was a blacksmith that Sherlene and Masakado trusted with their weapons, so he was likely to have heard about it.</p>
<p>“You know who we’re up against, boss?”</p>
<p>“A devil. That sword I was tempering just then is an anti-devil prototype, I made with information I got from the union.”</p>
<p>“I see, as expected by the chief of the knights’ exclusive workshop.”</p>
<p>Apparently the union also had information about devils.</p>
<p>“I heard about you too, Shin the ‘Slashing Hammer’, was it?”</p>
<p>“Gah, that nickname…it’s just too embarrassing…”</p>
<p>“Usually people are proud of them…anyway. You know a lot about devils, right? Do you think this could be useful?”</p>
<p>Vulcan did not tease the sour-looking Shin any further and showed him the sword he had just forged. It was more or less medium Rare-grade; it did not have any magic imbued in it, but it did have the special attribute of causing added damage to devils. If used against a devil or its cohorts, it would cause 5% more damage.</p>
<p>The number was kind of low for an added damage attribute, but it was still a prototype, so Vulcan had not given his all yet, surely.</p>
<p>Added damage attributes inflicted more damage to specific species: one of the more famous examples was the Dragon Killer, which inflicted added damage to dragons.</p>
<p>“Against a devil, I’d want at least a 20% boost. The weapons I’m going to distribute have a 30% boost, after all.”</p>
<p>“Even with the species limitation, 30%…Can I see it?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I planned to lend it to you anyway, and if it will help you forge better quality weapons, we will have less casualties too.”</p>
<p>Shin then materialized a longsword imbued with an attribute that caused more damage to devils. The silver blade had a yellow line from the hilt to the tip. It had no engraved name, so it could be called Devil Killer.</p>
<p>“All the weapons you plan to distribute have the same stats as this?”</p>
<p>“More or less. I plan to give something a little better to the captains and such. I prepared 200 of these for the elite troops for now. For captains and troops with higher levels, I have about 50 weapons a bit better than this one.”</p>
<p>“…I know that they’re Unique, but…200 of this? If I didn’t know about your skills, I’d never believe it.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t say it, but the “a bit better” weapons were Legend grade. If Vulcan knew that Shin could prepare 50 of them, he would probably be dazed.</p>
<p>“The union documents say to expect 10% at most. They did say that, depending on materials and blacksmith, it could go as far as 20%, but…”</p>
<p>Vulcan grumbled while looking at the blade. He added that the records contained precious techniques to be preserved after the Dusk of Majesty.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. You’re going to distribute this to the troops? Which means that, you’re going to use something better?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, mine has a +40% damage attribute. It’s called 『The Ark』.”</p>
<p>It actually had a +50% damage boost, but Shin corrected himself before talking, then materialized the sword in question. Its blade was about 1 mel and a half. Blue gems were set in the hilt, from which branch-like decorations extended.</p>
<p>“…I’ve never heard the name before.”</p>
<p>Vulcan’s expression was frozen. He probably wanted to pretend he didn’t hear about the stats.</p>
<p>“I heard the name came from an angel.”</p>
<p>Devil killer weapons were named after angels. It was pretty natural, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>Shin unsheathed the blade, which gleamed with a blue and silver hue. Its tip was not sharp, but square. It was completely unsuited for thrusting and bore the nickname of executioner sword, being used to administer the death penalty.</p>
<p>“A devil killer name with the name of an angel. I only heard about them in folk tales, though.”</p>
<p>“It served its purpose, so why not?”</p>
<p>“Well…yeah…I guess…”</p>
<p>“Boss, what’s wrong? You look pale.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I’m just feeling my common sense as a blacksmith start to shatter.”</p>
<p>Vulcan held his head in his hands, as it had started hurting, and talked with difficulty. While he had mentioned it, he didn’t really care about the weapon’s name. Even Vulcan, one of Erkunt’s top blacksmiths, was simply flabbergasted by what Shin just pulled out.</p>
<p>“Shin, you’re not a Lord, right?”</p>
<p>“Me? No, I’m Human, why?”</p>
<p>Of course, He couldn’t say anything about being a High Human.</p>
<p>“If you’re not from a species with high longevity, then you must be a Chosen One…but that is also too weird…”</p>
<p>“I know that well, believe me.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, then let’s leave it at that. I can’t fathom how you aren’t specialized in a production job, despite being so skilled.”</p>
<p>“I was in the beginning, but I was forced by circumstances to become a combat type.”</p>
<p>Shin had to raise his level not only to be able to gather materials more easily, but also to attain the necessary STR and DEX to wield certain hammers. Since Humans were considered weak, he would often be refused entry in parties engaged in quests to find rare materials, so in the beginning he had a very hard time finding good ones.</p>
<p>Because of this -as he had told Wilhelm in the past- he had entered a loop for a time: defeat monsters, gather parts, update gear, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>“A production specialist forced to take up combat? Isn’t that bizarre enough already?”</p>
<p>“Where I lived, we had to be self sufficient, in more ways than one. So if you needed Red Dragon scales, you had to start from hunting one.”</p>
<p>“Say what!?”</p>
<p>The more one focused on production, the more their combat skills and techniques would suffer. Vulcan was no exception: his level as a blacksmith was high, but as a fighter he was weaker than adventurers at the same level. Production specialists who could also fight were very rare.</p>
<p>“Where the hell did you live, really. Oh well, you gave me some great reference, I’m going to steal what I can.”</p>
<p>“I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p>Vulcan could definitely forge something much better than the prototype. Shin was positive about it, so he gave the dwarf some advice, then left the workshop.</p>
<p>He then realized that the sun was already setting. Schnee was probably already back at the hotel.</p>
<p>“This is bad.”</p>
<p>Not wanting to keep her waiting, Shin quickly headed back to their lodging.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 2 Part 3</p>
<p>It was two days after Shin and Sherlene found the monster den that an emergency summons arrived from the royal palace.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“It is probably related to the devil.”</p>
<p>The messenger sent by the royal palace was whipping the horses in a frenzy, so they opted not to ask questions yet. He was trying to be prudent while traveling as fast as possible. If they distracted him, he might even cause an accident.</p>
<p>“Your guide is waiting for you. Please, do lend us your assistance.”</p>
<p>After they somehow arrived at the castle, the messenger briskly saluted Shin and Schnee. They answered that they will do whatever they can and passed through the castle gates. The woman who would act as their guide approached them right away.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee were led to the room where they had previously met king Kreunzeit. The guide quickly served them both tea.</p>
<p>“I am sure they have been notified of your arrival. Please wait here for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>The guide had prepared tea and sweets before them, so Shin obliged without restraint. There were mainly cookie-like baked sweets with a couple other types mixed in.</p>
<p>“Pretty good, as expected of the royal palace.”</p>
<p>“If you like them, I can make some at the hotel too.”</p>
<p>“You know how?”</p>
<p>“I can pretty much tell, from the look and the flavor. Then I just need to make adjustments while baking.”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Level IX Cooking skills was nothing to snuff at. Thanks to visiting various countries and cities on official quests, Schnee had expanded her food repertoire.</p>
<p>“If you liked them, I’ll have someone give you the recipe later.”</p>
<p>While Shin and Schnee were talking, Namsaar entered the room as somber and expressionless as ever. He addressed Shin in the same way as he had done to the king.</p>
<p>“Please, you mustn’t bother. Is there only you today, Mr. Namsaar?”</p>
<p>“Yes, why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Namsaar asked back to Shin, as if meaning to ask if that was a problem.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be extremely disrespectful for an average citizen like Shin to address the captain of the royal guards so casually. Namsaar himself had said to not use titles when talking to him however.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t have any problems with you, Mr. Namsaar. I heard it was an emergency summons, so I figured that it might have come from king Kreunzeit.”</p>
<p>“It’s just information to be shared, so I’m more than enough. There is no need to put up appearances with you, sir Shin, as we must with the nobles. I’ll get on topic then. We have called you because a dungeon has been spotted about 2 kemel north of Erkunt.”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty close.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is inside a forest, but it does not appear to be too deep. The knights said that they’ve never seen it before.”</p>
<p>The location where the dungeon was found was in a place that Erkunt’s knights routinely patrolled. The forest was also visited often by adventurers on gathering or extermination quests: if a dungeon was present, it would be found immediately.</p>
<p>Namsaar added that the dungeon was not in a rarely visited location.</p>
<p>“Could it be related to the cave I found with Sherlene?”</p>
<p>“Probably so. The dungeon was found the day after the cave sighting, so I would be hard pressed to say the two are not related. There could have some sort of device or hidden mechanism, unknown to us.”</p>
<p>Namsaar talked without changing expression, but he seemed to be in a foul mood. There had to have been something more behind a dungeon appearing close to the kingdom when it was preparing for a devil’s attack.</p>
<p>This dungeon was highly likely to be related to devils. Even if they just went to inspect it, they needed to be very careful. That was the reason why Shin and Schnee were summoned. They had enough skills to both sneak into or conquer it.</p>
<p>“The exploration party will be only me and Yuki?”</p>
<p>“No, like last time, you will be accompanied by Sherlene and some knights under her direct command. If the dungeon is connected with the devil, I am sure only Sherlene will be of use in battle, but the knights could prove useful to take care of small fry or watch the surroundings.”</p>
<p>Shin found Namsaar’s words concerning, but chose not to say anything. Half baked strength was of little to no use against high level monsters. Even if they were powerful as average individuals, there was a limit to the monsters Sherlene’s knights could handle.</p>
<p>Shin chose not to say anything about it, though.</p>
<p>“Understood. Should we depart right away?”</p>
<p>“I had Sherlene and the others get ready. I would like you to join them and go.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee were told that they were in the training grounds, so they were about to leave the room and go.</p>
<p>“Gah….”</p>
<p>They heard a lament behind them, however, and turned around. Namsaar was holding his head, a pained expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“No problem. Just light exhaustion. There are many arrangements to be done to advance the preparations against the devil attack.”</p>
<p>Namsaar lightly shook his head, then returned to the usual stone-faced expression.</p>
<p>“It might be out of place for me to say, but you should rest when you can.”</p>
<p>“….I will think about it.”</p>
<p>Namsaar replied to Shin’s words and left the room.</p>
<p>“As long as he doesn’t overdo it and collapses.”</p>
<p>“Being a captain, I am sure he knows the importance of rest, but…I suppose we should mention it to Sherlene.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right.”</p>
<p>Schnee had a point. They wouldn’t go out of their way to openly worry that Namsaar was so overworked he risked not being able to fight when it was needed.</p>
<p>When they arrived in the training grounds, they noticed that Sherlene and her group were waiting, just as Namsaar had said. Sherlene was wearing a light armor with a red base color, just like before.</p>
<p>“Hello. Namsaar told us to join you for this expedition.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be counting on you. Lady Yuki, I think this is the first time we have actually talked. I heard that you are much more skilled than your looks would suggest. I’ll be counting on your assistance too.”</p>
<p>“I will do my utmost, as not to cast shame on Shin.”</p>
<p>Schnee shook the hand Sherlene extended and nodded while smiling. Some of the knights who were watching were charmed and stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>“Enough staring at lady Yuki, you lot! You have work to do!”</p>
<p>“Y-yes ma’am!! We shall do our utmost!!”</p>
<p>The knights exhibited a very sharp salute, then started moving again.</p>
<p>Shin felt sorry for the annoyed Sherlene, but he understood their feelings all too well.</p>
<p>Schnee was in a very good mood today, maybe because she could go together with Shin. Her expression clearly reflected her state of mind. Her bright smile would charm anyone: that’s why Shin nodded to the knights’ reaction.</p>
<p>“I see we are all ready. Let us depart for the dungeon in question then.”</p>
<p>No monsters or thieves dared attack the group of armored knights armed with swords and lances. Thanks to the lack of actual battles and relative close distance, the group reached the dungeon in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>“The entrance is much wider than the previous cave.”</p>
<p>“According to the soldiers we posted to observe the entrance, no monsters went inside. Though not much time has passed since it was discovered, so it could be a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped. Will you leave the knights here to guard the surroundings, like last time?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this time the explorers will be us three: Sir Shin, Lady Yuki, and myself. I believe the devil is definitely involved here. Nevertheless, we cannot concentrate all of our fighting power here. It’s rather troublesome.”</p>
<p>All countries possessed more Chosen Ones than the number they made public. Shin thought that there had to be skilled fighters in Erkunt other than Sherlene, Fagall, and Namsaar.</p>
<p>Maybe they were either keeping them as a reserve or they weren’t as strong as Sherlene and Fagall. As they headed towards the entrance, Shin wondered why heroes who were supposed to be the kingdom’s trump cards, were used so proactively so often.</p>
<p>“I don’t like this presence…”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s expression turned sour.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee felt the same, though not as much as Sherlene. There was a certain indescribable unpleasantness which they had not felt outside. It had approached them the moment they stepped in the dungeon.</p>
<p>“I thought this dungeon might be related to the devil, but it looks like we’ve hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Sherlene understood the meaning of Shin’s words after her question, as her expression showed.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean….”</p>
<p>“There’s a high chance there’s one here, in the lower floors.”</p>
<p>It was the same in the game era. Dungeon fields where devils were present had the attribute of making players feel unpleasant. What Shin felt now though, was not so much a strong uneasiness as it was little more than a bad feeling.</p>
<p>“(This didn’t happen with Luxuria, so I had kind of forgotten.)”</p>
<p>“(That was probably because she is on friendly terms with humans. I can only feel hostility from this negative aura.)”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee talked via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>Luxuria had no hostile intentions from the start. Instead, she wished to coexist with humanity. Schnee suggested that because of this, she didn’t release an aura that made others feel unpleasant.</p>
<p>“I guess we should get ready for the worst.”</p>
<p>“Are we proceeding like this? Should we not call for reinforcements?”</p>
<p>“No, we can fight it now without risking casualties in the kingdom. It’s definitely better to defeat it here rather than let it go out.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s drain attacks had a very wide range. The damage would be incommensurable if it used them in a populated location. Dungeons might have been rife by monsters, but were the perfect battlefield to avoid human casualties.</p>
<p>“I see. In that case, I have no objections. Can you defeat it?”</p>
<p>“No need for concern. I always have anti-devil gear with me.”</p>
<p>Shin then changed his equipment. In one instant, his attire turned into a shining full-body armor with silver and blue hues. Decorated with many thin, delicate ornaments, it looked like it was more suited for displaying than fighting.</p>
<p>The full-face helmet had a horn-like decoration extending towards the back; which gave the whole armor a strong impression of being poorly apt for battle. From the shoulders a dark blue mantle flowed down too. Paired with 『The Ark』 equipped at the waist, it really looked like what a holy knight would wear.</p>
<p>“Well…I am surprised again.”</p>
<p>Seeing the person next to you turn into a knight straight out of a fairytale in an instant, was surely a surprise to behold.</p>
<p>“This is the anti-devil, anti-demon specialized gear, 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』. Just standing close to a person with it equipped reduces the effect of status ailments and debuffs released by devils and demons. Don’t you feel different?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, the unpleasantness I felt before is gone just by being close to you…I suppose this is your trump card?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I would like to say, but the devil surely expects us to come with this. Many warriors clad with this armor have slain devils in the past, after all.”</p>
<p>“That’s true too. If we have a weapon so useful against devils, there would be no reason not to use it.”</p>
<p>The armor’s grade was, of course, Ancient. It was strong enough on its own, but it also boosted attacks against devils. For them it was nothing but a bane of their existence. Shin was wearing it the first time he met Luxuria; she had casually remarked that she was scared, but she had to have really been quite terrified.</p>
<p>“We have an anti-devil lance for you Sherlene, will you use it?”</p>
<p>Shin had procured it, but not given it to Sherlene yet, so he used this opportunity to propose it.</p>
<p>“May I try to use it once? An anti-devil weapon sounds very appealing, but I am more familiar with this.”</p>
<p>Sherlene then looked at the weapon she was holding.</p>
<p>“Of course. If it feels difficult to use, you can keep it as a sub weapon.”</p>
<p>Changing the weapon you were familiar with with a new one just before fighting a powerful enemy was a decision that required a lot of courage. Being a warrior, Sherlene knew it well.</p>
<p>Sherlene wielded the 『Holy Lance Guildern』 Shin gave her and tried a few practice swings.</p>
<p>She didn’t look awkward at all in Shin’s eyes.</p>
<p>“How does it feel?”</p>
<p>“I’m almost shocked…it doesn’t feel quite like my usual weapon, but it is very easy to use. It will do nicely. I am going to use it this time.”</p>
<p>Sherlene judged that if she used the lance in battle, there would probably be no problems.</p>
<p>“Let me give you this too then. This blue one is for protection, while this red one is for throwing. By the way, the one you have is for close combat.”</p>
<p>Shin pulled out some cards as he explained, but Sherlene was completely lost. The reason was all the cards he showed had 『Holy Lance Guildern』 pictured on them. Just the color was different: there were 10 red and blue cards respectively.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Sir Shin, but…these are all the same weapon?”</p>
<p>“They are, but the magic enchantments attached are different. The blue ones are for protection: if you thrust it in the ground it will create a field that reduces status ailments and contact damage. The red ones are for throwing: they have aiming support and piercing boost attached. If it hits, it can cause continuous damage. The one I gave you first is for close combat, it boosts physical abilities and grants auto-recovery. The red and blue ones are generally one use only, so I’d advise against re-using them as weapons while fighting.”</p>
<p>The different colors were meant to help not to confuse them. Not only Shin, but also other blacksmiths in the game applied these adjustments. Players did everything they could in order to defeat monsters in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p>“A-as expected of sir Shin…I will make good use of them.”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s expression was extremely tense. She could only stiffly nod to Shin’s words of using Legend-grade weapons as “one time only” items.</p>
<p>“Should I launch a surprise attack with the usual set?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure the enemy is wary of us, but that will be very useful all the same. If you can, land a blow or two.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded and changed her equipment.</p>
<p>Her maid attire disappeared, with an anti-devil ninja outfit in its place.</p>
<p>Just like Shin’s equipment, it was anti-devil gear for ninjas, called 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』 .</p>
<p>“This looks, quite, light.”</p>
<p>Sherlene wasn’t sure how to react to Schnee’s transformation. It was to be expected: Schnee was now covered by a very thin, rubber suit like outfit. Arm guards, leg guards, kunai holders, item holders and other accessories. The pieces of armor “protecting” Schnee’s shoulders and waist could barely be called part of a ninja outfit.</p>
<p>Schnee’s body and curves were very accentuated, so even Sherlene found it difficult to look at her straight. Just like bikini armors, this outfit too was often described as “too much” by female players in the game.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the male version had the same design too, but very few ever talked about it.</p>
<p>While it might look like something from another genre of game, its stats and effects were exceptional.</p>
<p>It allowed the user to move with enough stealth to completely bypass a devil’s detection field and -against devils’ attacks- have more defensive power than even the 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』. The negatives of its looks were completely counterbalanced by the positives of its specs.</p>
<p>If you could stand to wear it, it would prove to be a real asset against devils.</p>
<p>“I will conceal my presence till we reach the devil, then.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, leave the rest to us.”</p>
<p>It would be too blatant to disappear in front of the devil’s eyes, so Shin agreed with Schnee’s proposal of hiding until they arrived.</p>
<p>As long as extremely powerful monsters did not appear, Shin and Sherlene would be enough.</p>
<p>“I wonder if lady Yuki does not feel embarrassed…?”</p>
<p>“It’s because only you and me can see her. If there were other knights around, she wouldn’t have shown herself like that.”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t care what people other than Shin thought of her, but she still had a sense of shame. As long as the devil didn’t go on a rampage outside the dungeon, Schnee wouldn’t risk showing herself to others like that, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>“I see, I understand. Apologies, it was just…that stimulating. I ended up asking something unnecessary.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve seen it plenty of times and think about it too sometimes, it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>He had seen it in the game era already, but in this world Schnee wearing the 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』 was something to behold indeed.</p>
<p>Shin then shook his head to erase the image of Schnee that had etched itself in his brain. They were going to fight a devil: no matter how much the anti-devil gear would help, they couldn’t afford to lower their guard.</p>
<p>“Shall we go then?”</p>
<p>Sherlene nodded and they moved. Her expression did not show the former confusion anymore. Fighting was her profession, after all, and she was quick to switch back to serious mode.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 2 Part 4</p>
<p>As far as Shin could tell with 【Magic Sonar】, the dungeon only had 7 floors: it was a shallow yet wide type. It could be an instant dungeon which appeared all of a sudden and Avaritia happened to choose as base. Instant dungeons, which appeared randomly in all areas, could be conquered by a single party.</p>
<p>“I cannot feel many monster presences…what about you, sir Shin?”</p>
<p>“It’s the same for me. I searched throughout the dungeon and found very few monster presences.”</p>
<p>The monsters roaming through the dungeon were 10-20 per floor. Based on Shin’s experiences, they were far too few.</p>
<p>Shin and Sherlene proceeded through the dungeon, without any obstacles barring their way. Their objective was to defeat the devil, so they planned to avoid fighting as much as possible, but as they couldn’t even find traps on the way, it felt like they were lured in.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can see that.”</p>
<p>Sherlene agreed with Shin’s suspicions. It seemed like they would reach the boss chamber without a single battle.</p>
<p>“For added safety, please take this with you.”</p>
<p>Shin took a card out of a pocket -from the item box- and gave it to Sherlene.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“A crystal imbued with teleportation magic. In case the enemy causes this whole dungeon to collapse to bury us alive, use it to escape. You just need to materialize it and focus on it, thinking to “use” it. I set it to teleport the user to the woods near the entrance.”</p>
<p>“…teleportation…!?”</p>
<p>Shin gave a quick explanation, but it looked like Sherlene only picked one word from it.</p>
<p>“Wait, this is strange. I think I heard you say…teleportation…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, teleportation. It’s a rare item, so I would prefer if we did not have to use it though.”</p>
<p>“Is this, real?”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s face was, again, very tense. Much more than when she received Shin’s weapons however. She looked at the crystal as if she couldn’t believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve used the same item in the past.”</p>
<p>“….is that so.”</p>
<p>Sherlene said no more: she carefully, very carefully placed the card in her pocket.</p>
<p>She then looked at Shin, held her temples as if she was suffering from a headache, seemed as if she was going to say something, but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Whether she decided that it wasn’t the time or place to question him, or simply she stopped thinking, Shin couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>“I will use it, in case of necessity.”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s tone had lost much of its usual confidence.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Whose fault do you think this….no, that is the safest option. It would be ridiculous to complain. Apologies, I was slightly shaken.”</p>
<p>“Teleportation is quite the shock, I imagine?”</p>
<p>“To receive a piece of lost technology so casually…is a bit too much for my heart.”</p>
<p>Sherlene gave a small sigh, then her expression turned sharp again.</p>
<p>“It’s just for emergencies.”</p>
<p>“It is a very valuable insurance. In case of necessity, I will not hesitate to use it. Though, I would prefer not to.”</p>
<p>Crystals disappeared upon use. Sherlene understood that items were meant to be used, but she would have much preferred to keep it for research. If she didn’t use it, however, Shin would take it back, so in any case it would not become an object of research.</p>
<p>“If we stay out of the monsters’ roaming routes we won’t have to fight, but there are still traps. Please be careful.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I cannot afford to space out any longer.”</p>
<p>Sherlene refocused herself.</p>
<p>Shin and Sherlene descended from floor to floor, checking for storage rooms like the ones they found in the cave on the way. All the items they found were collected by Shin.</p>
<p>“We’ve had an easy enough time getting here, but things will be different from now on.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I am ready.”</p>
<p>A large, imposing door stood before them. It was the boss chamber, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Shin instructed the concealed Schnee via Mind Chat to strike if she had the chance, then touched the gate. The doors moved immediately and revealed the inside of the room.</p>
<p>“Ugh….”</p>
<p>The instant the doors opened, the stench wafting from inside made Sherlene twist her face.</p>
<p>Even Shin, relatively protected from the stench by 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』, could smell a nasty odor. Its source was all too clear: it was the stench of rotting and death.</p>
<p>A massive amount of monster corpses were piled in the boss chamber.</p>
<p>“What in the world…”</p>
<p>“The cause is, without a doubt, that.”</p>
<p>Shin pointed beyond the carpet of corpses.</p>
<p>Its back was visible. Because of the corpses, only the upper body was visible, but even that was more than 3 mel tall.</p>
<p>It was a human-like silhouette, a body with visible back bones, clad in armor. Only the body below the neck could be described as human-like however.</p>
<p>Its head was a lion’s face, forcefully grafted onto a human thorax. From the lion’s jaws, another neck extended outwards.</p>
<p>Shin and his group could only see black hair covering the neck and goat-like twisted horns.</p>
<p>“Nnghaah? More for meeh?”</p>
<p>A very coarse sounding male voice. The source then turned around.</p>
<p>What they saw then was a goat’s face. A face of goat bones. Nevertheless, from the goat’s mouth a man’s voice came out.</p>
<p>“Humaahns? That’s noht the plaahn—”</p>
<p>——Deadly Sin Devil – Avaritia – Level 750</p>
<p>While the devil talked, 【Analyze】 revealed its identity.</p>
<p>The name and appearance were just as Shin remembered.</p>
<p>“—-who, are, you?”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s eyes grew narrowers, its tone heavier. It was looking at Shin only.</p>
<p>“Let’s start. I’m going to charge in straight from the front, you find any openings and strike Sherlene. The attack patterns are as I told you before. It could use unexpected attacks, so always be on your toes.”</p>
<p>“I am well aware. I will give it my all.”</p>
<p>Shin ran forward, ignoring Avaritia’s question. He crossed the loads of corpses with a speed of nimbleness unthinkable of a man wearing armor, getting closer to the devil very quickly.</p>
<p>“Gheeah!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia swung its fist at the approaching Shin, without hesitation, twisting its back to throw it.</p>
<p>The devil’s giant fist easily reached over 1 mel: for Shin, it was like a wall of flesh was approaching him. Shin, however, did not dodge the punch thundering through the air.</p>
<p>“Hngh!”</p>
<p>His feet firmly planted in the ground, Shin blew out some air and swung 『The Ark』. At the same time, the sword’s blade was enveloped in white light.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin!?”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s yell rang out at about the same time as 『The Ark』 swung down. Tracing a white arc in the air, it clashed against Avaritia’s arm.</p>
<p>“That, can’t be only the weapon’s strength…”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s fist and Shin crossed, but Shin did not budge. Avaritia was the one to suffer damage in the clash.</p>
<p>Shin’s 『The Ark』 had not severed Avaritia’s arm, but vaporized it instead.</p>
<p>The range only extended to Shin’s immediate surroundings, but the power exerted came not from skills, but only from the weapon: it was simply destructive.</p>
<p>“Devil killehr…weapon.”</p>
<p> “You know them well, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Before Avaritia could pull back its arm, Shin attacked. He had already started moving when he talked: he had no intention of wasting time.</p>
<p>『The Ark』 was once again swung at Avaritia, a platinum light extending like a blade, carving the devil’s body. It was an effect which activated only against devils, something extremely dangerous to Avaritia.</p>
<p>“Youuh nuisahnce!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia screamed. At the same time, the visible half of its body grew dramatically larger. Avaritia’s upper body was human-like, but its lower body did not exist. It was like its upper body emerged from a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>It wasn’t something so ridiculous however. The “nonexisting” lower body was a slime-like shapeless mass.</p>
<p>When the devil shouted a black, pulsating, liquid mass covered the ground, with Avaritia at its center. Seeing the corpses melt as they came in contact with it clearly showed how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>It was one of Avaritia’s skills, 【Lifedraining Sludge】.</p>
<p>“Sherlene! The blue one!”</p>
<p>“I know!”</p>
<p>Before Shin called out to her, Sherlene had thrust the blue 『Guildern』 in the ground.</p>
<p>The ground then started glowing, with 『Guildern』 as its center, in a 5 mel radius. Only that patch of ground was freed from the black sludge cover, as if it had been cut away.</p>
<p>“I’m not just going to watch!”</p>
<p>Sherlene thus found a place to stand and readied a red 『Guildern』. The number was limited, but Avaritia’s gigantic body was an easy enough target: there was no risk of targeting Shin by mistake.</p>

<p>“Haah!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s head was targeted by 『Guildern』, shrouded in a deep red glow.</p>
<p>Sherlene had activated the Spear/Flame combination skill 【Mitear】.</p>
<p>It was a spear skill suited for throwing: its offensive area covered a 1 mel radius around the point of impact, so it was useful when fighting against large monsters.</p>
<p>Avaritia had perceived 『Guildern』’s presence during the fighting and blocked it with its regenerated left arm.</p>
<p>“Annother ooneh!?”</p>
<p>When the flames subsided, Avaritia’s left arm looked as if a wild beast had bit through it. Shin did not waste time and attacked it, slashing off half of the monster’s left arm.</p>
<p>“How the heell are you so stronng!?”</p>
<p>Probably aware of how rapidly its HP was falling, Avaritia voiced its frustration.</p>
<p>“It’s made just for you devils! You can thank me later!”</p>
<p>“Screew you!! Shiiht! Errkunt’s players were supposed to be small frrry!!!”</p>
<p>The devil was apparently aware of the players’ presence. As far as Shin knew, the only former players in Erkunt were Hilamee and Masakado. It would probably be impossible for them to stop Avaritia.</p>
<p>Facing Avaritia, however, were Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>Even during their conversation, Shin swung 『The Ark』 and continued carving through Avaritia’s armor and body, as Sherlene too increased the devil’s wounds.</p>
<p>The lower body covering the ground was also used to attack, but Shin blocked its assaults with his armor, Sherlene with the thrust spear’s barrier.</p>
<p>Avaritia was supposed to be a fearful enemy, with powerful drain abilities and ranged attacks that could directly hit at a rear guard and other such nasty skills, but its strongest advantages were thus nullified.</p>
<p>“You called for comradess too… who the heell arre you? Are you rreally human!? Damn monssterr!!”</p>
<p>“You take a good look at yourself now!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia screamed at Shin, who was freely moving with no concern for 【Lifedraining Sludge】 and blew away parts of its body with every attack.</p>
<p>Shin was moving as if 【Lifedraining Sludge】 wasn’t even there to begin with: the drain field meant to excruciatingly torment players was blocked by the protective field of Shin’s armor, so it couldn’t inflict any damage or status ailments.</p>
<p>Shin’s weapon, 『The Ark』, was also lethal upon contact for devils.</p>
<p>The 『Guildern』 spears thrown by Sherlene inflicted enough damage that they could not be ignored.</p>
<p>If Avaritia was a player, he would likely be complaining about how unfair the battle was.</p>
<p>Shin and the others however, found him to be a nasty foe as well.</p>
<p>“Drain affects the corpses too, huh. I guess it planned ahead.”</p>
<p>Drain barely affected Shin and Sherlene, but its targets included the monster corpses. Even if they were dead, HP could be absorbed from them.</p>
<p>The room was riddled with monster corpses, so even if Shin shaved away Avaritia’s HP, it also recovered at an impressive speed. The monster corpses on the black sludge covering the room acted as potions for Avaritia.</p>
<p>Because of its high recovery abilities, Avaritia had one of the lowest HP gauges among the Deadly Sin devils, but it was still much more than humans.</p>
<p>Shin’s attacks caused more damage but, because of the devil’s recovery ratio, the damage caused was still about 20%.</p>
<p>“…Let’s burn them.”</p>
<p>Shin distanced himself from Avaritia and held 『The Ark』 over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Sword/Light combination skill 『White Inferno』</p>
<p>The light permeating Shin’s blade grew stronger, forming a giant blade thrice the original size.</p>
<p>“You fool!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia didn’t miss the opening. It absorbed the sludge covering the room, forming multiple spikes to attack Shin. It was an attack possible thanks to the shapeshifting properties of the sludge.</p>
<p>“That’s my line.”</p>
<p>“Gwaah!?”</p>
<p>Following Avaritia’s lamentation, however, the spikes dissolved before reaching Shin.</p>
<p>Exploiting the opening created by Avaritia’s focus on Shin and Sherlene, Schnee had landed a blow on the devil.</p>
<p>Schnee’s slash entered diagonally from Avaritia’s right shoulder, reaching the spot where a human’s heart would be located. Devils did not have hearts, but its body was nevertheless slashed in half.</p>
<p>“Hngh!”</p>
<p>Schnee’s attack created an opening.</p>
<p>Shin used it to charge his attack, then swung 『The Ark』. The blade struck the ground and simply damaged it.</p>
<p>The light extending from 『The Ark』, however, formed a gigantic blade with a flash, slicing through the shapeless lower body of the devil as it advanced forward.</p>
<p>“Ggh!?”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s upper body had limited movement capabilities. Because of this, it could only block Shin’s attack by crossing its arms. However, when the blade of light struck, a white explosion burst forth with Avaritia at its center, briefly erasing the devil from sight.</p>
<p>The attack wasn’t powerful enough to completely defeat Avaritia, but what Shin needed the most now was time. He raised 『The Ark』 again and ran towards Sherlene.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin!?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me!”</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<p>Shin lifted the confused Sherlene as a red and orange light enveloped 『The Ark』.</p>
<p>“Burn to cinders!!”</p>
<p>『The Ark』 ,now lit ablaze, was thrown just in front of Avaritia’s location. Like a streak of light through the air, 『The Ark』 flew on and thrust itself into the ground. The very moment of impact, the energy concentrated in the blade was released.</p>
<p>Sword/Flame combination skill 【Flare Crisis】.</p>
<p>A sea of flames covered the whole room, raging indiscriminately through friend and foe.</p>
<p>The skill itself did not cause much damage to Avaritia, but it was perfect for Shin’s objective. The floor covered in black slime gradually returned to its original color. The corpses were burned to the point that not even ashes remained.</p>
<p>“Youu bastarrd!!”</p>
<p>Without any more recovery sources, Avaritia let out a grunt of irritation.</p>
<p>Because of Shin’s light slashes, the devil was now missing both its arms. Its main body was also scorched in places by 【Flare Crisis】. It also did not seem to be recovering HP anymore.</p>
<p>“Please keep assisting me by throwing the spears”.</p>
<p>Shin let Sherlene down, then again rushed towards Avaritia.</p>
<p>In that small time frame, the devil had regenerated half of its arms. It was one of Avaritia’s abilities, so its HP was unchanged.</p>
<p>“Hnngh!”</p>
<p>“Here goes!!”</p>
<p>Shin met the devil’s fist with his.</p>
<p>Shin’s fist was much smaller than Avaritia’s, but the devil’s punch was the one to be blown back.</p>
<p>Shin’s gauntlets were also part of 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil 』. Naturally, they inflicted bonus damage to devils.</p>
<p>Thanks to Shin’s muscular power and the gauntlet’s abilities, the difference in mass between the two fists was inconsequential. Because of the impact, Avaritia lost its balance.</p>
<p>Schnee also cast 【Arc Bind】 on the arm that was still missing its fist, slowing the devil’s reaction.</p>
<p>“Nice one!”</p>
<p>Shin did not waste the opening Schnee created: He picked up 『The Ark』 with both hands and activated a skill while swinging it.</p>
<p>“Time to disappear!!”</p>
<p>An eruption of light followed the arc drawn by the blade in the air.</p>
<p>Sword/Divine combination skill 【Stellar Geyser】</p>
<p>Blowing away everything in its path, the silver light streaked from the floor to the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Oooaaaoogghhhh!!!”</p>
<p>The pillar of light even erased Avaritia’s scream, growing even more powerful to turn the devil’s body to light.</p>
<p>The skill’s duration time was five seconds. As the light gradually dissipated, Avaritia’s body appeared: its arms were gone, several parts of its body missing as if carved away. Half of its head was missing.</p>
<p>Even after suffering all that damage, Avaritia was still alive.</p>
<p>“What…what the hell…arre…you…”</p>
<p>The remaining half of the devil’s face. The eye deep inside the monster’s skull was incredulous.</p>
<p>“You have no need to know.”</p>
<p>Shin stood in front of Avaritia and raised 『The Ark』 over his head.</p>
<p>The blade now glowed in a golden, cross-shaped light, different from 【Stellar Geyser】’s pillar of light, which had carved even the ceiling.</p>
<p>“This is the end.”</p>
<p>The golden light, despite its brightness which didn’t burned the eyes, struck down upon the unmoving Avaritia.</p>
<p>Divine skill 【Cross Judgement】.</p>
<p>The golden light did not crush Avaritia, but enveloped its body. The devil’s silhouette then started vanishing, as if melting away into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>When the light disappeared, Avaritia’s body had completely vanished too. The only thing left was the proof of Avaritia’s defeat, the 『Drop of Avarice』.</p>
<p>“Is it, over?”</p>
<p>Shin whispered as he turned the 『Drop of Avarice』 into a card.</p>
<p>“I wonder. According to Luxuria, Avaritia shouldn’t have been so close yet…”</p>
<p>Schnee said that if Avaritia was so close, it would be weird for Luxuria not to report it. Shin agreed too.</p>
<p>“What’s going to happen, I wonder.”</p>
<p>Shin then looked at the card. There was something that concerned him. It wasn’t over yet, probably.</p>
<p>He stopped thinking for the moment, however: the fact that one devil was gone was the truth. There wasn’t much he could do, except continue defeating devils.</p>
<p>“This is the first priority for now.”</p>
<p>Shin started thinking of all possible ways to keep the 『Drop of Avarice』 for himself.</p>
<p>He remembered, far too late, that he had committed the silly mistake of not talking about how drop items would be split.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 3 Part 1</p>
<p>“Since you defeated the devil, it’s only fair for you to keep the item, Sir Shin.”</p>
<p>While Shin was still wondering what he should do when they returned to Erkunt, Sherlene requested that they head directly to the king’s audience chambers and report on the mission.</p>
<p>Because of the magnitude of the incident, they would report directly to the king.</p>
<p>Shin expected to have to give a very formal report in the throne room, but once again they were shown to the usual room. Once he heard about the defeat of Avaritia, King Kreunzuit approved of Shin’s claim to the drop item. Shin was taken aback by the king’s immediate and frank reply.</p>
<p>“Is it really alright? This is a very rare item.”</p>
<p>“That is precisely the reason. If the rumor that devils drop very valuable items spreads, lady Luxuria will be the next target. Even with anti-devil weapons, I am sure that Deadly Sin devils are not an easy target to fell. Sir Shin would never cooperate with anyone to take down Lady Luxuria. Sherlene, could you and your knights take down a devil?”</p>
<p>“Frankly speaking, without Sir Shin and Lady Yuki’s prowess it would have not been possible to produce such results. If Fagall and I had gone to the dungeon, we would have fled in the best case or killed in the worst. After witnessing the battle with my own eyes, I realized how naive I was.”</p>
<p>There was probably another report from Shin’s. King Kreunzeit nodded while listening to Sherlene.</p>
<p>“Lady Sherlene has actually witnessed the battle: I do not have reason to doubt her words. Sir Shin, you have saved our countrymen; we owe you a debt of gratitude. If we said that the item will be used to exterminate other devils, no one will have reason to protest.”</p>
<p>The king wished to hold a grand ceremony to honor Shin’s exploits, but Shin would likely request not to. Instead, he would obtain possession of the item and a financial reward.</p>
<p>The king and his close aides had probably discussed and reached this conclusion.</p>
<p>“We also considered granting you land and a court title, but surely you would not accept, yes?”</p>
<p>“Even if I did, I wouldn’t know what to do with them. Honestly…if I received a court title, I would become a subordinate of Erkunt.”</p>
<p>That I cannot do, is what Shin’s words implied.</p>
<p>Receiving items or money was not a problem. However, land and court titles were a completely different matter: they would generate unwanted ties. If Shin was the type to accept such things, he would already belong to another country.</p>
<p>“That is a pity, but I understand there is no other way. Among the nobles there will probably be those who will try to secure you in their faction. I shall forbid it in my name, but if anyone tries to contact you about such matters, let me know. They shall be dealt with.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit’s proposal was something Shin was extremely grateful for. If the king personally expressed such an order, only an utter fool would try to hire Shin. On top of that, Shin had also obtained the item he coveted.</p>
<p>Shin thought for a moment that it was all going too well, but then considered that Erkunt had also gained valuable assets: a connection with powerful warriors, the elimination of a catastrophic threat, and a large amount of monster parts.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, what will you do next? Will you depart immediately?”</p>
<p>“No, I am in fact waiting for my comrades, I plan to stay here until then.”</p>
<p>“I see. If you have any spare time, would you train our soldiers? The officer in charge of training has reported that the soldiers trained by Lady Yuki have grown clearly stronger than the others. We do not know when such a threat might appear again, after all.”</p>
<p>“If we have time until our departure from Erkunt. If you accept these conditions, then I will.”</p>
<p>Shin made eye contact with Schnee, then replied. They already started doing it anyway, so it wasn’t a big problem.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee were told about the time the reward would be given and asked to contact the royal palace when they would leave Erkunt. After this, they left the royal palace.</p>
<p>“What should we do now?”</p>
<p>“Let’s pass by the institute. There’s something I want to confirm about Avaritia.”</p>
<p>Shin had a bad feeling about Luxuria’s statement that Avaritia’s presence was still far away. It would be troublesome if the typical “If only I had checked that out…” development that is so common in fiction, was lying in wait.</p>
<p>There was still some time until dusk. Shin and Schnee headed towards the institute: their decision to visit was sudden, but they were sure they would not be turned away.</p>
<p>Thanks to the lessons with Lecus’ party, they had grown acquainted with the gate guards, who contacted Hilamee right away. They were soon allowed inside and went straight to the infirmary. Normally, they would go to the headmistress’ office or a meeting room, but this time they were told to go to the infirmary.</p>
<p>“Hello there, what brings you here at this hour?”</p>
<p>Shin knocked and entered as Luxuria turned on her chair towards them. She was wearing a sweater and tight skirt, as per her usual style. She had her legs crossed, thus making the skirt appear even shorter. Shin thought that a gesture like that would be too stimulating for the boys.</p>
<p>“We have something about Avaritia to confirm with you. I thought it would be risky to put this off until later.”</p>
<p>After hearing Avaritia’s name, Luxuria’s eyes narrowed. She uncrossed her legs and took a more proper posture.</p>
<p>“I thought that something must have happened, but…did he make a move? It was supposed to take some more time before he arrived…”</p>
<p>It did not seem like she was faking. Luxuria probably really felt that Avaritia’s presence was still far.</p>
<p>“Some more time, huh. Which means, what we fought wasn’t the main body.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We fought against Avaritia. Today.”</p>
<p>“What!? How can that be!?”</p>
<p>Luxuria stood up and quickly approached Shin. He stopped her and pushed her back on the chair. At the same time, another knock was heard on the door. Hilamee entered afterward.</p>
<p>“Excuse me…I heard your voice from outside, did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Perfect timing, I wanted to ask your opinion too.”</p>
<p>“Yes….?”</p>
<p>Hilamee cocked her head to the side, failing to grasp the situation. Shin’s expression turned more serious, as he prepared to talk in detail about what happened.</p>
<p>“You found the drop item, right? It couldn’t have been a total fake, then, I think.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, this is strange. Like I said before, Avaritia isn’t supposed to be here yet. My senses can’t reach inside the dungeon, so it’s no wonder I didn’t realize, but…if that was him, than what is this familiar sensation I’m having even now?”</p>
<p>Luxuria had followed that sensation and met other devils in the past, so she was positive that it was correct.</p>
<p>“Could you be mistaking it for another devil?”</p>
<p>“All devils have unique presences. At the very least, this never changed until now.”</p>
<p>“Would it be impossible for two Greed devils to exist at the same time? Avaritia’s level was 750. It had absorbed other devils, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Shin was trying to recollect all of his memories about the game to figure out the situation, when Schnee proposed a new possibility. It was a fact that devils could use the abilities of other devils they had absorbed.</p>
<p>“It could be Sloth’s splitting ability.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have a few concerns about that, but it would the most convincing explanation for the presence of two Avaritia auras.”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned Sloth because during his recent fight against the Spirit of Pigritis he had directly witnessed this ability. Sloth was the weakest of all devils by itself, but it was one of the more annoying to fight, because it could create copies of itself, with the same powers.</p>
<p>Even if it was the weakest, depending on its growth it meant that players had to battle several boss-class monsters at the same time. This made it a threatening foe.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sloth’s main body and copies had to be defeated all together within a certain time period. Players had to lower all of their HP to a certain point, then deliver the final blow to all of them at the same time. This was the ideal way to defeat Sloth.</p>
<p>“If Greed just absorbed Sloth’s ability, it shouldn’t be necessary to defeat the main body and all copies at the same time. The one we defeated was one of those, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin’s instincts whispered that what he fought wasn’t Sloth’s* main body.</p>
<p>(T/N: I think that maybe the author meant to write Greed here…)</p>
<p>“Do you have any proof?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing to be honest. But wouldn’t it be weird for the main body to just be hiding there like that?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true…”</p>
<p>“Well, regardless of my instincts being right or not, Avaritia’s threat still hasn’t disappeared.”</p>
<p>“I think you might be right. Instincts of players like you get it right pretty often here.”</p>
<p>Luxuria said that it was likely to be a byproduct of skills. Players who had learned instincts-related skills often had incredibly sharp perception.</p>
<p>“I heard from the royal palace that Avaritia had been slain and thought it was probably Shin…but to learn the very same day that nothing was over yet…”</p>
<p>“I would have liked to finish it then and there too, believe me. It just went all too smoothly, though.”</p>
<p>Hilamee sighed as Shin replied, recalling how it felt to fight Avaritia. It was the first time for him to fight against Avaritia’s final form, but the battle had been too one-sided. He wondered how it would turn out based on the level and equipment, but the opponent had been too weak.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Schnee?”</p>
<p>“Personally, it felt like it didn’t put up much resistance. Though the equipment Shin forges are extremely powerful and I myself have powered up quite a bit, so it might be just a feeling.”</p>
<p>“I did reinforce the anti-devil equipment even more than before. I guess that would change things.”</p>
<p>Schnee said that she could have even defeated the devil on her own: that’s how little resistance she felt from Avaritia. The excessive power of equipment was a concern too.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what Avaritia is trying to do, but if it’s easier to fight than before, then it’s a good thing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. What’s left to verify is how many copies it made and what other manpower it commands.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Schnee’s optimistic opinion and mentioned the remaining issues.</p>
<p>In the game era, copies were a maximum of two. Greed’s mastery of the ability had to be less than Sloth’s, so the possible copies probably decreased by one too. Shin’s party had defeated one copy, so what was left were the main body and one more copy.</p>
<p>“Avaritia was gathering monsters, right? If it leads to high level monsters to attack, what would happen, considering the fighting force we have at the moment?”</p>
<p>Shin had heard that there was a relatively high number of battle-oriented Chosen Ones in Erkunt, Hilamee included. Very few of them could handle high level monsters -as in, over level 500-, however.</p>
<p>Even in the worst circumstances, Shin and Schnee could take down Avaritia. However, it was possible that the rest of the fighters, the heroes, and leader of the knights could not handle Avaritia’s monster army.</p>
<p>“Masakado will be back soon, so our fighting power will increase a bit more, but…”</p>
<p>“If Avaritia isn’t around, I can help too. People would panic if I turn into devil form, so I can’t go all out, though.”</p>
<p>“Even so, it would be a big difference.”</p>
<p>Hilamee didn’t seem to be aware that the monsters would come equipped with weapons and armor. The flow of information was apparently being controlled. Shin decided to let her know, just in case.</p>
<p>“Then, oh right. We could ask Tzaobath to pick up Filma and the others and bring them here.”</p>
<p>“That could be the best option we have, yes.”</p>
<p>Shin could contact the ancient dragon Tzaobath with a message card. He mentioned this option because he thought that Tzaobath would probably accept to do a favor this one time.</p>
<p>Depending on their situation, he couldn’t tell for sure that this would work, but it was worth considering.</p>
<p>“Even without Shin’s party members, if the ‘Silver Moon Reaper’ helps us, the monsters would be annihilated in seconds…”</p>
<p>“Right, it can bombard deadly beams from above after all…if you were on the receiving end, it would be nothing but a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Luxuria and Hilamee, who knew how powerful Tzaobath was, thought that in such a case the monsters would be almost pitiful.</p>
<p>After the alliance was established, the two had become quite friendly with each other. Their reactions were almost synchronized.</p>
<p>“In any case, let us know right away if you feel Avaritia approaching. We’ll take care of it. Hilamee, please tell the royal palace that we might have not defeated Avaritia completely. We don’t go to the castle often, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee would sometimes go, for Schnee’s training sessions or assistance in battle, but both were not scheduled regularly.</p>
<p>Only a small part of the army knew Shin’s name and face at the moment, and he did not have anything to prove his connections to the king or the heroes, so there was the possibility to be refused entry in the royal palace. It was a more surefire option for Hilamee to relate the news.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you would have trouble getting inside, but it’s not a place where you want to go so often. Understood, I will let the palace know.”</p>
<p>“That’s all we came to talk about. Oh, take this too. It’s an anti-devil weapon.”</p>
<p>Shin took advantage of the opportunity to give Hilamee the anti-devil weapon he had prepared for her.</p>
<p>“Even without the anti-devil attribute, it has higher stats than my usual equipment…”</p>
<p>“Because it’s specially made. It’s probably the reason why its stats are higher than weapons of the same grade.”</p>
<p>“If the dwarves notice it, they’ll start nagging me to let them analyze it.”</p>
<p>Dwarves were the most apt at analyzing unknown weapons and armor. Because of this, dwarf NPCs were always eager to learn about techniques they did not know. On the other hand, Vulcan and Vaal were very quiet examples.</p>
<p>“Don’t take that out in front of me!”</p>
<p>Hilamee materialized the weapon to check its stats, much to Luxuria’s dismay. She covered her eyes and stepped back, as if she was looking at an extremely bright light.</p>
<p>“It’s that hard?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I suffer actual damage, but I feel like my skin is being burned…if I touched it I would get scalded, no doubt.”</p>
<p>According to Luxuria, it was like the weapon itself was hostile towards her. She slid behind Shin to use him as a shield, showing that she really hated being in the presence of the weapon.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking that if I created an anti-devil weapon form in the shape of restraining rope, it would be possible to catch devils in human form too.”</p>
<p>“The scariest part is that I bet you could pull that off…if you want to restrain me, use normal rope, please. Don’t you try with her, okay?”</p>
<p>Luxuria replied while looking at Schnee.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to—no, the best way to test it would be to tie you up, but…wait, what am I even saying?”</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re inclined to enjoy such peculiar hobbies?”</p>
<p>“No way!? Who said anything about that?? I just wanted to say that catching Avaritia in human form would limit the damage caused.”</p>
<p>Unlike demons, devils counted as slain even if they were defeated in human form, or so Shin had seen in a website once. It was possible to defeat them in human form.</p>
<p>There were no details and the information was posted just once, so Shin wasn’t sure it could work with all devils.</p>
<p>If Avaritia managed to enter the castle in human form, it would cause greater impact when reverting to its original form. If possible Shin wanted to intercept and defeat it while it still was in human form.</p>
<p>“That would be fantastic, but I honestly doubt that even you could do that. If Avaritia attacks, it’ll be in devil form from the start, after all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’ll go that well either. If it did, then all the better. Anyway, the bigger it is, the easier it’ll be for us to stop its movements, so I’ll try making both anti-devil ropes and chains.”</p>
<p>“And once the ropes are complete, you’ll test them on me, won’t you!? What are you going to do with me after I can’t move an inch!?”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s embarrassment was clearly an act. What made Shin sigh the most was that she felt almost hopeful something like that could happen.</p>
<p>“Will you stop changing the tone of the conversation? You’ve got the wrong idea of me, really..”</p>
<p>“Well, there are people who like tying others, or to be tied up, right? I don’t really care, but I guess it feels good?”</p>
<p>“That’s what you’re interested in…?”</p>
<p>“My sin is lust after all, of course I’m interested…”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s expression was nothing short of seductive. To stimulate human desire so much without using mental skills was literally the devil’s work.</p>
<p>Even Shin, who had strong resistance to mental attacks, felt goosebumps. Schnee stepped back while taking a wary stance as Hilamee blushed fiercely.</p>
<p>“Don’t show that face to anyone else, okay? It would only bring trouble. If the rumors about a devil doing nasty things to people spreads, you’ll lose your place.”</p>
<p>“I know that. I am careful about who I show it to, you know.”</p>
<p>Luxuria then casually took Shin’s hand in hers. It was a very natural movement, without any hostility or ill will. Because of Shin’s position, Hilamee and Schnee could not see it.</p>
<p>Luxuria wasn’t using any force, so Shin let her do it. If she showed even the slightest hostility, he could tear off her whole arm easily.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be so wary…”</p>
<p>Luxuria then moved one step closer. One more step and their bodies would come in contact.</p>
<p>“I told you, I am very careful about who I show it to.”</p>
<p>With an enticing smile, Luxuria pulled Shin’s hand towards her chest, over the sweater.</p>
<p>Betraying Shin’s expectation that she would not actually do it, his hand was squeezed between her hands and chest.</p>
<p>Shin reacted not to the sensation and inexplicable situation, but to the chilling aura he detected behind him: he pulled back his hand and stepped away from Luxuria.</p>
<p>“What are you doing!?”</p>
<p>“I can’t use skills against you, so I tried using the mood. How was it? I bet it felt nice even through the sweater.”</p>
<p>“Listen now…”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t decide whether to get angry or annoyed and let out a sigh.</p>
<p>He didn’t check behind his back because he already know whom the chilling aura belonged to. Shin’s detection ability was now sounding the alert of maximum danger.</p>
<p>“Shin? What might you be doing?”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>A hand was then laid on Shin’s shoulder. The chill in the voice that followed was as powerful as Luxuria’s erotic charms.</p>
<p>The whisper reached Shin’s ears and made him jolt.</p>
<p>“That’s not good at all, you know?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sor…no, I will be more careful!!”</p>
<p>Shin slowly turned towards the source of the voice and saw Schnee wearing very chilling smile on her lips. All he felt were chills down his spine. His speech turned more prim and proper too.</p>
<p>“Y-yes…I’ll be careful too.“</p>
<p>Luxuria too replied in the same way as Shin. She probably felt the same chill.</p>
<p>“If you understand, it’s fine. We have said what we had to, I believe it’s time we excuse ourselves. Hilamee, thanks for relaying the message for us.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes. Thank you two for letting us know so quickly. I’ll go to the caste tomorrow, so I will relay the message then.”</p>
<p>Influenced by the atmosphere, Hilamee stood up straight too.</p>
<p>“O-okay then, we’ll go now.”</p>
<p>“Okay…I’ll let you know as soon as I notice something.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left the institute. The sun had already set, so magic lights were lit here and there in place of streetlights.</p>
<p>“Er….hm…Lady…Schnee?”</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Shin called Schnee to change the awkward atmosphere, but received no response.</p>
<p>Shin started having cold sweats, realizing how bad the situation was. Nothing good happened, despite his light panic. Shin did not speak a word until they reached the hotel.</p>
<p>“Sit down on the sofa.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am!!”</p>
<p>Schnee locked the door behind them and finally spoke. Unable to resist the silent pressure, Shin obeyed immediately.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Schnee walked in front of the very stiff Shin, then sat on his lap, looking at him.</p>
<p>“Ah, er, Lady…Schnee?”</p>
<p>Shin was puzzled, as they were practically hugging. Schnee’s chest was exactly at the height of his eyes. He just needed to bend his upper body forward a little to bury his face in her breasts; not that he would be reckless enough to do so.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Schnee stared at Shin, still silent. Feeling her cold stare from above, Shin was even more ill at ease. It wasn’t clear if Schnee was aware of how he felt, but she took his head in her hands and pushed it towards her breasts.</p>
<p>Shin thought that he was going to taste heaven (the sensation of Schnee’s chest) and hell (difficulty breathing) at the same time, but unexpectedly, Schnee’s chest was not pushing back with much strength.</p>
<p>Shin felt the softness of her breasts, changing shape as his face moved, with enough space to breathe comfortably. It was like she was embracing him, so the situation was actually very pleasant. He couldn’t figure out her intentions, though, so his hands waved helplessly in the air.</p>
<p>“How does it feel?”</p>
<p>Five seconds passed since Schnee started hugging Shin. She asked a question in a voice so feeble that Shin wouldn’t be able to catch it without his “Listen” skill.</p>
<p>It was a very difficult question to answer, however.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t have the slightest idea of what Schnee wanted to do. He felt that it would be wrong to simply say “soft and pleasant”, so he couldn’t reply.</p>
<p>“Please answer.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s chest pushed a bit harder. Shin’s face buried even deeper, making the situation even more comical.</p>
<p>“Well, ehm…I feel, extremely happy.”</p>
<p>Shin squeezed out an answer, meant to imply that he would have enjoyed it a bit longer. It wasn’t an answer much different from the one he previously discarded. Excluding the very serious matter of Schnee’s mood, it was a fact that Shin felt bliss at the moment. Hugging was nice, but to be hugged was not bad at all either.</p>
<p>“More than…Luxuria’s?”</p>
<p>“Obviously!”</p>
<p>Shin answered the following question immediately. He then finally understood Schnee’s actions.</p>
<p>“The greatest woman is right next to me. I wouldn’t even think of touching a devil! That caught me by surprise too, you know.”</p>
<p>Shin wrapped his hands behind Schnee’s back and embraced her too.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Schnee released him.</p>
<p>“You mean that?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>Shin replied as if he was stating the obvious. Luxuria was probably trying to liven the mood in her own way, but this time she only ended up stirring Schnee’s feelings.</p>
<p>“I would never expect you to do something so forward, though. Seeing this new side of you was great for me, personally.”</p>
<p>Shin moved his hands on Schnee’s hips and continued.</p>
<p>“You’re actually quite the jealous type, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…..!?”</p>
<p>Seconds passed after Shin’s question. Schnee understood its meaning and blushed. Her actions had indeed been motivated by the jealousy she felt after seeing what Luxuria did to Shin. Schnee’s eyes wandered left and right, as she actually understood her current position: she then tried to jump away from Shin.</p>
<p>Shin stopped her, though, holding her hips firmly. They looked at each other in the eyes, at very close distance.</p>
<p>“L-let me go!”</p>
<p>Schnee realized that she had lost her cool.</p>
<p>“Request rejected. I finally have the chance to gaze at jealous Schnee! In exchange for what you did, I’m going to savor this moment!”</p>
<p>“What are you even saying!?”</p>
<p>Schnee grabbed Shin’s arms and tried to pull them away, but Shin was overwhelmingly more powerful, in terms of muscular strength et al. She wouldn’t be able to escape him, unless they damaged the surroundings. In addition, Schnee could only exert about half of her usual strength at the moment.</p>
<p>“Don’…don’t look at me…so much…”</p>
<p>Trying her hardest to escape Shin’s gaze, Schnee covered his face with her hands. It was meaningless before Shin’s 【Through Sight】, however.</p>
<p>Schnee, having been unusually sensitive to people’s eyes, realized that she couldn’t escape Shin’s gaze. Her already flushing face turned beet red.</p>
<p>“Yet another uncovered side of Schnee was thus brought to light.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it!! I don’t like it!! Of course I get jealous too!!”</p>
<p>“But isn’t it the first time that you showed it so clearly?”</p>
<p>“T-that’s…”</p>
<p>Schnee’s voice flickered out. Shin didn’t miss her “even so, I couldn’t suppress my feelings..” though.</p>
<p>(…I guess it’s because she held back all this time.)</p>
<p>If Schnee hadn’t lost her memories because of Hameln, Shin might be still undecided whether to remain in that world or not. Schnee had probably kept her emotions bottled up, especially the negative ones, thinking of Shin’s feelings.</p>
<p>Shin’s feelings were now aimed towards Schnee, so those shackles were gone: her original personality and feelings now surfaced freely.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Shin chuckled.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny now…?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, I’m not making fun of you, believe me. I was thinking that from now on I’ll see your honest feelings more and more, so I felt kind of happy.”</p>
<p>Schnee was no longer Shin’s servant, instead she was his life partner. He would then see more and more of her human-like qualities, which he thought was pure happiness.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I like you thinking this is happiness! It’s like I’m not the usual me, it’s so, so embarrassing…”</p>
<p>Shin thought that Schnee looking away like that was very cute too, but avoided saying it, lest she became angry again.</p>
<p>The distance separating them until minutes ago had vanished into thin air: in the end, they were flirting as usual.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 3 Part 2</p>
<p>“Ehm, I’d like to go down now. Do you mind letting me go?”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it after you hug me again.”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>“I’m joking, come on.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s rebuke made Shin realize that he had joked enough, so he let her go.</p>
<p>Still blushing, Schnee went to the kitchen to prepare dinner. When the meal was ready, she had returned to her usual self.</p>
<p>After dinner, Shin went to check his gear. He didn’t think there would be problems, but the enemy was a devil: there would be no harm in facing the battle in the best state possible.</p>
<p>Shin took out 『The Ark』 and 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』, in card form, then told Schnee to take out her anti-devil short sword 『Daybreak』 and 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』.</p>
<p>“There’s no real damage, but the arms and legs part were consumed a bit, after all.”</p>
<p>The greaves, having walked over Avaritia’s 【Life Draining Sludge】, and gauntlets, which had clashed against the devil’s knuckles, had slight decreases in their endurance values.</p>
<p>Thanks to their anti-devil attributes, the decreases were very small. Without the right preparation, fighting devils were always very taxing.</p>
<p>The 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』 wasn’t too affected, so Shin simply used his blacksmith skills to perform minor repairs on the simpler broken parts, such as fittings and decorations.</p>
<p>『The Ark』 was more damaged than the armor, but there would be no problems even if it was used as is. Shin disassembled it to make sure there was nothing wrong with it, but judged its condition was perfectly okay.</p>
<p>“Here you are.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Shin took Schnee’s equipment and materialized it. He checked 『Daybreak』 first. Schnee had attacked only a few times, so its endurance was unchanged. Even after disassembling it, there were no problems.</p>
<p>He put 『Daybreak』 back together, turned it into card form, then moved on to 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Shin was carefully checking the gear, as he did with all other items, when he realized that Schnee looked very embarrassed.</p>
<p>“N-no, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Despite her reply, Schnee was still looking away: she clearly had something on her mind.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything that concerns you, say it, I’ll fix it.”</p>
<p>“Well…there’s nothing I have to say about the item itself. It doesn’t get stuck anywhere, it’s actually really easy to move in. It’s just that…seeing you check it so thoroughly, it’s like…you’re looking at every nook and cranny of my own body. It’s embarrassing, I feel kind of bothered…”</p>
<p>“Ooh, I see…”</p>
<p>Schnee blushed a little again and Shin nodded.</p>
<p>『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』’s endurance was unchanged. There was no problem with it as an item, just like Schnee had said. The gear, however, was modeled closely after Schnee’s body. It didn’t stretch or shrink like other items, as it was created to fit a very specific shape.</p>
<p>Because of this, the bust, hips, arms and thighs were all Schnee’s exact size. Measuring the 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』 would result in knowing Schnee’s three sizes and other detailed measurements.</p>
<p>Schnee felt embarrassed even if Shin wasn’t actually looking at her.</p>
<p>“It seems a bit late to worry about that though…no?”</p>
<p>They hadn’t registered with the authorities, but Shin and Schnee were husband and wife, as a matter of fact. They lived under one roof now so, as Luxuria had pointed out, their relationship was also physical.</p>
<p>“That’s not the same thing! What are you saying!?”</p>
<p>“I-it isn’t?”</p>
<p>Shin staggered because of Schnee’s piercing gaze. He decided not to pursue the matter further and change the topic.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the 『Shinobi Gear – Vanquisher of Evil』 is alright too. Well, I should have expected it, since today’s battle was over quick and all.”</p>
<p>Shin gave Schnee her equipment’s cards, recalling the battle against Avaritia.</p>
<p>“It’d be great if the next battle went that smoothly too.”</p>
<p>“It would be ideal if we found a method not to let it inside the town.”</p>
<p>If it snuck inside in human form, not even Shin could do anything.</p>
<p>“We need to ask Hilamee first, but we could set some traps all around Luxuria.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s target was Luxuria. Shin never expected that he would act to protect a devil, but he realized that this could happen in this world.</p>
<p>“Hehe, I bet she wouldn’t like it at all.”</p>
<p>“They’d be anti-devil traps, after all. They would affect her too.”</p>
<p>The topic was a serious one, but Shin found it amusing as well.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>The next day, Shin and Schnee headed towards the institute to meet with Hilamee.</p>
<p>“It’s noisier than usual today.”</p>
<p>Shin had this impression as they walked down the street lined with shops. He used the same path to go to Vulcan’s workshop, so he knew the street rather well.</p>
<p>“It’s mostly people arguing prices. It happens often, but everyone seems more frantic than usual.”</p>
<p>Schnee often negotiated the price of groceries, with Shin carrying the heavier bags, so he frequently witnessed other clients arguing prices. The mood was usually brighter as that too was a form of communication. Today, however, things weren’t as peaceful.</p>
<p>“I’ll go take a look.”</p>
<p>Schnee approached one of the stores she usually visited, looked around a bit, then talked to the owner. Shin went close enough not to be in the way and gestured a greeting.</p>
<p>The owner seemed troubled, as Schnee listened to him with a serene expression. Thanks to that, she could obtain various pieces of information.</p>
<p>“The flow of supplies is slow, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself while looking at fruit sold at a higher price than usual. All stores were in the same situation, so the citizens’ wallets were in a pinch.</p>
<p>Most merchants’ carts had not arrived yet, despite the scheduled date having already passed.</p>
<p>Erkunt traded with various cities, so the cause could not be pinpointed to something that happened in one particular city. In other words, something had likely happened to the trade routes that connected Erkunt to its partners.</p>
<p>“The country is already investigating the cause. I heard they sent knights to check on some of the routes.”</p>
<p>“Crushing trade routes…it’s either Avaritia or its collaborators.”</p>
<p>Shin hypothesized that monsters, armed with gear like what he had recently found in the cave, had been used to attack merchant convoys. For parties of armed monsters, merchant convoys would be easy prey.</p>
<p>Shin, Sherlene and the knights had neutralized only one cave. They didn’t know how many of those caves there were, but even one would be enough to cause serious damage.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be possible to have powerful Chosen Ones guard all convoys. Even if they did, only warriors on par with Fagall or Sherlene could survive the encounter with Avaritia’s monsters.</p>
<p>“It’s way cheaper over there!! Why do you set prices so high!?”</p>
<p>“Enough out of you!! I told you I can’t do anything!!”</p>
<p>Shin heard the quarrelling voices of a customer and shop owner from another shop. The two were arguing rather fiercely, so the passersby steered away from them.</p>
<p>It looked like a fight could break out any minute: Shin wasn’t a guard, so he thought that only in case they started fighting he would go to stop them.</p>
<p>“Hmm? That’s..”</p>
<p>Just then, a silhouette separated the two quarreling parties. It was a tall man, one head taller than the two, carrying a large sword on his back, which signaled how he couldn’t be just any young man.</p>
<p>The young man listened to the customer and the shop owner, a warm smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Prices are rising everywhere. You know that convoys are being attacked, right? The shop you’re talking about will have a hard time keeping prices down, you know?”</p>
<p>Like Schnee heard from the shop owner, Erkunt’s citizens already knew that trade convoys were not reaching the area lately. If the current situation continued, all stores would be forced to raise their prices.</p>
<p>“It’s not like the authorities are sitting there doing nothing. Besides, if you keep making a commotion you’ll have the guards on your neck soon. You don’t want to go that far, do you?”</p>
<p>At the mention of the guards, the customer’s expression stiffened. He hadn’t lost all reason yet, so he apologized to the shop owner and left.</p>
<p>“That’s really like him.”</p>
<p>Shin approached the young man, feeling a wave of nostalgia. The young man noticed him too and smiled, after a moment of surprise.</p>
<p>“Shin! You’re really here! And Schnee too!”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>The young man who came running up to Shin and Schnee was Masakado, a former player who lost his life alongside Hilamee.</p>
<p>Shin gave him a casual greeting and Schnee nodded at him.</p>
<p>“Wow, you’re Shin even up close!”</p>
<p>“It would be weird if I wasn’t…”</p>
<p>Shin replied with a sigh to the wide-eyed Masakado. He had brown hair and red eyes, just like he was in the game era. Though he was a Dragnil, he made his appearance completely Human-like, so the only traces of his actual species were a few sparse scales on his arms and legs. He did not have horns, so he looked completely Human.</p>
<p>Shin remembered that he was a level 211 Holy Knight, but now his level had increased to 231.</p>
<p>“Did you just return today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, completed my mission with flying colors.”</p>
<p>Masakado said that he had gone on a mission to exterminate a pack of Shadow Hounds which attacked trade convoys.</p>
<p>Shadow Hounds were wolf-like monsters which could conceal themselves in shadow, with levels ranging from 250 to 300. The pack was larger than normal, so exterminating it took some time.</p>
<p>“But just as I return, I get told that another convoy was attacked in another location! I was just talking with the others, things are really getting crazy.”</p>
<p>Masakado thought that the trade route was finally secure, but heard that another route had been squashed. He was going to report to Hilamee that something fishy was definitely going on.</p>
<p>“If you’re just making a report, couldn’t you use Mind Chat?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you know, some things should be done in person…”</p>
<p>“Ooh, yes, I see it now…”</p>
<p>Shin perceived the meaning behind Masakado’s words and grinned. It was clear that Hilamee and Masakado enjoyed each other’s company, to say the least.</p>
<p>Shin remembered Masakado as a 15 year old boy: he had to be older now, but to Shin he didn’t seem much different.</p>
<p>“We were planning to go see Hilamee too, but I suppose we’d be in the way?”</p>
<p>“Not at all! If you’re going to see her, it must be about the devil, right? If Hilamee learns that I had you go home, she’ll never let me hear the end of it.”</p>
<p>“You can’t just win with her, huh?”</p>
<p>“Well, come on, you know, her position is higher and all…”</p>
<p>Masakado replied with a fair reason, or at least tried to.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know how they met: as far as he could remember, Hilamee had always kept the reckless Masakado in check with her staff, that’s the kind of relationship they had. He had heard that in the real world, Hilamee was older than Masakado. Even if she wasn’t however, the result would have probably been the same.</p>
<p>“Hmm, yes, let us ask in detail later. About you and Hilamee, first of all.”</p>
<p>“God, please, no…”</p>
<p>Shin grinned even more, to Masakado’s dismay. His other comrades probably joked about it too. Schnee was silent throughout, but the smile on her lips hinted that she shared Shin’s thoughts.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the institute, they were let inside right away thanks to Masakado’s presence. The guard, who also was a Chosen One and instructor, was one of his comrades.</p>
<p>They went straight to the headmistress’ office. Masakado knocked and asked permission to enter, which was granted right away.</p>
<p>“The Shadow Hound exterminations has been completed. This is the proof.”</p>
<p>“Duly noted. I will take care of the documentation.”</p>
<p>The report, part of the headmistress’ duties, was carried out formally. Hilamee checked the material cards Masakado gave her and signed a document.</p>
<p>“Masakado.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Welcome back. I’m glad to see you safe.”</p>
<p>Hilamee showed a defenseless smile, very different from the one she showed to Shin or other teachers.</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, thanks. It’s…this feels kind of embarrassing with other people present…”</p>

<p>“Eh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, there’s Shin and Schnee too…”</p>
<p>“Eh!? What!? Where!?”</p>
<p>“What are you getting surprised about? They’re right behind…”</p>
<p>Masakado turned around, confused by Hilamee’s surprise, but Shin and Schnee were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“…You sure got us good.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I couldn’t help it.”</p>
<p>“You two are quite adorable.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee deactivated 【Hiding】 and showed themselves.</p>
<p>“W-w-w-whaaa…”</p>
<p>Hilamee, unable to grasp the situation, was at a loss for words. She knew that she had been seen with a very “unprofessional” face on though, so her face quickly became beet red.</p>
<p>“Looks like I was worried for nothing. I’ll go call Luxuria, so please continue.”</p>
<p>“I’ll accompany you too.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded satisfied, then slid out of the room, followed seamlessly by Schnee.</p>
<p>“Shi—–n!!!“</p>
<p>“Hilamee, calm down! Hey Shin, how could you leave us like that!?”</p>
<p>Shin heard the voices through the door and thought he might have gone a little bit overboard, maybe.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 3 Part 3</p>
<p>When Shin and Schnee returned to the headmistress’ office with Luxuria in tow, Hilamee’s face was still red. Luxuria didn’t let go of this chance.</p>
<p>“Oh my, are we blushing, headmistress?”</p>
<p>“Not another word, please.”</p>
<p>Hilamee replied right away. After that, she complained to Shin for a good while.</p>
<p>“What is your business today, anyway? I suppose it is something different from yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was wondering if we could set some anti-devil traps around Luxuria.”</p>
<p>Shin explained that if the enemy initiated battle unaware of the traps, the tide could easily turn in their favor.</p>
<p>“Wait, let me make sure, but wouldn’t these traps activate against me too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, so you’ll have to learn their locations really well.”</p>
<p>Anti-devil traps would react to any devil. It wasn’t possible to set them such that Luxuria wouldn’t set them off. At the very least, Shin could not do it.</p>
<p>Luxuria put her hands on her cheeks and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s all that Avaritia’s fault…go ahead and install something huge, so that he can suffer massive damage at least.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? You’ll risk suffering high damage too.”</p>
<p>“I just have to dodge it.”</p>
<p>Luxuria seemed very confident in her dodging skills, but Shin couldn’t help but worry. It was also true that average traps would mean little against Avaritia’s abnormal recovery abilities.</p>
<p>Shin then took out one of his highest quality traps, which he had prepared the night before.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“The immobilizing trap I mentioned before and a trap that inflicts great damage to devils only. The right one is for immobilizing, the left one for damaging.”</p>
<p>Shin did not yet have traps that could target human form devils, but only ones meant for their true devil forms.</p>
<p>“Avaritia’s lower body doesn’t have a fixed shape, so the immobilizing trap uses a water spell to freeze and stop it. Even if activated inside the institute grounds, there’s no risk of blowing up buildings. However, if there are people other than devil within its radius they will freeze too, so be careful. As for the damaging traps, I have basic ones that just shoot beams of light while others that damage anything inside their radius. It only affects devils, so there’s no concern even if there are people inside the radius.”</p>
<p>“Would people die if they got caught in the activation radius?”</p>
<p>“The main purpose is immobilization, so it barely does any damage. The damaging types are specialized against devils, so make sure you stay away from it.”</p>
<p>Shin estimated that a direct hit would shave off about 10% of Avaritia’s HP. At the very least, 【Lifedraining Sludge】 would be blown away.</p>
<p>“Will you try it…on me?”</p>
<p>Shin was serious when he mentioned testing the effectiveness of anti-devil items on Luxuria before, so she asked Shin if he really would. Her complexion was very pale.</p>
<p>“Things would turn nasty, so I won’t. I packed it with magic, after all.”</p>
<p>“I see. I don’t really like it too rough, after all.”</p>
<p>Luxuria seemed relieved. The conversation was supposed to be serious, but her last words seemed to head in a completely different direction: after all, she was the devil of lust.</p>
<p>“I’d like to set them up as soon as possible, can you give us permission?”</p>
<p>“Just to make sure, the students will not be in danger, right?”</p>
<p>“They won’t be. These traps only react to devils, so even if the students touch them nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the traps was that they would show no reaction to all species except devils.</p>
<p>“Then it’s okay. That kind of friendly fire would be too scary.”</p>
<p>Hilamee was tasked with preserving the students’ safety too, so Shin’s words gave her relief.</p>
<p>Shin then went to install traps with Luxuria. As there was the possibility of being spied upon by people from Avaritia’s side, infiltrated in the institute, they made sure to camouflage their actions.</p>
<p>“I really can’t tell that there’s something there…I have to be really careful.”</p>
<p>Luxuria carefully looked at Shin setting up traps, then spoke with a tense expression on her face. In order to make sure the enemy did not find out about the traps, they did not create any maps or write down the locations.</p>
<p>Only Shin, Schnee, Luxuria, and Hilamee knew about the location of the traps.</p>
<p>“Aaah, it’s all your fault, Avaritia!”</p>
<p>As Luxuria frowned, Shin and the others could feel her heartfelt exasperation.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>After Shin’s group set up the traps, Hilamee left the institute to go to the royal palace: she had to report the information received from Shin to the top brass. She had actually planned to go first thing in the morning, but news of Avaritia’s defeat was being spread around the castle, so it took some time before she could schedule an appointment.</p>
<p>“There’s still some time before Avaritia arrives, though…”</p>
<p>She wanted to relate the news as soon as possible. She thought that Shin’s group would be authorized an audience with the king quickly, but apparently some nobles did not see them positively. They were people who did not know how fearsome devils could be: if Shin and Schnee requested an audience, they would surely get in the way.</p>
<p>Hilamee also realized that Shin had entrusted her with the task because he expected something like this might happen.</p>
<p>“I suppose Shin and Schnee would easily realize if someone was looking at them with malicious intent.”</p>
<p>Hilamee could tell, so Shin surely would too. She had heard from him about such bothersome looks in the game era too.</p>
<p>Hilamee was lost in such thoughts when a knock was heard at the door.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. His Majesty cannot move for the time being, so I have come in his stead.”</p>
<p>The king’s envoy was one of the kingdom’s guardians and heroes, Sherlene. Hilamee, who often visited the royal palace due to her duties as headmistress, often had the chance to meet with Sherlene, so they had become close.</p>
<p>“Thank you for sparing time for me in this hectic period.”</p>
<p>Because of their positions, their first greetings had to be formal. The mood quickly lightened, however, as smiles appeared on their faces. No one else was present, so there would be no problem even if they talked informally.</p>
<p>“There’s something you need to report immediately, right? Could it be related to the devil?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Shin realized that Avaritia hasn’t been completely defeated yet. According to Luxuria, Avaritia is still a few days from here.”</p>
<p>“How can that be!? Sir Shin defeated it, I…I saw it with my own eyes!”</p>
<p>The usually composed Sherlene couldn’t help losing her cool.</p>
<p>“Devils can use the abilities of other devils they absorbed, albeit as weaker forms. Shin said that Avaritia probably absorbed Sloth. That devil can create copies of itself, so the Avaritia you defeated was probably a copy created like that. Avaritia’s main body will be stronger than that.”</p>
<p>“Oh god…so that wasn’t its actual strength…”</p>
<p>The battle had been one-sided, but only Shin could do something like that. Without the anti-devil weapons, Sherlene wouldn’t have stood a chance.</p>
<p>“The news of Avaritia’s defeat is spreading through the palace…and this happens.”</p>
<p>Sherlene held her head with her hands. The king and his aides with some knowledge about devils would understand that a devil could not be defeated easily, but the soldiers’ morale would definitely take a hit. Some might even say that Shin had made a mistake.</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s better to say that the report came not from sir Shin, but from our research. We haven’t even distributed all weapons yet…”</p>
<p>“I agree, that would create less of a commotion. There were no casualties among the soldiers in the previous battle, so if you riled them up with a speech, saying that now it was the knights’ turn to protect the kingdom, morale won’t decrease too much…I hope.”</p>
<p>“That’s for me and Fagall to think about. If Avaritia is heading here, the institute is the area in the most danger. Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>Luxuria was in the institute’s infirmary: being Avaritia’s target, it was only natural for the institute to be the enemy’s number one target.</p>
<p>“We are making countermeasures. In case of necessity, there’s always the emergency escape function.”</p>
<p>“Emergency escape? That’s a first.”</p>
<p>“We can instantly transfer all people in the institute to the underground shelter. It can be used only once, so it’s for emergencies only, but that’s the situation we are in right now.”</p>
<p>Hilamee planned to use it without hesitation if Avaritia entered the institute or any equal emergency occurred.</p>
<p>If devils fought in their true forms, their surroundings would turn to rubble. It would be impossible to have people take shelter by other means if a battle between such humongous beasts broke out.</p>
<p>“Teleport, again…”</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“Sir Shin gave me a teleportation crystal card for emergencies. He took it back after the battle against Avaritia, but to see supposedly lost magic mentioned so often, I started thinking that maybe it’s not actually so rare.”</p>
<p>It was a technology impossible to replicate at present: only former players, chosen ones and a few inheritors could use it. In addition, not even all former players or chosen ones could use teleportation, so there was no progress in its research.</p>
<p>“I too only had the guild house function, so I can’t actually use teleportation. Depending on how it’s used, it can become a lethal weapon, so this ability would be dangerous if it spread.”</p>
<p>It could be extremely effective for assassination or invasion: while convenient, Hilamee thought that it shouldn’t be spread. Sherlene could understand her opinion too.</p>
<p>“We went a bit off topic…today I came to report only about the devil.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. I will duly report to the king.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Hilamee added that she would get in touch if there was anything new and left the palace via horse cart, as Sherlene saw her off. She still had many things to do in the institute, as its headmistress.</p>
<p>“A devil more powerful than that is coming? We really must be ready for anything.”</p>
<p>Sherlene went to report to the king as soon as Hilamee left.</p>
<p>Sherlene recalled the pressure she felt during the fight against Avaritia and clenched her fists. Shin and Schnee would surely be wary of any signs of Avaritia. It might be possible not to have to face it directly. Sherlene, though, asked herself what she could do.</p>
<p>Thanks to the weapons Shin gave her, she could put up some resistance, but depending on the location, even those weapons might not be useful. Sherlene, who had heard from Shin about Avaritia’s abilities, sadly concluded that if the devil appeared in the city, all she could do was buy time until Shin arrived.</p>
<p>She would have to entrust someone else with the protection of her country. This was what frustrated Sherlene the most.</p>
<p>“Lady Sherlene, the meeting is already over?”</p>
<p>“Sir Namsaar? I thought you were overseeing the soldiers’ training.”</p>
<p>Sherlene was stopped by Namsaar on her way to the king’s audience room. The leader of knights had his usual gloomy expression and mood, but Sherlene was used to it.</p>
<p>“An urgent request from Hilamee, who is connected to sir Shin…I thought something serious happened, so I left the training to the vice-captain. There is no concern about that.”</p>
<p>“I see. Indeed, there is something I need to report to His Majesty as soon as possible. It appears that Avaritia was defeated was just a copy and the main body is still alive and well out there.”</p>
<p>Sherlene made sure no one was around them and whispered the news. Namsaar simply raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I see. So it hadn’t been defeated after all.”</p>
<p>“You do not seem very surprised. Did you foresee this happening?”</p>
<p>Sherlene was surprised that Namsaar seemed to know that something like that would happen.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Sir Namsaar? What do you…gh!?”</p>
<p>Before Sherlene could act on her suspicions of Namsaar’s peculiar silence, something wrapped around her neck. That something, which did not emanate the slightest presence, tightened its grip more and more.</p>
<p>Because of her high stats, Sherlene wouldn’t have trouble breathing if she was just being choked, but she was having unexpected difficulty now.</p>
<p>“!?!”</p>
<p>The situation was completely unexpected, but Sherlene would not faint without a fight. Thanks to her diligent training, she had managed to materialize one 『Guildern』 as soon as she realized that she was under attack.</p>
<p>Before she could attack whatever was constricting her neck, however, a shadow extended from Namsaar’s back and knocked 『Guildern』 away.</p>
<p>The unexpected development increased Sherlene’s agitation. She had been caught just when she exhaled, so her consciousness was starting to fade.</p>
<p>If she took out other weapons they would be just knocked away, so she tried to forcefully remove what was wrapped around her neck, but its grip was too tight to budge. It was so tough that Sherlene’s muscular strength wasn’t enough to rip it apart.</p>
<p>“As expected of a hero, not giving up till the very end.”</p>
<p>A male voice came from somewhere. It sounded rather young and gave Sherlene a strong feeling of uneasiness. She couldn’t understand what was going on. Even as her consciousness was fading, she knew that she couldn’t let Namsaar go like that.</p>
<p>“You can’t do anything. Stay quiet.”</p>
<p>Sherlene was about to resort to a self-detonation spell, when a shock ran through her body. Almost unconscious, Sherlene could not resist anymore.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“Nngh…where am I…?”</p>
<p>Sherlene mumbled to herself and stopped. She looked around and found the familiar corridor of the royal palace.</p>
<p>“Lady Sherlene? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Sherlene reassured Namsaar, who was walking a few steps ahead, that nothing was wrong. She wondered if she had fallen asleep while walking, then resumed her pace.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that everyone is a bit too festive about the “Avaritia has been vanquished!” business?”</p>
<p>Sherlene sighed after hearing the conversation between some passing nobles.</p>
<p>“I agree. The spread of the monsters surrounding the kingdom is still unclear and there have been sightings of high-level monsters as well. On top of that, the merchant convoys are being attacked by monsters, so trade and supply are stalled…it certainly isn’t the right time to be festive.”</p>
<p>Just as Namsaar said, there were many problems left to solve.</p>
<p>“The defeat of Avaritia, however, is one of the few great news as of late. I suppose we can turn a blind eye then.”</p>
<p>“That might be true. I shall take my leave, then. Lady Sherlene, please take care of your health.”</p>
<p>With an expression that suggested all but such sentiments, Namsaar left. Sherlene watched him go, then headed towards the troops’ barracks. She still had many missions of monster research and extermination to organize.</p>
<p>“Okay, time to work.”</p>
<p>Sherlene did not notice that her neck still showed faint traces of being choked. Nor that she lacked the memories about what happened before she regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Avaritia was not dead yet. The threat to the kingdom was approaching quickly.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 3 Part 4</p>
<p>“It’s almost here, huh.”</p>
<p>Three days had passed since Hilamee visited the royal palace to make her report. Shin heard from Luxuria that, based on the current pace, Avaritia would arrive in a few days.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about the kingdom’s preparations…they seem rather slow.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke while looking out the window towards the royal palace. The kingdom’s troops were researching the missing trade convoys, but Shin and his party felt that they were not preparing adequately to counter the devil’s army.</p>
<p>Schnee had visited the palace the day after Hilamee supposedly related her report, but the mood among the troops was very much relaxed. At the moment, she thought that the news hadn’t been released yet.</p>
<p>“Maybe they thought it was too early and the soldiers would be shaken?”</p>
<p>“They would panic when the monster troops actually appear though. The morale might fall, but I believe that is better to make sure every single soldier knows what is coming.”</p>
<p>“That’s right…”</p>
<p>Shin’s group had been disposing of the monster packs attacking the convoys in the last few days. Countless requests for extermination were sent to the guild, so Shin’s participation was very welcome.</p>
<p>After the first three days, the monsters apparently realized that there was a group of warriors hunting them down, so the attacks on the convoys became scarce. Shin sold some of the parts they obtained and stocked the rest.</p>
<p>“Maybe boss Vulcan knows something…let’s try asking him.”</p>
<p>Vulcan was in charge of the knights’ gear, so he would probably know how the army was going to move based on the equipment orders he received.</p>
<p>They had nothing in particular scheduled that day, so they went to the workshop right away. Shin opened the door and found Vaal behind the reception counter, as usual.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shin, Ms. Yuki. I have been hearing of your exploits.”</p>
<p>It seemed news of Shin’s exterminations had reached Vaal’s ears too. Kicking wolf monsters measuring several mel in midair, sniping flocks of bird monsters, and much more. While they might sound like exaggerated stories, Vaal did not doubt them at all.</p>
<p>He had known Shin for a fairly long time now, so he knew well how extraordinary Shin was.</p>
<p>“I feel I better not ask about those exploits…I’d like to talk with the boss, is he in the back?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You look different than usual, did something happen?”</p>
<p>Shin had felt it also when he had come to bring in the weapons he found in the cave, but Vaal had a keen eye. He noticed right away that Shin had not come for the usual exchange of techniques.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’m worried about, but I can’t confirm my suspicions easily. It concerns the safety of Erkunt as a whole, so I want to verify as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“The safety of the whole country? Could it be, that?”</p>
<p>Vaal lowered his eyes, deep in thought.</p>
<p>“Do you know anything that might fit?”</p>
<p>“I heard gramps…the boss talk with some knights, and…well, I don’t know if it’s okay for me to talk about it, so please speak directly with the boss.”</p>
<p>Shin understood that Vaal couldn’t just talk about state secrets like that, so he nodded and headed towards the back of the workshop. Schnee went with him this time.</p>
<p>The sound of hammering metal couldn’t be heard. Shin found Vulcan sitting, his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? It’s strange to see you sitting in the workshop doing nothing.”</p>
<p>“…it’s you. Blacksmiths don’t just hammer on metal all the time, you know. Well, this time it’s not related to blacksmithing, though.”</p>
<p>Vulcan had a sour expression, as if he was frustrated about something.</p>
<p>“Can I ask what happened? Vaal said you talked with soldiers from the kingdom. He didn’t say what you talked about, though.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. You’re involved too, after all.”</p>
<p>“I am? Then it must be something related to the devil.”</p>
<p>Shin figured it had to be something like that. He had no other connections to the kingdom and blacksmith work.</p>
<p>“Those fellows from the kingdom came here saying that the devil had been defeated, so they didn’t need anti-devil equipment anymore. I have no intention of ruining their mood when they’re all so giddy and happy, but devils don’t die that easily, do they? Don’t they always have an ace up their sleeve or something? That’s what is rubbing me the wrong way.”</p>
<p>Vulcan had learned about the devils while making weapons that worked against them, so the kingdom’s actions did not convince him at all.</p>
<p>“Boss, when did they tell you to stop?”</p>
<p>“When? Today, just today. Either the top brass knows something we don’t, or—”</p>
<p>“That can’t be.”</p>
<p>Shin reacted before Vulcan could finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“What can’t be?”</p>
<p>“The devil isn’t dead yet. And the top brass should know too.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>Vulcan’s frown changed into surprise.</p>
<p>“Something’s not right. Why did they stop the orders of anti-devil equipment, then?”</p>
<p>“The information has been stopped somewhere…or there’s something wrong with the brass themselves. Either way, the situation is really bad.”</p>
<p>Hilamee said that she had duly relayed the message. It didn’t look like anything unusual happened to her, so Shin thought that either the person she gave the message to or their superiors were suspicious.</p>
<p>Some time had passed since he met the king, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary with him at the time. He didn’t want to think that the kingdom’s top brass had fallen into the hands of the devil in such a short time.</p>
<p>“Maybe the devil did something to interfere?”</p>
<p>“I wonder. They say that there are people willingly following the devil too. They might have done something.”</p>
<p>“There are people like that?”</p>
<p>Vulcan joined in Shin and Schnee’s conversation. He probably couldn’t comprehend how people willingly cooperated with devils.</p>
<p>“The devils’ sins are originally a reflection of people’s desire. It’s not impossible for people to be seduced by them.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t understand it, but…I can’t deny it.”</p>
<p>Vulcan held his head with his hands and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“In any case, we better figure out what’s going on with the top brass.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way you can do that?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I have my ways…..”</p>
<p>Shin shrugged and gave a vague reply.</p>
<p>“I’ll check with my connections too. Don’t you go cause a commotion now, you hear? Also, should I resume making weapons?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to cause any problems. If you have the time to make more weapons, by all means do. We’re going to need them.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t say that the devil would arrive soon, but Vulcan understood the situation by the expression shown by Shin’s eyes. He replied, “Got to hurry.” He then started hammering right away.</p>
<p>Shin nodded and left the workshop.</p>
<p>“Are we going to the royal palace?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we don’t have the luxury of going through the proper procedures.”</p>
<p>Shin implied that he planned to sneak inside. Information about the devil had been intercepted: even if he asked to visit the castle, he would likely be rejected.</p>
<p>Shin entered a narrow back alley, immediately concealed himself with 【Hiding】 and jumped. He landed on the workshop’s roof, made sure Schnee was keeping up, and headed towards the castle.</p>
<p>The very moment he stepped forward, something completely unexpected happened.</p>
<p>“What the!?”</p>
<p>What he heard was a sound similar to an explosion. Surprised, Shin looked towards the source of the sound.</p>
<p>“That…can’t be…”</p>
<p>Schnee looked in the same direction and couldn’t help but voice her surprise, with good reason: they saw Avaritia’s massive body, supposedly still a few days away from Erkunt, destroying the castle’s outer walls.</p>
<p>It was more than double the size of the monster Shin, Schnee and Sherlene fought in the dungeon, measuring up to 7-8 mel. Its fists easily shattered the walls protecting the castle.</p>
<p>Clouds of dust rose to the sky as the booming sounds of the crumbling walls reached Shin’s ears.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. I don’t know what happened, but Avaritia’s here already!!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Behind Avaritia, a horde of monster presences was approaching. They proceeded in orderly ranks, and Shin remembered the monsters he had seen in the cave. These were probably similarly armed too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were a few human presences near Avaritia, moving in various directions. The ones that did not move were either paralyzed by fear or wounded by the crumbling walls.</p>
<p>“This is bad. If it manages to get inside, it—-”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Schnee asked why Shin stopped talking and he replied that he had just received a message card.</p>
<p>“Not even Luxuria understands what happened. It moved while avoiding her detection…could it be that it teleported!?”</p>
<p>“With a crystal, it could be possible.”</p>
<p>Teleportation was a skill available only to players. That was common sense for Shin.</p>
<p>No monster possessed teleportation abilities, nor did they need to.</p>
<p>Normally monsters would roam established routes or lie waiting in specific locations.</p>
<p>Only players moved from town to town, from guild houses to fields, etc.</p>
<p>“Shit, I should have realized when we determined Luxuria’s level of intellect…an ambush via teleport! It knows how to fight!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted out of frustration for falling in the enemy’s trick.</p>
<p>Avaritia ignored the east and west gates, focusing instead on destroying the walls between them. It was the point closest to the forest. It was the ideal location to hide the monsters until the very last moment.</p>
<p>“Schnee, please take care of the monsters coming from outside. Rescue the people that can’t escape in time.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to face Avaritia by yourself?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Even if it has its full powers, I’m not going to lose. I’m going to punch it as hard as I can first, so I can send it flying.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee ran on the roofs as if they were flying. Avaritia was focusing on destroying the outer walls, so it wouldn’t get inside to rampage just yet.</p>
<p>Shin thought that he would make it just in time, but —as if to counter Shin’s efforts — Avaritia’s massive body disappeared, just moments before Shin could arrive.</p>
<p>“That bastard…! It turned into human form!”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s large icon had turned into one of the many dots on the map. Mingled with the panicked crowd, it would be very difficult to find.</p>
<p>Monsters and people, however, had different presences. Not all locations were swarming with people.</p>
<p>Now that the monsters hadn’t yet penetrated the castle premises through the crumbled walls, there was no mistaking it. Shin’s expectations, however, were betrayed yet again.</p>
<p>“What? There are monster presences in town already?”</p>
<p>“What in the world…?”</p>
<p>Schnee was confused too. The monster presences outside the walls were still far from the town. The monsters which suddenly appeared inside came from somewhere else.</p>
<p>The worst case was for Avaritia to mingle among the monsters, making it impossible to see which one it was. It probably prioritized hiding among the monsters instead of heading straight to Luxuria.</p>
<p>“I lost track of Avaritia’s presence…”</p>
<p>“Me too…”</p>
<p>They could track it in the beginning, because of the low density of monster icons, but after Avaritia arrived in a location where a pack of monsters was prowling, they lost it.</p>
<p>“This just gets worse…the monsters’ presence are even in the royal palace. What the hell’s going on?”</p>
<p>Even within the range of Shin’s detection field, there were groups of monsters rampaging in various locations throughout the town. Unlike the monsters outside, marching forward in a well-organized manner, the monsters within town had movements that seemed random, as if they were just following their instincts.</p>
<p>“I suppose the ones inside are expendable pawns, meant to confuse us. They’re still powerful enough to hurt the citizens though. Damn it.”</p>
<p>Around the adventurers’ guild and soldiers’ posts, there were many people used to fighting, so they could take care of any attacking monsters. The ones that suddenly appeared in town were level 200 at most and generally moved by themselves, which was a silver lining.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?”</p>
<p>Schnee stared into Shin’s eyes.</p>
<p>There were no skills that could conveniently only blow monsters away. Only Shin and Schnee were present at the moment: they had to decide what to do.</p>
<p>“Like I said before, please take care of the monsters outside. They’re much more powerful than the ones inside, after all. Very few people here can deal with those.”</p>
<p>The monster troops coming from outside were probably around the same level as the monsters Shin found in the cave. They were much more threatening than the ones currently running wild in the town.</p>
<p>“Where will you go, Shin?”</p>
<p>“I’ll find Luxuria first. If Avaritia appears somewhere, it’s likely to be where she is.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s goal was clear: Shin couldn’t think of any other options. Shin could defeat it on his own, so he decided to go to the most likely location.</p>
<p>“When you finish with the monsters outside, come back and deal with the ones in town. We can’t do both with just the two of us…”</p>
<p>If only Shibaid and the others were here…Shin found himself thinking.</p>
<p>He had asked Tzaobath to take them to Erkunt, but Filma and Sety were occupied with retaking a city conquered by a demon, while Shibaid and Tiera were restoring a weakened World Tree, so they couldn’t go right away.</p>
<p>They were all occupied with important tasks, so Shin couldn’t count on reinforcements.</p>
<p>“Understood. I will do so as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee nodded to each other, then ran off. The former towards the institute, the latter towards the crumbling castle walls.</p>
<p>Erkunt’s threat had struck with timing that no one expected.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 1</p>
<p>The outer walls were being destroyed, with parts of the walls falling into the city. For Erkunt’s citizens, it was more than enough to create panic. The people and carts that were unfortunate enough to be close to the walls were crushed by the debris. Even just the vibrations caused by the impact injured many of those near the source.</p>
<p>The nightmare, however, had just begun. From the other side of the destroyed walls, the very perpetrator of this disaster had shown itself.</p>
<p>“What in the world…is that…?”</p>
<p>Despite being as tall as the walls, only the upper body was visible. Centered on its torso, with bones protruding from the sides, was a lion’s head that looked to be grafted into it. Its head, shaped like a goat’s head made of bone, was adorned with black curved horns that signified the ominous catastrophe.</p>
<p>The beast’s appearance was much different than the monsters the people were used to seeing, enough to make even adventurers quiver.</p>
<p>“Gh, I feel…sick…”</p>
<p>Some people, who did not have the strength to move, and fell prey to the devil’s aura. Their almost non-existent resistance caused them to be affected by Avaritia’s status ailments all too easily.</p>
<p>Thanks to their stats, Shin and Sherlene’s only felt an unpleasant sensation, but the average citizens had levels of only one or two digits, so they were powerless. Not only were the citizens immobile, but also the ones screaming in pain due to their wounds stopped, unable to voice their pain due to the status effects.</p>
<p>The same applied to guards and adventurers. They were much stronger than the average citizens, but they still could not match Avaritia’s power.</p>
<p>Level 750. Only a very small number of Chosen Ones could hope to be able to fight it.</p>
<p>It was a level of strength that most humans, whose level cap was fixed, would never reach. It would be almost impossible to even reach a level high enough to actually “do battle” against so much power.</p>
<p>Without exceptional strength, the “battle” would only devolve into “slaughter”.</p>
<p>“What’s going on!? Didn’t they say that the devil had been defeated?”</p>
<p>The guards, who firmly believed in the good news they had received, struggled to get back on their feet, to no avail.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of the heroes and devil hunter clan, the devil threatening Erkunt had been vanquished. The information had come from the kingdom’s higher ups: they couldn’t not believe it.</p>
<p>What was the creature before them then? That ominous figure and power was a devil’s through and through.</p>
<p>The guards, who had been informed about the potential threat of a devil, would naturally identify the beast destroying the walls as a devil.</p>
<p>“Someone, help…”</p>
<p>“Can anyone move?”</p>
<p>“Shit…my body feels…so heavy…”</p>
<p> Voices requesting help could be heard from here and there.</p>
<p>Some of the guards and adventurers were somehow able to stand back up, but that was all they could do. They barely had the strength to help themselves, so helping others was out of the question.</p>
<p>There were many wounded, maybe even deceased, in that place alone. No one could tell when the walls would completely crumble, letting hordes of monsters inside, even then, it was impossible for the people take shelter elsewhere.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the guards, the situation was changing. The oppressive aura suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>“My head’s spinning!”</p>
<p>“Hey! That thing disappeared!”</p>
<p>The soldiers were still having trouble regrouping, but one of them quickly recovered and shouted while looking at the walls.</p>
<p>The other soldiers looked too, but found nothing but piles of rubble, with no sign of the monster that created them. A large, gaping hole was left in its place.</p>
<p>The soldiers could also see the clouds of dust hanging over it.</p>
<p>“Something’s coming..!”</p>
<p>“Monsters!! But…wait! They’re armed!?”</p>
<p>A soldier with better eyesight than most shouted something unbelievable. The monsters marching towards the city, forming orderly files, were all clad in armor and wielding swords, spears, or other gear reinforcing their horns and fangs.</p>
<p>“Shit!! Send an emergency dispatch to the guild and the army!! If you can move, grab a weapon!! If we don’t stop them here, they’re going to break into town!!”</p>
<p>“Us against that many!? I’ve never even seen most of them! There’s no way we can stop them…we should retreat.”</p>
<p>“We can’t! If those get inside the walls, there are going to be massive casualties!!”</p>
<p>The soldiers who were shouting at each other both held their weapons with trembling hands.</p>
<p>They were guards who received training to keep the city safe. They understood very well how dangerous the packs of monsters before them were.</p>
<p>If they fought, they would, without a doubt, be annihilated. However, thinking about what would happen next, they couldn’t just withdraw. After all, the majority of the people in the city could not fight.</p>
<p>If they were attacked by monsters, they would be killed if they were lucky, or played with if they weren’t. As guards, they couldn’t simply let that happen.</p>
<p>“Dammit all!! If I could protect the city, I would do it too!!”</p>
<p>“Lend me your ideas, then. Even if we make a wall here, we’re just going to be routed.”</p>
<p>“Tch, alright. I don’t think it’s worth jack shit, but let’s buy as much time as we can with bows and magic! If you want to run away, go and don’t turn back!!”</p>
<p>Realizing that there was no time to waste arguing, the guard that was previously accusing the other guard advocating to protect the city shouted to the others. He too was one of Erkunt’s protectors: he was certainly not only worried about his own safety.</p>
<p>However, contrary to his expectations, not one guard fled.</p>
<p>“Hah, no one’s running? Guess I was a real dumbass for arguing!”</p>
<p>“Don’t think so. Our little spat here served to make some of us make up their minds.”</p>
<p>“Some fools they are. You’ve got me in this, you better get me some good booze later!”</p>
<p>“If we survive, sure enough!!”</p>
<p>A grin on their lips, born from their newfound courage, the soldiers faced the monsters. The other guards and some of the adventurers that happened to be close by were wielding their weapons too.</p>
<p>Everyone was smiling, but they knew they were way over their heads.</p>
<p>“They’re coming…”</p>
<p>The ones who used bows or long range magic were attacking, but not even one monster fell. Even if their attacks struck, the enemies’ armor protected them.</p>
<p>The troops of monsters approached, the ground trembled beneath their feet.</p>
<p>However, that foul army, could not penetrate the hole in the wall and invade the city. Flying over the soldier’s heads, a storm of lightning arrows rained upon the monsters.</p>
<p>The lightning struck through the monsters’ armor, which had repelled all magic until then, burning through their hides and scales too, putting the monsters on the front lines out of commission.</p>
<p>Some still breathed, but the damage and fear prevented them from moving. The monsters on the front lines, who had stopped in their tracks, were crushed under the feet of the monsters behind them, which couldn’t stop in time, disrupting their progress and creating chaos among the ranks.</p>
<p>“Seriously…? What was that?”</p>
<p>“It’s coming again!”</p>
<p>After the lightning storm, a rain of ice arrows started falling. However, it was hundreds of times larger than the one the soldiers knew. Rather than ice arrows, it was a rain of ice pillars: they shattered over the monsters, creating multiple ice arrows that rained over the monsters. Those outside the range of lightning were struck this time too.</p>
<p>The ice arrows, just as the lightning storm before, completely disregarded the monsters’ protective gear and hide, stabbing them as if skewering through fruit. The arrows passed through some monsters and stayed lodged in the bodies of others, but nevertheless it was enough to halt their momentum.</p>
<p>“Amazing…”</p>
<p>The spectators mumbled such comments while seeing the monsters drop one after the other.</p>
<p>If former players were present, they would have recognized that the lightning attack was the Lightning magic skill 【Thunder Split】 and the ice arrows were created by the Water magic skill 【Eis Ast】.</p>
<p>Some monsters remained, but the soldiers thought that those massive magic spells couldn’t have left many. They all agreed in their minds that such a powerful magic user had to be widely renown. Lightning and ice. Based on the spell’s power, they had to be skills, not arts. No one present, however, could think of a magic user that fit the description, so they were all puzzled.</p>
<p>This mysterious spellcaster then appeared.</p>
<p>A red long coat, hot pants and long boots, golden hair flowing in the wind. A slender silhouette, long ears and incredible magic power: the soldiers behind her realized that she had to be a High Elf.</p>
<p>At the same time, they found it unusual that she was wielding blue and red short swords. Judging from the strength of the spells, they were sure the caster was a mage with a powerful staff.</p>

<p>Before the confused guards, the High Elf pointed the red short sword in her left hand towards the remaining monsters. After a few instants, the tip started glowing deep red.</p>
<p>Flame magic skill 【Crimson Ray】.</p>
<p>A magic-powered beam of highly concentrated heat ran through the monsters, followed by bursts of flames blooming from the ground. The flames and explosions swept through the remaining monsters: the spell was much more powerful than the ones which preceded it.</p>
<p>The monsters directly struck by the beam melted away immediately: the ones who did not, regardless of how armored they were, were destroyed or burned by the explosions.</p>
<p>The heat beam then vanished, leaving behind a horrifying scene of scorched earth and corpses.</p>
<p>“What were we all ready to die for…?”</p>
<p>“Well, we did reaffirm our convictions.”</p>
<p>The situation continued changing suddenly, so the guards were left quite puzzled. At the same time, though, they were also relieved. While it could be temporary, the threat was now gone.</p>
<p>They could not feel reassured for long, however.</p>
<p>“Hey!! There are monsters running amok in town!! If you can fight, come help us!!”</p>
<p>“What!?!”</p>
<p>The guards, flabbergasted by the High Elf and the magic she wielded, were forcefully brought back to reality by a new warning, heard from inside the castle walls.</p>
<p>There were monsters already inside the city: the guards thought that the city’s gates had been penetrated. Closing the gates would allow them to resist for a while, but if a large number of monsters attacked them from behind, the area around the gates would fall into panic. The possibility that the gates fell before being closed was more than likely.</p>
<p>“The only walls or gates breached were here. I do not know the cause, but it seems that monsters suddenly appeared within the city. Their levels are low, but their numbers great: it seems this is happening on a wide range too. I will seal the gap here, so please start subjugating them from the closest location.”</p>
<p>After finishing off the few remaining monster units, the High Elf talked to the guards in a clearly resounding tone.</p>
<p>The monsters she saw while heading to the outer walls were level 100 at most. Their numbers were many, but it was nothing the guards and adventurers could not handle.</p>
<p>“Damn, just what the hell is going on here?”</p>
<p>“Easy there. If what she says is true, we can handle it. Let’s leave this place to her and go somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“Can’t be helped!!”</p>
<p>Some were overwhelmed, some complained, others were relieved. While the reactions were all different, they all took up arms and scattered.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 2</p>
<p>“I have to hurry.”</p>
<p>After the guards and adventurers left, the High Elf looked at the walls and whispered to herself.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the monsters and magic spells, the guards had not realized that the High Elf was Schnee in disguise. Because of the disguise, she had chosen light equipment that was easy to move in.</p>
<p>Except for the one spot that had crumbled, the outer walls were untouched. It wasn’t clear how much they had been damaged by the aftershocks.</p>
<p>In order to prevent further damage to the walls, Schnee had first crushed the closest enemies with 【Thunder Split】 and 【Eis Ast】, then took care of the rest with 【Crimson Ray】.</p>
<p>If she started with【Crimson Ray】 , she would have dealt with them even faster, but the resulting explosions and flames risked damaging the walls even further.</p>
<p>“I better reinforce them to be safe.”</p>
<p>If the walls were left as is, they would invite invasions by other monsters. Schnee used Earth magic to form a net of tightly packed earth, then created a giant wall of ice to contain it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Schnee’s magic power, the resulting barrier was as sturdy as the walls. The ice would melt over time, but, as an emergency countermeasure, it was more than enough. Even if Schnee did not do anything more, it would last one full week.</p>
<p>“Were those all the monsters…?”</p>
<p>Schnee climbed on the outer walls and surveyed the forest where the monsters supposedly hid. Her detection range wasn’t as wide as Shin’s, but it was wide enough to cover her field of view. There were no movements similar to the one just before in the forest or other locations.</p>
<p> The monster presences were just in groups of two or three. Their directions and movements were all different, so they were likely unrelated to the invasion.</p>
<p>“Let’s take care of the monsters inside, then.”</p>
<p>She could go to the closest location, but instead peered at the map and the presences she had detected. Defeating monsters alone would not resolve the problem, so she first tried to find monsters that exhibited unique behavior or locations with abnormal concentrations of monsters.</p>
<p>If not defeating Avaritia meant that monsters would continue spawning, she just needed to keep going until Shin defeated it. But, if that was not the case, Schnee had to find the cause behind the monster’s appearance and deal with it.</p>
<p>“!! That’s…”</p>
<p>A few minutes had passed when Schnee’s eyes focused on one point of the map. After the monsters moved away from a spot where they were looking for prey, it suddenly happened. In the now empty spot, new monsters suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>“I see, the monsters are being sent from somewhere. I guess they setup such points throughout the city.”</p>
<p>It was either a Tamer’s 【Summon Partner】 or a teleportation point. Schnee ran towards the spot where the monsters appeared, using the rooftops as platforms. She found monsters running wild with greater quantity near the spawning point.</p>
<p>“Out of the way.”</p>
<p>Schnee resolutely advanced through the monsters in the streets. With pale blue flames from 『Lazuli Flare』 in her left hand and blazing red flames from 『Scarlet Blaze』 in her right, Schnee let out fiery slashes that scarred the monsters before spreading to their whole body and burning them to cinders.</p>
<p>As if performing a beautiful ritual dance of slaughter, Schnee advanced while leaving mounds of ash in her wake. The monsters in town were low level and unarmed, so it was an inevitable result.</p>
<p>She could have used the roofs to proceed while ignoring the monsters, but she opted to use the ground route to help the citizens and adventurers in trouble. Crushing the main cause was the quickest way to solve the situation, but Schnee wasn’t so cold as to let people die in front of her.</p>
<p>Shin would do the same, she thought.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>Schnee arrived at her destination and found a store like any other. The entrance, however, was destroyed and monsters prowled about. She quickly incinerated them and entered the store.</p>
<p>The main cause of the issues was likely to be found inside the destroyed store. What Schnee found, however, was slightly surprising.</p>
<p>The stockroom was about five mel wide. In front of the magic circle drawn on the floor, a wizard-looking silhouette was wielding a staff. Before Schnee’s eyes, the magic circle glowed and a monster appeared. Accompanied by a groan of pain from the man.</p>
<p>“Hel….p…..”</p>
<p>A strained voice escaped the man’s lips, his wand still in the air, the monster before him.</p>
<p>Schnee noticed that the man’s cheeks were emaciated, his skin ravaged, as if he was about to die. What hair remained was unnaturally white. He was just like a mummy wielding a wand.</p>
<p>All the signs indicated that the man had been subjected to powerful drain attacks.</p>
<p>“How horrible…”</p>
<p>Schnee realized the truth by looking at the man. During the 500 years she had spent waiting for Shin, she had seen many, many things, of which some were unspeakable horrors.</p>
<p>The perpetrators were sometimes people, sometimes monsters. What happened to the man was not too rare. He had been forced to summon monsters, effectively being used as a magic battery. This often happened when the culprit was a person.</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Schnee silently wielded her 『Lazuli Flare』. A blue slash streaked through the air and severed the man’s neck. His corpse was engulfed in blue flames as it hit the ground, burning into ashes.</p>
<p>When the man died, the magic circle went silent. It was connected to his lifeforce, which was converted into magic power to feed the magic circle.</p>
<p>When Schnee found the man, his HP and magic were already zero. The only reason he was conscious was that he was kept alive to drain away his magic power. There was no way to save him, but it was possible to at least put him out of his misery by finishing him.</p>
<p>“Is this happening in the other locations too?”</p>
<p>Just in case, Schnee used the screenshot function Shin taught her and recorded the magic circle. If the same method was used elsewhere, the summoning would stop when the caster died. It was possible that, if enough time had passed, the summoning circles would become useless on their own.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no concrete proof. Some areas might have had different summoning methods, or the monsters summoned could constantly increase in power.</p>
<p>Schnee decided to disregard this option and crush all spawning locations. She checked her map again, narrowing down the options to stores or stockrooms large enough to house the magic circle.</p>
<p>“This is strange…”</p>
<p>The monster presences in the city.</p>
<p>She had not kept count of them, so she did not know at what pace they increased, but according to Schnee’s experience, magic circles allowed to summon one monster every few minutes. In one hour, that would amount to 20 or 30 monsters at most.</p>
<p>Only about 30 minutes had passed since the outer walls crumbled, yet, the monsters had increased at an extremely fast pace, which meant that there was a large number of magic circles.</p>
<p>However, Schnee felt something strange from the numbers of spawning locations, as well as the locations they were set up in.</p>
<p>In the beginning she only searched for location large enough to house the magic circle, so she hadn’t noticed, but she realized that monsters were appearing in very unusual places.</p>
<p>“There’s a spawning location in the middle of the street? The citizens or guards would definitely realize…”</p>
<p>The location was easy to find, but difficult to set up. As far as Schnee could tell, the magic circles were not concealed in any way.</p>
<p>“This presence…is moving despite there being no paths here…?”</p>
<p>Schnee spotted a few presences moving through walls in the shopping area. However, they were moving far too fast. It was like there were no obstacles in their way. Schnee then had a realization and modified the map to show a 3D display, showing the underground too.</p>
<p>“I see…the underground waterways.”</p>
<p>Even if they weren’t as developed as the former Sacred Places, cities that reached a certain size created underground waterways. They reached everywhere under the city, just like waterways of modern cities, and it was said that few people in the country knew about their total extension. That is where the magic circles were set up.</p>
<p>“This is not good.”</p>
<p>They were far too many for Schnee to crush by herself. Some of the presences were also moving beyond the internal walls, inside the royal palace.</p>
<p>“Miss Yuki!”</p>
<p>The numbers were not on their side. Schnee was thinking of a countermeasure while going to the closest point, when she heard someone shouting her name.</p>
<p>It was Masakado, his loyal weapon at his side, with a group of adventurers in tow.</p>
<p>“I apologize to bother you when you’re in a hurry. Is there a way to solve this situation? We have been destroying all monsters we saw on our way here, but it doesn’t look like they’re decreasing at all.”</p>
<p>It was the first time they talked in a while, but Masakado skipped all preambles and went straight to the point. Schnee quickly reported her findings.</p>
<p>“Summoning using people as fuel, and the underground waterways…”</p>
<p>“There are many monster summoning magic circles above ground, but the numbers underground are considerable as well. Maybe the pace of the summoning will not increase over time, but considering who our opponent is, I doubt things will go over easily.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen them too, they seem like a pretty nasty bunch.”</p>
<p>Masakado said that many witnessed the destruction of the walls. He himself never participated in a devil extermination mission, but he had seen what devils looked like from message boards related to the game. When he saw the monster destroying the wall, he remembered instantly.</p>
<p>“It might be dangerous, so I don’t like saying this, but we seriously need manpower. Rather than waiting for the summoners turned magic batteries to expire, we should defeat them in order to reduce potential casualties. If you have a map, I can show you the general locations. I need the cooperation of as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>“Roger! I’m sure I can help with that!”</p>
<p>Based on the monsters being summoned, simply putting the magic circles out of commission was possible even for those who weren’t Chosen Ones, so Masakado turned to the adventurers.</p>
<p>“You heard, right? We need numbers more than anything. If we subdue the places where the monsters are being summoned, the situation will improve significantly. We can’t let them do whatever they please like this! But if things turn sour, run!”</p>
<p>Masakado’s words were met by an energetic “Roger!!”.</p>
<p>It would be just as dangerous to fight the monsters prowling the city. All the adventurers present nodded without hesitation. Some of them ran to contact the guild and the guards.</p>
<p>Schnee wrote down the location of the magic circles on Masakado’s map, made copies with a skill and gave them to the other adventurers, who split in groups of three and scattered throughout the town.</p>
<p>“What will you do Masakado?”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay above ground and deal with the more difficult looking spots or areas with a higher density of monsters.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will go underground. Just in case, take this.”</p>
<p>Schnee then gave a stack of cards to Masakado, potions especially made by Shin. They healed more than regular ones and acted instantly.</p>
<p>“Never let your guard down. Or Hilamee will be really sad.”</p>
<p>“Yes…I know. I am more worried about her though, since she is in the institute.”</p>
<p>Luxuria is in the institute: Avaritia was surely headed towards her.</p>
<p>“Shin is going to the institute as we speak. He also set up anti-devil traps, so I believe everything will be alright.”</p>
<p>“That’s true…okay, time to get busy!”</p>
<p>Masakado ran off towards the monsters with an expression full of confidence.</p>
<p>While he was worried, he didn’t let it show. He knew what he had to do.</p>
<p>“I can’t lose either, can I.”</p>
<p>Schnee also started moving right away. Her first destination was the entrance to the underground waterways. She had to exterminate the monsters, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 3</p>
<p>Shortly before the outer walls were destroyed and monsters started spawning in Erkunt…</p>
<p>Something abnormal happened inside the royal palace.</p>
<p>Most soldiers were gathered in the training grounds, separated into platoons, to check their equipment. They were all nervous, some of them confused.</p>
<p>“To think that there were other devils…”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the institute was keeping it hidden? If so, then the staff is…”</p>
<p>All soldiers on stand-by were whispering.</p>
<p>Just when everyone in the palace was relieved by the news of Avaritia’s defeat, another piece of news had arrived. All palace workers and especially the soldiers were shaken.</p>
<p>They had to fight with mere swords and spears against a beast that could level entire cities. No matter how many they were, they could never hope to match it.</p>
<p>There weren’t enough anti-devil weapons to supply the whole army.</p>
<p>“I heard that the anti-devil clan guys were possessed by the devil.”</p>
<p>“If they fight alongside the devil, we have to fight them too, right? Can we really win?”</p>
<p>Information was spreading in a chaotic manner. Conflicting information was reaching even the lowest ranked soldiers. They all talked about information, regardless of its veracity, and believed it all.</p>
<p>“Hey, what is going on here!?”</p>
<p>There were some who hadn’t lost all reason, though. One of Erkunt’s heroes, Fagall, and the knights serving directly under him.</p>
<p>When Fagall returned to the castle after an inspection outside Erkunt, he found the soldiers ready for war, with a heavy atmosphere hanging over them.</p>
<p>The confused Fagall asked nearby soldiers what was going on and was told that the captain of the royal guards personally ordered them to go exterminate the devil dwelling in the institute.</p>
<p>“This can’t be…”</p>
<p>Information about Luxuria had been halted by the country’s elite. It was impossible for mere footsoldiers to know about it.</p>
<p>The captain of the royal guards, Namsaar, also knew that Luxuria opposed Avaritia and would not harm normal people.</p>
<p>Fagall then asked the soldiers if anything happened about the devils, as there had to be a reason behind this order. All soldiers, however, replied that they did not know anything.</p>
<p>They also spouted unbelievable things, such as that Shin and Yuki were on the devil’s side and the institute as a whole was under the devil’s control.</p>
<p>“Just what is going on here…”</p>
<p>“I believe that there are mental skills at work. You can train your body, but things are different for the mind.”</p>
<p>One of Fagall’s subordinates, specialized in magic and healing, gave her opinion. She was one of Fagall’s vice-captains, a female Chosen One called Nakuri.</p>
<p>“So that’s the reason why I feel this indescribable unease…if so, we have an emergency on your hands. I will go inquire to His Majesty. Based on the circumstances, we might need the King’s permission to act. Kassh, Nakuri, take the knights with you and go ask Lady Sherlene what’s going on. If they are already in formation in a platoon, tell them to standby until I come back. I’ll take responsibility. And…”</p>
<p>“Be ready to fight, yes?”</p>
<p>The stern-looking man called Kassh completed Fagall’s order. He too was a Chosen One.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Nakuri, use defensive skills on the men, as much as possible. If you feel the atmosphere becomes more suspicious, retreat from the palace. If we end up under the enemy’s influence too, there will be no one left to protect the kingdom.”</p>
<p>“…understood. Please take care.”</p>
<p>Both vice-captains replied at the same time, but Kassh sounded not completely convinced, while Nakuri was worried. Kassh out of frustration for not being able to do anything, Nakuri out of concern for Fagall, who would be left on his own.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we can learn something.”</p>
<p>Fagall passed through the pacing soldiers, hurrying towards the king’s chambers.</p>
<p>“It’s too quiet…”</p>
<p>Normally, the king would be carrying out his duties at this time. Fagall noticed that the more he approached the king’s chambers, the less noise he heard.</p>
<p>Armed soldiers would not be found in this area, but if there was another reason for the lack of people in the surroundings, the situation was extremely dire.</p>
<p>Fagall hurried even more, trying to keep his nerves in check. He arrived close to the room where the king executed his duties and found two soldiers standing guard. Fagall knew both of them.</p>
<p>“Is His Majesty here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but why the hurry? Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“The whole castle is. The soldiers are getting ready to go exterminate the devil, but I came to check with the king if there are no mistakes about their orders.”</p>
<p>Fagall didn’t know where Namsaar, the one who actually gave the order, could be. As he told Kassh and the others, the king had to be aware of the situation, so Fagall came to ask him about the reasons behind the order, while also making sure the king was safe.</p>
<p>“I have heard nothing about such orders. Could it be that your information is wrong?”</p>
<p>“I understand why you would think that. The soldiers below, however, are preparing to battle this very moment. There is conflicting information going about, but as far as I heard, they were told that there is a devil in the institute.”</p>
<p>The guards looked just as confused as Fagall was when he arrived in the castle. Fagall then judged that they hadn’t lost their reason yet.</p>
<p>“I wish to speak directly to the king.”</p>
<p>“Just a moment.”</p>
<p>One of the guards turned his back to Fagall and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>While he was supposedly speaking with the king inside, the other guard held the hilt of his weapon and kept Fagall firmly within sight. Even if confused, he would not let down his guard. Not even if his opponent was a hero or an acquaintance. That was their job.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, the first guard turned the doorknob and allowed Fagall inside. The other guard silently opened his side of the door too.</p>
<p>“For you to come without prior notice…what is happening?”</p>
<p>Kreunzeit understood right away that something was off. After hearing Fagall’s report, the king’s brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“That is a first for me too. Namsaar would inform me first of all.”</p>
<p>“I do not know why this happened. I did not know where sir Namsaar is, so I decided to confirm Your Majesty’s safety first.”</p>
<p>“You have done well. What in the world is—what!?”</p>
<p>A booming sound interrupted Kreunzeit’s words. The sound came from the direction of the window: Fagall looked outside and saw a wall crumbling, with an enormous monster attacking it.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>Fagall was speechless for a moment. A wall that could easily withstand attacks from giant-sized golems was destroyed, revealing a horde of monsters behind it.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? What happened?”</p>
<p>“The outer wall has been destroyed. It couldn’t withstand the attacks of a gigantic monster.”</p>
<p>The king’s words let Fagall return to his senses. He then started reflecting on what he just saw. Then, he realized. A human-like shape. A torso with a lion head grafted onto it. A head wearing a goat skull coming out of the lion’s mouth. It all coincided with Sherlene’s report about Avaritia’s appearance.</p>
<p>“This is absurd…why would the devil be here…?”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t lady Sherlene supposed to have defeated it?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. The soldiers who went to inspect the area said that they found clear traces of fighting.”</p>
<p>If so, then why? Doubts and questions ran through Fagall’s mind.</p>
<p>Maybe they only thought they defeated it? Maybe it managed to flee? The reason was unknown, but the reality that the devil was attacking was an undeniable truth.</p>
<p>“It disappeared? Is it going to where lady Luxuria is?”</p>
<p>The devil’s gigantic body disappeared in an instant. Fagall thought he saw a small shadow, so he hypothesized that the devil turned into human form and went into the city. Based on the information he had, the destination was surely the institute.</p>
<p>Should he rush to the crumbling walls? Go fight the devil in the institute? Stay here to protect the king? A series of choices appeared within Fagall’s mind.</p>
<p>If the devil went on a rampage, the city would surely suffer extensive damage. The monsters approaching from beyond the crumbling walls could not be ignored either, though. No matter what he prioritized, damage and casualties were inevitable.</p>
<p>Fagall was unsure what to decide, but one of the choices was quickly crushed. The monsters outside the walls were swept away by magic spells, the gap in the wall sealed with ice.</p>
<p>“That has to be either sir Shin or lady Yuki’s doing.”</p>
<p>“Yes. That should prevent the monsters from penetrating the city.”</p>
<p>“Then all is left is to deal with the devil. I do not know if Namsaar predicted this, but the situation is in our favor. Select the troops equipped with anti-devil gear and send them to exterminate it. Sir Shin’s group is certainly on the move as well. If possible, join with them and take down the devil.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>There were too many potential risks. Defeating the devil, however, took priority. Fagall was about to leave to execute the order he received.</p>
<p>“Hngh!?”</p>
<p>He put a hand on the doorknob, but jumped back as if something had repelled him. Fagall drew his sword, warily looking at the door.</p>
<p>“…I suspected there was someone behind the soldiers’ confusion, but I suppose they came straight here.”</p>
<p>“Please flee. This ominous presence…it will be a very dangerous opponent.”</p>
<p>Outside the room, there were the guards too. Considering that this new threat had approached the room without Fagall realizing, it had to be an assassin very skilled at hiding their presence.</p>
<p>Fagall could not tell how powerful the enemy was, but estimated them to be very able, so he immediately asked the king to escape. If Fagall fought seriously, the king would be in danger too.</p>
<p>“Well damn. I thought I had finally taken over this guy, and here I find another pain to deal with.”</p>
<p>As Kreunzeit leapt into the secret passage, the door opened. The voice heard as the door revealed the intruder was very familiar to Fagall. Its tone was very casual, however. Fagall knew that the owner of this voice would never use such a tone.</p>
<p>“I surely didn’t want this prediction to come true…”</p>
<p>Fagall whispered to himself, looking at the man who entered the room.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t say that? We’re pals, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ve ever met. Who are you? What did you to Namsaar!?”</p>
<p>Voice, body, 【Analyze】 data—everything said Namsaar. The ominous black armor that covered its body, the goat bones that covered half its face, however, clearly showed that Namsaar was not currently himself.</p>
<p>Probably because he had just seen Avaritia, Fagall quickly realized who had taken over Namsaar’s body.</p>
<p>“My other self was knocked out before they even managed to introduce themselves, so I guess I better do it, yeah? You are in the presence of one of the Seven Deady Sins, Avaritia the devil of Greed. You….are not the one who defeated my other self in the dungeon, are you.”</p>
<p>Avaritia peered at Fagall and spoke after he had gauged the knight’s skill.</p>
<p>Avaritia’s words let Fagall understand that the devil could create copies of itself. He didn’t know how many, however.</p>
<p>“Your other self, hmm. Which means, if you are defeated here everything will be over?”</p>
<p>Let it be so. Fagall tried his hardest to hide his nerves and asked the question.</p>
<p>“Too bad buddy, I’m not the real body either. If you take me down things will be easier though, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Avaritia drew his sword, Namsaar’s loyal partner. Its blade had lost all its shine: black vein-like tendrils ran across it.</p>
<p>“I might be an enemy, but this is your comrade’s body. You know what it means to attack me, yeah?”</p>
<p>“I surely do!”</p>
<p>Fagall answered Avaritia’s threat by swinging his sword. He aimed at the face, the side not covered by the goat mask. Avaritia parried Fagall’s unhesitant strike with his sword.</p>
<p>Fagall saw how his swing had been effortlessly blocked, despite the fact that he had not held back at all, and realized that his opponent might be using Namsaar’s body, but his abilities exceeded the host body’s limits.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty strict on your buddies, huh?”</p>
<p>“Sir Namsaar would take me to task if I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>Hiding his concern about his opponent’s actual strength, Fagall replied in turn to Avaritia’s quip. While it might be hard to imagine from his appearance and atmosphere, Namsaar was extremely loyal to the king. His fighting prowess and loyalty had granted him the position of captain of the royal guards.</p>
<p>If Namsaar was himself, he would rather take his own life rather than point his sword at the king.</p>
<p>Thus Fagall knew that he had no reason to hesitate. Ready to take Namsaar’s life if need be, he once again swung his blade.</p>
<p>“Is that so. Let’s see how long you can struggle, then!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s blade clashed with Fagall’s. The devil’s movements were the same as Namsaar’s. Every strike was much heavier, though.</p>
<p>“Plenty, you will see. I cannot be useless forever.”</p>
<p>Fagall had his pride as a hero as well. If necessary, he was ready to die and take his enemy with him.</p>
<p>The two warriors’ blades crossed again. Even brighter sparks flew about, as if to show the strength of Fagall’s renewed conviction.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>A thundering sound made the ground tremble, echoing through the palace gates and training grounds. In response, abnormal events happened throughout the palace.</p>
<p>Monsters appeared out of thin air. Their levels were low, but the soldiers fell into confusion because of the sudden event. The booming sound that deafened their ears was a sort of signal.</p>
<p>“What is going on here…?”</p>
<p>The monsters appeared when Sherlene, informed of the order to exterminate Luxuria, was in the barracks to inquire further about the sudden orders. Sherlene rushed out of the barracks and found the training grounds in utter chaos: soldiers feeling from monsters and others fighting them.</p>
<p>“What the..!?”</p>
<p>The soldiers were supposed to be well trained, so even if the monsters had appeared all too suddenly, their response was far too poor.</p>
<p>“Do not cower!! Troops with shields, go to the front and block the monster’s attacks! Troops with spears, gain enough distance and seal their movements! The monsters are few! Face each of them in groups!”</p>
<p>Sherlene shouted orders at the soldiers, also using the support skill 【Hearten】, used to encourage one’s allies. Even the platoon leaders were panicked: there was no time to worry about the chain of command.</p>
<p>Struck by Sherlene’s orders, the soldiers started moving in a well organized manner, making it seem unreal that they were running around until moments ago. Sherlene then realized that they had to be influenced by something.</p>
<p>“So that was the reason why the soldiers’ information was compromised?”</p>
<p>“It does seem to be like that.”</p>
<p>Sherlene talked to herself, but received an answer.</p>
<p>“Sir Kassh.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am. I and Nakuri have been ordered by sir Fagall to contact you.”</p>
<p>Kassh related to Sherlene about the bizarre situation in the castle and that Fagall had gone to see the king.</p>
<p>“I am glad to see that you seem to be in full possession of your wits.”</p>
<p>“No, I did not notice the situation before, so I cannot say that I was not influenced at all. I heard just now about the order to exterminate lady Luxuria, but it would be strange for me not to realize the soldiers’ unusual state. Taking down a devil is not such a simple task either…”</p>
<p>Sherlene remembered the battle against Avaritia and her brow furrowed. She then materialized a spear. It was one of the weapons she borrowed from Shin, the holy spear 『Guildern』.</p>
<p>“I have never seen such a spear. It is quite heavily adorned.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>An instant after materializing 『Guildern』, Sherlene opened her eyes wide and stopped. Kassh, concerned, called to her: Sherlene regained her senses and shouted.</p>
<p>“What…what a blunder!!”</p>
<p>『Guildern』 was a holy spear meant to fight devils. Because of this, it could protect the wielder from devil attacks and dispel devil influences.</p>
<p>Depending on the devil’s power, it might only weaken their powers, but this 『Guildern』 had been reinforced by Shin, so it was more powerful than the default version.</p>
<p>Thanks to its boosted ability, the fake memories Avaritia’s copy had planted in Sherlene disappeared. She recalled the conversation she had with Hilamee.</p>
<p>Avaritia hadn’t been defeated yet. There were copies remaining. Something was controlling Namsaar too.</p>
<p>“Sir Kassh, Lady Nakuri. I want you to take my troops and take care of the monsters. The chaos will continue, I fear. Also, do not follow sir Namsaar’s orders.”</p>
<p>Namsaar was the captain of the royal guards: he had nearly unlimited access to the royal palace. Sherlene thought that the monsters’ appearance had been orchestrated by him, or rather, whatever was controlling him.</p>
<p>She chose not to say it at the time, however. The presence that had hid in the shadows until now finally showed itself. Sherlene was also concerned about the sound that thundered through the castle minutes before, but there were other, greater priorities.</p>
<p>The king’s safety, most of all. If the leader of the royal guards was under enemy control and the king dead, the whole country would fall into chaos. It would be almost impossible to bring things under control.</p>
<p>There was enough confusion because of the monsters rampaging in the palace. For the devil, it was the perfect chance to strike. Sherlene thought that Avaritia aimed to take advantage of the confusion to kill Luxuria.</p>
<p>“If it appears in town, not even sir Shin could…”</p>
<p>Thanks to her experience fighting against the copy, Sherlene understood very well how dire the current situation was.</p>
<p>“Lady Sherlene. Do you know what is actually happening?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but forgive me, there is no time to talk. We must take control of the situation as soon as possible, then have the citizens take shelter. This is just a prediction, but I believe that the monsters have appeared in town too. The devil I and sir Shin defeated was a copy. There is also another one in the palace too.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think so??”</p>
<p>“Oh my god…”</p>
<p>The two vice captains could not hide their surprise at Sherlene’s statement.</p>
<p>“That devil is more and more dangerous the more people are around. We have to make everyone…no, everyone still alive evacuate the palace and institute as soon as we can.”</p>
<p>While she said it, Sherlene was aware that it would be impossible. There wasn’t enough time or manpower in Erkunt at the moment.</p>
<p>“I will go see His Majesty. Sir Fagall is probably fighting the devil as we speak. I must leave the monsters here to you. If possible, have the citizens take shelter too.”</p>
<p>Sherlene hurriedly gave her orders, then rushed deeper in the palace, towards the royal duties’ chamber.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 4</p>
<p>At the same time the heroes started moving inside the royal palace, someone in the institute noticed the abnormal occurrences.</p>
<p>A devil just like Avaritia, Luxuria.</p>
<p>“!? No way…!”</p>
<p>Luxuria thought Avaritia was still far from Erkunt. All of a sudden, however, that distance became zero. The devil’s presence moved right next to Erkunt’s outer walls in an instant.</p>
<p>“Luxuria? What happened?”</p>
<p>Luxuria stood up out of the blue and was looking in a certain direction. Hilamee called to her, but Luxuria couldn’t reply.</p>
<p>She took out a message card and quickly started writing on it, thinking that she had to let Shin know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“Sent! Hilamee, I think that Avaritia will be coming here any minute. Evacuate the students!”</p>
<p>After sending the message, Luxuria explained the situation to the confused Hilamee. While Luxuria was talking, the booming sounds gave further credibility to her words.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too soon!? To cover a few days’ worth of distance all at once is impossible without teleporting…wait, you don’t mean…”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s abnormal appearance could be explained in one way. Hilamee reached the same conclusion Shin and Schnee did: as a player she used teleportation on a daily basis after all.</p>
<p>“A devil using player techniques…well, I can do similar things after all.”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s expression was indescribable. The institute was riddled with the anti-devil traps Shin had set up. Luxuria had also borrowed anti-devil items which wouldn’t affect the user, so it could be said that she was doing similar things to Avaritia.</p>
<p>“That’s enough contemplation, evacuate the students already. Avaritia will probably come here: I’ll stay as a decoy.”</p>
<p>Luxuria was surprised by Avaritia’s sudden appearance, but she felt his presence even now.</p>
<p>He wasn’t heading straight for the institute. Even if its path was a roundabout one, the presence gradually approaching the institute was without a doubt Avaritia’s.</p>
<p>“Please don’t use that word.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, it feels nice to hear you say that.”</p>
<p>Luxuria tried to relieve the atmosphere, but Hilamee’s expression was deadly serious.</p>
<p>“I was wary of you in the beginning, but now I consider you one of us. You’re going to keep protecting the institute with us, so don’t you dare get absorbed by that Greed!!”</p>
<p>“No need for concern. I haven’t the slightest intention to.”</p>
<p>Luxuria saw Hilamee off, a reassuring expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Why did you have to go and say something so nice…”</p>
<p>Luxuria whispered towards the door as she felt Hilamee’s presence go.</p>
<p>From a devil’s standpoint, people were supposed to be nothing more than cattle to satisfy their desires. Whether to raise them or slaughter them was up to each devil’s will. At least originally.</p>
<p>The feelings born in Luxuria’s heart, however, were very far from her original instincts.</p>
<p>“This is so strange…I’m supposed to be a devil, and yet…”</p>
<p>Luxuria then pulled out a message card and another card from her bosom. Pictured on the card was a human-shaped slime-like being, in the process of being erased by the rays emitted by a globe of light. It was a very powerful anti-devil item: Shin had told Luxuria to use Avaritia as a shield if she had to use it.</p>
<p>“One wrong move and it’s suicide, so I didn’t want to use it…but if worse comes to worst, I’ll have to. I wonder why I’m able to think like this…”</p>
<p>Luxuria questioned herself while looking at the item that could very well blow her away too.</p>
<p>She had already performed many actions unthinkable for a devil. Luxuria didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>However, there was no time to look for answers. She felt that the presence had entered the institute. It had probably destroyed one of the walls protecting it.</p>
<p>Following Avaritia’s presence, an avalanche of monsters broke in too.</p>
<p>“Looks like Hilamee and the others are okay.”</p>
<p>Hilamee had already planned an escape route, so she acted quickly. The teleport had already been activated: only Luxuria remained in the institute.</p>
<p>Avaritia too detected Luxuria’s presence and proceeded on a straight line towards her, uncaring for any obstacles or buildings in the way.</p>
<p>Luxuria didn’t move an inch. Avaritia probably thought that she had given up on resisting or planned to face him without fleeing.</p>
<p>Though, both assumptions would be wrong. Luxuria told Hilamee that she would act as a decoy, but her aim was to let Hilamee and the others flee and also lure Avaritia into a trap.</p>
<p>“Two devils with the same level, disregarding affinity, are pretty much equal. He’s stronger than me for now, but there’s no reason to fight head-on like a simpleton.”</p>
<p>The distant noise of destruction reached Luxuria’s ears. Avaritia had stepped into Shin’s trap zone.</p>
<p>Like Luxuria, Avaritia was likely aware of the existence of anti-devil traps. If her memory was correct, they could damage devils, but not straight up kill them.</p>
<p>Shin’s traps, however, far exceeded Luxuria’s memory. Maybe it was because the traps Luxuria knew of had been made by inexperienced players, but Shin’s traps had far superior offensive power.</p>
<p>The explosions continued. Even the sounds caused by the anti-devil traps making the air vibrate and made Luxuria jolt when they reached her ears.</p>
<p>Some of Shin’s traps were set up to activate chain reactions, so underestimating them would result in very painful regret.</p>
<p>Shin’s traps exceeded Luxuria’s knowledge such that she even thought that there was the possibility that Avaritia decided to retreat.</p>
<p>However—</p>
<p>“Oh my, you’re looking quite manly now.”</p>
<p>Sitting in the infirmary’s chair, Luxuria spoke to Avaritia. He hadn’t stopped even if damaged by the traps, and was now right before Luxuria.</p>
<p>Because of the destruction, the infirmary was half wrecked too.</p>
<p>“You can say thAt again. Thanks to that, I was fORced to eat up All the fodDEr I brought wIth me.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s body was covered in wounds, though they were gradually healing. His HP was also down to about 10%.</p>
<p>Luxuria almost wanted to praise him for surviving the traps with only 10% HP left. If he had done so with only his powers though.</p>
<p>The presence of the monsters which entered the institute was completely gone. Some had probably been destroyed by the aftershocks of Shin’s traps, but most had been devoured by Avaritia.</p>
<p>Low-level monsters couldn’t survive Avaritia’s drain. Their presence was gone, probably because Avaritia’s 【Lifedrain Sludge】 had swallowed them, corpse and all.</p>
<p>“You would be even manlier if you went through another round of that, you know? …by the way, are you a man now?”</p>
<p>“GendErs don’t mAtter to dEVIls. WhAT’s manlY abOUt this faCe, anYWay.”</p>
<p>Avaritia, in devil form, looked down on Luxuria. As they spoke, his 【Lifedrain Sludge】 was in the process of surrounding the building and her.</p>
<p>“We finally meet after all this time, why not chat a little bit?”</p>
<p>“AftEr thoSE trAps? You SUrelY haVe somethINg else in stoRe.”</p>
<p>Avaritia didn’t let his guard down: the traps had surely given him a rough time. The 【Lifedrain Sludge】 generated by his lower body rushed towards the half-destroyed infirmary.</p>
<p>“TheRe were MORE?”</p>
<p>Avaritia cursed under his breath. The 【Lifedrain Sludge】 that tried to attack Luxuria was blocked by a barrier of light, so it couldn’t get any closer.</p>
<p>It was a barrier set up by Shin, of course. Though it was a trap originally used to seal devils inside, this time it was used to protect the sealed devil from the attacks of others.</p>
<p>“You cAn’t attACk eithEr LIke this…yOU’re buying tIMe.”</p>
<p>“Bingo.”</p>
<p>Avaritia turned towards the presence approaching him and Luxuria grinned smugly. That High Human wouldn’t stay quiet in such a situation. That was the reason why Luxuria chose not to move and buy time.</p>
<p>“Tch…GWAAH!?!”</p>
<p>Avaritia started gathering the 【Lifedrain Sludge】 around himself, as a rain of shining spears fell on him.</p>
<p>【Lifedrain Sludge】 was only slightly faster, forming a sphere, it acted as a wall against the spears. The devil managed to protect himself in the nick of time. Avaritia thought so, but only for mere seconds.</p>
<p>Those spears didn’t just disappear after being blocked. They kept thrusting towards Avaritia, trying to break through the 【Lifedrain Sludge】 barrier.</p>
<p>Just like booster-powered harpoons, they gradually scattered the 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>“NNGH!!”</p>
<p>Avaritia wouldn’t just stay there and suffer though. With arms more powerful than its copies, it punched away the spears blocked by the 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>Not even the spears could stand such attacks: leaving behind trails of light, they were sent flying and stuck in the piles of rubble.</p>
<p>“ThE bASTard is hEre…”</p>
<p>Ignoring his sizzling fists, caused by the contact with the spears, Avaritia looked in the direction from which the spears came. What he saw was a knight clad in blue and silver armor.</p>
<p>“You went straight to Luxuria, so you’re the main body I wager?”</p>
<p>『The Ark』 slung over his shoulder, 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』 protecting his body, Shin spoke.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“You’vE tAKen good CAre of my coPIes…”</p>
<p>“No need to thank me. My business is with you.”</p>
<p>Shin gauged the current situation while looking up at Avaritia.</p>
<p>Avaritia’s attack had reduced 1/4 of the institute into rubble. Shin also noticed that the traps had affected Avaritia with weakening debuffs. The only other presence he detected was Luxuria’s: Hilamee and the others had clearly evacuated already.</p>
<p>“Luxuria, don’t step a foot out of there!”</p>
<p>“I know. Even if I tried to force my way out, I wouldn’t be unscathed.”</p>
<p>Luxuria tried touching the light barrier, but her hand was pushed back with a loud snap. The barrier was originally meant to constrict devils, so its effect was tried and true. It blocked magic power from traveling inside or outside it, making it perfect for creating a safe area.</p>
<p>“Is YOuR liTtle chaT oVEr?”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s 【Lifedrain Sludge】 erupted from under Shin’s feet. The devil had moved it underground to strike an ambush.</p>
<p>Shin, however, dispelled the attack by drawing a circle with his 『The Ark』.</p>
<p>“I exPecTed as much, but that swORd is a royAl pain.”</p>
<p>Avaritia probably shared memories with his copies. It was supposed to be the first time the main body saw 『The Ark』, but he didn’t show signs of surprise.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18073 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Armored-Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>(He’s stronger than the last one?)</p>
<p>Shin found the sensation transmitted by 『The Ark』 to be peculiar.</p>
<p>During the previous battle against Avaritia’s copy, 【Lifedrain Sludge】 hadn’t proven to be much of an obstacle.</p>
<p>Thanks to 『Holy Armor – Vanquisher of Evil』, 【Lifedrain Sludge】 was just an annoying recovery option Avaritia possessed.</p>
<p>【Analyze】 showed that the main body’s level was the same as the copy, 750. The different sensation when slicing 【Lifedrain Sludge】, however, convinced Shin that the main body had to be more powerful.</p>
<p>“I don’t have much time to waste. I’ll have to end this quick.”</p>
<p>Avaritia did not have any sources of recovery in the surroundings. If they stayed inside the institute, Shin could limit the damage to material ones.</p>
<p>“DoN’t get YoUr hopES up, bOy.”</p>
<p>Before Shin could move, however, Avaritia said something concerning.</p>
<p>“Do yoU rEALly ThiNK I didn’t prEpAre anythINg to coUNTer yOu?”</p>
<p>“….what do you want to say?”</p>
<p>Engaging a devil in conversation was risky. Avaritia, who shared memories with its copy, wouldn’t say such a thing without a reason, though.</p>
<p>“HuMan deSIre knowS No boUnds. EsPEcially for tHE yoUng. It wAs a cINch to set up, yoU know?”</p>
<p>“You…!”</p>
<p>Among the students evacuated by Hilamee, some had to be under Avaritia’s control. If Shin didn’t comply with the devil’s instructions, he would order them to do his bidding.</p>
<p>“SuIciDe works, aTTacKing the oTHers too. How mANy do yoU thiNK thEy aRe?”</p>
<p>“Filthy bastard…”</p>
<p>Shin tightened his grip on 『The Ark』. He wanted to wipe Avaritia off the face of the planet then and there, but if he didn’t literally do so in one blow, the devil wouldn’t hesitate to do what he said.</p>
<p>Cool your head down. Nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself and relaxed his grip on the hilt of the blade. He then thought of contacting Schnee via Mind Chat and telling her to contact Hilamee.</p>
<p>Mind Chat did not use magic power, nor required any particular movement. It was possible to contact distant parties without the opponent realizing.</p>
<p>“What are your demands, then?”</p>
<p>Luxuria probably noticed that Shin’s expression changed, so she spoke to attract Avaritia’s attention. The pupils hiding deep within the goat skull turned towards her.</p>
<p>“You knOw thAT alrEAdy. I cAMe all the WAy herE to maKe yoU mINe. The hoSTAges are thERe to keEp anyOne elSe out oF the wAy.”</p>
<p>“My, and here I thought you wanted to use them to force me not to resist.”</p>
<p>Luxuria was a staff member of the institute too: keeping students as hostages would work as a threat against her too.</p>
<p>“A devIl liKE yoU? YoU doN’T caRe aboUT huMAns, do yoU?”</p>
<p>Avaritia honestly wondered why Luxuria would say something like that. Shin started thinking that Luxuria might start fighting without regard for the hostages.</p>
<p>“You know me well, don’t you.”</p>
<p>Shin saw Luxuria’s cold smile for the first time. He knew what she actually thought, so that smile could only be described as devilish.</p>
<p>Because he knew Luxuria, though, Shin found her smile somewhat strange. He had only found her devilish in her sensual gestures and alluring provocations. She didn’t display any of the cruel and cold attitude characteristic of devils, so in a way, she didn’t fit the image Shin had of devils.</p>
<p>Shin felt that she had to be acting. That’s how different her atmosphere was from the usual Luxuria.</p>
<p>“Let’s have the human remove this barrier, then. If this stays up, I can’t go out but you can’t do anything either, can you?”</p>
<p>“ThAT’s riGht. Do It, hUMan.”</p>
<p>“….got it.”</p>
<p>Shin had set up the trap, so naturally he could disarm it too. As soon as he did so, Luxuria jumped away from the spot she was standing on.</p>
<p>【Lifedrain Sludge】 had poked out of the ground like a flurry of spears from beneath her.</p>
<p>“I told you, keep being hasty and you’ll never be popular.”</p>
<p>“I doN’t hAve muCh tIMe, yoU sEe. LeT’s jUSt fUse alrEady. YoU stAy out of It, aLl rIGht?”</p>
<p>Avaritia told Shin to stay put. As long as the hostages were under the devil’s command, Shin couldn’t do anything. He could only wait for the right chance.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I just don’t like this look, after all.”</p>
<p>The moment Avaritia spoke to Shin, Luxuria turned back to her devil form. She was now about 5 mel tall. A very rough description of her new appearance would be a female upper body on a ball of tentacles. From the tentacles, however, a large arm-shaped appendage extended forward.</p>
<p>The upper body looked like Luxuria was hugging her generous feminine parts. The arms, however, were attached to her chest: bird-like wings sprouted from her upper arms and shoulders and thorns covered her face from the mouth upwards.</p>
<p>Her voice was exactly the same as her human form, which sounded like a nasty joke in this situation.</p>
<p>“YoU lOok jUst wonDErfuL to me.”</p>
<p>“Your compliments thrill me.”</p>
<p>Avaritia raised a fist: in response, the giant arm protruding from Luxuria’s lower body formed a fist too.</p>
<p>In stark contrast with the casual tone of their words, the institute was gradually filled by killing intent and insanity. The battle between devils, which had to be avoided at all costs, was about to start.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 5</p>
<p>Avaritia and Luxuria. While the two devils began to fight, Hilamee couldn’t hide her surprise at the information received from Schnee.</p>
<p>Some of the students had been charmed by the devil and were now being used as hostages.</p>
<p>“I have to do something…”</p>
<p>Hilamee felt she had to act quickly, however, nothing useful came to mind. 【Analyze】 could show if someone was affected by status ailments, but it wouldn’t show anything abnormal if the mind control was performed via skills that used drugs or words.</p>
<p>Just then, some students approached Hilamee.</p>
<p>“Headmistress, there is something we need to tell you.”</p>
<p>“It’s very important!”</p>
<p>The students were among the top fighters of the institute, the Elf Lecus and the Dragnil Myu. Gian was behind them too. They had probably been training when they evacuated, as they wore their battle gear.</p>
<p>“This is an emergency, please standby with your assigned teacher. I will listen to you later.”</p>
<p>Hilamee thought that they wanted her to explain the current situation, so she told them to wait with their teacher.</p>
<p>“We know that very well. We must speak now, though.”</p>
<p>“Yes!! Or it will be too late!”</p>
<p>“There’s no time. As we speak —”</p>
<p>Luxuria is in danger, is what Hilamee was about to blurt out, but she stopped herself just in time.</p>
<p>These three students would probably be okay, thanks to the mental training they had received from Shin and Schnee, but the other students would likely fall into panic.</p>
<p>“Headmistress, we aren’t here to waste your time. The students here might be in danger. Please listen to what we have to say.”</p>
<p>Seeing Hilamee turn silent, and Gian stepped forward to talk to her, in a very calm tone. His eyes were deadly serious. Looking at them helped Hilamee to regain some composure she had lost.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We feel that some of the students here…are under the influence of something bad. We thought that you might know something, headmistress.”</p>
<p>Gian looked at Lecus, who explained further. The allegedly influenced students were enveloped in impure magic or were acting strangely.</p>
<p>One of them happened to be nearby, so Hilamee used 【Analyze】, but no status ailments were displayed. Lecus and the others, however, all said that they were acting strange, albeit each in a different way.</p>
<p>That was the difference between former players and pure denizens of this world.</p>
<p>Most players thought that learning skills was everything. Because of their experience in the game, their concept of skills was fixed.</p>
<p>Lecus and the others, however, had a more abstract understanding of skills. Because of this, they couldn’t fully unleash their effects, but they could also sense things and produce effects that players couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Did Shin give you any skills?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing. We learned new skills during training, though. I learned 【Magic Vision】, Gian 【Sign Perception】, and Myu 【Insight】.”</p>
<p>Skills weren’t something to reveal lightly, but because of the dire situation, Lecus did not hide anything.</p>
<p>Unlike Shin’s expectations, they all learned perception-related skills. The reason why they learned different ones was that, in this world, there were conditions to learn skills were different from the game rules Shin was familiar with.</p>
<p>Before learning the skills, they had never felt sensations such as those they were feeling now, so Lecus was sure that the skills were the cause, a theory that Hilamee agreed with.</p>
<p>“Let’s isolate one of them and ask them some questions, then.”</p>
<p>“I think that person would be the best choice.”</p>
<p>They needed as many clues as they could. Hilamee thought of asking other teachers to help, but Lecus pointed to an instructor before she could.</p>
<p>“That person feels the same too.”</p>
<p>“He’s the one that…”</p>
<p>The instructor Lecus pointed to was listed among the possible spies who leaked classified information out of the institute. However, the investigation had only reported him as possibly compromised.</p>
<p>It would be easier to ask a teacher to talk in private. Hilamee then called him to one of the shelter rooms used to store goods.</p>
<p>“What do you need to talk about, ma’am? Will you explain the current situation?”</p>
<p>The male teacher was still relatively shaken because of the sudden teleportation. His eyes swiftly shifted from left to right, his behavior slightly erratic.</p>
<p>Hilamee, without a word, took a card out of the item box and materialized it.</p>
<p>It was a yellow crystal set on top of a green and white spiral, the 『Clear Storm Wand』.</p>
<p>Hilamee lightly touched the confused teacher with the tip of the wand. That moment, his whole body trembled and he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The 『Clear Storm Wand』 was an anti-devil weapon Shin gave to Hilamee.</p>
<p>Shin had attached it with added magic damage to devils and the ability to clear the influence of devils from whomever it touched.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t have any effect on those not contaminated by a devil’s influence, so it was clear that the male teacher had been controlled by a devil.</p>
<p>“Ooh! That weird feeling is gone!”</p>
<p>“Amazing, as expected of our headmistress.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what to feel about that compliment…”</p>
<p>Shin had given her that weapon. By herself, Hilamee couldn’t have solved the situation so easily.</p>
<p>Though she was a former player, by the game’s standards she was in the lower middle ranks at best.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to worry about that, though. Bring all the people that feel influenced here, I’ll take care of them. Try not to cause a commotion.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Lecus replied, Myu gave a huge nod and Gian a smaller one, then they all left the room. Soon enough, they returned with a female student with them.</p>
<p>Hilamee touched the confused student with the wand and she fell down, as if struck by vertigo. Unlike the male teacher, she didn’t lose consciousness.</p>
<p>“Where…am I?”</p>
<p>The girl looked around puzzled: it looked like she didn’t recognize the place.</p>
<p>Hilamee asked her if she remembered how she came here, not mentioning the devil, and the girl replied that her memories were hazy, as if she had been dreaming. She couldn’t clearly remember what she had been doing.</p>
<p>Gradually realizing the current situation, the student was starting to panic, so Hilamee put her to sleep with a magic spell. She didn’t like doing such a thing, but there was no time to comfort her.</p>
<p>After the male teacher and female student were moved to an empty room in the shelter, Hilamee had Lecus’s party continue bring in influenced people to her.</p>
<p>The students and teachers that gave an unusual feeling were not few, but, compared to the total number of evacuees, they were still a small fraction.</p>
<p>While waiting for the next victim, Hilamee prayed that Shin and the others could buy enough time and stayed safe.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Thundering sounds echoed through the institute.</p>
<p>No one would think that they were produced by collisions of fist against fist, flesh against flesh.</p>
<p>They could, however, if those fists belonged to devils. Fists large enough to crush people.</p>
<p>The reinforced bodies of high level monsters were comparable to rare metals in terms of resilience.</p>
<p>Their massive bodies, ignoring the laws of physics, were packed with mass, heavy enough to imprint the ground they walked on. Now, two such walking calamities were battling each other.</p>
<p>Each clash of their fists shook the earth and the air.</p>
<p>“LoOks liKe yoU’ve goT yoUr shAre of pent-UP frUStrAtioN!”</p>
<p>“Spare me the disgusting comments!”</p>
<p>The devils exchanged casual quips along with blows. There was a gap of 50 levels between them.</p>
<p>Unlike players, whose level cap was 255 and individual stats varied greatly, the stats of monsters depended heavily on their level. The higher the level, the stronger the monster: it was as simple as that.</p>
<p>Excluding affinities and the monsters which specialized in specific stats, normally the monster with higher level was stronger. This was especially true for devils, which had high stats overall.</p>
<p>No clear difference could be seen from the two devils as they exchanged punches, however. The reason was the magic power Luxuria had accumulated while in Erkunt.</p>
<p>The source for her magic power was human desire, which strongly spiraled around human towns. There was a limit to how much magic power could be stocked, but Luxuria had enough to fill a 50 level gap.</p>
<p>“How loNg can yoU keEp up, HMMm?”</p>
<p>“Kh!”</p>
<p>Naturally, however, such magic power would be depleted as the battle continued. As it did, the gap between Avaritia and Luxuria would widen.</p>
<p>Devils possessed vast powers. Precisely because of that, the magic power decreased at alarming speed. Little by little, Luxuria was starting to lose the edge in their battle of blows.</p>
<p>Luxuria’s lower body tentacles were also being approached by Avaritia’s 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>“Get that disgusting thing away from me!!”</p>
<p>In response to Luxuria’s shout, her tentacles trembled, unraveled from the ball, and emitted purple smoke from their tips. Their aim was the 【Lifedrain Sludge】 crawling on the ground.</p>
<p>When touched by the purple smoke, the 【Lifedrain Sludge】 spread all over the floor disappeared with a sizzling sound.</p>
<p>It was one of the skills Luxuria could use in devil form, 【Fading Purple Haze】. It could inflict heavy damage to equipment and, to players, 【Paralysis】 and 【Bloodred Poison】.</p>
<p>The mist’s strong acidic properties would continuously inflict damage if one stayed inside it: that was the reason why 【Lifedrain Sludge】 was disappearing.</p>
<p>“BabE, I jUst wanTEd to celEBRate our meeTIng with a hUG.”</p>
<p>“Too bad, I already have a special someone.”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s tentacles endlessly spewed the 【Purple Haze】, burning through Avaritia’s 【Lifedrain Sludge】. The Greed devil, however, always looked in control of the situation. Luxuria’s 【Purple Haze】 was very effective against players, but against devils it barely managed to sear the skin surface.</p>
<p>The unique abilities devils possessed weren’t very useful against other devils. That applied to Luxuria too. Even among specimens of the same species, however, there was good or bad affinity.</p>
<p>Avaritia’s 【Lifedrain Sludge】 was a draining ability. As opposed to Luxuria’s 【Purple Haze】, it couldn’t be ignored because it would have little effect.</p>
<p>Because of the two devils’ affinity, if Luxuria touched the sludge even a little she would be sapped of her strength even more than the usual.</p>
<p>“If yoU waAnt to gIVe up, now’s tHE beSt, TIMe, yoU knOw? Make my lIfE a lITTle eASier.”</p>
<p>Avaritia urged Luxuria to surrender, confident of being in an advantageous position. Despite his boastful attitude, the blows he unleashed were as fierce as before.</p>
<p>“Too bad for you, I never know when to give up. Why are you even asking a devil to be a good loser?”</p>
<p>Luxuria switched to a defensive stance, focusing on buying time.</p>
<p>Shin could not move because of the hostages, but Luxuria thought that he had to have contacted Schnee. In addition, Avaritia’s attitude and speech were as cocky as ever, but Luxuria felt that he actually wasn’t as confident as he wanted to sound.</p>
<p>The reason was obvious: standing right behind him was an opponent he couldn’t defeat even if he fused with Luxuria. If the hostages were rescued or Shin decided to accept a few sacrifices, the situation would change in a flash.</p>
<p>Avaritia was definitely acting confident to hasten a conclusion, or so Luxuria thought while blocking his attacks.</p>
<p>“Do you plan to absorb him too after me?”</p>
<p>“No wAY. As sOOn as you’RE mINe, I’m hIGhtaILing it oUt of Here. EvEn uSIng the hOStaGes, that gUy is tOo mUCh of a bEAsT.”</p>
<p>Avaritia replied to Luxuria’s question, for the first time with a cold and dry tone. He knew that even after absorbing two other devils and using hostages, he couldn’t win against Shin.</p>
<p>Avaritia’s fists struck again, shaking Luxuria’s body.</p>
<p>Not much time had passed since they started fighting, but the magic power Luxuria had stocked was already half depleted by Avaritia’s flurry of punches and 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>Because of that, the level difference between the two devils was growing ever starker.</p>
<p>Luxuria did not have much leeway either. Most of her skills inflicted the opponent with status ailments, but were of little use against other devils.</p>
<p>Her strongest strategy was to shower the enemy party with status ailments and disrupt their teamwork. Against a single opponent or someone who resisted status ailments, her strongest point was practically useless.</p>
<p>“I still have a couple cards to play, though.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know how useful it could prove to be, but she would just gradually lose like that. Ready to play all cards at her disposal, Luxuria released her power even more.</p>
<p>The vines covering her head squirmed. After a few seconds, countless rips and cracks appeared on the surface of the vines.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>Avaritia clicked his tongue and packed even more power into his punches. Luxuria could still defend herself, albeit barely.</p>
<p>The rips and cracks on the vines grew wider, gradually revealing human mouths. The countless mouths that appeared on the vines drew in air.</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>Luxuria activated her skill after making sure that Shin, still behind Avaritia, had covered his ears with his hands.</p>
<p>All the mouths emitted a shriek. Shrill voices, low voices, clear voices and twisted voices. A multitude of mixed voices that attacked the opponent’s mind.</p>
<p>It was a shockwave attack that also inflicted status ailments, called 【Dread Lullaby】.</p>
<p>Most status ailments couldn’t affect other devils, but the shockwave would.</p>
<p>This too was a wide-range indiscriminate attack. It blew away both Avaritia’s own body and the 【Lifedrain Sludge】, with a deadly lullaby that would turn a normal person into a lifeless husk.</p>
<p>“YoU’re tOo dAMN lOUD, bITch!”</p>
<p>Avaritia cursed while holding the ground with his hands. The 【Dread Lullaby】 was one of Luxuria’s most powerful attacks.</p>
<p>Even if Avaritia was safe from the status ailments, he couldn’t just shrug it off.</p>
<p>The more powerful Avaritia was gradually pushed back. The attack was a shockwave in all directions, so it damaged the institute too, but with a battle between devils going on so close, that was par for the course.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Shin quietly used Avaritia as a shield against the attack.</p>
<p>“TIme for pAYbAck.”</p>
<p>As the effects of Luxuria’s 【Dread Lullaby】 subdued, black lights started glowing from the tips of Avaritia’s goat horns.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of charging, the black lights were shot towards Luxuria. Compared to Avaritia’s massive body, the lights seemed quite small, but were actually one mel wide.</p>
<p>Luxuria couldn’t avoid Avaritia’s attack. The black globes traveled close to Luxuria and exploded, enveloping her large body in the blast.</p>
<p>Just like blots of ink falling over the painting of a scenery, the very air around them seemed to be covered in black, for the three seconds of the attack.</p>
<p>It was Avaritia’s most powerful skill, 【Bullets of Corruption】.</p>
<p>“Kh…”</p>
<p>Luxuria had forgone the option of avoiding the blast and did all she could to protect herself.</p>
<p>It was of course a very powerful attack, but if a player was hit with it, their max HP would also be reduced to half. For this reason, it was nicknamed the “frontline killer skill”.</p>
<p>Other devils wouldn’t be affected by the half max HP effect, but being hit by all bullets would cause considerable damage.</p>
<p>Part of Luxuria’s tentacles and wings was gone, her large arm was partially torn off, the other half charred black, still.</p>
<p>“That was pretty rough…”</p>
<p>Differently from Luxuria’s focus on status ailments, Avaritia’s skills were primarily designed for draining. Luxuria suffered heavy damage because this skill had low draining capabilities, being primed for causing damage.</p>
<p>This was the same for players and monsters alike, and did not change in the new world either. If one wanted to raise the drained amount, it was necessary to either attack more times or raise the damage of each attack.</p>
<p>Avaritia’s skills increased in draining ability as the damage increased.</p>
<p>“ThAt wAsn’t eNOugh, huh.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t think I would go down this easily, did you.”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s stats were based on defense. Even after suffering Avaritia’s brutal attack, she could still move enough.</p>
<p>The 【Lifedrain Sludge】 sent as follow-up was burned by 【Purple Haze】. Luxuria’s tentacles had decreased in number, however, so the sludge was closer than before.</p>
<p>Because of the damage suffered by her giant arm, Luxuria could not fully parry Avaritia’s attacks anymore.</p>
<p>“Ladies, should be, treated with care!”</p>
<p>“HaH! No nEEd fOR cOmplImEnts bETweEn uS!”</p>
<p>The situation was now completely one-sided.</p>
<p>Luxuria could only parry one of Avaritia’s fists with her arm: the other had to be blocked by her tentacles. Because of that, she couldn’t stop 【Lifedrain Sludge】’s progress as well as before.</p>
<p>Luxuria, locked in a defensive stance, saw her body gradually surrounded by 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>“What a nuisance!!”</p>
<p>【Lifedrain Sludge】 was also limiting Luxuria’s movements. Little by little, Avaritia’s fists started breaking through Luxuria’s defenses.</p>
<p>With clashes strong enough to make the air vibrate, Luxuria’s body floated in the air slightly.</p>
<p>“YoU serIoUsly puT up a gOod fIghT.”</p>
<p>Avaritia continued to attack relentlessly. His rush of fists didn’t let up, together with 【Lifedrain Sludge】. The greed devil’s punches rained through Luxuria’s defenses.</p>
<p>She was still parrying, but it was just a flimsy difference from her opponent’s attacks hitting cleanly: Luxuria was practically turned into a sandbag.</p>
<p>“Haha!! HahAhAhaHA!! HaHAHaHA!“</p>
<p>Avaritia’s laugh echoed through the surroundings. Luxuria’s body was tattered, more than half of it was painted black.</p>
<p>She could tell, somehow, that Shin was holding himself back from acting.</p>
<p>She had secretly sent him a message before turning to devil form, so he wouldn’t do anything until all hostages were freed.</p>
<p>“….HahAha…hAh.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s fists stopped.</p>
<p>“What…are you doing?”</p>
<p>Only Luxuria’s head remained uncovered by the 【Lifedrain Sludge】. She couldn’t imagine what Avaritia was planning by stopping to attack then and there.</p>
<p>“ThAt’s mY lINe. YOur atTAckS aRe liGht, yoU dOn’t eVen dOdge. YoU stOckEd alL tHat pOwEr, but Didn’T eVen usE it rIGhT.”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s level was higher, but after they both used their skills, one was almost unscathed, the other almost out of commission. The gap was far too wide.</p>
<p>The key fact was that Luxuria failed to dodge the 【Bullets of Corruption】. Even if her body was now gigantic, her high level also granted her high speed. It was unthinkable that she would be hit by all bullets, shot right in front of her.</p>
<p>“DoN’t tELL me thAt yoU wOrrIed aBOut the dESTrucTIon? YoU, a dEVil?”</p>
<p>If she had gone all out, 【Dread Lullaby】 would have extended its reach as far as outside the institute.</p>
<p>If she had dodged the 【Bullets of Corruption】, some of them too would have caused damage outside the institute.</p>
<p>Luxuria’s behavior, bizarre enough to make Avaritia stop attacking, was motivated by her desire of wanting to limit damage and casualties.</p>
<p>“Hmm…? I don’t know…what you’re hinting at.”</p>
<p>Luxuria had no intention of giving Avaritia an honest answer.</p>
<p>She didn’t know herself why she had done that. Her own life should be the most important thing, but before she realized it, she had blocked all 【Bullets of Corruption】 with her own body.</p>
<p>She couldn’t resist anymore. Avaritia would now absorb her, erasing her existence for the world.</p>
<p>Her body would resurrect, one day. It will probably inherit her memories too. The next Luxuria, however, would be a different entity.</p>
<p>Even with the same memories, her feelings would not be the same. In a way, that was the same as “death”.</p>
<p>“Are yoU…rEAlLy the dEvIl of lUst?”</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Luxuria did not have enough strength left in her to even speak. Avaritia’s eyes grew narrower as he watched the defenseless Luxuria. His 【Lifedrain Sludge】 then resumed its progress, without meeting any resistance.</p>
<p>Luxuria was fully covered by 【Lifedrain Sludge】 and turned into a black cocoon.</p>
<p>“ThIs…iS…”</p>
<p>Avaritia looked at the cocoon with suspicion.</p>
<p>The battle was over, Luxuria did not resist anymore. The fusion should have started already.</p>
<p>Despite this, Luxuria was still existing inside the cocoon.</p>
<p>Avaritia had no recollection of such a phenomenon. That was enough to create an opening.</p>
<p>Explosions resounded behind Avaritia, attracting his attention. That very instant, a blue and silver flash passed right next to the devil.</p>
<p>“YOu—!?!”</p>
<p>The flash deftly kicked the air to dodge Avaritia’s fist and approached the cocoon.</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not too late…haaaAAAAh!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s 『The Ark』 sliced open the cocoon.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 14 Chapter 4 Part 6</p>
<p>Sparks scattered in the air. Two blades clashed both chipping away at each other.</p>
<p>“You’re not half bad!”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>The battle between Fagall and Namsaar, which started before Luxuria and Avaritia’s, was continuing, in favor of Namsaar – as controlled by Avaritia’s copy.</p>
<p>The room’s interior was almost unrecognizable because of the fighting.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you use your full power? Are you still playing around?”</p>
<p>Either he decided to only use a certain extent of power or something was limiting him. Fagall couldn’t tell by Namsaar’s slight changes in expression, but fully focused on it.</p>
<p>“Defeat me and I’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>The thrust longsword was redirected by Fagall’s twin swords. Namsaar was superior to Fagall in terms of muscular power, so clashing against him head on was not a smart strategy.</p>
<p>Fagall considered his options. He wanted to stop Avaritia and Luxuria from fighting, but he couldn’t leave Namsaar unchecked. It was especially dangerous if his aim was the king.</p>
<p>There were also other workers and soldiers in the palace. Even if he was at a disadvantage, he couldn’t simply ditch them and run.</p>
<p>“It really doesn’t feel like someone else is controlling you.”</p>
<p>The swordplay was just like Namsaar’s. Fagall had asked why his opponent didn’t come at him with his full power, but if he had from the start, Fagall’s situation would be in a much worse now.</p>
<p>The longsword, deflected by Fagall’s twin blades, stopped and abruptly changed direction to a horizontal slash.</p>
<p>Fagall jumped in the direction of the slash and put some distance between himself and his opponent.</p>
<p>“That’s a nasty weapon you got there.”</p>
<p>“We knew that a devil was coming. We had to be prepared this much.”</p>
<p>A kind of black smoke rose from Namsaar’s longsword, from the part that had clashed against Fagall’s twin swords.</p>
<p>The blades Fagall was equipped with were the twin swords 『Regulus』. They had anti-devil attributes, of course.</p>
<p>He had received them from Schnee when she had come to the palace to train the soldiers. Without them, the situation would surely be much worse.</p>
<p>“You and that woman too, you’re a pain in the ass with your weapons…”</p>
<p>Namsaar, controlled by Avaritia, was superior in terms of fighting prowess, but Fagall had better weapons.</p>
<p>Fagall thanked Shin mentally and went on the offensive.</p>
<p>The right 『Regulus』 was imbued with lightning, the left 『Regulus』 with flames.</p>
<p>Fagall used a different skill for each sword. It was the first and foremost advantage in using a two-sword fighting style.</p>
<p>Fagall swung the thunder-clad 『Regulus』 first.</p>
<p>Namsaar would recover quickly thanks to the devil’s power, but his movements would at least slow down.</p>
<p>He would either deflect the attack with his longsword or dodge it. So Fagall predicted, but things went differently this time. Namsaar, against all expectations, grabbed 『Regulus』 with his left hand.</p>
<p>“Wow, this sure packs a punch!”</p>
<p>The thunder attack ran across Namsaar’s whole body and slowed down his movements.</p>
<p>The gauntlet covered hand that caught 『Regulus』 emitted a sizzling sound, like water poured over melting iron. The grasp on the blade was still firm, though.</p>
<p>“You, bastard!?”</p>
<p>“It’s too early to stop, man.”</p>
<p>Fagall’s hesitation was punished by Namsaar’s longsword. The former managed to intercept the slash with his other sword, so he avoided being cut in half.</p>
<p>He couldn’t fully block the longsword with just one of his swords, however: the left 『Regulus』 was blown away and Fagall was shoved against a wall, moaning in pain.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s time for the coup de grace. You’ve delayed me long enough.”</p>
<p>“I got to say…I’m honored to be considered so important…”</p>
<p>Fagall wondered why he received such “special treatment”, then thought: at least Sherlene was free to act.</p>
<p>Namsaar’s words, however, made him realize that he was wrong.</p>
<p>“I’ve already dealt with her. You people would be ready to sacrifice few to save many…I can’t stop you like I did with the other guy. Besides, you’re still worth using.”</p>
<p>Namsaar readied his longsword.</p>
<p>“….I see, that’s why you’re not concerned with Lady Sherlene then…”</p>
<p>Fagall let out a very faint whisper. The tone of his voice had changed.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye -a speed that could not be described any other way- Fagall moved.</p>
<p>His twin swords drew two arcs in the air. One deflected Namsaar’s longsword, the other aimed for his neck.</p>
<p>“Sheesh, that was close!”</p>
<p>Namsaar touched the fresh wound. 『Regulus』 had undoubtedly reached his neck.</p>
<p>However, Namsaar didn’t just let himself be attacked. He had twisted his body in order to limit damage to the smallest possible area.</p>
<p>His neck had been sliced up to the carotid, but his magic power quickly stopped the blood loss.</p>
<p>“Never seen such a technique. You didn’t even tell your comrades? You lonely bastard.”</p>
<p>Fagall’s speed was much higher than before: it was obvious for Namsaar to be wary.</p>
<p>Fagall didn’t answer. He used Namsaar’s wariness to draw a deep breath.</p>
<p>“!!”</p>
<p>The knight then moved again. A lightning quick technique, lasting a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>If Avaritia wasn’t in control of his body, Namsaar’s head would be rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>“Tch, you’re pretty damn fast now.”</p>
<p>Namsaar’s defense couldn’t keep up with Fagall’s speed. However, he wasn’t defeated since he avoided lethal wounds and recovered at insane speeds.</p>
<p>Fagall couldn’t inflict lethal wounds, while Namsaar couldn’t keep up with his speed. Their bout continued, with neither able to break the stalemate.</p>
<p>However, the first to reach his limits, was Fagall.</p>
<p>Gradually, the wounds he inflicted on Namsaar were shallower and shallower, fewer and fewer. In the end he stopped, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“I see, you’ve been using your own lifeforce, reckless fool.”</p>
<p>Namsaar understood thanks to his own draining abilities. Fagall was attacking one-sidedly, but losing strength in the process.</p>
<p>Fagall had used the support skill 【Overboost】. It was a skill born from one Shin had used in the past, which provided better boosts than normal support skills, at the cost of one’s HP.</p>
<p>Naturally, if used for a long time it would corner the user before the opponent.</p>
<p>“Too bad you had to fight me. I guess you would have defeated anyone else with that.”</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Fagall didn’t answer. He was severely fatigued and had no way to recover.</p>
<p>Namsaar continued talking before his weakened opponent, taunting him to try to do anything.</p>
<p>“Why work so hard? Your hero buddy isn’t coming to save you. You should have turned tail a long ass time ago!”</p>
<p>“Too…bad…I can’t…do that…”</p>
<p>Fagall felt like that was a possibility too, but he bit his lips to seal his weakness inside.</p>
<p>He remembered what his subordinates said when they saw the royal soldiers, under the influence of mental skills.</p>
<p>“If lady Sherlene cannot fight, then I must stand…”</p>
<p>“You? You’re weaker than her. What can you do?”</p>
<p>In terms of stats, Sherlene was superior to Fagall.</p>
<p>Fagall himself was aware that, even if they were lauded as the two heroes, there was a gap in strength between them.</p>
<p>“That’s easy…I…swore an oath.”</p>
<p>What was that worth, though? If one was weak, they should let the strong handle everything.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the point, though. That was wrong, thought Fagall.</p>
<p>“I have taken upon the sword to protect this country. Even if I am weaker, I am still its hero. I shall stand in the way of those who threaten my country, till I draw my last breath!”</p>
<p>Before finishing the sentence, Fagall activated a skill and attacked.</p>
<p>His HP was already in the red. If he didn’t change strategy, his HP would reach zero in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>He would either stop right before dying or just die. Fagall never tried before, so he didn’t know if it would work. In any case, he wouldn’t stop. He was ready to bring down his enemy with him.</p>
<p>He could only pray that Shin and the others somehow stopped Avaritia’s main body. That was his only regret.</p>
<p>“OOOOOOAAAAHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>Fagall’s roar shook the very air in the room. His slash was even faster, even sharper, s it attacked Namsaar.</p>
<p>“Guess I’ve got to get serious too.”</p>
<p>Seconds before the slash hit, Avaritia released his power. He had held back in order to keep using Namsaar, but if his enemy was going to self-destruct, he didn’t need to anymore.</p>
<p>Namsaar’s body, with stats already equal to a hero, was further boosted by the devil’s power. Its movements even Fagall, who was consuming his own lifeforce to power himself up.</p>
<p>Fagall’s slashes were all blocked by Namsaar’s longsword, now fully clad in black mist. Not only that, the devil-controlled captain of the guards even aimed to strike a counter.</p>
<p>Fagall wouldn’t have been able to dodge or even defend himself against Namsaar’s new speed if he hadn’t reinforced himself.</p>
<p>“Just give up, you’ll feel much better.”</p>
<p>“I refuse!!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Fagall instinctively felt that the next attack would be his last, and focused every last ounce of his strength into it.</p>
<p>“That’s a damn shame.”</p>
<p>His right blade cut into Namsaar’s left side, while the left one slashed him from the shoulder towards the chest.</p>
<p>He failed to cut him completely, however, because of Namsaar’s resilience and the protection provided by his armor.</p>
<p>The sizzling sound of burning flesh rose from the wounds: 『Regulus』 managed to damage Namsaar’s body, but it was far from being lethal. The body was Namsaar’s, but the recovery speed was Avaritia’s. The wounds would be completely healed soon after the swords were removed.</p>
<p>“………”</p>
<p>Fagall’s hands released his swords. He was not dead, but he did not have the strength to even stand anymore.</p>
<p>Namsaar extended a hand towards the falling Fagall. The latter’s life was almost spent: with the devil’s powers, it would be simple to turn him into a puppet.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Just before he could touch Fagall, Namsaar readied his sword again. The next instant, a spear emitting blinding light flew in from outside the room.</p>
<p>“What the!?”</p>
<p>Namsaar knocked away the spear, but the impact pushed his back to the window.</p>
<p>“Looks like I barely made it.”</p>
<p>Sherlene caught the deflected spear and prepared to defend Fagall from Namsaar.</p>
<p>“What the, how the hell did you regain your senses?…Ahh, no need to answer, I got it.”</p>
<p>Looking at Sherlene’s spear was enough to know the answer. The sacred aura emitted by the holy spear 『Guildern』 was clearly felt by those in the room.</p>
<p>Just like Fagall’s 『Regulus』, it wasn’t just a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s see how long you can last, with that weight on your shoulders and all!”</p>
<p>Sherlene parried Namsaar’s longsword with the hilt of her spear. He was still at full power, so a single blow was enough to force Sherlene to her knees. Fagall’s twin 『Regulus』 swords were still lodged in Namsaar’s shoulder and stomach, but there was no blood.</p>
<p>“You had to dodge that, so the weight would be gone too. Or do you want to finish him off yourself? I can wait that long, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“You’re a pretty chatty fellow.”</p>
<p>Sherlene’s expression clearly showed how dire the situation was. She had used a recovery potion on Fagall without being noticed, but maybe because he had pushed his body to the limits with the power-up skill, his limbs couldn’t move yet.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to kill you off, but I guess I have no choice.”</p>
<p>Namsaar’s longsword pushed against 『Guildern』. Even if the spear was a superior weapon, Namsaar’s own stats were higher. The jet black sword was closer and closer to Sherlene’s face.</p>
<p>“In the end you just bought some time. Why did you even attack at that timing?”</p>
<p>“Just say, whatever.”</p>
<p>The blade and hilt grinded against each other. It was just a matter of time—anyone would say so, but the next moment, they all felt something burst out: it struck Fagall, Sherlene and Namsaar too.</p>
<p>There was no sound, but all of them felt “something” propagated throughout Erkunt.</p>
<p>“What the…? Gah…GHAAAAAHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>When this “something” passed through Fagall and Sherlene and reached Namsaar, the situation completely changed. Namsaar, who was pressuring Sherlene, started screaming in pain.</p>
<p>Fagall, who barely managed to stand back up, saw black mist rising from the wounds his 『Regulus』 had inflicted on Namsaar’s body, leaking at a very high speed.</p>
<p>Soon enough, the black mist formed a sort of black puddle next to Namsaar’s body.</p>
<p>“What in the world..?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But whatever just passed through our bodies seems to be on our side.”</p>
<p>Fagall walked next to Sherlene. He was feeling much better all of a sudden. Looking at the progressively disappearing mist, he felt that the devil’s power was fading away.</p>
<p>Namsaar’s armor and longsword were gradually returning to normal too. Soon after, the mist completely disappeared from Namsaar’s body. The 『Regulus』 blades fell on their own, leaving no wounds behind. Namsaar’s body collapsed to the floor, unscathed but powerless.</p>
<p> “WhAt..DId…yOu…”</p>
<p>The mass of black mist forced out of Namsaar’s body spoke. The two heroes did not know what it was, but readied their weapons nonetheless.</p>
<p>They did not reply. Without a word, Sherlene thrust 『Guildern』and Fagall swung 『Regulus』.</p>
<p>The shapeless mist reduced in mass after every blow, as if blown away by the wind. The area struck by the weapons disappeared along its surroundings, so it did not take much time until the mist completely vanished.</p>
<p>“Is it…over?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. Sir Namsaar’s body seems to be healed too. This time we’re always getting rescued, aren’t we…”</p>
<p>Sherlene replied to a sigh to Fagall, their nerves finally relaxed.</p>
<p>The threat wasn’t completely gone, but they were confident that the end was near.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>The people under the devil’s influence were all freed. Shin received this message just as Luxuria had been swallowed by the 【Lifedrain Sludge】.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>The moment he understood Hilamee’s message, Shin kicked the ground with all his might.</p>
<p>The cocoon had already formed. Though he didn’t know how devils absorbed each other, he had no intention of giving up.</p>
<p>Shin passed by Avaritia with one step and leapt towards Luxuria with the second.</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not too late…haaaAAAAh!!”</p>
<p>『The Ark』 sliced through the cocoon, which put up little to no resistance.</p>
<p>Shin’s momentum made him land behind Luxuria. The following instant, an explosion of light burst behind him.</p>
<p>“What the!?”</p>
<p>Shin got back on his feet, turned around and saw light seeping out of the cocoon. He also saw Avaritia, his arms crossed to protect his body, being pushed back. The light from the cocoon was burning his whole body.</p>
<p>“The cocoon is breaking down?”</p>
<p>Cracks extended all over the cocoon from the gash cut open by Shin.</p>
<p>Dozens of seconds later, the cocoon crumbled. Luxuria’s silhouette, as it was before the fight, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>Luxuria was there, but in human form. However, she was much different than what Shin remembered.</p>
<p>Luxuria, floating inside white light, was wrapped in white bandages, shining as strongly as the light. A bright halo was even shining behind her.</p>
<p>The shining halo was projecting a kind of pattern, as tall as Luxuria was. There were 4 of such patterns on her right and 4 on her left, looking just like wings.</p>
<p>“Is that really…Luxuria?”</p>
<p>The moment she appeared, a wave-like “something” expanded in the surroundings. It passed through Shin’s body, but he didn’t feel anything.</p>
<p>The only one affected seemed to be Avaritia.</p>
<p>“GWAAAAAHHHHHH!?!”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s whole body distorted and contorted. He had to be in indescribable pain.</p>
<p>“Who knew something like this could happen…”</p>
<p>Pale blue and white light shone from Luxuria’s hands, the same color as her wings. She shot repeatedly spears of light, which stabbed Avaritia’s body, still in the throes of pain, opening large holes in it.</p>
<p>“Y..yoU…thAt’s…”</p>
<p>“Do you even need to ask? Any devil could tell. I was really surprised too, though.”</p>
<p>“A deVIl…tuRnIng inTo an AngEl…? GivE…me..a…fUc…”</p>
<p>Avaritia’s body then vanished into smoke. What remained was just the 『Drop of Avaritia』, proof of his defeat.</p>
<p>Shin was confused by the sudden development, and Luxuria looked at him, chuckling.</p>
<p>“Oh my, did I scare you?”</p>
<p>Luxuria descended next to Shin and asked him a question, cocking her head to the side.</p>
<p>“I’ve just never seen or heard anything like this. To be perfectly honest, I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing.”</p>
<p>Before disappearing, Avaritia mentioned the word “angel”. Seeing that she had defeated a devil, it was fair to think that she would be an ally.</p>
<p>However, Shin -despite his vast knowledge of THE NEW GATE’s bestiary- had never seen an angel. The game’s producers had hinted at their existence, but no player ever reported encountering one.</p>
<p>Angels were often depicted as the counterparts of devils. Just like devils, however, they were categorized as monsters. As long as they were monsters, there was the chance that they would antagonize humanity.</p>
<p>“I understand where you’re coming from, but I have no idea why this happened. But I do understand that I’ve turned into an angel, and still have my memories as a devil. I remember you all too, of course.”</p>
<p>“So angels really existed…”</p>
<p>“I suppose they were a transformation of Deadly Sin devils. I kind of felt it after transforming, but it looks like I’m the protector of “Love” now.”</p>
<p>“The virtue opposite to the deadly sin, I guess? I heard that they aren’t officially established as opposites though…anyway, there’s no need to probe deeper into that right now, I suppose.”</p>
<p>Shin tried recalling what he had read when researching about the deadly sin devils, but did not remember much in detail.</p>
<p>“Whoa, I almost forgot. Now that Avaritia’s defeated, I have to go into town. The summoned monsters are going wild.”</p>
<p>“No need to worry, that’s already taken care of.”</p>
<p>“….what?”</p>
<p>Shin was about to leave to go help Schnee, but Luxuria stopped him. According to her, the first wave of energy thing she released – 【Saint Wave】 – erased both the magic circles influenced by devil power and the monsters they summoned.</p>
<p>Shin checked the map and confirmed that the presences of monsters across town were indeed nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Amazing…and I thought that we had still a lot to do.”</p>
<p>“It only work against devils and their influence. Though, I could only do this thanks to you. If you didn’t cut open the cocoon, I think I would have been assimilated by Avaritia.”</p>
<p>“If you have to thank someone, thank Hilamee. They freed all the hostages, that’s why I could act.”</p>
<p>Shin was forced to do nothing while Luxuria was suffering Avaritia’s attacks, so he felt guilty instead.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. I could do my best because you were there.”</p>
<p>Before transforming in devil form, Luxuria had sent a message to Shin, telling him to not do anything until the hostages were freed, even if she were to lose.</p>
<p>She had asked Avaritia if he would withdraw after absorbing her for the same reason. She had fought while considering her assimilation a viable option.</p>
<p>“Even if I lost, Avaritia would be defeated by you. Thanks to this experience, it would be possible to prepare countermeasures against hostages in the future. That’s why my sacrifice wouldn’t have been in vain…after I realized that, I felt a weight off my chest.”</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Shin was about to say that she shouldn’t even think about things like that, but Luxuria smiled and put a finger on his lips.</p>
<p>“I’m free to choose who to be grateful to, so you don’t need to concern yourself with anything. Isn’t there anything you’d like me to do, instead? I’m not a devil anymore, so you can entrust your whole self to me, you know? Incidentally, I’m not wearing anything at the moment, up here or down there…so I’m a bit chilly, I would love to be warmed up, honestly.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Tell the truth, you’re still half a devil, aren’t you? Or maybe you’re an angel, but the angel of lust…”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s words quickly took a turn for the “romantic” after she mentioned Shin entrusting himself to her, causing Shin to sigh in disbelief.</p>
<p>Stopping Luxuria from removing her belt, he was relieved that at least one major threat was over.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 1</p>
<p>At the Erkunt Institute of Magic, Shin fought with one of the Deadly Sin Devils, the greed devil Avaritia. During the battle, another one of the deadly sins, the lust devil Luxuria, had transformed into the counterpart of a devil, an angel. Thanks to her power, Shin was victorious.</p>
<p>After neutralizing the devil’s attack, Shin contacted Schnee, one of his support characters. Thanks to Luxuria’s powers, the monster summoning circles had vanished, however, the damage and casualties were still great. Schnee did not know the overall situation either, but, thanks to the monsters’ disappearance, the rescue and healing of the wounded populace could start.</p>
<p>“I’m going into the city, but what about you, Luxuria?”</p>
<p>“Let’s see…I think I will teleport to the institute’s shelter and meet up with Hilamee. I already messaged that it’s safe now, so I think everyone’s probably back already. But before that I have something to request of you, would that be fine?”</p>
<p>“It depends on the request.”</p>
<p>Shin would be in a spot if she started saying, again, how she wasn’t wearing anything down there or up there, so he replied cautiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so defensive. I just want to borrow some clothes. As you can see, I only have this belt…cloth? Well, this piece of clothing covering my body, which was given form thanks to my powers, but I’m sure it wouldn’t be proper to walk around like this.”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>Shin focused on her single piece of clothing and the words 『Angel Sash』 appeared. It was handled as a material apparently.</p>
<p>The 『Angel Sash』 covered Luxuria from her chest to her thighs. It hugged her body very tightly, evidencing her curves. Other than the parts wrapped by the sash, there were bands on her arms too, which floated loosely around them.</p>
<p>Maybe because the fighting was over, the halo of light on her back and the wings that extended from it had disappeared.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I can do that. Clothes and shoes first.”</p>
<p>Shin opened his item box and took out a random outfit. It was something used to raise skill level and did not have any particular attributes.</p>
<p>He recalled Luxuria mentioning not wearing anything “down there or up there” and casually sorted his inventory, wondering if he had forgotten anything in there. Indeed, he found several items that he almost had forgotten the existence of.</p>
<p>“Then…underwear, I guess.”</p>
<p>“….oh? Did you say…underwear?”</p>
<p>Luxuria had heard very clearly.</p>
<p>“Dear Shin? Do you mind telling me the reason why you are in possession of ladies’ underwear, so completely naturally? You won’t say that you made underwear of your liking for Schnee to—”</p>
<p>Luxuria looked at the item cards and asked the question. While talking, her expression turned to incredulity.</p>
<p>“No way!! I just left in some I had made to raise my creation skills, who knows when. I did them when I was still a newbie, so they don’t even have automatic size adjustment capabilities.”</p>
<p>The item box was said to be uselessly spacious. Because of this, items created in the early stages of adventuring sometimes lay forgotten in the depths of the box. It happened often to creation-oriented players like Shin: his item box contained many items that could only be considered trash by now.</p>
<p>Shin had half-forgotten he still stored that underwear, after all.</p>
<p>“If you say so…”</p>
<p>“I feel another horrible misunderstanding has been created…”</p>
<p>Luxuria seemed to clearly question Shin’s explanation, but he didn’t know what else to say. He, a male player, had female underwear in his item box. Anything he said would surely sound like an excuse.</p>
<p>“Never mind. I’ll change then.”</p>
<p>After Luxuria’s words, the sash wrapped around her body vanished. It happened so suddenly that Shin couldn’t process what happened right away. He looked at Luxuria’s naked body, frozen, for a few seconds.</p>
<p>After he finally realized what had happened, he turned his whole body away from Luxuria.</p>
<p>“You can keep looking, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Give me a break…”</p>
<p>Maybe because she used to be the devil of lust, even after turning into an angel her beauty and proportions were still very alluring. If she was still a devil, she would exude excessive erotic charm, but as an angel, she did not emanate such a seductive aura anymore.</p>
<p>It could be said that she was closer to an artistic rendition of a naked beauty now.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin. I feel bad for saying this after you let me borrow these clothes, but could you add automatic size adjustment?”</p>
<p>“…just give me the cards.”</p>
<p>The reason was clear. Shin had given Luxuria the largest size he had, but that wasn’t enough, apparently. Shin knew that Luxuria’s “those” were much larger than the average woman with the same height, so he half expected this request.</p>
<p>He took the card without looking at Luxuria and quickly attached the automatic size adjustment attribute. Luxuria was indeed not wearing anything “up there” right now.</p>
<p>“Okay, perfect. I heard about it before, but it really is convenient. I always have to order underwear just for me, so this is really helpful.”</p>
<p>The sound of rustling clothes stopped, so Shin thought Luxuria finished changing and was about to turn around, when he felt something pressing against his back.</p>
<p>It was Luxuria, of course. She was pressing her body against his, so Shin could clearly feel a very soft sensation on his back.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, it’s just a little thank you. This much is fine, no?”</p>
<p>The soft sensation disappeared and Shin turned around, to see Luxuria’s pleased smile after accomplishing her prank.</p>
<p>She was now wearing a white sweater and a long black skirt. The gesture made her look more childish than usual.</p>
<p>The next instant, however, she placed her index finger on her lips, giving off a more mature air, so Shin couldn’t tell how serious if she really meant what she said or not.</p>
<p>“I actually wanted to kiss you, but Schnee would scold me, so I won’t.”</p>
<p>“I would get the worst of it if that happens, so please don’t.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s mood would definitely turn very foul if that happened. Shin would be more than happy to avoid triggering such a landmine.</p>
<p>Shin and Luxuria separated, as she headed to the shelter’s teleport, and he went to the city.</p>
<p>He proceeded from the outer walls that were destroyed by Avaritia to the city center, so he could have a clear picture of the destruction caused by the monsters.</p>
<p>Some buildings had been fully destroyed, others only partially. Most houses in the residential areas only suffered minor damage, like part of the roof collapsing or something similar.</p>
<p>It was probably caused by someone fighting against the monsters.</p>
<p>As Schnee had said, the people’s expressions did not seem as grim as he’d expected. They clearly already knew that the monster threat was no more.</p>
<p>“I should do whatever I can to help too.”</p>
<p>Looking at the map through 【Sign Perception】, Shin could tell that there were still people trapped under the wreckage. He decided to start by rescuing them and headed towards the closest one.</p>
<p>“….two people.”</p>
<p>He detected two presences inside the building.</p>
<p>“Hey, you can tell that there are people inside?”</p>
<p>The man standing next to Shin heard his comment and called out to him. Judging from the leather armor he was wearing, he was probably an adventurer.</p>
<p>“It’s an alternative way of using presence detection. I’ll ensure their safety with magic first, to make sure they’ll be okay even if the building comes down. Please stand back.”</p>
<p>The man nodded to Shin and had the other men in the surroundings step back. He was likely the leader of the rescue operations in the area.</p>
<p>Shin first used 【Through Sight】 and 【Analyze】 to check the condition of the trapped survivors.</p>
<p>It appears they were lucky enough to be in a space between two pillars.</p>
<p>Shin used the earth-type magic spell 【Earth Wall】 to cover and protect the two survivors.</p>
<p>“Okay, done. I’ve covered the people inside with an earth barrier. It won’t collapse easily, so let’s get rid of the wreckage.”</p>
<p>The men around Shin then started removing the wrecks. Shin joined them, easily lifting up the wreck that looked difficult to transport and piled it somewhere else.</p>
<p>There was no need to hold back when rescuing others: even if he had to pick up part of a wall or a broken pillar, Shin whisked them away without hesitation. Every time he removed a piece of wreckage, a “swipe” and loud “thud” could be heard.</p>
<p>“Well I’ll be….”</p>
<p>“Whoa…”</p>
<p>Looking at Shin lifting wreckage many times larger than himself, the other men were flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“Folks, your hands aren’t moving!! Leave the large stuff to the guy and carry the smaller ones!”</p>
<p>The leader snapped out of it before the others and shouted at them to get moving again, which they promptly did.</p>
<p>After removing the larger wrecks, Shin pinpointed the survivors’ location and, after a while, a ball made of clay appeared. It was too hard for the men to break through, so Shin opened a hole in it. Inside it were a mother and child, hugging themselves tightly.</p>
<p>The mother and daughter, carried out by the men, had no idea what had happened.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave the rest to you. I’m going to the next spot.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll take care of things here. —Take care.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded and hurried to the next location.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 2</p>
<p>“You truly have accomplished much. On behalf of all of Erkunt, I thank you.”</p>
<p>Three days after Avaritia’s strike, Shin was in an audience with king Kreunzeit in the royal castle. Schnee was with him, camouflaged as her “Yuki” persona.</p>
<p>Hilamee, informed by Luxuria, had reported to the royal castle, so king Kreunzeit and the royal elites had learned of Avaritia’s extermination on the same day. The audience happened three days later because Shin told the knights that came to summon him that he wanted to prioritize rescue operations.</p>
<p>To delay the audience with a king would normally be considered the epitome of contempt, but because of the reason behind Shin’s refusal, it was accepted.</p>
<p>The knights who visited Shin even pleaded to join the rescue efforts after hearing his reasons. They deeply regretted not having been able to do much during Avaritia’s attack.</p>
<p>“No, we were mostly on the defensive this time, so we were simply lucky that there weren’t many casualties. I almost want to apologize for acting so haughty, then not accomplishing much.”</p>
<p>Shin felt very awkward, as he actually couldn’t do very much because of the hostages.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, if you were of little use, then we were of even less…”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Without the weapons sir Shin offered, we wouldn’t be standing here now.”</p>
<p>Shin’s wry laugh was followed by Fagall and Sherlene, knights of Erkunt who had also fought during the monster attack, who felt equally awkward. They fought against their superior Namsaar, under Avaritia’s control, but they struggled against a mere copy of Avaritia, so they felt apologetic.</p>
<p>Namsaar was exhausted both body and mind because of Avaritia’s control and was still unconscious, apparently.</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s enough! In any case, casualties and damage were little, so we should rejoice, right!? No one here slacked off or anything, so let’s improve what we should and stop fidgeting like this!”</p>
<p>Luxuria interrupted the conversation, which lingered on how pathetic Shin and others apparently were. She was clearly tired of it.</p>
<p>“Indeed. We will strive to do better next time.”</p>
<p>“It is as lady Luxuria and lady Yuki said. Let us gather more information about devils and monsters and develop proper countermeasures. We should speak of the reward for sir Shin first.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit nodded and changed the topic. The new direction, however, was unexpected for Shin and the others.</p>
<p>“I would be more than satisfied if I could just have the drop items, though.”</p>
<p>They were items that would be next to impossible to obtain at present. Shin considered more than enough for a reward.</p>
<p>“I am aware. But some are talking of awarding you land and a court title. Your achievements are that important, it wouldn’t be strange, actually.”</p>
<p>“I believe I already refused that in the beginning.”</p>
<p>Adventurers rising to the rank of noble because of their achievements. It wasn’t an unthinkable development, Shin had read about such stories of success, but he simply thought it was more trouble than what it was worth.</p>
<p>The search for the guild houses, inspection of the Sacred Places…there were still many things for him to do. He had no time to waste serving in any court. If he was forced to, he would have to take the appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>“I am aware of that as well, of course. But there are some stubborn folks that will not relent unless they hear the words coming from the mouth of the person in question.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the discussion about Shin’s reward had been held before the audience. Fagall and Sherlene too were laughing wryly. No matter where, there were always those who wished for someone as powerful as Shin to be tied to their country.</p>
<p>“Shin, Yuki, your powers are fascinating after all. Oh, by the way, I will not help for anything other than defense, is that alright?”</p>
<p>“Of course. To use an angel’s power for invasion…would surely bring forth a hefty price to pay. We are going to keep that information as hidden as possible.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit had also been informed about Luxuria’s transformation from devil to angel. The problems associated with her status as devil would all change now that she was one no more. Some doubted her change, but when she showed her angel wings -the eight patterns on her halo- everyone was surprised and convinced.</p>
<p>Adorned by the wings, Luxuria emitted a holy aura. Shin and Schnee too thought that she would do no harm to people. Her personality, however, had not changed a bit, so in a way, she was a “threat” in the same way as before, which was the only disappointment.</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit and the others had been overwhelmed by Luxuria’s holy aura. Shin and Schnee were not affected very much, but for the denizens of that world, it was a divine sight.</p>
<p>In “THE NEW GATE”’s world, angels only existed in legends, but now one was before them. It was like a myth coming into life.</p>
<p>They would never match it in pure power, that was a fact, but more than that, the simple idea of using an angel was taboo for most. No one among the elites dared to object about it.</p>
<p>“A wise decision, I think. If the existence of an angel was revealed, the relationship with other countries couldn’t remain the same either.”</p>
<p>“It would disrupt my work in the institute, so I will be thankful if you do that.”</p>
<p>Shin laughed at the large difference between what Schnee and Luxuria were respectively concerned about. If Luxuria’s status as angel was revealed, it would be impossible for her to simply continue treating students in the infirmary.</p>
<p>“We have nothing else to discuss, I think?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you for coming all the way here. I have also heard that you have spent these days rescuing our citizens. Allow me to express my gratitude again.”</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit bowed his head. Normally, his subordinates would frown at their king casually lowering his head, but both Sherlene and Fagall were completely calm. Shin and Schnee had accomplished something worthy of a king’s reverence.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 3</p>
<p>After leaving the castle, Shin, Schnee, and Luxuria headed towards the institute. Though the town had been severely damaged, the institute — albeit only part of it — was in a pitiful state.</p>
<p>“We’ve got more than enough time to fix it.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking at the ruined structures as they headed towards Hilamee’s office.</p>
<p>He was a blacksmith, but there was also a reason why he was so confident.</p>
<p>All Rokuten members shared part of their specialty with other members.</p>
<p>In Shin’s case, he taught his smithing and metal engraving skills to Reed and Cook. On the other hand, when he built his guild house, Tsuki no Hokora, another Rokuten member, Cain the “Blue Magician”, taught him all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, his architecture skills, while not too high, were proficient. Architects also required imagination: taking advantage of the fact that he was in a game, Shin had also built all sorts of bizarre constructions.</p>
<p>“I already knew that you were something else, but well…you really can do anything.”</p>
<p>“Not really…I just have a bit of experience, but, by professional standards, I wouldn’t be good at all. Other than Blacksmithing, Architecture and Alchemy are the only skills I can handle.”</p>
<p>Shin’s architecture skill level was IV, alchemy was X. He needed alchemy to create potions for his Blacksmithing, so it was much higher, but that was all.</p>
<p>If he was told to create the same things as the “Red Alchemist” Hecate, his answer would be a flat no. Alchemy required much more than just a high level.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, his trading skills, farming and animal raising skills etc were all around II: he had just acquired them and leveled them no further.</p>
<p>After taking in Yuzuha as partner his taming skills had grown a little, but he was still inferior to professional tamers even in this world.</p>
<p>“Being able to do ‘only’ that seems already enough to me…well, I guess it’s different if we use the standards of the past era.”</p>
<p>Luxuria knew of the “Game Era” before the “Dusk of Majesty”, so she understood why Shin classified himself in that way.</p>
<p>“It would be more than what we could ever ask, but is it really okay? You will end up standing out, won’t you?”</p>
<p>In the headmistress’ office, Hilamee made a troubled expression after hearing Shin’s proposal.</p>
<p>Being a skilled fighter was already enough to draw attention. If the information that he was capable of creation skills spread, many would seek to contact him. Even if there were particular circumstances, Hilamee was concerned that Shin had shown his true abilities before others more than necessary because of his involvement with her and Erkunt.</p>
<p>“I’ll do just enough to let people think I’m worthy of my A rank. It’s a bit late to worry about standing out anyway.”</p>
<p>Shin had already given up on avoiding standing out too much.</p>
<p>He was not based in any country, so, as long as he left the country where he was last seen, it was pretty much impossible to contact him. If someone followed him, it would be all too easy to lose them.</p>
<p>“The circumstances are what they are, so let’s just accept our sweet Shin’s kindness, no? We just have to thank him properly later.”</p>
<p>Luxuria held Hilamee’s shoulders from behind and interjected. Hilamee couldn’t see it, but Shin did not miss that her smile widened when she said the words “thank him”.</p>
<p>“I know already that your “thanks” is going to be something bad…”</p>
<p>“Oh my, I’m hurt.”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s lips pouted. It was rather childish for an adult, but her charm made it mysteriously acceptable.</p>
<p>Shin, however, glared at her. Even as an angel, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that her gratitude would be sexual in nature. She was not a devil anymore, so Shin thought that Luxuria wouldn’t need to draw energy from people’s sexual activities, but contrary to his expectations, she still possessed that ability.</p>
<p>“Not even a king could ever hope to have an angel service him…”</p>
<p>“I know what you really mean anyway. Besides, why would I go to any other woman when I have Schnee at my side?”</p>
<p>Shin then pulled Schnee closer to him. Her look had turned sharper because of Luxuria’s words, but Shin’s sudden action took her completely by surprise. Even though they were husband and wife, she still seemed unused to such physical contact.</p>
<p>“Look at them, I’m getting jealous…in this world polygamy is not all that rare you know?”</p>
<p>“Where I’m from monogamy is the norm, and fiction is more than enough for harems. Why are you so persistent, anyway? Because I’m a High Human?”</p>
<p>In the beginning, Shin thought she was provoking him out of curiosity. Though, it wasn’t enough to explain her behavior anymore.</p>
<p>“To fall in love with the person who saved you in a tight spot…is not so strange, is it?”</p>
<p>“I watched you get beat up without doing anything and attacked once in the end. That’s what made you fall in love?”</p>
<p>Luxuria said that Shin’s attack was what triggered her transformation, but he argued that those were two separate things.</p>
<p>“That was one of the reasons. Maybe because I used to be the lust devil.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The strong emotion you and Schnee share…I think I was attracted to that. It’s clearly different than other humans’.”</p>
<p>Luxuria had grown interested because she was the lust devil. Before she could realize it, it had changed into a feeling unlike infatuation or love.</p>
<p>“Maybe one other thing…you don’t show an excessive reaction after learning of my true nature? Normally, people would outright reject any contact with a devil.”</p>
<p>“‘Maybe?’, she says…”</p>
<p>Luxuria caressed Shin’s hand, the one opposite to Schnee’s side. Shin didn’t react much, but a normal person would probably scream and knock it away. Even if she was an angel now, people would usually hate to be even remotely close to a devil.</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit, who wasn’t a Chosen One or even a former player, normally conversed with Luxuria, but that was an exception among exceptions.</p>
<p>For Shin too, Luxuria was “someone to defeat”. Surely a troublesome opponent, but still not enough to show an excessive reaction to.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it, can I? I don’t care about how it started anymore. I’m surprised too to be so attached, you know? I have never felt like this before in my life…”</p>
<p>Luxuria’s had tightened her grip on Shin’s.</p>
<p>Normally, devils played around and toyed with others. They sought the weaknesses in their hearts, stimulating their desires, charming them. There was no affection in that. In other words, they were complete beginners in terms of approaching someone simply because they hoped the other person would like them, not manipulate them.</p>
<p>“Well…I can understand if you’re feeling confused. Even so, it has nothing to do with this.”</p>
<p>Shin thought what people call “first love” had bloomed inside her. Considering that, Luxuria’s words and actions were understandable. The feeling of liking someone else couldn’t be suppressed, even if one wanted to.</p>
<p>He couldn’t comply with her desires, though. Schnee had come closer, as if hugging him, so Shin was presently sandwiched between them. He couldn’t see Schnee’s expression, however, which was quite scary for him.</p>
<p>“Schnee is a much more fearsome enemy than you, I see.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you go any further.”</p>
<p>Between the two ladies’ smiling gazes, sparks were flying. Schnee was ready to do battle.</p>
<p>Hilamee, who was observing the situation, decided to interrupt at that moment.</p>
<p>“Ehm, if possible, I would like to resume our discussion about the reconstruction…aaah!?”</p>
<p>The two ladies focused their gaze on Hilamee, which was enough to make her retreat several steps. Shin mentally saluted her courage.</p>
<p>“What is going on here…”</p>
<p>Masakado, who had arrived late, expressed his confusion at the situation. His expression clearly showed that he thought he had arrived at a very bad moment.</p>
<p>“Anyway, like Hilamee said, let’s discuss the reconstruction now, okay?”</p>
<p>Shin used the silence created by Hilamee and Masakado and tried to change the topic with all his might. It was their reason for visiting, after all: Luxuria’s topic was completely unrelated.</p>
<p>“….understood. We will talk about this again another time.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have to…”</p>
<p>Luxuria winked and Shin felt a headache coming.</p>
<p>They finally managed to get back on topic, so he avoided thinking about Luxuria and talked with Hilamee about rebuilding the school. Shin’s skill level was high enough to restore the mostly ruined buildings to their original state. He also mentioned using the opportunity to reinforce them to be stronger than before.</p>
<p>The institute used a modified version of the technology employed to build guild houses, but the building itself used the same standards as that world’s architecture.</p>
<p>“Both I and Masakado have battle-focused skills, so all we could do was use the sturdiest materials to build it.”</p>
<p>In the game era, all they had to do was to send a request to a creation guild that, provided an appropriate price was paid, could build a school as strong as a fortress which could repel monster attacks easily. That was not possible now, though. It was obvious for the buildings to be damaged after suffering the brunt of a devil’s attacks.</p>
<p>“I guess I will focus on making it as resilient as possible. My skill level isn’t high either, but I should be able to use Cain’s techniques to fill the gap.”</p>
<p>The “techniques” Shin mentioned were real-world techniques, adapted for use in this world. Schnee’s method to temporarily repair the breached wall, an earthen net supported by ice, was based on the structure of concrete.</p>
<p>In game, many players thought of walls as compact masses of earth or metal.</p>
<p>However, Cain, who was a real life architect, came up with this idea and put it into practice. Thus some real-world techniques could be adapted to the game world. Other players also noticed that creation skills did not have to be used strictly as they were created, so a part of creator-type players knew about such techniques.</p>
<p>Shin too was one of the players who realized it by himself. When smithing, he thought that, since he was moving his body, he might as well imitate real blacksmiths, and noticed that the resulting gear was higher in quality.</p>
<p>“Don’t imitate Cain so well that you add in self-detonation devices, okay?”</p>
<p>“I won’t, I won’t….there’s no one else who would put stuff like that, anyway.”</p>
<p>Hilamee, who knew of the High Human that made it a personal rule to insert self-detonation devices in everything he created, made it clear that she wanted no such thing.</p>
<p>Shin too had been encouraged to equip Tsuki no Hokora with one, but refused.</p>
<p>The detonation devices themselves were made by Hecate, designed to blow away only the building and its interior. They boasted that it was an incredible item that would never cause damage to anything outside it, but, because of its concentrated power, not even a High Human could necessarily survive the blast.</p>
<p>“Leaving bombs and such aside, I’d like to start working immediately, but is there anywhere you want me to start from?”</p>
<p>“Let me see…we cannot start the lectures right away anyway, so I would ask you to start from the dorms next to the school buildings. It’s difficult for us to let the students coming from afar stay in inns for a long time, after all.”</p>
<p>Many foreign students came to Erkunt to study, but, except for a few affluent ones, most of them lived in the student dorms. Their school expenses would be a little higher because of it, but it would still be much cheaper than renting a room at an inn.</p>
<p>The inns in the city had also suffered damage because of the monsters, so the situation was still problematic. For the students’ sakes, rebuilding of the dorms was the highest priority.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll start right away then. I’ll finish today, so they can rest easy.”</p>
<p>Shin headed to the student dorms right away, there was no time to lose.</p>
<p>He found a half-destroyed building there. The parts still standing were cracked in many places, looking like they could crumble anytime.</p>
<p>“I see, I see, looks like it won’t be hard.”</p>
<p>Shin used a skill and displayed the dorm’s structure in his mind. The parts used to build it were not too rare, so he could handle it by himself. Since the wreckage was still there, so he had materials to spare. Shin touched the wrecks and activated a skill.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18188 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shin.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>The structure plan of the student dorms, as displayed in Shin’s mind, materialized itself before his eyes, with the same size as the actual building. Shin moved his hands in midair and the wreckage turned into a liquid, gradually filling the blueprint he materialized.</p>
<p>The wreckage started filling the building plan, like water filling an empty container. It seemed as if it were dancing according to the commands of an invisible conductor’s baton.</p>
<p>“A few more adjustments and—”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Hilamee had been watching over the construction, but she apparently couldn’t wipe the thought of the self-detonation device from her mind and grabbed Shin’s shoulders from behind. Her tone was enough to express that she was admonishing him not to play any tricks.</p>
<p>“Easy, easy, I’m not going to do anything weird. I was just thinking of reinforcing the walls a bit.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Shin was offended by the suspicion. High Human abilities were well known, but their personalities were often not trusted.</p>
<p>Shin continued and raised the walls’ resilience by about 30%. The mostly completed dorm glowed faintly, then showed itself just as it was before the destruction. The furniture and accessories likely used by the students were all outside. Many things had been broken when the building came down.</p>
<p>“I can’t do anything about that, so the rest is up to you.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t impossible for Shin to fix them too after a bit of research, but repairing the buildings took precedence. Thus, he thus decided to leave that kind of work to Hilamee.</p>
<p>“The structure inside is the same as before. I can’t do anything about the furniture, so they’ll have to do something about it themselves.”</p>
<p>With sleeping bags or something similar, the students should be able to get by. Regardless, the most important thing was to have a roof over their heads. Hilamee informed Masakado via Mind Chat and they started relaying the communication to the students.</p>
<p>Masakado had stayed in the school building, ready to contact the students as soon as the dorm was restored.</p>
<p>“Okay then, onto the next one.”</p>
<p>Skill-based construction work could be done at a speed that would leave professionals speechless. The Erkunt institute of magic regained its original look within the day, with added resilience to boot.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 4</p>
<p>“Err… why have I been summoned again?”</p>
<p>“Are you really sure you don’t know why?”</p>
<p>During the restoration of the city, Shin was summoned by the Adventurers’ Guild and was now in the Erkunt branch. He was told that he would be informed once he arrived at the guild, but as soon as he arrived he was brought to a private room.</p>
<p>He could think of a few reasons why he would be summoned, but he had no evidence for any of them.</p>
<p>“We are aware that you are collaborating with the city’s reconstruction. That is the same reason why we wanted you to come to the guild.”</p>
<p>“I see…?”</p>
<p>According to the receptionist, the guild agreed to cooperate with the country’s reconstruction efforts; there were requests available according to each adventurer’s abilities. Shin was expected to use his abilities for rescue operations, but he acted independently from the guild, helping wherever he found it necessary.</p>
<p>“We are very thankful to you, sir Shin. Without you two, many would have surely died. But without prior procedures here, it becomes impossible to add such efforts to your achievements.”</p>
<p>Because of the guild’s system, accomplishments not covered by a registered request were hardly evaluated or considered. Because of the scale of Shin’s actions, he would receive some sort of recognition all the same, but it would be much smaller than what he would garner if he acted officially.</p>
<p>“The reward becomes smaller too…as a citizen of this country, I feel terribly sorry.”</p>
<p>“Ah…I see. Well, er, I’m sorry. But we weren’t thinking about any rewards anyway. We’ll be more careful next time.”</p>
<p>Shin actually hoped that there wouldn’t be a next time, but chose not to mention that.</p>
<p>“Thank you. So, these are the requests specifically for you, sir Shin.”</p>
<p>The receptionist took out one sheet of paper from the file. The request was about removing wreckage from destroyed buildings and rescuing trapped survivors.</p>
<p>Because of Shin’s fighting abilities, he was apparently deemed to be very strong. Since several days had passed since the attack, the rescue of survivors had to be prioritized if they were still alive.</p>
<p>“We are aware of your achievements, sir Shin, lady Yuki, so if you accept this request, we can add more to your accomplishments.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee’s combination of Earth-type magic and 【Through Sight】 was very effective. They could quickly find any survivors inside the rubble and ensure their safety first with earth spells.</p>
<p>Normally, removing wreckage had to be done with extreme caution, but since they didn’t have to worry about the safety of the people inside, speed could be prioritized.</p>
<p>The adventurers or the guards were not trained to rescue people in this situation: but if all they had to do was use their muscles to remove wreckage, things were very different. Shin’s assistance was a godsend for them.</p>
<p>“We have no reason to refuse the request, of course.”</p>
<p>Shin signed the request. There was no time limit, so they could step down anytime they wished. The achievements and rewards were fixed, but it was an emergency rescue operation request. Operation evaluation would be carried in secret by the guild: in any case, they wanted people to assist restoration efforts as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shin was curious about how the assistance efforts would be evaluated, but there was no time to think about that. After leaving the guild, Shin and Schnee headed to the district where Vulcan’s workshop was located.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many damaged buildings around here. I guess it should be expected since there are so many workshops.”</p>
<p>“They’re built sturdier than other buildings after all, so they can withstand much damage when something happens.”</p>
<p>That world’s workshops were always built fairly sturdy, thanks to the widespread usage of magic, a set of techniques developed that were different than science-based techniques.</p>
<p>Using too much magic power could cause explosions, so it was necessary to prevent any such incidents from affecting the workshop. A side effect to this precaution was that the workshops were thus stronger to attacks too.</p>
<p>Monsters had gone wild in the workshop district too, but because of their sturdy construction, the number of destroyed buildings was much lower than the districts where inns or stores predominated.</p>
<p>“I guess that the problem is that any wreckage is too heavy to be moved, so they called us.”</p>
<p>In the real world, transportation would be difficult even with heavy-duty machinery. The materials used were unique to this world, which were much stronger and resilient.</p>
<p>“Oh, you came.”</p>
<p>“You’re helping with wreckage removal too, boss?”</p>
<p>“I’m stronger than most humans after all. Besides, this is more important than forging swords or armor right now.”</p>
<p>The monster invasion had left Vulcan’s workshop unscathed, and his disciple Vaal was safe and sound too. The building’s sturdiness had definitely kept damage to a minimum. Another fortunate coincidence was that because of the large size of most monsters, they couldn’t enter the workshops. If people had taken shelter inside such sturdy buildings, casualties could have been avoided.</p>
<p>“I thought I knew already, but you really are strong.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that unusual, is it? There are plenty of high-ranked adventurers as strong as me.”</p>
<p>“I know that, but in your case, it’s a whole other level…well, compared to your lady, you don’t look as unusual though.”</p>
<p>Vulcan meant that as Shin was a man, being so powerful was not as surprising. Because of his profession, he had the chance to observe all sorts of Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>Seeing Schnee’s thin arms easily lift wreckage many times larger than her, however, left even him dumbfounded. Shin thought that he would feel the same if he didn’t have his abilities from the game era.</p>
<p>The removal operations accelerated immensely after Shin and Schnee joined in: thanks to the fact that few workshops were damaged in the first place, the whole district’s wreckage removal was completed the same day. There was no one in need of rescue either.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, we’ve spent a fairly long time here in Erkunt.”</p>
<p>Shin voiced his thoughts while relaxing after dinner, back in their hotel room. It was the first time he stayed longer than one month in a single country. They had stayed a long time in Hinomoto too, but never in the same place, so he didn’t feel like he stayed as long there.</p>
<p>“It’s also the first time for our party to scatter like this.”</p>
<p>In the beginning, Shin was by himself. Then Yuzuha, Schnee, and Tiera joined, soon followed by the others, leading to the current six members and two “pets”.</p>
<p>Shin had proceeded ahead of the rest of the party before arriving to Hinomoto, but it was not because the party had scattered, but because he decided to act on his own. While he was lost in such thoughts, he felt a warm and soft feeling on his right arm and shoulder.</p>
<p>“I find myself hoping for this time to continue, even just a little more.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke while leaning against Shin. There was no need to worry about the other party members, unless an emergency happened, so now that Avaritia was gone they could spend time relaxing together.</p>
<p>“Right, right…with the others around, you’ll be too embarrassed to act spoiled around me…”</p>
<p>“That’s…! ……I mean, isn’t it…embarrassing?”</p>
<p>Schnee blushed fiercely and looked away. Because of her serious personality, she found it impossible to flirt when other people were around. If she was provoked, however, all bets were off.</p>
<p>“Besides, Filma and Sety would definitely ask about every little detail…I’m sure I’m going to be interrogated when the party is back together.”</p>
<p>The party’s ladies will definitely have a lot to be curious about. No matter the world, love affairs were a never-ending source of curiosity.</p>
<p>“I don’t really mind though. You’re not going to tell everything, right?”</p>
<p>“Not! Absolutely not!! Those two would definitely tease me to no end!!”</p>
<p>Shin thought for a moment that they might as well reveal everything, but Schnee’s panicked reaction was so cute that he kept quiet. This is pretty nice too…he thought as he felt all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>While caressing her head, Shin wondered how long such a time would continue. It was that very moment, that the notice of an incoming message was displayed.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s from Tiera.”</p>
<p>“A message?”</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself and Schnee, happily enjoying being caressed, raised her head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s see….hmm, it turns out things are getting troublesome on their end.”</p>
<p>Shin read the message and laughed bitterly. Their peaceful days had finally come to an end.</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…Tiera and Shibaid were working to resurrect the World Tree, right? It looks like it’s not going too well, or rather, it’s turned into something pretty nasty.”</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 5</p>
<p>The next day, Shin and Schnee prepared to join Tiera and decided to visit their acquaintances in Erkunt to inform them of their imminent departure. In other countries, they would have left immediately, but in Erkunt they had made many acquaintances , from the king to former players.</p>
<p>Shin first informed the guild that they would leave on a journey, as to not be reprimanded again. Then, they headed to the institute of magic to meet Hilamee. Being former players, they decided to keep in contact in case anything happened. Just then, Luxuria arrived: she had somehow caught wind of Shin’s departure.</p>
<p>“You’re going already? You could take it easy a little longer…”</p>
<p>Luxuria grabbed Shin’s right hand and brought it to her chest, looking up at him with pleading eyes. While she didn’t state it outright, it was clear that she wished for him to stay there forever.</p>
<p>“My comrades contacted me, looks like they got involved in something troublesome. We’re in the same party, so I can’t ignore them, can I?”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while slowly removing his hand from Luxuria’s grip, thinking that her gaze alone would be enough to make any Chosen One fall for her.</p>
<p>The fact that Tiera sent him a message meant that his assistance was needed.</p>
<p>“We plan to leave right after we’ve said our goodbyes.”</p>
<p>“That’s really sudden…”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped. Ms. Luxuria, you should know when to give up.”</p>
<p>Masakado, who had joined them in Erkunt just a few days before, was rather dejected. Hilamee agreed with Shin and tried to appease Luxuria, but she didn’t hide the fact that she felt lonely as well.</p>
<p>For former players that knew of the game era and the current era, they couldn’t help but hope for Shin to be in the same country, if possible.</p>
<p>“I’m a former devil, of course I don’t know that.”</p>
<p>Luxuria herself knew that it was impossible to keep Shin there. She wasn’t acting, she really felt lonely.</p>
<p>“…well, it can’t be helped, can it. I’d like to go with you, but I grew fond of this place, so that won’t do either.”</p>
<p>Luxuria had grown quite attached to her title of health officer of the institute of magic. Masakado added: now that she was an angel, the infirmary had gained a divine-like atmosphere.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything special though.”</p>
<p>“Why not use the chance to behave more angel-like too?”</p>
<p>“If you mean that you like the well-behaved type better, I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>Luxuria talked while looking at Schnee and Shin raised his hands in surrender. He just meant to crack a joke but felt that any more banter wouldn’t sound like a joke at this point.</p>
<p>“In any case…thank you both for everything. If you ever come around here again, please visit. You will always be welcome.”</p>
<p>“Next time visit when I’m here too!”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee still had places to visit, so Hilamee and Masakado prompted them to go. At the rate they were going, they wouldn’t ever stop talking, so Shin gladly took the cue.</p>
<p>“It’s a pity, but I very much look forward to seeing you again…”</p>
<p>Luxuria finally gave up and said her goodbyes. Before Shin could reply, though, she went up to him and whispered:</p>
<p>“That thing you gave me after the battle…makes me feel like I’m always being embraced by you, so it’ll do for a while. But next time, you’ll have to keep me warm yourself, okay?”</p>
<p>“Wait, what!?”</p>
<p>Shin hurriedly closed Luxuria’s mouth, but it was too late: the bomb had already been dropped. Hilamee and Masakado tilted their heads, as they hadn’t heard clearly, but Schnee was next to Shin, so she had to have heard everything.</p>
<p>Shin, slowly and timidly, turned towards her, but found her smiling as usual.</p>
<p>(She’s the same as always…chillingly so.)</p>
<p>Shin understood well how terrifying it was for her to remain unchanged. He wasn’t inferior to her in terms of ability, but he definitely couldn’t win against her as far as their relationship’s power balance went.</p>
<p>“Well, Shin? We should go soon, or we won’t be able to depart before the sun sets.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, you’re right. So, see you guys. If anything bad happens, don’t hesitate to contact us.”</p>
<p>Egged on by Schnee’s smile, Shin quickly left the institute. The remaining locations were the royal castle, where Sherlene and the others were, and Vulcan’s workshop. They hadn’t met Lecus and the other students, but, because of Avaritia’s attack, many inquiries and messengers were keeping them busy, so they couldn’t move freely.</p>
<p>Since there was no other way, Shin left a letter and some items as parting gifts for them.</p>
<p>“I see, so you’re leaving. It’s a pity…sir Namsaar wanted to thank you in person too.”</p>
<p>“My comrades requested my help, after all. I’m glad that Namsaar recovered, though.”</p>
<p>Sherlene said that Namsaar had regained consciousness and was gradually recovering, though he still struggled to move on his own. After waking up, he had apparently said that he would take responsibility for the incident and step down from his position as leader of the knights.</p>
<p>King Kreunzeit, however, pressured him to earn more accomplishments to cover for this failure and stopped him. Shin and Schnee said that if Namsaar stepped down, there would not be much difference between Sherlene and Fagall, so he resolved to strive more to fight for the country.</p>
<p>The problem was that there was no one skilled enough to succeed him. That was how important Namsaar and the two Heroes were for Erkunt.</p>
<p>“Then, we will be going now. Thank you for finding the time to meet us.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had arrived during training, so they kept their farewell brief.</p>
<p>Sherlene and Fagall thought of stopping them, but after hearing that Shin’s comrades needed his assistance, they couldn’t. They saw Shin and Schnee off with bitter smiles.</p>
<p>Shin thought that if he lingered in the royal castle he could get involved in something troublesome, so they left quickly. Disappearing without a word would be disrespectful, so he visited the people he knew more, but he didn’t have much time to spare.</p>
<p>Soon enough, Shin and Schnee reached the next destination, the workshop that had become quite familiar by then.</p>
<p>Vaal was at the reception desk with about three other dwarves nearby. Based on past experiences, it was clear that they were there hoping to catch a glimpse of Schnee.</p>
<p>“Good day, Shin, Yuki—are you in a hurry, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Wow, keen eye as usual. Yeah, we’ve got some urgent business to take care of, so we have to leave right away, but it felt wrong to do so without a word, so we came.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>“That’s a pity. I’m sure the boss will say the same too.”</p>
<p>The dwarves reacted to Shin’s words with evident disappointment.</p>
<p>“Where’s the boss?”</p>
<p>“He went to a craftsmen’s meeting. The situation has improved, but the city still needs rebuilding. When will you depart?”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame, we have to leave today. It’s faster if we run instead of using a horse carriage, so we don’t need to make any preparations.”</p>
<p>“Eh!? Today!?”</p>
<p>Vaal didn’t expect them to leave the same day as the visit, so he was very surprised.</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re in a hurry. Please tell Vulcan that I’m looking forward to talking about smithing with him the next time we come.”</p>
<p>“…understood. Please take care.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left Vaal and the dwarves and headed towards the gate. He was strangely impressed by the sight of the three dwarves, crying and waving handkerchiefs as they saw them off.</p>
<p>“Ok, shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee passed Erkunt’s gate, waited until they were in a place where no one could see them, and then started running. They used 【Hiding】 at the same time, so they could go as fast as they wanted without worrying about being seen.</p>
<p>Their destination was the elf village called 『Lanapacea』. Shin had never heard of it, but Schnee said to have been there before.</p>
<p>“The resurrection of the World Tree…according to Tiera’s message, it isn’t completely dried up, so hopefully we can do something.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Personally, I’m more worried about Tiera.”</p>
<p>“About Tiera? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s tone and expression gave Shin a very bad feeling.</p>
<p>“The Lanapacea village is Tiera’s hometown. I believe that is the reason why, as she wrote in the message, things aren’t progressing well.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled the image he had seen of Tiera holding the remains of a woman, weeping loudly.</p>
<p>“Tiera is an adult now, so maybe there is no reason to worry…but please keep it in mind, just in case.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Schnee didn’t seem to be all that worried about any potential issues. After all, Tiera had always been together with Schnee since losing her homeland. They had lived together far longer than Shin had.</p>
<p>Shin nodded, thinking that her judgement could be trusted more than his.</p>
<p>After all, hundreds of years had gone by, so it wouldn’t be strange if they had come to an agreement.</p>
<p>“Anyway, she was teleported next to her hometown…it feels like it was intended.”</p>
<p>Shin noticed that he had never heard the name of Tiera’s hometown before. Her message didn’t mention it either and he wasn’t aware of the circumstances surrounding Tiera after she was cursed.</p>
<p>Shin thought that it was probably tied to her particular status as Priestess of the World Tree.</p>
<p>Other than Yuzuha and Kagerou, the experienced Shibaid was with her too. If something truly dangerous happened, he would surely contact them via Mind Chat. The message didn’t describe their situation in detail, but it looked like they were stuck at an impasse. In order to break through it, Shin’s assistance was needed.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s hurry while resting when we can.”</p>
<p>They would take proper rest at night in Tsuki no Hokora and use the remaining time to proceed. They planned to maintain the maximum speed possible, while ensuring they wouldn’t arrive at Lanapacea exhausted.</p>
<p>“Understood. Oh, there is something I must ask you later, so please give me some time tonight.”</p>
<p>“Okay, got it.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Schnee casually, but he had forgotten. Forgotten that, now that there were no immediate emergencies, he could not avoid being interrogated about certain things.</p>
<p>“The meaning of Luxuria’s words: being enveloped by you. I will need a thorough explanation, is that clear?”</p>
<p>“Gwah!?”</p>
<p>What Shin explained that night and what happened next is a secret only Shin and Schnee knew.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 6</p>
<p>One week after leaving Erkunt, Shin and Schnee finally reached the elf village of Lanapacea. Thanks to their high stats, they managed to shorten one month’s worth of travel via horse carriage to only seven days. They could run through forests and crags, without the limitations a horse carriage would have, which also helped shorten the travel time.</p>
<p>The fact that Schnee had visited the village before also helped. If Shin was alone, he would have had to proceed while comparing the map and the environment, which would have been definitely troublesome. There was no navigation technology after all.</p>
<p>“We’re finally here, but it doesn’t look like we’re quite welcome…everyone’s glaring.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. The last time I came, there wasn’t such exaggerated security.”</p>
<p>According to Schnee, the clearly defined line between forest and fields was the outer edges of Lanapace.</p>
<p>Similar to the “Gardens” Pixies created, a magical barrier prevented monsters from entering. Though it looked unprotected, lacking any castle walls or the like, the entrances into the village were actually limited.</p>
<p>To be overconfident in such barriers, however, would be foolish. In the outer edges, where monsters could appear, soldiers with relatively high fighting prowess were always stationed.</p>
<p>Many of such troops were currently stationed near the entrance to the village, as gate guards. From another perspective, the normally invisible entrance was thus made visible.</p>
<p>“Elf, human. This is the entrance to our domain. If you have come upon this place by chance, retrace your steps and be on your way.”</p>
<p>One of the elves, with equipment superior to the others, shouted in Shin and Schnee’s direction.</p>
<p>Elves were a very long lived species and always looked young. The male elf who spoke to Shin and Schnee looked around 40-50 years old, in human terms.</p>
<p>He had probably lived a fairly long life. His gaze was sharp, as if he could see right through Shin and Schnee. Even if the atmosphere was tense, he did not give off the impression that he would attack them.</p>
<p>—–Anaheit Luderia Magic Archer Level 233</p>
<p>【Analyze】 revealed the elf’s identity. His level was the highest among the elves. His job was magic archer, the archer version of the magic swordsman, so to speak. The job’s skills allowed the user to exterminate multiple targets at the same time: it was one of the most popular jobs in the game era.</p>
<p>“We have come to Lanapacea for a reason. We have no hostile intentions.”</p>
<p>“You wish to enter, I see. Do you have any proof of identity?”</p>
<p>Shin took out his adventurer’s card, which he was told would work as proof of identity. He was also told that not all countries accepted it. In that case, he would ask Tiera to come meet them.</p>
<p>“Oh, an adventurer….what? Rank…A?”</p>
<p>The elf who checked the adventurer card frowned. Shin was used to seeing people surprised by it, but the elves also showed a sense of wariness similar to hostility. They probably checked Schnee’s card too, but didn’t show any reaction to it, maybe because her rank was C.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong with my rank?”</p>
<p>“…my apologies. A human with your appearance must still be very young. I was of the impression that adventurers that reached rank A were all of advanced age.”</p>
<p>The male elf’s expression softened. His first warning had been intimidating, but he did not keep the same tone in conversation.</p>
<p>Shin thought of any adventurers that reached rank A despite being young, and could only come up with Wilhelm. He was a Chosen One, however. The others he could think of were all former players or support members, all clearly different from normal people.</p>
<p>Shin reflected that normally adventurers who reached rank A had to be of a certain age, like Bayreuth’s guildmaster Barlux – though he was a Chosen One too.</p>
<p>“What business would a high rank adventurer have in our country? There is no adventurers guild here, so even if you gather materials you would need to bring them to a neighboring country for them to be appraised, which is quite a hassle, I’m sure you understand.”</p>
<p>“Our reason is another. There isn’t a guild here though? I thought they were present in all countries.”</p>
<p>The Adventurers’ Guild, an organization that transcended borders, was present in most countries and cities. As far as Shin had seen, all countries and cities of a certain size had a branch of the guild. It wasn’t present in small fishing villages though, naturally.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of the adventurers’ guild however, Anaheit seemed to be aware of the significance of being an A rank adventurer.</p>
<p>“Our village does not have frequent contact with the outside world after all. As a country, it is quite small as well. Because of that, we protect the populace from monsters with our own fighting forces. To be perfectly frank, very few people come from outside.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a famous tourist location, nor was it a spot well known for rare materials or unique monsters. The presence of the World Tree was kept a secret too.</p>
<p>Shin knew about it because he had heard from Tiera and Schnee. He probably wouldn’t have ever visited Lanapacea if it wasn’t for them.</p>
<p>“Our reason for coming here is to meet an elf named Tiera. We have been informed that she is staying in the elf village called Lanapacea.”</p>
<p>It didn’t look like they would be let in without stating their purpose outright, so Shin mentioned Tiera’s name.</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Lady?”</p>
<p>The elf’s response was slightly unexpected.</p>
<p>For Anaheit, Tiera was apparently someone that had to be addressed with “Lady”. The male elf looked intently at Shin. Some of the elves behind him armed their bows with arrows.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere’s turning sour.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the elves as he spoke to Anaheit. He very much doubted that Anaheit hadn’t noticed the movements of the elves behind him.</p>
<p>“The village is in a bit of a tense situation at the moment. If someone as powerful as you enters, we fear that the situation might take a turn for the worse, you see.”</p>
<p>Anaheit spoke clearly. While not as much as the other elves, he didn’t seem to be very welcoming towards Shin either.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had not yet been targeted, so they were still quiet, but if the bows turned towards them, they would respond appropriately. Judging by the situation, Tiera’s circumstances were much worse than what she wrote in the message.</p>
<p>“We have no intention of causing any trouble, so could you let us in?”</p>
<p>“My apologies, but we need some time. As I said before, your presence could instigate trouble. If you were a normal human, we wouldn’t react like this though.”</p>
<p>Shin asked to be let in, but Anaheit maintained his stance of refusal. Neither was going to budge, and it wasn’t “yet” time to force his way in, so Shin decided to retreat for the moment.</p>
<p>“I guess it can’t be helped. I am sure that even if we persisted we would just give you more work to do, so we’ll be back at another time.”</p>
<p>“Apologies for the trouble. As you have an elf with you I am sure you already know, but do not think of sneaking in. If you do, we will be forced to work even harder at our jobs.”</p>
<p>“Haha, who would do something so reckless?”</p>
<p>Both men smiled, but the topic of conversation wasn’t amusing at all. Shin, incidentally, did not say that sneaking inside would be impossible.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 1 Part 7</p>
<p>“So, looks like we aren’t getting in anytime soon.”</p>
<p>After distancing themselves from the gate, Shin shook his head and spoke.</p>
<p>“It seems like they are on high alert. If I wasn’t with you, they probably would have resorted to more direct methods.”</p>
<p>Schnee talked while looking in Anaheit’s direction. Shin agreed that, since an elf like them — though Schnee was actually a high elf — was together with Shin, the elves limited themselves to arming their bows.</p>
<p>Even Anaheit looked at Schnee first before speaking to Shin. The elves who hadn’t armed their bows all focused their gazes on her too. Even among elves, known for their beauty, Schnee was probably a special case.</p>
<p>“‘Lady’ Tiera, hmm…”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee headed away from Lanapacea, to a nearby forest. Despite being surrounded by trees, they felt like they were being watched. The elves were probably using a combination of 【Far Sight】 and 【Through Sight】. Shin had used it often in the game era too.</p>
<p>“Tiera used to be the World Tree priestess after all, it is not strange for her to be addressed with such a title, but…”</p>
<p>“Normally no one would call someone who’s been banished by that title….”</p>
<p>People are respected and revered because of their abilities and status. However, Tiera had been banished by her village once. Shin and Schnee agreed that she likely wouldn’t be treated in the same way as before.</p>
<p>“The fact that the curse has been lifted is visible to everyone, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, any elf would know right away if they saw her. That is probably the reason, or rather, I cannot think of any other reason.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that has to be it.”</p>
<p>The curse was the reason she had been banished, something even the priestess Tiera had given up on. Now that the curse was removed, it could be possible for her to regain her title and honor. She could even be exalted even more, as she had accomplished an unprecedented feat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tiera’s own abilities had increased exponentially since she left the village. That alone would be enough to completely change how they treated her.</p>
<p>“In any case, we should go meet them soon. I guess we could try contacting Shibaid.”</p>
<p>“I agree. If Tiera herself calls for us, they will not have a choice but to let us in.”</p>
<p>It didn’t feel right to use her authority like that, but joining Tiera and Shibaid was the highest priority. Considering the freedom of movement once inside the village, entering openly from the main gate was surely better than sneaking inside.</p>
<p>Shin attempted to contact Shibaid via Mind Chat right away.</p>
<p>“(O Shin. Looks like the message was delivered successfully.)”</p>
<p>“(Yes, we’re already outside Lanapacea. They won’t let us in, though. What’s going on?)”</p>
<p>“(I thought that things could work if Schnee was with you…but I guess there was no such luck. I’ll tell you the details once we rejoin. I’ll come out to meet you.)”</p>
<p>“(Roger.)”</p>
<p>Shin asked when exactly Shibaid would come, then cut the communication. They hadn’t actually spoken aloud, but Shibaid’s voice seemed exhausted somehow.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“He’s coming out to meet us. The details will wait until then.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left the forest and headed straight to the village entrance, but at a leisurely pace. Anaheit watched them from the start.</p>
<p>“You’re back so soon? You aren’t thinking of “literally” breaking through the impasse, are you?”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had left just a short time ago, but were now approaching the gate again. It was enough to suspect that they were up to something.</p>
<p>“Of course not, we would already be firing magic spells in that case.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke calmly to the wary Anaheit. Shibaid was coming to meet them, so there was no need to start any trouble. If he provoked them and things turned sour, it would only be a problem.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear once and for all, but talking won’t solve anything, do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I suppose. But it would feel wrong to not even try, I think.”</p>
<p>Shin kept talking, hoping to at least get some information out of Anaheit until Shibaid arrived. He kept acting like he had simply come to visit an acquaintance and mentioned that he had traveled together with Tiera before. He first stated that Schnee was his wife and it was through her that Shin had had the chance of traveling with Tiera.</p>
<p>“Captain, someone calling themselves a messenger from the main house wishes to speak with you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>During the conversation, an elf emerged from the forest and whispered in Anaheit’s ears. Shin’s 【Listen】 skills revealed what he said to him.</p>
<p>“Why is a messenger from the main house….agh!”</p>
<p>As to corner the confused Anaheit even further, another elf appeared from the forest. Light blue eyes, blue hair extending down her back. The female elf, wearing priestess-like loose-fitting clothes, walked up to Shin and Schnee, ignoring Anaheit and his elves’ attempts to stop her.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, Lady Yuki, I presume? Milady Tiera calls for you. I will be your guide, so could you please follow me?”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“Lady messenger!”</p>
<p>Shin nodded, but at the same time Anaheit interrupted.</p>
<p>“I wish for an explanation. Surely you must know about the current situation…!”</p>
<p>They probably belonged to different factions: Anaheit couldn’t back down without an explanation.</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera deemed it necessary. In that case, it is our duty to comply.”</p>
<p>“I must insist! Lady Yuki is an elf, but sir Shin is a human! Surely you have not gone senile to the point of not realizing what that means?”</p>
<p>“I just said that such a human has been deemed necessary. Besides, lady Tiera’s companion, sir Shibaid, said the same. You already know that he is someone worthy of trust, do you not?”</p>
<p>“That’s….but, if we let any more races in, the head might be irritated.”</p>
<p>While the conversation was not a heated one, both sides did not relent. Anaheit seemed to be concerned about matters other than the World Tree. Tiera was probably involved too.</p>
<p>“I too am aware of that much. However, the World Tree is the first priority. The head is far too concerned with boosting our forces.”</p>
<p>“…I see it is inevitable, then. I will pretend I did not hear your last words.”</p>
<p>The clearly ominous conversation ended and the messenger resumed walking, after again inviting Shin and Schnee to follow her. They promptly did so, without any more words from Anaheit or the other elves.</p>
<p>After they stepped through the barrier into the village, the forest turned into streets crowded with elves and houses built in harmony with the trees. The border between the forest and the plains literally separated the village from the outside world.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee followed the guide, named Lyla, and were invited to board a horse carriage waiting for them. The carriage was equipped with cushions and traveled on paved roads, so it did not shake much during the ride.</p>
<p>It was of a quality rare for this world, though it still could not compare to Tsuki no Hokora or Shigureya. Shin thought that thanks to their long lives, elves probably attained high skill levels.</p>
<p>Lyla, who was sitting quietly in front of them, had the high level of 240. Shin didn’t know if she was a Chosen One or not, but she was very skilled for this world’s standards.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, I was just thinking that we hadn’t introduced ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I am but a guide, you do not need to concern yourself so.”</p>
<p>Lyla did not budge an inch. Shin, who knew of her level, was sure that she couldn’t be just a guide. She was probably an escort for important figures. As there was nothing to do, Shin thought of looking outside, but realized that the horse carriage did not have windows. The interior was lit by light magic crystals set at the four corners of the roof of the carriage.</p>
<p>“This carriage doesn’t have any windows, I see. Are all carriages used by elves like this?”</p>
<p>“No, this is a special carriage used by the Luderia house. Normal carriages are the same as the ones humans use.”</p>
<p>The carriage looked like it could be used to transport important people or prisoners, so it wasn’t clear if they were being wary or they simply had many enemies. Thinking back to the conversation with Anaheit, both hypotheses were probably correct.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t see outside, Shin used the map and his detection skills and noticed that they were traveling along a large road. There were a few people out and about, but all of them were above 150 in level: it was hard to believe that they were regular citizens. Since the country was small, Shin imagined that military service was a duty.</p>
<p>As Shin was quietly gathering information, the horse carriage stopped. The map showed a large building in front of the carriage. When they got off, they found a building much larger than expected.</p>
<p>The other constructions in the surroundings were more akin to treehouses, but this building’s architecture was very different. The gate and walls around it were made of stone, reinforced by special vines and rare materials.</p>
<p>“This way, please.”</p>
<p>Lyla headed through the gate without hesitation. There were guards posted at its side, but they just glanced at Shin and said nothing.</p>
<p>The interior of the building was very spacious, with many complex corridors. Intersections and doors were built at regular intervals, with each passageway being roughly the same length, so after a few turns it was difficult to know where one really was. It was a structure meant for defense.</p>
<p>“Please go in. Lady Tiera awaits you.”</p>
<p>Lyla stopped in front of a certain door and spoke. She wouldn’t go in with them, apparently. Shin felt five presences inside the room. Four of them were Tiera, Shibaid, Kagerou and Yuzuha. The last remaining one did not belong to any one of Shin’s party members.</p>
<p>Shin thanked Lyla and opened the door. Other than Tiera and the others, an elf unknown to Shin was in the room. Her clothing was similar to Lyla, but wore many more gorgeous decorations.</p>
<p>White, almost transparent skin without the slightest blemish, silver shoulder-length hair and golden eyes. Her appearance was very beautiful, as expected of an elf.</p>
<p>Her appearance suggested she was a young girl in her late teens. She looked younger than Tiera. Her appearance and luxurious jewelry signaled that she had to be of rather elevated status.</p>
<p>“That human is sir Shin?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Among us, I think he knows the most about the World Tree.”</p>
<p>Shin’s expectations were suddenly increased.</p>
<p>“(Shin!!!)”</p>
<p>“Whoops!”</p>
<p>Shin wanted to tell them to wait a bit before saying things like that, but Yuzuha rushed to him before he could. She was in a small fox mode, so she jumped and fit right into his arms. She called to him via Mind Chat because of the presence of someone other than the party members.</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>They had been separated for a while, so she wanted to cuddle more than the usual. She had been kind enough to let him have alone time with Schnee, so he let her do it for the time being.</p>
<p>After Yuzuha, Shibaid approached them too.</p>
<p>“You finally made it through.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but the welcome was rather rough, you know?”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned that the elves at the gate armed their bows against them and Shibaid frowned a bit.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that bad when we arrived.”</p>
<p>“It’s because I arrived, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin talked to Shibaid while coddling Yuzuha, then Tiera joined the conversation with an apologetic tone.</p>
<p>“So it’s really connected to that, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“It is. Because of that, things turned really complicated, so I had no choice but to contact you.”</p>
<p>Tiera apologized for having to do so. She would have wanted to solve the situation by herself, if it was possible.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be shy of asking us for help. But it’s not like I know everything about the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“But you know more than us, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Well…I guess.”</p>
<p>Compared to this world’s people, I guess I do…was what Shin meant to say, but he stopped himself. If the knowledge acquired in the game era was still valid, Tiera was definitely right. Problems would arise if symptoms of sickness Shin was unaware of were present.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s take care of introductions before going into the details. I haven’t met the young lady before, after all. As you have heard from Tiera, I am Shin, an adventurer. This is…”</p>
<p>“His wife, Yuki.”</p>
<p>Introduced by Shin, Schnee smiled and greeted the young lady. She casually stressed the “wife” part, causing Shibaid and Tiera to react.</p>
<p>Tiera couldn’t process the new information and stared at them, her mouth wide open. Shibaid quickly understood and smiled.</p>
<p>“Ehm, my name is Lymliss Luderia. Er, pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>Maybe because it was their first meeting, after introducing herself Lymliss looked timidly at Shin. She was probably shy with strangers. Her surname was the same as the gate guard Anaheit, so they were probably siblings.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. So, going back on topic, what’s the situation? Judging from the conversation between the messenger Lyla and the gate guard, it looks like there are factions at odds here?”</p>
<p>Thinking that he would be questioned later anyway, Shin did not say anything about Tiera and Shibaid’s reactions. At the same time, he tried saying what he thought could be the core of the situation. From the conversation between Lyla and Anaheit, he surmised that there had to be several factions in play.</p>
<p>“It’s just as you say. The Lanapacea village was born to supervise the World Tree, so its structures are different than other countries. There is a king, but the ones in charge of the World Tree have more authority.”</p>
<p>Shibaid too judged that it wasn’t the right time to talk about Shin and Schnee’s relationship and plainly answered Shin’s question. Because of the World Tree’s importance, its caretakers had the highest clout.</p>
<p>“What does that say for this country…?”</p>
<p>“Well, up until now it has been functioning normally, it seems.”</p>
<p>“Up until now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, up until now.”</p>
<p>Those repeated words highlighted the fact that no one knew what was going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>“Normally, the World Tree’s caretakers don’t interfere in the country’s politics. The current leader of the caretakers, the head of the Luderia house, seems to be a bit different, though. He seems to be involved with outside forces.”</p>
<p>Why must the caretakers of the World Tree, an existence vital to the whole world, be confined in such an isolated village? This was apparently the focus of the question.</p>
<p>“I have a bad feeling about all of this.”</p>
<p>“But normally, things wouldn’t turn out as bad as they did.”</p>
<p>Tiera, who overcame her shock, joined in the conversation.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Normally, the caretaker clans are two: if one goes out of control, it is the other’s duty to keep them in line.”</p>
<p>Shin then had a flash of a realization.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the other is the Lucent clan?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. Because of my curse, their duty was terminated, though.”</p>
<p>There still were those who carried the Lucent name, but being the clan who gave birth to a cursed elf, they were treated rather harshly.</p>
<p>“I returned with my curse gone, so things turned problematic.”</p>
<p>“I bet they did…”</p>
<p>The Lucent clan, considered by all an impure lineage. The banished priestess, however, had overcome her curse and had returned, more powerful than ever. She also retained her priestess powers to boot.</p>
<p>“The retainers of the Lucent clan got all excited, saying it’s the rebirth of the clan and similar stuff.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Tiera and the other clan members used to be loved by all: if it wasn’t for the curse, they would have been able to stop the Luderia clan.</p>
<p>Shin, personally, thought that it was way too late for such a reaction.</p>
<p>“I am telling them that I have no such intention, though.”</p>
<p>“It depends on what they are planning. Maybe they did not really want to banish….no, sorry, I said something weird.”</p>
<p>No matter the reason, the banished party would feel abandoned. Shin stated his honest thoughts, but quickly realized it and apologized to Tiera.</p>
<p>“No, don’t worry. If I was in their same situation, I probably wouldn’t have been able to stop it either.”</p>
<p>According to Tiera, not all elves agreed with the banishment. That was the reason why she managed to survive until she met Schnee. Originally she was planned to be executed, not exiled.</p>
<p>“But then, right now what is your status here?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t have my status or authority as a Lucent, but I am still a priestess, so I have some sort of special treatment.”</p>
<p>World Tree priestess was something that not everyone could become. One had to be recognized by the World Tree and be able to communicate with it. Such a talent was not inherited, but appeared more easily in certain lineages.</p>
<p>“Then I guess the other priestess must be unhappy about it, right? There was another priestess bearing that role before you returned, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“That’s not really it. One of the priestesses is this child, after all.”</p>
<p>Tiera then brought Lymliss before her.</p>
<p>“Ah, er, ehm…yes…I am…”</p>
<p>She was already about to cry. Her job was indeed priestess.</p>
<p>“I apologize in advance for disrespect, but…will she be okay?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that a priestess would have a firmer, dauntless attitude, so he couldn’t help but be worried about her.</p>
<p>“She’ll be fine. They supported this country while I was away, after all. Their talent and skill are proven.”</p>
<p>“I see….wait, are there so many priestesses?”</p>
<p>Tiera had clearly said “they”. It meant that there were at least two or more.</p>
<p>“Of course, why? We don’t know when someone with talent is born, after all. It can happen for more than one to have it in the same generation. Lymliss was like my junior when I was still a priestess. As of now, she has been acting as priestess longer than I did, so she kind of became my senior.”</p>
<p>“Not at all!! Sister Tiera, you are much more amazing than someone like me!! You overcame the curse, became stronger, and still have your priestess abilities…while I’m sure I couldn’t even go out of the village.”</p>
<p>Lymliss retorted enthusiastically. All her former shyness seemed to be gone. Her tone when she listed everything Tiera accomplished was so innocent that it was hard to imagine her fulfilling an important role such as World Tree priestess.</p>
<p>The subject of her retort, however, wouldn’t have it. In contrast with Lymliss’ enthusiasm, Tiera had turned bright red.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop, enough already!”</p>

<p>Tiera had been helplessly withstanding all the praise, but at a certain point couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>“Oh don’t be like that, it means you’re that respected.”</p>
<p>“I mean…it’s all too exaggerated, it’s like they’re talking about a whole different person…”</p>
<p>Tiera’s immature self, as she was before meeting Schnee, was apparently still present within her. While she said it was all exaggerated, Shin knew that she used her abilities without meaning to. She thought she wasn’t anything special, but there was the possibility that the truth was quite the contrary.</p>
<p>“I am not exaggerating at all! Sister Tiera’s spirit channeling can summon the spirits of the deceased, so she becomes like someone completely different.”</p>
<p>Shin wanted to correct Lymliss, saying that an actually different person inhabited Tiera’s body, but stopped himself in time. Apparently, Tiera could now use skills that she did not know before. Shin imagined she was like a spirit medium, but apparently Tiera was now even beyond that.</p>
<p>In the past there were priestesses with similar powers, but unlike Tiera, no one had managed to master their skills during their lifetime. That was the reason why Tiera was regarded as a genius.</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing to say, but sometimes that caused me to act very shamefully, or so I was told…”</p>
<p>“It’s an amazing ability, but yeah, I don’t really envy that part…”</p>
<p>When her soul returns to the World Tree, some skills become unusable. Tiera cannot retain her memories of that time, so it could be said that she does not benefit much from this talent. She receives the gratitude of the people she could help, but that was it. In exchange, she is granted treatment fitting to her role, though.</p>
<p>“The people around me envied me, but looking back at that time, I had barely any free time, all my meals were really frugal, training was super harsh, everyone looked at me with pity until the spirit channeling ended…I really worked hard…didn’t I…?”</p>
<p>“Tiera!! Come back to us!!”</p>
<p>The treatment she received wasn’t enough, after all. Tiera’s gaze went farther and farther as she talked, so Shin hurriedly brought her back to reality.</p>
<p>“Ehm, sister Tiera, are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Eh!? What was I…? My head hurts…”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s better to go back on topic.”</p>
<p>Shin told Tiera to take it easy and summarized the situation.</p>
<p>First, the World Tree’s current caretaker clan was only the Luderia. The clan’s head also seemed to be involved in suspicious activities. Tiera had no authority, but former followers of the Lucent clan, holding her as figurehead now that she had overcome her curse, are starting to move in order to restore the clan.</p>
<p>“(That Lyla we met before is from the Luderia clan, right? Why is someone from the Luderia clan serving Tiera instead of their head? Wait, does it mean that…)”</p>
<p>Since Lymliss, priestess belonging to Luderia clan, was with them, Shin used Mind Chat to talk with Shibaid. As he did, however, he came up with the answer to his question.</p>
<p>Shin had lived in a world where all sorts of stories and tales intertwined. He could recall many similar events like what was unfolding in Lanapacea at the moment.</p>
<p>“(It’s probably as you think. While they are using the Luderia name at the moment, there are many here who used to have the Lucent name or are connected to it. Lyla is one of them too.)”</p>
<p>“(I see, so the Luderia absorbed the fallen Lucent clan in itself.)”</p>
<p>The Lanapacea village was formed by several clans. Among them, those possessing the most authority were the clan of the royal family and the clan of the first priestess, Lu, which later split into two: Lucent and Luderia.</p>
<p>The clans following the Lucent were absorbed by the Luderia, which bore the same role of looking after the World Tree.</p>
<p>“This place too belongs to the Luderia?”</p>
<p>“Yes, at the moment it’s used as a second home of the Luderia clan, but it used to be the place where we lived. It was assigned to me since they thought I would find it easier to stay here.”</p>
<p>The former retainers of the Lucent clan were gathered there at present.</p>
<p>“Some people even abandoned their jobs to come here…it’s getting really problematic.”</p>
<p>Shin wondered if that wasn’t considered neglect of duty.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t the Luderia clan say anything about the situation?”</p>
<p>“Of course they do. Since you are a priestess, start helping with the purification of the World Tree, they said. That’s my goal too, so I have no reason to refuse, but lots of other problems have come up.”</p>
<p>Shin only knew that the World Tree had started dying. As soon as he arrived in Lanapacea he heard of the dispute between the Luderia and Lucent clans, but as it turns out there was more.</p>
<p>“First, about the priestesses with the ability of purifying the World Tree. Other than Lymliss there was one more, but she disappeared a long time ago. She was born after I left, but she was kidnapped, so recently Lymliss has been working hard on the purification by herself. One of the reasons why the World Tree is weakening is that her powers alone aren’t enough to keep up with the speed at which the World Tree is dying.”</p>
<p>The World Tree crisis was not known to all of Lanapacea’s population. Even if someone simply visited the village they wouldn’t know of it.</p>
<p>According to the elves who had inspected the location where the missing priestess was kidnapped, there were traces of miasma, so they suspected demons were the culprits. There were no other clues, however, so it was impossible to go look for her.</p>
<p>“The World Tree cleanses this world from impurity. Because of the decrease in World Trees and increase of impurity, however, many World Trees are gradually becoming contaminated. If Tiera wasn’t here, this World Tree would be in serious danger.”</p>
<p>Shibaid added that Lymliss’ ability as priestess was not lacking by any means, but the World Tree’s contamination had advanced to the point that it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“That is one of the underlying reasons why some people are adamantly pushing for the resurrection of the Lucent clan. The kidnapped priestess came from a clan called Lulac, which was supposed to keep the Luderia clan in check: they had the caretaker role in place of the Lucent. Since the priestess was taken, their authority and influence have grown smaller, so as I said before, right now the Luderia are front and center.”</p>
<p>The Lucent clan had been absorbed by the Luderia, but because of the birth of another priestess, the situation had returned to two clans acting the role of World Tree caretaker.</p>
<p>The kidnapping incident, however, put an end to it. Things would be very different if Lymliss was the one to disappear, but the priestess that was taken away belonged to the new clan of caretakers, the Lulac.</p>
<p>Because of this, the authority and influence as World Tree caretaker clan once again concentrated in the Luderia’s hands.</p>
<p>“Since the purification is lagging I was welcomed in the village, but as you can tell the situation is pretty complicated.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s expression was clouded. Because of the situation, however, her standing was rather strong. She used to be a priestess, so she knew what had to be done. Her abilities were also much superior to Lymliss.</p>
<p>It was thanks to Tiera that the situation was now somewhat stable. It was obvious for the Luderia to request her assistance.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, if only I wasn’t so incompetent…”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped, the World Tree is in a much more terrible state now than when I was here. It’s not something one person can solve by themselves.”</p>
<p>Lymliss looked down in shame, but Tiera defended her. Shin knew of the extent of Tiera’s purification powers. If Tiera and another priestess could only barely keep at bay the contamination, the situation was indeed dire.</p>
<p>“I see now why you’d call for me.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Please, we are in your hands.”</p>
<p>Shin first had to see the World Tree before being able to say anything, but he was ready to do anything he could.</p>
<p>“By the way, Tiera…there is something else you need to say, isn’t there? Something very important. You should speak now.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…! I didn’t forget about it, really! But I wanted to act like it didn’t happen…”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s question turned Tiera’s expression sour. If Tiera wanted to act like it didn’t happen, it had to be something serious, so Shin prepared to listen to her seriously.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Well…the current head of the Luderia clan has a son, and he…says he wants to take me as his bride.”</p>
<p>“…..oof.”</p>
<p>Completely surprised, Shin could only emit a sort of whimper. Schnee’s self introduction as his wife probably contributed too.</p>
<p>“Does he plan to pull you in with them before you become the clan’s leading figure?”</p>
<p>“Actually, it seems that’s not the case. When I returned here I had the chance to talk a bit with him, but he proposed to me then and there.”</p>
<p>After the purification, the son of the clan leader with the Luderia retainers coming to accompany Lymliss and proposed to Tiera on the spot. Tiera added that he didn’t say anything about causes such as the purification of the World Tree or the world at large, but simply appealed to her persistently.</p>
<p>“For real?”</p>
<p>“Before you ask, I refused.”</p>
<p>Tiera half glared at Shin and replied. Shibaid later said that she refused immediately, without even the time to act surprised.</p>
<p>“Did you know him already?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that a sudden marriage proposal would leave anyone surprised, so there had to be a reason why Tiera wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Yes, I knew him since I was a priestess, well he’s kind of a childhood friend. Elves have few children, so it’s not like it was only him, though. Since I was the daughter of the Lucent clan head, because of customs and things like that…well, a lot happened. To put it simply, he’s my childhood friend and former fiance.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so that’s it.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard that high-ranked families used to marry their sons and daughters in order to preserve their relationships. It wasn’t something that could ever have occurred to him, but it wasn’t unheard of in the real world.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that Tiera was the daughter of the head of the clan, but that explained the situation well. In that world kings and nobles existed, so it wasn’t strange for such things to happen among elves as well.</p>
<p>Shin wondered, however, if it was okay for the children of the two different caretaker clans to marry.</p>
<p>“When I was cursed the marriage plan was dispelled just like that, but now that the curse is gone he acts like nothing happened! It’s just horrible!”</p>
<p>Tiera recalled the proposal and her temper flared up again. She was now utterly furious.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Tiera. Your anger is definitely justified, but this is not the time to cause a ruckus.”</p>
<p>“Y, yes…I’m sorry, master.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s words calmed Tiera instantly, as expected of her mentor.</p>
<p>“Ehm, sister Tiera…what exactly is your relationship with lady Yuki?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t tell you about it, did I. When I was banished from the village, master rescued me. She took care of me until the curse was gone. She taught me not only skills, but also new ways of thinking, ways of looking at things, many things I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“W-wow! Amazing!”</p>
<p>Lymliss, who had great respect for Tiera, looked at Schnee, Tiera’s master, with sparkles in her eyes. Her shyness seems to disappear when she turns like this.</p>
<p>“By the way, is it okay for miss Lymliss to be here?”</p>
<p>In order to help Schnee, who was feeling awkward because of the young elf’s burning stare, Shin asked about something he wondered since his arrival. Lymliss addressed Tiera with the same respect as the Luderia retainers who planned for the Lucent’s revival, after all.</p>
<p>Lymliss called Tiera “sister”, but from her behavior everyone would think that Tiera was of higher standing. Regardless of Lymliss’ feelings, the Luderia clan surely did not view the situation positively.</p>
<p>“It normally wouldn’t be okay, but since we are purifying the World Tree together, she comes here with the pretext that it wouldn’t be bad for us to strengthen our relationship.”</p>
<p>“Sister Tiera taught me how a priestess should act and use my abilities, so…”</p>
<p>All her enthusiasm when looking at Schnee vanished: in front of Shin, Lymliss lost all of her momentum. She seemed to act differently when talking with elves and other species, or maybe she wasn’t used to talking with men.</p>
<p>“I see, she’s your senior as priestess then.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t teach her anything special, though. The way a priestess should act, manners and such are different in the Lucent and Luderia clans, and a priestess’ abilities are learned more through practice than theory.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!! Your teaching is very easy to understand!!”</p>
<p>“R-really? Well, I’m glad then.”</p>
<p>Tiera succumbed against Lymliss’ momentum, even stronger now than how it was with Schnee.</p>
<p>“Anyway, won’t it be bad if you don’t go back by now? They’re not very happy with your presence here, right?”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we’ll be able to meet again soon.”</p>
<p>Pushed by Tiera’s smile, Lymliss returned to the Luderia clan’s main house. Her escort was waiting in another room.</p>
<p>“It’s a fine mess, more than I expected.”</p>
<p>“Right…it was too much to write by letter, I didn’t know when to start…”</p>
<p>Less tense now that Lymliss was gone, Tiera looked quite tired.</p>
<p>“At first, I was just worried if I could visit my mother’s grave or not. But the aura of the World Tree was totally different from before, so I couldn’t leave it alone. Poor Lymliss was really emaciated when I arrived.”</p>
<p>The World Tree is always protected by elven warriors, so normally it isn’t possible to get close to it. Thanks to Shibaid’s skills and equipment, however, they managed to get close enough to inspect it. Since Shibaid did not know many concealment skills, it had taken considerable time to do it, though.</p>
<p>When they finally managed to slip inside, they found Lymliss, on the brink of collapsing for using too much strength to purify the World Tree.</p>
<p>“We carried Lymliss back and asked her what was going on. She remembered me, so we weren’t treated as intruders. I then revealed who I was officially, and here we are.”</p>
<p>“Here you are, admired as priestess and turning into the trigger for a feud…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it like that, please. As soon as the World Tree is healed, I plan on leaving this place.”</p>
<p>Lanapacea was Tiera’s hometown, but she had no intention of staying there.</p>
<p>“Okay, now I know how you feel. Next is the World Tree, is its condition that bad?”</p>
<p>“I think that if I didn’t come back, it was a matter of time until it dried up completely. I’ve never seen it in such a sorry state.”</p>
<p>Part of the trunk had lost all gloss, as if it was dry, and had started changing color. Tiera said that during the time she was a priestess, it had never turned like that.</p>
<p>“It’s really strange. I learned about the World Tree from the previous generation’s priestess, but no one ever said anything about such a phenomenon. If something happened to the World Tree, they would surely record it for future generations…I asked Lymliss too, but she said she never learned about anything like that. It probably never happened before.”</p>
<p>Tiera said that according to elven knowledge, the only countermeasure available was purifying the World Tree.</p>
<p>“Part of the World Tree had dried up and fell on the ground, so we recovered it.”</p>
<p>Shibaid then took out two item cards and materialized them. One was an orichalcum plate, the other the World Tree fragment he mentioned.</p>
<p>It was probably part of the World Tree’s bark. Laid on the orichalcum plate, it had a sickly dull color.</p>
<p>“This is seriously bad…”</p>
<p>Shin was almost speechless. In the game there was a rescue quest that involved healing sick World Trees, but he remembered that they never turned in such a horrible state.</p>
<p>“This is miasma…? No, it feels like a devil’s aura, but it’s also different.”</p>
<p>In the game era, the affected World Trees were enveloped in a dark aura visual effect, but now that the game had become reality he could feel the aura from the fragment. It was an aura similar to the many kinds of “noxious presence” Shin had felt in this world, but it was also different from each of them. It could only be defined as impurity.</p>
<p>“Does it return to normal after you purify it?”</p>
<p>“It depends on the state. If it gets like this, we can only cut off the contaminated part. Maybe you would be okay, but an average elf will be confined to bed for days after just touching this a little. Some even become paralyzed or confused.”</p>
<p>Tiera said that whoever touched it was affected by serious status effects. The fragment had been recovered by elven warriors, under the priestess’ supervision. During the process, one of them had touched it by mistake.</p>
<p>Even trained warriors, with levels much higher than regular elves, could not withstand its effects.</p>
<p>There weren’t Chosen Ones among those affected, so they didn’t know if the impurity would affect Chosen Ones as well.</p>
<p>“They just touched it and couldn’t move anymore…is it any different from paralysis?”</p>
<p>“The paralysis is the same as the normal one, they just can’t move. But they also lose all their energy. I asked Shibaid to check, and it looks like, what do you call them? HP and MP? They were both in the red.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I believe it either robbed them of their life force or absorbed it.”</p>
<p>Shibaid added his hypothesis to complement Tiera’s words.</p>
<p>“We can try solving the problem with skills then. The World Tree bark is treated as a material, so it might tell us something.”</p>
<p>All creation-type jobs had a skill in common, 【Analyze Material】, which could tell all creation-related information of the analyzed material. If used, the item explanation window listed when that material was used in the creation process and what effects it would have on the finished product.</p>
<p>For example, if used on medicinal herb it listed that it was better to cut them into small pieces and that they boosted the finished product’s effects. Such information was often vague, however, so an extensive process of trial and error was still necessary. Nonetheless, they were helpful hints for effective item crafting.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking that he would have no use of that World Tree bark as material as he activated the skill. The information was displayed to him on a semi-transparent window.</p>
<p>“Ah, no good.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s bugging…I mean, it’s a jumbled mess. The information was probably ruined by the impurity.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the displayed information, then raised his arms in surrender. There were letters, numbers, and unrelated symbols mixed in it, making it unreadable. The barely readable parts seemed to describe the original World Tree bark.</p>
<p>“Nothing to see here. I suppose that even if it was used to craft something, it wouldn’t even work.”</p>
<p>“I hoped we could find out something, but I suppose it will not go so easily.”</p>
<p>“Can’t be helped, we would have been lucky if it worked.”</p>
<p>Just in case, Shin tried using all sorts of status healing items and skills on the World Tree bark fragment. As he did, the discolored part gradually regained their original color. When Shin and Tiera purified it, the effects were clearly visible. As they might have expected, Tiera’s had a greater effect.</p>
<p>“This is strange…I tried purifying it when we recovered it, but it didn’t have this much effect.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because it’s separated from the World Tree now. I guess the World Tree was acting as a source of impurity.”</p>
<p>Impurity from the whole world gathered in the World Trees. Shin thus thought that it would be difficult to purify it entirely.</p>
<p>“I see…no wonder. Me and Lymliss would never be able to purify the whole world after all.”</p>
<p>“….can it be that…we can’t do anything?”</p>
<p>“No, wait, I’m just listing possibilities. As far as I know, it’s not possible to completely annihilate impurity. But it should be possible to erase enough impurity so that the World Tree can purify it by itself or to increase its purification abilities.”</p>
<p>In a past event, Shin had set purification boosting devices and created nutrients specific for the World Trees. The problem was how different the increase in impurity was between the game era and now. He could think of possible countermeasures, but there were many unknown factors in the game, so he couldn’t guarantee they would be effective.</p>
<p>“We can’t just do nothing, though. First of all, I will get permission so that you can enter the World Tree area to inspect it.”</p>
<p>They wouldn’t be let through simply because they were a priestess’ acquaintances.</p>
<p>“If it turns out to be necessary, we can use my real name. I’m an elf too and I’m pretty well known, after all.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will do so too.”</p>
<p>“No, Shibaid, you used to be the monarch of another country after all. They might become needlessly suspicious. I will go by myself first.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, indeed you are right.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded to Schnee. At present, he was simply an adventurer, but he was still widely known as emperor Shibaid of the dragon empire of Kilmont.</p>
<p>Even if he was not related to Kilmont anymore, if his identity became known not only the Luderia clan, but also Lanapacea’s king would be forced to make a move.</p>
<p>“Not that the news of your real identity wouldn’t cause a stir, master.”</p>
<p>“Right. I bet that there’s not an elf that doesn’t know Schnee, after all.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded, but Tiera and Shin remarked that Schnee’s fame was not to be underestimated either. She was well known among the royals of several countries, so it was an understatement to define her as just “pretty well known”.</p>
<p>“I do not belong to a specific country, though, so we could just say that I came out of concern for the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“I doubt they would refuse, but the current clan head is a really stubborn person.”</p>
<p>Tiera expressed her concern and Shin couldn’t help but wonder if such a person was fit to be the clan’s leader.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 2 Part 1</p>
<p>“I’ll go get permission right away, then.”</p>
<p>Tiera was ready to go to the Luderia. She was probably keen on solving the problem and leaving the village as soon as possible. Kagerou, who was lying quietly at her feet, slipped inside her shadow.</p>
<p>“I’ll accompany you, then.”</p>
<p>Schnee followed Tiera. If permission wasn’t granted to them, the group would have to consider sneaking in.</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid stayed behind and waited. Because of Lanapacea’s circumstances, they might cause trouble if they walked around outside.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shibaid, there’s something I need to ask.”</p>
<p>“What would that be?”</p>
<p>Shin talked to Shibaid, while carrying Yuzuha in his arms. It was a bit difficult to ask the person in question, so Shin decided to talk about it with Shibaid first.</p>
<p>“Tiera said she first came to visit her mother’s grave, right? How did that go?”</p>
<p>Shin had seen a vision of Tiera’s past, of her younger self embracing her dead mother and crying. Based on that, Tiera’s mother probably died while attempting to let her flee.</p>
<p>For Tiera, her mother was someone to be proud of, but, for Lanapacea, she was nothing but a traitor at the time. Tiera couldn’t have built a grave at that time, so Shin wondered if they had given her a proper burial.</p>
<p>“Tiera’s lady mother…I haven’t heard anything in detail. As Tiera said, however, not all elves agreed with her banishment. Tiera’s mother was surely well respected too. While it was a bit to the side, her grave was definitely there. It also seemed well kept, like all the other graves.”</p>
<p>Shibaid said that Tiera had visited the grave already, so there could be no mistaking it. There was no way of knowing if or how proper rites had been held, but at least Tiera’s mother hadn’t been neglected, so Shin was slightly relieved.</p>
<p>“Anyway…the World Tree is in lethal danger and Tiera just happens to come back for a visit? It’s all too convenient.”</p>
<p>“I agree. The World Tree, however, is one of the pillars sustaining this world. It might have interfered with our teleportation at the time.”</p>
<p>The evil deity was already defeated, so such a thing wouldn’t be impossible to do with a World Tree’s powers, or so Shibaid theorized.</p>
<p>“If you put it like that, it does sound feasible. I just feel that these kinds of convenient developments happen to us way too often.”</p>
<p>In the Wraith Plains, Shin happened to be where the Skullface Lord appeared.</p>
<p>Shin being transported together with Rionne.</p>
<p>Shin visiting right when the merfolk were facing a crisis.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee being transported to a country threatened by a devil’s invasion.</p>
<p>If they started counting smaller cases too, the number would grow exponentially. The encounters with Yuzuha and Kagerou were such cases as well.</p>
<p>Most of these events could hardly have been solved by the local people. Shin wasn’t the only one concerned by this string of coincidences.</p>
<p>“I see…you have been involving yourself with all sorts of trouble even when I wasn’t around.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I went looking for trouble myself!”</p>
<p>“I know that. We don’t know if there are actual connections, though. Demons or devils seem to be frequently involved, but there are other cases too. What happened at Bayreuth, for example, seemed to be nothing but a random occurrence to me.”</p>
<p>Only the attack on Erkunt was caused by a devil, but many other events were related to demons. In the beginning, however, they didn’t know of the demons’ involvement.</p>
<p>Shin and Rionne’s teleportation to a Sacred Place was the first example. If Shin hadn’t caused the Skullface’s sword to fly all the way to the royal castle, they wouldn’t have ever met.</p>
<p>“Kuu! Shin is special!”</p>
<p>“Hm? Yuzuha, do you know something?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s sudden mumble halted Shin and Shibaid’s conversation. Yuzuha felt their gazes concentrating on her, so she jumped out of Shin’s arms, landed on the ground and took human form.</p>
<p>It was Yuzuha’s late teens version, as they had last seen her before separating. Shin thought: if she had become familiar with the power received from Ishkar in the Castle of the Depths she would look older, but apparently this was her current limit.</p>
<p>“It’s easier to talk in this form, so I transformed. I recalled something about you, Shin, and learned something new.”</p>
<p>“You said that I’m special? What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“I can feel a power different from yours within you. I think that is what guides you to sources of harm for this world. Others are influenced by it too.”</p>
<p>“A power…inside me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That power is originally used to protect this world. That is why it’s attracted to demons or devils, why it connects you to them. Do you have any idea what it could be?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…I can’t be sure, but I do have an idea.”</p>
<p>In a world where game rules still applied, there was a skill and title that probably only Shin possessed. Thinking about how he had acquired them, he could only think of one possibility.</p>
<p>“The last opponent I fought to clear the death game. When I defeated the monster called Origin, I received Gifts granting me powers that, for this world’s standards, might as well be called cheating.”</p>
<p>The three Gifts Shin had talked about with Schnee before: Accomplished One, Limit Breaker and Liberator. Among them, the first two were especially amazing. Because of Shin’s maxed out stats, their effects were particularly “game-breaking”.</p>
<p>“You told me about that before. When I heard about their effects, I honestly doubted my ears.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe my eyes either.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled with a sort of nostalgia how many times he had checked to see if he hadn’t read wrong.</p>
<p>“I have also acquired skills, but I haven’t used them yet. Or rather, it’s more correct to say that I can’t activate them. I have never seen them before and don’t know what the conditions for activation.”</p>
<p>The three skills Shin acquired after defeating Origin, 【Hades Surge】, 【Scattering Surge】, and 【Concentrated Surge】 were still impossible to activate, as Shin didn’t know the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Normally, MP consumption, effects etc. of player skills could be checked via the menu. Some skills that could be used in events had particular activation conditions, but they were usually easy to predict from their names or the event’s contents.</p>
<p>The three skills Shin acquired, however, had no related events or hints about their activation. From their names, Shin could guess that 【Hades Surge】 was a boosting skill or a trigger to use the two other skills.</p>
<p>【Scattering Surge】 was probably a wide-range attack. 【Concentrated Surge】 was maybe a high firepower strike concentrated into one point, but these were all predictions.</p>
<p>“I have never heard of such skills before either. However, there is something that concerns me.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“During Shin’s battle against Ishkar, his body seemed enveloped in a sort of deep purple aura. Could that possibly be 【Hades Surge】?”</p>
<p>Shin hadn’t noticed this at all, so Shibaid’s words surprised him very much.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I have no idea…I can’t recall.”</p>
<p>“Plenty of time has passed. After that, I too was engrossed in the exchange with Ishkar and the merfolk’s affair, so I neglected mentioning it until now. My apologies.”</p>
<p>“Don’t apologize, that’s the same for me too. Schnee and Filma didn’t say anything either, it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard that during his battle with Ishkar, Shibaid and the others had been stopped by an invisible barrier. No one mentioned anything about the surge skills, so it wasn’t strange for them not to put the two things together, so Shin told Shibaid to raise his head.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about, I get the feeling that there was something different at that time. I felt really eager to fight…but I feel that’s not the power to protect the world Yuzuha mentioned.”</p>
<p>“The power within you doesn’t have a defined will. The power probably reacted excessively to your feelings, boosting your will to fight too much. When power grows too strong, people are intoxicated by it and their restraint to harming others is lost.”</p>
<p>“Right, it might be as Yuzuha said. I always restrain my powers with【Limiter】, but when I don’t, I feel like I could do anything.”</p>
<p>Shin had fought very few times at full power, removing all the restrictions imposed by【Limiter】. Every time he did, however, he could not see himself losing in the slightest. That feeling of omnipotence was probably what Yuzuha meant when she said to be intoxicated by power.</p>
<p>“Is it dangerous to remove【Limiter】?”</p>
<p>“Not as long as you maintain control. If anything happens, I will stop you.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha was usually expressionless, but now her eyes clearly had a strong light within them.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it better to talk about this with Schnee and Tiera here too?”</p>
<p>“It’s still…a bit early.”</p>
<p>Shibaid wondered if it wasn’t better to share the information with the others and Yuzuha replied, back in her usual sleepy tone.</p>
<p>“Why would that be?”</p>
<p>Shibaid asked why Yuzuha talked about the matter to him too and not only Shin.</p>
<p>“Tiera and Schnee are too reliant on Shin. If… anything happened to him, they would not be able to draw their swords against him. I might not be able to stop him by myself.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha spoke with a telling pause after the word “if”. She clearly wished that possibility never became reality.</p>
<p>“So you say that I could?”</p>
<p>“Shibaid, what lies within you is loyalty. You do not wish to become someone special for Shin, like Schnee does. That is why, when there is no other option left, you will be able to wield your weapon.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha looked straight at Shibaid, who was not concealing his intimidating tone, and spoke firmly.</p>
<p>“Even when a leader is mistaken, is it not the follower’s duty to obey?”</p>
<p>“That possibility is not zero either. However, I believe that if you think your leader is going down the wrong path, you will try to stop him even if you must fight. That is why I spoke about it to you too.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Shibaid did not object to Yuzuha’s words. He admitted to himself that in an emergency, he would probably take up arms as she said. Shibaid was Shin’s support character, but at present he was not bound by anything. He would not act on predetermined commands, as he would in the game, but decide which path to follow based on his own will.</p>
<p>He was not forced to be Shin’s ally unconditionally.</p>
<p>Listening to them, Shin too thought that Shibaid would stop him if it was necessary. He was the one to set Shibaid’s personality, after all. In a way, he knew him much better than Yuzuha did.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s anything to worry about as long as Shin is like this, though. I believe in Shin.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you do, but don’t hug me in that form, please.”</p>
<p>Wiping away the heavy mood in one stroke, Yuzuha waddled closer to Shin and hugged him tightly, wrapping her arms around his back, so her fully grown curves softly changed shape against his body.</p>
<p>Looking at her happily wagging tail, signaling her mood, Shibaid felt all tenseness leave his body and his shoulders dropped.</p>
<p>“I too believe that Shin will not be consumed by that power. Would you be able to stop him if he ever did, anyway?”</p>
<p>“When the going gets tough, Yuzuha gets going.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Yuzuha replied with a very smug face, while resisting Shin’s attempts at pushing her away. Shin and Shibaid, both rendered speechless, simply stood there, powerless.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 2 Part 2</p>
<p>Ten minutes had passed since Shin told Yuzuha that, if she had to stick to him, she should at least do so in small fox form. While waiting for Schnee and Tiera to return, Shin watched Yuzuha merrily snoozing on his lap when he heard quarreling voices from the entrance.</p>
<p>Shibaid had also noticed and was looking in the same direction as Shin. The residence they were in was fairly large, so normally it wasn’t possible to hear people talk in the entrance from their room: Shin and Shibaid could thanks to their 【Listen】 skill.</p>
<p>They didn’t mean to eavesdrop all conversations in the residence, so they usually kept it inactive and only used it when necessary.</p>
<p>Shin detected two presences walking around the entrance, so he activated it thinking that they were heading inside the residence. One of them was saying that someone had come to meet Tiera and they wanted to wait inside, while the other, an elf working in the residence, refused. The residence was very large, so a number of helpers worked in it.</p>
<p>Shin kept listening and the conversation took a strange turn: they started talking about the Lulac clan leader, the problems of the Lucent and Luderia clans and similar questions, so Shin decided to conceal himself and go to the entrance.</p>
<p>“—and thus, we request lady Tiera to come to the residence of our Lulac clan. If things continue like this, the Luderia will grow even more powerful. As a caretaker, this cannot be considered correct.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! You are simply after lady Tiera’s powers. The Lucent are now a part of the Luderia, thus, it is natural for lady Tiera to be at our side.”</p>
<p>Shin was now close enough to hear the voices normally, but rather than angry he felt simply exasperated. In the end, they both wanted to use Tiera for their own benefit. Considering the status of the 2 male elves quarrelling before him, it was pretty obvious for them to do so. However, Shin knew of Tiera’s feelings so he couldn’t help but think that they were engaged in a pointless debate.</p>
<p>“It cannot be helped, I see…I shall return for today.”</p>
<p>The representative of the Lulac clan turned around and the man, likely belonging to the Luderia clan, left too. Shin followed their presence for a while and noticed that, for some reason, they were heading in the same direction, even walking side by side.</p>
<p>Even if they had to head in the same direction, there was no reason to walk so close together. Besides, there was another presence behind the two, which seemed to be tailing them.</p>
<p>“This is strange…their clans seemed to be at odds. If the presence following them is an escort…why would they conceal their presence? It doesn’t seem like they are dealing with private affairs, so normally they would be alone, or the escort would be together with them…”</p>
<p>“Indeed, this merits suspicion. Some, however, dislike having their escorts walk with them, so it would be understandable if the latter was concealed. If those two are of high rank, that might be it. Though, I do not understand why they would be together. I suppose not all members from the clans are up in arms against each other, but judging from their conversation, their relationship did not seem positive in the least.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I suppose I should follow them for a while.”</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the two were avoiding crowded streets, so Shin suspected something was afoot and told Shibaid that he was going after them. Yuzuha, now awake, climbed on Shin’s shoulder and went with him. Shibaid was not suited for such stealth activities, so he said he would wait back in the residence.</p>
<p>“Okay then…looks like they’re talking about something.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, I don’t think they’re fighting…now.”</p>
<p>Shin and Yuzuha, still concealed by 【Hiding】, followed the two elves. Between their quarrels, they would sometimes whisper among each other, in completely different tones. The loud quarrels were apparently a camouflage tactic meant for the presence following them.</p>
<p>Shin decided to focus only on what the two elves whispered.</p>
<p>“That manner of speaking would only worsen people’s impressions. If you wish to apologize, then why not use a more peaceful method? It’s like you’re begging people to hate you.”</p>
<p>The Lulac representative’s brow furrowed, his blue eyes looking at the man next to him. He was quite handsome, as normal for most elves, with short hair parted at the sides of his face. His tone was casual and he appeared fairly confident.</p>
<p>According to 【Analyze】, his name was Herald.</p>
<p>“You too. It sounds like you want to use Tiera as a substitute for your missing priestess. That would be a worse blow to the people’s impression of your clan.”</p>
<p>The man likely belonging to the Luderia replied. He was an elf, naturally, with silver hair reaching up to his shoulders, his green eyes glaring back at Herald. His name was Orlean.</p>
<p>“Like I don’t know that already! Our old man was more than happy to banish lady Tiera at the time.”</p>
<p>“But look at him now! She came back so much stronger, with a divine beast to boot, so he’s pissing his pants worrying that she’s going to get her revenge. Yet he won’t admit his faults all the same…he’s just hopeless. I get it that I wasn’t even born then, but acting as the one in charge of drawing her to our side is just absurd. And I’m supposed to “tread the water”? What the hell am I supposed to do? On top of all that, that residence’s retainers are former Lucent people, so even if I say the truth, who knows if they’ll believe me…”</p>
<p>Some former Lucent retainers were invested in making Tiera the figurehead of the clan’s revival, after all. From their point of view, the Lulac’s actions would be easily thought to mean that they wanted to use Tiera for their own goals. Herald was so irritated that he managed to raise his voice while whispering, a rather impressive feat.</p>
<p>“What about me, then? I was her fiance and couldn’t even protect her. If she wanted to take revenge, I’d be the first in line! If this would give her some relief, that’d be fine, though.”</p>
<p>Orlean agreed with Herald’s idea that honestly bowing their heads and petition Tiera’s assistance was better, then said his piece.</p>
<p>“What are you saying, you idiot. I did greet her officially as representative of the Lulac, and I can tell that she’s not that kind of woman. The guys who escorted lady Tiera to the purification said they started crying just by watching her do it! Someone with that kind of power isn’t going to feel any relief by killing you, man.”</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Shin, Tiera’s reputation had been on the rise. He had seen her purification before, but did not recall being moved to the point of tears. He wondered what could have ever happened.</p>
<p>“I know that already. I just regret what happened that much. That is why I want to cooperate with her as much as I can, but she’s always being watched. If I said anything like that, they’ll go straight to father to report. We’re already butting heads about how they’re treating Tiera…in the worst case I won’t be free to act anymore either. It wasn’t so bad before, but father lately is acting really strangely.”</p>
<p>“Should we speed up the plan?”</p>
<p>“No, I want to know as much as possible about what father is trying to do. Besides, the Lulac warrior chiefs are still mostly on father’s side. At least the majority follows the head as warriors protecting the country and the World Tree, though.”</p>
<p>The conversation was getting more and more suspicious and Shin could not shake an increasingly bad feeling. Their speech suggested that they might be planning something like a coup d’etat.</p>
<p>More than anything, the fact that Tiera was being watched was a problem. Shin was sure that there was no such person when they were together. She was possibly followed only when she went to purify the World Tree.</p>
<p>(So this guy is Tiera’s former fiance? The one who proposed to her as soon as they met…)</p>
<p>Shin’s impression of Orlean changed a bit after hearing their conversation. He seemed to have several doubts about the current situation, and the same could be said about Herald. Based on their words, it was clear that they had other collaborators too.</p>
<p>The proposal too seemed to serve the purpose of having Tiera, who had returned stronger than ever, be taken in by the Luderia clan, the most powerful faction at the moment, and to protect her from the clan head.</p>
<p>“It was a mistake to let the Luderia be the most powerful clan for all this time. But those who know about the World Tree are aware that the Luderia are up to no good…hell, your father doesn’t even try to hide it lately, does he?”</p>
<p>“It might be because their preparations are complete. But I really have no idea about what he’s trying to do. Even if I’m next in line for the clan head position, I only oversee very little of the clan’s activities… just stuff that anyone else could do. He’s definitely acting strange, but I have no idea what changed him and he won’t tell me anything about his plans. It’s really frustrating.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to himself as he kept following the two and organizing the information he gathered. There seemed to be a rift between the Luderia’s current head and the next in line, Orlean. The current head and his closest retainers were up to something.</p>
<p>Judging from his words, Orlean was keen on earnestly protecting the World Tree. Herald was a childhood friend of his, that’s why they spoke so frankly. He too seemed to think that taking care of the World Tree was his mission.</p>
<p>Drawing Tiera within their family was the clan head’s intention, but Herald too was of the opinion that Tiera’s powers were necessary to keep the Luderia in check and protect the World Tree at the same time.</p>
<p>Part of the Luderia clan was also involved in suspicious activities, so he believed that for Tiera it would be safer to be with the Lulac, which bore the same role as World Tree caretaker clan.</p>
<p>“See ya. Better think of a better invitation next time.”</p>
<p>“Like I need you to tell me. You better talk smarter next time too.”</p>
<p>The two elves’ whispered conversation stopped there. They acted like they quarreled again, then went their separate ways. Shin considered following one of them, but realized that they wouldn’t talk about important information by themselves, so he stopped following them.</p>
<p>In any case, he had already gathered information that had to be reflected upon.</p>
<p>“So the Luderia’s next head sees this situation as bizarre…”</p>
<p>“Is the World Tree in danger because of the same cause?”</p>
<p>“If the boss of the caretakers is up to something, it would be strange if it was unrelated.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s suspicion was well-founded. Shin sighed: there was surely going to be trouble before the situation could be solved.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 2 Part 3</p>
<p>About one hour after Shin and Yuzuha returned to the residence, they were talking with Shibaid when they hear a loud bang.</p>
<p>“Tiera and the others are back.”</p>
<p>“In a foul mood too, I doubt they will have good things to report.”</p>
<p>The bang they had heard was the sound of the doors being thrown open.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, let’s talk about what you said before when this business is taken care of. With Filma and the others too.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had avoided mentioning it to Schnee and Tiera, but it would not be good to hide it. Some members were also elsewhere, so they decided to discuss it again when everyone was gathered. Shibaid nodded to Shin’s proposal, as Tiera and Schnee approached their room, with footsteps much more agitated than usual.</p>
<p>“Welcome back. Permission…wasn’t granted, I guess?”</p>
<p>Tiera’s foul mood didn’t need an explanation. She was clearly still holding back her anger.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, exactly! For heaven’s sake! “Mere humans cannot be trusted”, they say! You’re the ones who don’t deserve any trust!! Making Lymliss work so hard while you sit back!!”</p>
<p>Since she was surrounded by Shin and companions, Tiera let all her anger out. She had never shown such seething rage.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, calm down now. Even if I am a priestess’ acquaintance, it’s hard to trust someone right away, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s true too, but…they never even met you, yet say things like “he’s probably deceiving you” or “there can’t be someone like that other than us”…aah, I’m getting irritated just thinking about it!!”</p>
<p>According to Tiera, the area around a World Tree was a sacred place for elves, where other races were not allowed to enter. The current situation, however, was an emergency. Even with Tiera here, all they could do was stall the contamination.</p>
<p>Tiera tried to persuade them that it wasn’t the time to worry about things like that, but they found it doubtful that Shin was really knowledgeable about the World Tree.</p>
<p>“I get why it makes you angry, but it’s pretty normal for them to find it suspicious. The World Tree is not something a human would normally learn about.”</p>
<p>“That’s..! That’s true, but…”</p>
<p>“I guess we should have them ask me a question that only someone with actual knowledge could respond, reply correctly and go on from there. If they ask where I’ve learned it from, just say that I was trained by a High Elf.”</p>
<p>If that didn’t work, the only way left was to sneak in. Lanapacea was Tiera’s hometown and housed the World Tree, an existence vital for the whole world, so Shin wanted to avoid trouble as much as possible. As long as the World Tree problem was taken care of, no matter what the elves said or did, they just needed to hightail it out of there, or so Shin thought. If they could, of course.</p>
<p>“It would be easy if they were convinced like that.”</p>
<p>“Did you reveal Schnee’s name, by the way? With her support, they have to be more careful with their words, no?”</p>
<p>“We did, but this was the result. Without master, they wouldn’t have even listened to us, I guess.”</p>
<p>“That’s….wow.”</p>
<p>Were they being extremely careful because of the gravity of the situation, or were they simply distrustful of other species? Based on the information he had, Shin leaned towards the latter option. If it wasn’t for the World Tree, he would definitely steer clear.</p>
<p>“Well, regardless of whether they trust us or not, what we have to do doesn’t change. Let’s start making preparations.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t checked the World Tree yet, how can we prepare?”</p>
<p>“For starters, I’ll prepare the countermeasures to the symptoms I know of. The special nutrient 『Healer EX』 to give energy to the World Tree, the magic circle 『Eraser EX』 to reinforce its purification abilities, then the magic crystal 『Empower EX』 to lessen the damage caused by impurity. With these three, it should become more resistant to impurity.”</p>
<p>In the game, just one of them was enough to create sufficient effects. Using all three should be enough to resurrect withering World Trees. They should work in this world too, so Shin decided to use them all without reserve.</p>
<p>“Healer, Eraser, Empower…one of them has a pretty ominous name…”</p>
<p>“Forget about the names…I didn’t choose them, just so that we’re clear. I haven’t used them in this world yet, so I’m not sure how effective they will be, but they should work as intended.”</p>
<p>Shin looked through his item box and took out items he didn’t use during their events. He had 2 Healer EX, 2 Empower EX and 1 Eraser EX.</p>
<p>Healer EX was used by planting the nutrient case into the ground.</p>
<p>Eraser EX, a magic circle sticker, was to be applied directly to the trunk.</p>
<p>Empower EX was a magic crystal to be buried near the roots.</p>
<p>“I should craft some too.”</p>
<p>Items created in this world might have different effects than the ones created in the game era. Shin decided to make some more, just in case.</p>
<p>Eraser EX and Empower EX had simple production processes, the former required one to draw a magic circle and the latter to attach a certain enchantment, but the liquid Healer EX needed a bit more work.</p>
<p>“If you want to materialize Tsuki no Hokora we can do it in the inner garden, but it’ll stand out.”</p>
<p>“No, they’re pretty simple to make, I don’t need Tsuki no Hokora for these.”</p>
<p>Shin made sure no one was around and took out several metal fragments and 2 glass bottles from the item box. One of them contained a semi-transparent silver liquid, the other a golden liquid.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin. That silver liquid…is that World Tree sap…?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you noticed? As expected of a World Tree priestess. This golden liquid is elixir, these fragments are orichalcum and scarletite minerals. They’re small because they’re leftovers from crafting. I’ll also use a magic steel alloy I created for Healer EX.”</p>
<p>“Wait…you’re going to use materials from a World Tree to heal it? Isn’t that weird?”</p>
<p>Tiera stopped Shin as he was listing the ingredients. She found it bizarre to use materials from the World Tree to cure it.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, they’re necessary. The sap allows the World Tree to more easily absorb the medicine. Normally you would first use medicine without it, heal the tree to a point, then make medicine with it. If possible, I’d like to use the sap from the sick World Tree, so acquire some if you can.”</p>
<p>Shin then gave an empty glass bottle in card form to Tiera. He had some items in stock from past events, so he would use them this time.</p>
<p>Shin mixed gold and silver with skill and dropped the fragments inside. Like ice inside water, the metal fragments melted and the liquid turned a pale green color. The container changed too, transforming into a thin vial about 20 cemel long.</p>
<p>“And it’s done. We just need to plant it in the soil near the tree.”</p>
<p>It looked just like a plant nutrient vial for home use, maybe larger than normal. The liquid would be automatically absorbed by the ground, so there was no need to do anything after setting it.</p>
<p>“Then, the other two…one, two, three…done.”</p>
<p>Without the slightest bit of tension, Shin created the other items. He made some spares and gave them to Tiera too.</p>
<p>“I know I should feel grateful, but you make it all seem so simple…well, as expected of Shin.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Shin lightly poked Tiera for her ungrateful remark, then explained in detail how to use the items. He would be more than happy to be able to avoid the elves’ inspection.</p>
<p>“Okay, duly noted. I doubt they will allow you in the holy area anytime soon, so I’ll test these first.”</p>
<p>“Please do. Honestly, I hope they’ll be enough to close the case.”</p>
<p>That way, there would be no need to go through all the trouble to enter the elves’ holy land. As long as the World Tree problem was solved, there was no need to worry about appearances. Even if the clan head was up to no good showed up, they just needed to give him a good pounding. Any trouble that followed could be left to the next head, Orlean, to handle.</p>
<p>“By the way, do you and Lymliss go purify the World Tree at fixed hours?”</p>
<p>“We do it twice a day now, once in the morning and once at night. It takes energy to purify it, so we can’t do it many times a day. It takes less of a toll on me now…or rather, I’m stronger now, so I can still move after, but there’s Lymliss too, so…”</p>
<p>Tiera added that this pace was very close to Lymliss’ limits.</p>
<p>“Her purification powers aren’t weak at all, the impurity is just too thick. Now that we do it together, the burden on her should be a lot lighter. As I said before, when I arrived I found her in a state that…it would have been lethal for her to continue.”</p>
<p>The ability to purify hailed from a holy power, but it was still used by people. Their energy was not limitless.</p>
<p>One more reason for Tiera’s anger towards the Luderia was that they forced Lymliss to continue purifying the World Tree despite her state.</p>
<p>“I know that only priestesses have the ability to purify, but isn’t there anyone that can provide support? Just using 【Heal】 or 【Cure】 on the priestess would help a lot, I think.”</p>
<p>“There’s no one like that, unfortunately. There are 2 guards, for whatever reason. Priestesses don’t use magic power for purification, but something close to life force. You know, I tried using 【Analyze】 on Lymliss and noticed that the magic power indicators, “MP”, right? They hadn’t decreased much. Well, they were a little less than the max value, but in spite of that she was really spent. I tried it on myself too, and they hadn’t decreased much either.”</p>
<p>Skills like 【Heal】 or 【Cure】 could not restore the energy spent for purification.</p>
<p>“HP is supposed to stand for life force, but I’m not sure what they actually are either. Hmm, purification doesn’t use magic power, huh…we can’t use MP transfer skills in case of emergencies, then.”</p>
<p>“You can do that? But yes, we couldn’t drink ethers while purifying anyway.”</p>
<p>To purify while doing other things -even just drinking a bit of a potion- would be very difficult.</p>
<p>“It’s not in the list, but it’s probably a skill or something. It’s a sacred activity, so if it could be done easily it would take away a lot from it, I guess…”</p>
<p>As skills were based on patterns, Shin thought that the same probably worked for purification too. It wouldn’t be strange if there were conditions for its activation.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I did everything I can at the moment.”</p>
<p>“We have to wait for the Luderia to contact us or until the next purification. We could also move on our own, though…”</p>
<p>“Conceal ourselves and sneak in the Luderia house?”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Schnee’s comment, in a joking tone, with the proposal that had come up several times in conversation already. He considered it again, thinking it could be worth it. They could manage to learn what the Luderia clan head was actually up to.</p>
<p>“Shall we?”</p>
<p>“….no, let’s wait until the next purification. We might be able to sneak in without being spotted, but they are the World Tree caretakers. They might have set up alarms we are not aware of, using the powers of the World Tree. If intruders were detected the same day visitors came from the outside world, we would be suspected right away and Tiera’s standing would get worse. Let’s give it some time.”</p>
<p>The World Tree still had many unknowns even for Shin. It would be harder to move freely if they were distrusted any further, so they decided to wait. That was also the reason why he had not followed Orlean into his residence.</p>
<p>“So, we should gather information for now?”</p>
<p>“Right. Information about the World Tree is restricted, but we might find out something about the Luderia or the Lulac. By the way, while you two were away, elves from the Lulac and Luderia came here. I followed them for a while and found out that—”</p>
<p>The timing was right, so Shin told Schnee and the rest about what he heard from Orlean and Herald.</p>
<p>“That Orlean is the elf that proposed to me, there’s no mistake. But who would think things were like that…well, now that I think about it, to propose the moment he met me, after all these years, was quite bizarre.”</p>
<p>“He wanted you at his side to protect you, I suppose. What Shin heard isn’t enough to explain it, however. Based on how they talked, whoever was following them in secret must have been sent by the clan head.”</p>
<p>Shin had suspected as much. The two elves knew they were followed, so they pretended to fight as they talked. If they were quarrelling, it wouldn’t be strange for them to go in the same direction at the same pace. If Shin hadn’t heard their whispered conversation, he too would have thought that they were too invested in their fight and lost sight of the surroundings.</p>
<p>“It might be worth it to contact them. There’s information I might not be able to find by myself, though…what about Shibaid?”</p>
<p>“As Tiera’s companion, I can manage a mundane conversation with them, but I doubt we could delve deeper.”</p>
<p>Schnee could probably have an easier time talking with them. High elves and elves looked practically the same. For Shin and Shibaid, human and dragnil, it wouldn’t be easy though.</p>
<p>“There’s merit in trying. Insider information about Lanapacea is very important for us right now.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee could investigate them while concealing themselves. Even if Orlean and Herald were always being watched, they wouldn’t be found.</p>
<p>“I can help with information gathering too. Or rather, the people aiming to resurrect the Lucent clan will talk even without me asking…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a really important source? Some of them work for the Luderia, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but only the elders and people of high rank know the really important things. I heard that they’re even more secretive since I returned. The former Lucent retainers are never assigned important tasks, anyway.”</p>
<p>Either they didn’t trust the Lucent retainers or simply trusted no one outside their own clan. The former was more likely, as they suspected they could be spies. They were already leaking information, so their suspicion was legitimate after all.</p>
<p>“Tiera and I will start gathering information, then.”</p>
<p>“In the meantime, we should…hm?”</p>
<p>Shin was thinking of concealing his presence and going into town to eavesdrop…gather information, when a message icon flashed at the edge of his sight.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I received a message. The sender is…Lilishila?”</p>
<p>Shin wondered for a moment who that was, then recalled the elf cleric who helped them in Palmirack, during the Holy Woman rescue. She was the one who told Shin what it meant for an elf to form a party with someone of the opposite gender and another species.</p>
<p>“Is it something urgent?”</p>
<p>“Just one moment… well…”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Shibaid, then scanned the message. The message stated that the elven girl that was found imprisoned in the room of “pig cardinal” Bulk had finally regained consciousness. It also said that she had to return to Lanapacea.</p>
<p>“Could it be that the girl is the missing priestess?”</p>
<p>Pulling the strings behind the cardinal were the demons: the Lanapacea priestess was also said to have been kidnapped by demons.</p>
<p>The elf also said that she had to return to Lanapacea, so she was very likely the kidnapped Lulac priestess.</p>
<p>“That girl…she was born after I was gone, so it’s no wonder I didn’t recognize her.”</p>
<p>“You can’t tell if another elf is a priestess like you?”</p>
<p>“Some can, but not me. She was corrupted by miasma at the time, so I doubt I would have noticed even if I had that talent.”</p>
<p>Being able to tell if others had the same power apparently depended from person to person.</p>
<p>“If that girl is really a priestess, then…I know it sounds strange to say this, but how can she be still alive? While they attacked me with that crazed look in their eyes…”</p>
<p>Tiera was probably recalling the two demons they had battled at the Summit Faction’s hideout, Adara and Scoruas. Shin thought about it too.</p>
<p>It was true that as soon as they perceived Tiera’s powers, they ignored Shin and others to target her. In that case, they would not have kidnapped the priestess, but killed her on the spot.</p>
<p>“It could be that when they kidnapped her they could seal her powers, or she was so weak they could not feel them. I do not know who kidnapped her, but, if it was by demons, any rank would be very dangerous. Even a priestess could not defend against a demon by herself. If she was kept alive, it has to be because they had something planned.”</p>
<p>Even if the priestess was escorted, depending on the demons’ rank, a martial strength on Schnee or Shibaid’s level was needed to put up a fight. Shin agreed that it was pretty much impossible for someone from this world to do that.</p>
<p>“The sooner we bring her back, the better. But if they ask how we brought her back, we can’t answer.”</p>
<p>Lilishila and the elf girl are in Palmirack, one of Rokuten’s guild houses. Even without using Tsuki no Hokora, they could use a teleport crystal to bring her there instantly. Shin had prepared some for situations when Tsuki no Hokora was problematic to use -like now- or when they physically couldn’t materialize it. If they registered the current location, it was easy to go back and forth from one point to another.</p>
<p>If Shin’s group, just arrived in Lanapacea, showed up with the kidnapped priestess out of nowhere, a huge scandal would definitely erupt. If they arrived together they could say they escorted her there, but Shin and Schnee had entered the village by themselves. They would be hard-pressed to answer where the girl had come from.</p>
<p>“The people here know of crystals with teleportation enchantments. We could say that she was weakened and we left her somewhere to recuperate, planning to teleport her later, what do you think? Knowing how important priestesses are, it wouldn’t sound strange to use a precious teleport crystal for one, I think.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded in agreement to Schnee’s proposal. If they were questioned as to why they hadn’t mentioned it in the first place, they could say that they were concerned they wouldn’t be trusted. The fact that Schnee was together with Shin also contributed to the credibility of the story.</p>
<p>“What incredible timing, though…”</p>
<p>Shin recalled what Yuzuha said. Thinking that this event might have been caused by the power inside him made him feel conflicted. The timing was perfect for them. Too perfect.</p>
<p>“Is there something on your mind?”</p>
<p>“Kind of. I’ll tell everyone once this is over, Filma and Sety included.”</p>
<p>Shin said he wanted to prioritize the priestess. With 3 priestesses, the purification of the World Tree might progress as well.</p>
<p>“Understood. I will go gather information then.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go ask about the purification.”</p>
<p>“Okay, see you later.”</p>
<p>Shin left the information gathering to Schnee and Tiera, replied to Lilishila’s message, then teleported to Palmirack with Shibaid and Yuzuha. They arrived in Palmirack’s heart, the control room. They hadn’t told Lilishila they could access it, so they concealed themselves with 【Hiding】 and re-entered from the main entrance.</p>
<p>They found a female elf with pale green hair and brown eyes waiting for them: the sender of the message, Lilishila.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while. You arrived really soon, were you in the vicinity?”</p>
<p>“Yes, something like that. So, about your message…”</p>
<p>“Yes, we should take care of that first. This way, please.”</p>
<p>Lilishila led the group to a sector where personal rooms were lined up, then knocked on the door of one of them. Inside there was a young female elf, wearing apprentice cleric robes.</p>
<p>Green hair cut at shoulder height and slanted, pale green eyes. She gave a rather strong-willed impression. In human years, she would be in her mid teens.</p>
<p>“Ehm, who are these guests?”</p>
<p>“They’re the people who rescued you, as I told you before.”</p>
<p>“I see. You have my gratitude for that.”</p>
<p>The young elf stood up from her chair and bowed her head. After raising it again, she politely and firmly introduced herself.</p>
<p>“My name is Lina Lulac.”</p>
<p>“I am Shin, this is my partner Yuzuha.”</p>
<p>“My name is Shibaid.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group entered the room and introduced themselves in turn.</p>
<p>“Er, is anything the matter?”</p>
<p>Shin inquired about the reason why Lina was staring so intently. Even before saying her name, her eyes had been fixated on him.</p>
<p>“No, just…”</p>
<p>Lina did not give a clear answer and her words trailed off halfway. She glanced at Lilishila a couple times.</p>
<p>“Lilishila, we plan to bring her back to Lanapacea as soon as possible, would that be alright?”</p>
<p>From Lina’s expression and glances, Shin supposed that she could not talk if Lilishila was around, so he moved the situation along.</p>
<p>“Lina’s condition is not bad, I think, but she just regained consciousness. I fear that such a long journey would take its toll on her.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m alright. I am not really sure why, but I feel in a very good form. I would like to request their assistance in bringing me back.”</p>
<p>Lilishila was worried about Lina, but the latter said she was fine and Shin added that they will not push her too much, so she relented. Preparations were done quickly: Lina had no personal belongings, she just had the clothes the church had supplied her.</p>
<p>Shin would provide both food and transportation, so all that was left was for Lina to go.</p>
<p>“Leave the rest to us, then.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much. Please take this too.”</p>
<p>Shin materialized a horse carriage and climbed on the coachman’s seat, when Lilishila gave him a stack of paper.</p>
<p>“This is…?”</p>
<p>“The documents about Sacred Places I mentioned to you previously. We could not gather extensive information, though.”</p>
<p>Lilishila had evidently prepared to give them to Shin right away. He turned the papers into items and placed them in his box.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help. We will depart now, then.”</p>
<p>“Please come with lady Yuki and everyone next time. You will always be welcome.”</p>
<p>Shin’s horse carriage left, under Lilishila’s gaze. Kagerou was not with them, so Yuzuha pulled it.</p>
<p>“Lady Lina, it looks like you wanted to say something. Could we hear it now?”</p>
<p>After putting some distance from Palmirack, Shin talked to Lina. Judging from her behavior when Lilishila was present, Shin thought that she hadn’t revealed the fact that she was a World Tree priestess.</p>
<p>“You are my savior, there is no need for titles or polite speech with me. There is something I wish to know…who are you, exactly?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you up on that, then. I’m sorry to answer a question with another question, but, concretely speaking, what do you want to know?”</p>
<p>Shin was not sure what to answer her, so he asked a question instead.</p>
<p>“I can feel a faint aura of the World Tree from you. Besides, despite being a Human you also have magic power of other species within you. The Dragnil and monster with you are unusual too, but you are exceptionally so. Also…it’s hard to explain, but I feel overwhelming power from you. Are you really a human being?”</p>
<p>Lina was evidently at a loss. Her tone changed more than once as she talked.</p>
<p>“I think I’m a human being. About the aura, maybe it’s because one of my comrades is a World Tree priestess. As for the reason why there’s a mix of magic power within me, that I don’t know. But my priestess companion told me the same thing.”</p>
<p>Shin replied while thinking that the mixture of magic power was because he was a High Human who performed several resurrections in the game era.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it was brave of you to just come with us like that. We helped you, sure, but it doesn’t mean we can be trusted, right?”</p>
<p>“I can’t go back to Lanapacea by myself, and if I told the church my reasons for having to go back urgently, I would be making a risky gamble.”</p>
<p>“A gamble?”</p>
<p>With the church’s assistance, it would be possible to travel back to Lanapacea much more safely and quickly than doing so alone.</p>
<p>“If I wanted to return as quickly as possible, I would need to talk about my circumstances. But speaking about the World Tree is extremely dangerous. It is a very precious source of materials and there are those who wish to obtain its powers. When strength is within their grasp, people will always reach for it. However, if I did nothing, the World Tree might fall into ruin.”</p>
<p>“Thirst for power…I cannot deny that. But more importantly…the World Tree is in such grave danger?”</p>
<p>Shibaid had been silently listening to Lina, but could not help but react to her final words.</p>
<p>“Lina’s words aren’t far from the truth, yeah.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t participate in those events, right Shibaid? It’s no wonder you don’t know. If all World Trees fall into ruin, are cut down, or for any reason disappear, a world-ending catastrophe will happen.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled about the game and recounted his memories without thinking. Only after noticing the silence that followed he realized it.</p>
<p>“Hey? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well, you said all that so naturally, that…”</p>
<p>“I wonder that too. It’s supposed to be a secret revealed only to priestesses.”</p>
<p>Shin then realized his mistake.</p>
<p>The world destruction event that happened in-game had been caused by certain players cutting down all World Trees. In a way, it was a disaster caused by human hand. Players fought together to protect the major cities, but the damage was massive nonetheless. In the game, it was nothing but a secret event, though.</p>
<p>In the game, the “end of the world” only meant that buildings, etc. were damaged and players received penalties for dying, but naturally no one actually died. In this world, however, it wouldn’t go like that.</p>
<p>“I can’t say why I know, at least for now. But it’s true that we wish to bring you back to Lanapacea. One of our companions and Lymliss are currently working hard to purify the World Tree. You are the kidnapped Lulac priestess, right?”</p>
<p>“So you knew.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. We used a bit of a trick to come to pick you up. We will do the same to go back. I’m sure you have a lot of questions, but our goal is to heal the World Tree. If possible, I would like you to cooperate with us once we return to Lanapacea.”</p>
<p>Lina was quiet for some time, then nodded. She had made her decision, apparently.</p>
<p>“Understood. Let me ask one last thing, then. Your World Tree priestess companion, is that Tiera Lucent?”</p>
<p>“…yes, that’s right. The cursed and banished priestess. Let me tell you first that the curse has been dispelled, though. Monsters won’t invade Lanapacea like that.”</p>
<p>“Is…that so. It’s her, after all…”</p>
<p>“Do you know Tiera?”</p>
<p>Shin thought it strange that Lina seemed sure that his companion was Tiera, even if they were both World Tree priestesses.</p>
<p>“The elder told me about her. One of the most powerful priestesses in history, banished from the village because of a curse. That’s not the only reason, though. If you know what kind of abilities World Tree priestesses have, I’m sure you can guess?”</p>
<p>Lina implied that if they really were companions, they should know already.</p>
<p>“The abilities World Tree priestesses have?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My ability is 【Clairvoyance】. I can see any location under the influence of the World Tree’s powers, no matter how far it may be. I can also speak with the deceased, albeit only a little.”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Is it really alright to tell us so much? We’re not from Lanapacea, you know that.”</p>
<p>Shin was surprised to hear Lina talk about her powers in such detail. Shibaid did not say anything, but looked at her with suspicion too.</p>
<p>Despite Shin’s words and Shibaid’s gaze, Lina’s expression became unexpectedly softer.</p>
<p>“Actually, because of this power, I already knew that I could trust you both. Palmirack was apparently built over a Ley line, so I could use my powers a bit.”</p>
<p>Through the ability to communicate with the deceased, Lina learned that Shin and Shibaid could be trusted.</p>
<p>“The souls of the dead…could you tell us who that was?”</p>
<p>“That I don’t know, unfortunately.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know?”</p>
<p>All Lina could tell was that it was an elf connected to the World Tree priestesses’ lineage. Lina’s ability could tell that it was the truth, so she trusted Shin’s group. The soul that told her about Shin, however, never mentioned their name. According to Lina, however, that wasn’t unusual.</p>
<p>“To go all the way to tell you about us…did something happen to the World Tree?”</p>
<p>“Indeed…it could be a situation so dire that the assistance of a far away priestess was needed.”</p>
<p>Shin quietly prayed that the items he gave to Tiera could be effective.</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess it’s time. Yuzuha, change routes.”</p>
<p>As they talked, Shin noticed that there were not many people or carriages around them, so he told Yuzuha to head to the forest. It was an unnatural change of direction, but Lina did not say anything. Even if the World Tree had told her about Shin, he couldn’t help but think that she was being too trusting.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, there’s one more thing I need to confirm, do you mind?”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“About when you were kidnapped. The demons we encountered in the past tried to kill Tiera the instant they realized she was a World Tree priestess. Why did they let you live?”</p>
<p>They knew that Lina had been kidnapped by demons because of the traces left. It was all very unnatural.</p>
<p>“I believe that they meant to use my powers. My 【Clairvoyance】 cannot hurt others, but depending on its usage, it can be a powerful threat. I can’t do it myself, but it is told that in the past one could see the whole world with it. It was possible to see all the secrets people wished to hide.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty different from the 【Clairvoyance】 skill… so the demons found it worth using, and had found a way too.”</p>
<p>Lina said that she willingly absorbed miasma within herself to fall into a kind of coma and prevent them from manipulating her. They kept her alive because they could manipulate her even in that state or she was still worth using in other ways.</p>
<p>“If you go back to Lanapacea, will the demons come for you again?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible. It was so powerful that I couldn’t even resist for an instant.”</p>
<p>“….are you okay?”</p>
<p>Shin noticed that Lina’s arms, crossed in front of her chest, trembled a little. She acted like everything was okay, but she had been kidnapped by monsters and almost died. It was impossible for her not to be afraid.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, you are cooperating with lady Tiera, but not with the Luderia clan, is that right?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Yes, that’s right. I haven’t met him yet, but we’ve heard rumors that the Luderia clan head is up to no good. I’m thinking of finding out the truth about that too.”</p>
<p>“…in that case…after we return to Lanapacea, could I stay with you for a while?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at Shibaid. If the missing Lulac priestess returned, all of Lanapacea would surely know of it instantly. Even if the Luderia head was plotting something, the Lulac had enough clout for him to put his plans into action easily.</p>
<p>The risk of Lina being attacked by demons was still present, however. Shin concluded that Lina had come up with that proposal after considering what she should do.</p>
<p>“There’s no guarantee that staying with us is safe, though.”</p>
<p>Shin stopped the carriage, turned it into a card and answered Lina. The card slipped into his shirt’s pocket…actually, the item box.</p>
<p>“They say my detection abilities are the highest in the history of priestesses. I can tell that you all- sir Shin, sir Shibaid, lady Yuzuha- are more powerful than the demon who attacked me. This is why I wish to ask for your assistance, until the clan head is captured.”</p>
<p>Lina then prostrated herself. Shin was surprised by her disregard for her hands and clothes turning dirty because of the soil and mud.</p>
<p>“What’s with you, all of a sudden!?”</p>
<p>“I…have seen it. I have seen the head of the Luderia clan…dealing with demons. The reason why I was attacked was probably that I saw that scene through my 【Clairvoyance】. I want to do something about the World Tree…but I’m scared…”</p>
<p>Lina talked with a very feeble voice. The feelings she had been holding back gushed out. Her slender shoulders trembled.</p>
<p>“….I see, that was also meant to keep you quiet.”</p>
<p>Proof of the clan head’s wrongdoings came up from an unexpected source. From Lanapacea, located right at the foot of the World Tree, even the clan head’s private rooms were visible to 【Clairvoyance】.</p>
<p>If Lina spoke the truth, they couldn’t let the clan head run free. There was even the possibility that Tiera was being attacked right now.</p>
<p>“You can rest easy. We aren’t going to leave you to fend for yourself, not at this point.”</p>
<p>Shin laid a hand on Lina’s shaking shoulders and raised her head. She had to be really terrified: her eyes were gleaming with tears.</p>
<p>“Will you…help me?”</p>
<p>Lina’s tears did not suggest she was acting at all. Her eyes still showed the struggle between her will to accomplish her mission and the terror she felt.</p>
<p>“Leave it to us. Even if a duke demon pops up, we’re bringing them down.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Shin, Shibaid and Yuzuha all nodded confidently.</p>
<p>For the sake of the world? To erase impurity?</p>
<p>It was a mystery that, rather than such lofty ideals, fighting to help their comrade, who strove to fulfill her duty despite being banished, and to wipe the tears of a terrified girl made them much more motivated.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 2 Part 4</p>
<p>“Okay, now that the terms of our alliance have been set, let’s teleport.”</p>
<p>Shin waited for Lina to stop crying, then made preparations for the teleportation. She seemed a bit embarrassed to have lost control, so her face was still red.</p>
<p>“Teleport?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a secret technique that allows you to go to a faraway place instantly. It’s attached to this crystal. With this, we can go to Lanapacea in a second. We’d stand out if we used it in an open space, so we waited till we reached a more secluded place, like here.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why we went to a forest. I was wondering what was going on….er, sir.”</p>
<p>Lina awkwardly turned up the politeness of her tone. She seemed to have suddenly noticed that she was speaking casually.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, I was a bit out of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right. I’m just a no-name adventurer, so feel free to speak as you like. You only need to worry about that when there are other people around.”</p>
<p>Shin made up the fact that it would be bad if a World Tree priestess addressed him too politely and told Lina to adopt a more casual tone. They would be fighting together to heal the World Tree and bring down the Luderia clan head, so he honestly didn’t want her to treat him with such restraint.</p>
<p>Shin also personally disliked being treated with respect and admiration because of his strength.</p>
<p>“Ok, so, er, thanks.”</p>
<p>Lina awkwardly lowered her head to Shin, who nodded.</p>
<p>“Ok, ready to go.”</p>
<p>Shin infused the crystal with magic power. The attached spell properly activated and the next instant Shin’s group was in the Lanapacea residence.</p>
<p>“Wow, we really are in Lanapacea…”</p>
<p>Lina seemed to know about the residence: she looked around the room and realized they were back in Lanapacea. From how she looked around, however, she seemed a bit confused all the same.</p>
<p>“Oh, they’re back.”</p>
<p>Schnee and Tiera were in the residence too: they probably detected their return. The door opened and they entered the room.</p>
<p>“You’re back. A bit too quick, no?”</p>
<p>“It’s almost time for the next purification. I haven’t got much information, but I wanted to tell master at least.”</p>
<p>Tiera managed to acquire new information, albeit only a little.</p>
<p>“So this is the girl Lilishila wrote about. I am Tiera Lucent. How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“M-my name is Lina Lulac. I’m honestly surprised, but I feel really good!”</p>
<p>Tiera knew what Lina had gone through, so she talked to her with a warm smile. Lina had noticed Tiera even before the latter introduced herself, so she replied with a rather excited tone.</p>
<p>“Is the miasma not affecting her anymore?”</p>
<p>“It surely doesn’t look like that. She probably recovered because we made her drink an elixir. She also said that the World Tree used its powers for her.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Schnee’s whispered question with what he heard from Lina.</p>
<p>“Past priestesses told her about you…? Well, I suppose a priestess could do something like that…I wonder who she was, though.”</p>
<p>“A priestess?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s not too rare for priestesses to be able to speak with the dead. The current situation is pretty unique, though. I can’t help but think that there must be a reason why she was chosen.”</p>
<p>“…that’s right. If a random priestess had been chosen, like in a game, it wouldn’t sit right at all.”</p>
<p>Shin and the others didn’t know who the elf that Lina saw was, though. Lina had told them about the elf’s facial features, but as expected she was very beautiful, which did not help to narrow down the options. She had silver hair and green eyes, a combination that was not unusual among elves.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t help that she doesn’t seem to have unique features…since she contacted Lina from her side, it’s difficult to call her from this side too.”</p>
<p>“I can’t pinpoint exactly which spirit to channel either, it just can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Tiera said that even if she could speak with the dead, she couldn’t do it with just anyone unconditionally.</p>
<p>“If a disaster is approaching, someone with the ability to counter it appears; to communicate with the remaining family, someone from the same family is necessary. Calling the perfect person to do such things isn’t something I can do, but I heard that past priestesses had this ability.”</p>
<p>As far as Tiera knew, only one of the World Tree priestesses ever had such an ability. She was a very powerful priestess, like Tiera.</p>
<p>“I see…well, if it’s not possible, then that’s that. If she ever comes in contact again, please ask for her name. We can’t do anything special even if we know, but it’s always better than not knowing.”</p>
<p>“Okay, got it.”</p>
<p>Lina nodded to Shin. Like before, she was unusually close to him.</p>
<p>“….by the way, Shin. Lina’s back safe and sound, so shouldn’t we bring her to the Lulac? Their authority and clout would be restored if she returned to them.”</p>
<p>Schnee noticed Lina’s attitude, her eyes narrowed and she voiced this doubt. She added that Lina would be given proper items to defend her from demons, of course.</p>
<p>“About that, well, before we came here I promised that she could stay with us.”</p>
<p>If the Luderia clan head, who was connected with the demons, knew that Lina was back, she would surely be attacked again.</p>
<p>A demon that made deals with people was definitely high-ranked. In that case, the Lulac clan’s fighting power was likely insufficient.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m afraid things might get a bit complicated.”</p>
<p>“A bit? They’re going to get *very* complicated.”</p>
<p>“You’re right…”</p>
<p>Shin had promised, partly, on the spur of the moment. Even if Lina was equipped with anti-demon items, as Schnee suggested, it wouldn’t mean anything if others were attacked in her place.</p>
<p>In the orphanage, Millie had been given such items, but the demons took hostages, forcing her to remove the items herself. Lina had friends and family in Lanapacea: Shin’s party couldn’t protect them all. The items they provided could also potentially be handed to others or used in other ways.</p>
<p>“I guess it can’t be helped, then. Fortunately, among the Lulac there are those who lament the current situation. If we contact them and explain the circumstances, further interference from the Lulac clan should be reduced.”</p>
<p>“The same goes for the Luderia. If we talk to Orlean, their movements should change a bit. Considering what Shin heard, they will probably get in contact with me when I head for the next purification.”</p>
<p>Shin’s party would not mention the clan head’s connection with the demons yet. If Orlean and Herald came to know, they -along with their allies- might resort to violent means.</p>
<p>“I’ll go to the holy area now. What should we do with Lina?”</p>
<p>“Purifying the World Tree is our top priority, but I’m thinking of trying the items first and bringing Lina next time too. They won’t just let her in anyway, we would just start a ruckus.”</p>
<p>The return of the kidnapped priestess would definitely be huge news for the village. If she showed her purification powers no one would doubt she was the real Lina, but the Luderia clan head was on the side of the perpetrators. In the worst case scenario, Shin’s party could be accused of the kidnapping.</p>
<p>“Herald is my older brother. If I talk to him, I’m sure he will understand.”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned what he heard from Herald and Orlean; Lina was slightly surprised, then said this.</p>
<p>“I guess we might go talk to them while Tiera goes to the purification. We need to sneak into their residence, but are there any traps we should watch out for?”</p>
<p>Lina didn’t know the extent of Shin’s stealth abilities, which could make it hard for her to reply, so he erased his presence and turned invisible to show her an example. Lina’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“I think that they probably reinforced the security since I was kidnapped. I do not think that they would ever find you as you are now, sir Shin.”</p>
<p>“I guess we need to go actually go there to find out. Why the ‘sir’, though? You don’t need to address me with titles.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do.”</p>
<p>Lina’s tone had become a bit more casual, thanks to Shin’s attitude and atmosphere, but she clearly stated she couldn’t address him without a title. Apparently, it was something she wouldn’t budge on.</p>
<p>She addressed not only Shin, but all party members in such a way. Shin had no strong preferences about that, so he let her do as she wanted.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s move then. I’ll go to the Lulac with Lina.”</p>
<p>“I will accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Schnee and Yuzuha said that they would follow Shin.</p>
<p>“It would be suspicious if we all disappeared except Tiera. I shall remain here.”</p>
<p>“I will go the purification, as scheduled.”</p>
<p>After deciding what they would do, Tiera left for the World Tree and Shin’s group for the Lulac residence. Since Lina was with them, they wouldn’t risk getting lost.</p>
<p>Shin concealed their presence with skills and proceeded via the village’s rooftops. Lina couldn’t jump like them, so Yuzuha let her ride on her back. Proceeding without care for the streets, they could reach the residence in little to no time.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like we’ll find any nasty traps. Can you feel anything, Schnee?”</p>
<p>“No, I do not detect any dangerous traps either. I believe we’ll be fine as long as we are wary of people’s eyes.”</p>
<p>If the kunoichi Schnee said she didn’t feel anything, they concluded there weren’t any traps to worry about and jumped on the residence’s roof. If they found a trap they couldn’t detect, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Right before entering the residence, Shin felt something pass through his body. He thought he might have triggered an alarm, told Schnee and the others not to move and carefully scrutinized the surroundings, but no one inside the residence seemed to react.</p>
<p>“Was there a trap?”</p>
<p>“No, but I felt something pass through my body…”</p>
<p>Lina said that she had no recollection of such traps. Thinking it might have been his imagination, Shin kept his guard up as they descended into the residence’s garden.</p>
<p>Guided by Lina, the group headed to Herald’s private quarters, where they detected someone was present. 【Through Sight】 revealed that Herald was reading something in the room. He hadn’t gone to see Tiera, evidently.</p>
<p>They planned to leave a message if he wasn’t there, but it was much more convenient for him to be present. Shin’s group entered without a sound, closing the door behind them. Herald did not notice and continued looking at the letter he was holding.</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>“!? Who’s there!?”</p>
<p>Surprised by the sudden voice, Herald assumed a fighting pose and turned around. His pose showed that he was likely versed in martial arts.</p>
<p>“Wait! It’s me, Lina!”</p>
<p>Shin deactivated the skill and they became visible. Herald recognized her and his eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“…what exactly is going on here?”</p>
<p>“You know that I was kidnapped by demons, right? These people saved me. But since Lanapacea is in an abnormal situation now, we decided to let you know that I was safe first.”</p>
<p>“Are you really Lina? No, if lady Schnee is with you, I’m sure you are, but…”</p>
<p>Herald was confused, but as he talked with Lina he gradually recovered his cool. He couldn’t believe his eyes yet, to good reason: after all, his missing sister, who he didn’t know whether was alive or dead, had suddenly appeared before him.</p>
<p>“Look, this should be proof enough.”</p>
<p>Lina held her hands as in prayer and concentrated. Her body then started glowing in a faint light.</p>
<p>“The light of purification…you really are…Lina.”</p>
<p>Herald staggered towards her, as if attracted by the light. When the light of purification, proof of Lina’s identity, faded away, he hugged her tightly.</p>
<p>“Hey, b-brother!?”</p>
<p>“….I’m so glad. You’re alive…!”</p>
<p>Herald, still hugging the squirming Lina, barely managed to put his feelings into words. He was clearly overjoyed that Lina was still alive. Tears were streaming down his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Can we talk now?”</p>
<p>“I apologize for making you wait. You have my most heartfelt gratitude for saving Lina. I will never forget this debt as long as I live.”</p>
<p>Herald bowed deeply and expressed his gratitude. His frank tone when talking to Lina was subdued, his speech extremely polite.</p>
<p>“So, what do you wish from me?”</p>
<p>Herald raised his head and his expression turned serious. They happened to save Lina, who happened to be a World Tree priestess, so they brought her here…he knew things couldn’t be that simple.</p>
<p>Shin explained why Lina had been kidnapped and that she wished to stay together with them for a while.</p>
<p>“Considering such circumstances, I cannot possibly oppose you. I know of Lady Schnee’s martial prowess: if she says so, sir Shin must be equally strong or even more. You are both far superior to me, but I can tell that you are strong. Our Lulac clan has warriors with special powers like Returned Ancestors, but I do not know how they would fare against demons. I am sure my sister would be more than sufficiently safe with you.”</p>
<p>Though there were Chosen Ones in Lanapacea, most were chiefs of the warrior corps in charge of protecting the village.</p>
<p>Herald then told Shin’s party what he knew of the current situation. Since he had saved Lina and Schnee was his ally, Herald found him worthy of trust.</p>
<p>Herald’s information included the fact that recent cases of missing persons happened frequently and some warrior chiefs’ personalities suddenly changed drastically. Thanks to his relatively high rank in the country, he had gathered a fair amount of confidential intel.</p>
<p>Shin was especially concerned by the information stating that lately, the clan head had not shown himself to anyone. Whenever he spoke with someone, he did so through a curtain, so in the last few months, only a select handful of people had actually seen him.</p>
<p>“How was it during the audience, Schnee?”</p>
<p>“It was just like Herald said. The curtain was attached with an enchantment that neutralized all visual skills like 【Analyze】. That by itself is not too unusual, so I did not mention it.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that some still existing game settings were probably involved. In the game, it was possible to block magic eye-type skills.</p>
<p>Schnee had connections to Tiera, but she was still an outsider. Even if she was a well-known personage, they would still be wary around her. Among Magic Eye-type skills, there were some that could charm and manipulate the target.</p>
<p>In the game, Lords were often connected to such visual barrier items. One of the Lords’ characteristics was having Magic Eye skills: in order not to be suspected of abusing such skills for evil deeds, they produced items that could neutralize them. This was true for NPCs in the game era, however, Shin did not know if it applied to this world as well.</p>
<p>Schnee said that royals and nobles other than Lords often conducted audiences in that way. Other than Lords, Elves and some Beasts did, at the very least.</p>
<p>“Judging from the information we have, there might be a reason why he doesn’t want to be seen.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled the woman who had turned into an Invader he had fought in the church. The real clan head could be already dead.</p>
<p>“That’s possible. If it’s a fake, it wouldn’t be strange that it stayed hidden to prevent being found out. It would also explain his strange behavior.”</p>
<p>“This is just a theory, though. He might be under someone’s control, or…as much as I hate saying it, the probability that he’s cooperating with them of his own volition is not zero.”</p>
<p>Shin hoped for this last probability to be a clear zero.</p>
<p>“We need to investigate more to be sure. Fortunately, the son of the Luderia clan head is not pleased with the current situation either. He will let me know if he finds out anything, so I will let you know as soon as I can. Can I talk to Orlean, the son of the head chief, about you, sir Shin?”</p>
<p>“Lina plans to participate in the next purification, so I would like you to keep it a secret until then. I don’t mean to suspect you, but Orlean might be under surveillance. I want to avoid any risk that the clan head discovers us.”</p>
<p>Shin said that it was a possibility, but Orlean being under surveillance was a fact. This would probably happen to Shin’s group too, but as far as their detection field extended, it hadn’t occurred yet. They teleported back inside the residence and always concealed their presence when they were outside.</p>
<p>Not even the elves working in the residence had seen them, so very few knew of Lina’s return to Lanapacea. There was a chance the clan head learned about their plans or other parties interfered, so they wanted to keep it a secret until right before the purification. If they were attacked they could just beat the assailants back, but if they used their authority it wouldn’t be so simple.</p>
<p>“Understood. I will keep this meeting a secret, then.”</p>
<p>It would be risky to talk for too long. They completed their objective of informing Herald of Lina’s safety, so they decided to go back to the residence. Before they did, Shin took out an item card from the box.</p>
<p>It was a simple necklace with glowing clear magic stones about 1 cemel in size. Shin gave it to Lina.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“It’s an accessory enchanted with 【Hiding】 and various defensive skills. Even if you are separated from us, with this you can hide your presence and buy enough time to flee. If you take it off the effects will disappear. I’ll make sure at least one of us will always be with you, so I think everything will be alright, but take it just in case.”</p>
<p>“From the description, it looks like a national treasure…but okay…it’s for my safety…for my safety.”</p>
<p>When Shin lent it to Millie, he realized that the necklace had a weakness: if the wearer removed it, its effects were lost. Shin had rearranged it to be active only when the registered person wore it, but in the end, it just served as insurance.</p>
<p>Lina whispered to reassure herself and equipped the necklace. Her detection abilities probably told her that the item she was so casually given could be astoundingly precious in that world.</p>
<p>“Hm? Someone’s coming.”</p>
<p>Shin detected a presence and, from the map, noticed that it was heading straight for their room. No one had approached that room before, so he concealed them just in case.</p>
<p>“Lord Herald!! Lord Herald!!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Herald opened the door and talked with a panicking female elf. Apparently, the path leading to the World Tree had turned into a dungeon: they couldn’t contact Tiera, Lymliss and the warriors that were escorting them anymore.</p>
<p>“What the…what happened to the warriors protecting the holy area?”</p>
<p>“They apparently suffered heavy casualties while fighting monsters when the dungeon appeared. The Luderia clan has contacted all clans, to gather warriors in order to clear the dungeon. The elders have already started doing so, but…”</p>
<p>The monsters in the dungeon were all over level 300, apparently. With enough numbers, it wasn’t impossible to defeat them since, among the warriors, there were some who could even defeat such monsters on their own. However, there were simply too many monsters. There seemed to be even more powerful units too.</p>
<p>Not much time had passed since the dungeon appeared, so information was still scarce, but the surroundings of the holy area had been shut due to the emergency.</p>
<p>“We must go as well. Ready the equipment.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Herald gave orders to the female elf, who quickly left.</p>
<p>“The clan head made his move? Or maybe the demons he’s connected with…”</p>
<p>“Or the World Tree is reaching its limits.”</p>
<p>Shin hypothesized while taking out a message card, then Schnee added a possibility. In game terms, her theory was more probable.</p>
<p>Shin tried extending his detection field and caught Tiera, Kagerou and Lymliss’ presences. However, they were so faint and unstable that they were flashing on the map.</p>
<p>“I can’t read their presences well, since they’re inside the dungeon-turned holy area. If I can detect their presence, however, they should still be safe. Kagerou also with them after all, and Tiera, as she is now, won’t go down easily. If a duke demon comes up, they’ll be in trouble, though…they’re definitely being targeted, so we’re going to blow through the dungeon without holding back this time.”</p>
<p>Tiera and Kagerou could hold their own, but Lymliss’ fighting ability was low. She could easily become a weak point if attacked. If a high-ranking demon appeared, they would definitely target her. There was no guarantee that there was only one demon attacking either.</p>
<p>There was no time to wait for the elves’ rescue operation. Shin decided to go help Tiera’s group, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>“S-sir Shin!? I understand that lady Schnee is with you, but won’t it be dangerous!?”</p>
<p>Herald was surprised to hear what Shin said to Schnee. He didn’t know how strong Shin was, so he probably thought that Shin was saying something absurd.</p>
<p>“I might not look the part, but I have defeated duke demons in the past. I have Schnee Raizar’s seal of approval too, so please believe me. We need speed above everything now, so I’ll have Shibaid watch over Lina. Please wait here for a while.”</p>
<p>Shibaid excelled in muscle power and defense, so his speed was inferior to Shin and Schnee. He regretted having to do give him this role, but contacted Shibaid to ask him to guard Lina.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, please stay here until Shibaid arrives. Once he’s here, I’ll call you with 【Summon Partner】.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Probably happy to be relied on, Yuzuha deftly stood on her hind legs and saluted Shin, then jumped down at Lina’s feet.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha looks like a small fox, but if she goes all out she can turn this whole country into a wasteland. Please rest easy.”</p>
<p>“Er…yes..?”</p>
<p>Herald was convinced of her power, so -albeit a bit lost- he nodded.</p>
<p>“Once Shibaid arrives, please stay with him in the residence.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Please take care.”</p>
<p>“Sure, we’ll be back with Tiera and the others.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 3 Part 1</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee left the room immediately and made use of their explosive strength to leapt to their destination. They used roofs and walls as footholds, but if they kicked at full power they would surely be destroyed.</p>
<p>It would be troublesome if they caused needless destruction, so they used 【Flying Shadow】 to create footholds in midair, using roofs and walls only when the skill’s usage limit did not allow them to create any more footholds. The plan was to reach the holy area using 【Flying Shadow】 as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>As they were moving, Shin felt an indescribable feeling when using the skill. In this world, when he used a skill he could understand how it worked through his senses. In case of sword skills, how the sword had to be swung; in case of magic, what effect and power it would have. In Shin’s case, he could also check the skill details via the menu.</p>
<p>Shin was now having a bizarre feeling about the Movement-type skill he was using, 【Flying Shadow】. The skill in question allowed the user to create up to 2 platforms in midair to use as a foothold, but he couldn’t help but feel that it was possible to create more.</p>
<p>“Could it be…?”</p>
<p>Shin felt a sort of irritation towards the two foothold limit: not expecting anything to really happen, he tried activating the skill. He jumped off a roof and used it once, then one more time in mid-air.</p>
<p>Then, when he would usually use a wall or roof again to reset the counter, he tried making a third foothold. Normally, nothing would happen and he would end up kicking empty air. What Shin’s feet felt, however, was the same hard surface that appeared when the skill was properly activated.</p>
<p>Guided by his senses, Shin activated the skill a fourth, fifth, sixth time, continuing to leap through the air.</p>
<p>“Shin!?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s surprised reaction reached his ears. She needed to use actual surfaces to proceed, so, by blitzing through the air, Shin achieved a pace much higher than hers.</p>
<p>Shin landed on a roof and waited for her, then – without a word- picked up the perplexed Schnee up in his arms in the so-called “princess carry”.</p>
<p>“Ehm, Shin? What are you…”</p>
<p>“Looks like I can use 【Flying Shadow】 without limits now. I don’t know why it happened, but I’ll make the most of it.”</p>
<p>It was so sudden that it was normal to be confused, but Shin somehow felt that it was a good thing.</p>
<p>“I’m going to jump at full power. Hold on tight!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Schnee wrapped her arms around Shin’s neck, while he also strengthened his hold. Then their preparations were complete.</p>
<p>Shin lightly kicked the roof to jump up, then put more power in his legs. An invisible platform formed under his feet. This platform, strong enough to withstand his kicking power, catapulted them in the air. Now that he didn’t have to worry about damaging any property, Shin could take the shortest route to the holy area turned dungeon.</p>
<p>“(Tiera sent a reply. Can you read it, Schnee?)”</p>
<p>The wind pressure would make it difficult to speak, so Shin talked via Mind Chat. He held her even tighter, to avoid any chances of her falling. Schnee unwrapped her arms and quickly caught the message card materialized from Shin’s item box, then opened it.</p>
<p>“(Tiera is safe. Apparently, the World Tree and its surroundings didn’t turn into a dungeon.)”</p>
<p>Schnee scanned the message and reported on the situation surrounding Tiera’s group. The World Tree and its surroundings, in a 200 mel radius, were unchanged. Outside of that, a bizarre haze of colors covered everything, making it impossible to move.</p>
<p>Despite looking like mist, it was hard enough that Tiera’s arrows couldn’t even chip it.</p>
<p>The mist also covered the air around the World Tree, so it was impossible to see the sky. The path leading to the World Tree had turned into a dungeon, so there was a cave-like entrance.</p>
<p>The message also mentioned that Tiera felt that it looked like a living creature.</p>
<p>“(I thought it would be an instant dungeon, but maybe it’s using the impurity?)”</p>
<p>“(It could be, but there’s also the possibility that a demon turned its body into a dungeon.)”</p>
<p>“(A demon dungeon…yeah, it’s possible.)”</p>
<p>Instant dungeon appeared randomly in various fields. “Demon Dungeon” was a sort of variation of such dungeons.</p>
<p>The dungeon boss would be, needless to say, a demon. The biggest difference with instant dungeons was that it was impossible to escape. In ordinary dungeons, using the highest grade crystal allowed the user to exit, but it would not work in demon dungeons. There were only two ways to leave: clear it or die.</p>
<p>“(It seems that Tiera is not under attack at the moment.)”</p>
<p>“(Even if it’s corrupted by impurity, it’s still the World Tree’s zone after all. It might not have enough power to appear as a boss. If there are multiple demons, however, it’s just a matter of time until she is attacked.)”</p>
<p>The current world did not completely abide by the game’s rules. Phenomena impossible in the game era could happen anytime. Shin nodded to Schnee and kicked the air with even more strength. Advancing as if flying through the air, it took them less than 10 minutes to reach the holy area, now transformed into a dungeon.</p>
<p>Shin landed on a nearby roof and observed the situation. As Tiera had written in her message, the mist had taken the shape of a dungeon. The mist extended from the ground until high in the sky, so it was not possible to leap over it and reach the World Tree.</p>
<p>Shin considered circling around it, but the area around the World Tree was completely white, save for the presence of Tiera’s group. The map showing the town around the World Tree had been erased. Apparently, the entrance was the only way inside.</p>
<p>The entrance was about 10 mel tall and 20 mel wide. Armed elves were standing in a fan-like formation in front of it, fighting against a monster that had just emerged from the dungeon.</p>
<p>The monster in question was a rhino-like monster with green rocks sprouting from its body, a level 344 Radseya.</p>
<p>It could not perform long-distance attacks and moved rather slowly, but its exceptional defense made it very hard to damage. In terms of defense only, it was in the same league as level 400+ monsters.</p>
<p>The elves’ arrow and magic attacks had little to no effect. On the other hand, the attacking elves were growing more and more apprehensive.</p>
<p>“This is bad…the charge is almost maxed out.”</p>
<p>Many players thought that a Radseya was to be defeated with long-range attacks while kiting. However, it wouldn’t be called a monster, if it was eliminated so easily.</p>
<p>The “charge” Shin mentioned increased as Radseya was attacked: when it maxed out the monster’s movement speed increased exponentially and it used its defensive power to trample its enemies. Many players got too excited attacking it, only to end up squashed by the monster’s charge.</p>
<p>Apparently there were already casualties; there were monster corpses and other puddles of blood at the dungeon’s entrance, as well as limbs scattered here and there.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to waste talking, we’re going in.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Shin kicked the roof to jump in mid-air, then accelerated via 【Flying Shadow】. That very instant, Radseya’s whole body glowed bright green.</p>
<p>“I-it’s coming!!”</p>
<p>One of the elves shouted after seeing the shining Radseya. One second later, the monster’s massive 3 mel body launched into an explosive acceleration. Most of the elves couldn’t react in time to the sudden change. Just a few of the elves on Radseya’s path managed to crouch and prepared to defend themselves with their shields.</p>
<p>Elves as a species had low physical resistance and VIT. As long as they weren’t high-level Chosen Ones specialized in defense, no shield would prevent them from being crushed to pieces. The elves’ desperate expressions clearly showed that they did not expect to survive the monster’s offensive.</p>
<p>Radseya charged towards the dumbfounded elves. Moments before it could trample the shield elves, Shin’s kick firmly landed on the monster’s cranium.</p>
<p>“Off you go!”</p>
<p>With a snap-like sound, Radseya flew even faster than before-but in the opposite direction, straight into the dungeon. One second later, the dull sound of raw meat crashing into a hard surface echoed.</p>
<p>“…wha?”</p>
<p>The shield elves let out a hapless grunt, unable to comprehend what happened. Their eyes were directed at Shin, but it wasn’t clear if they had really grasped who had just kicked Radseya back where it came from.</p>
<p>“Hey, did any other monsters come out of the dungeon?”</p>
<p>“Eh? N-No…that was the last one.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. We’re going to rescue the priestesses. We will defeat as many monsters as possible, but some might get out of the dungeon. Those are all yours.”</p>
<p>“What are you s- L-Lady Schnee!?”</p>
<p>The elf noticed that Schnee was standing next to Shin: his surprised shout shook all the other elves back into their senses and they stared fixedly at them.</p>
<p>“The dungeon is likely filled with monsters such as that one. We’re going to find the priestesses, so I would ask you to stand guard and prevent any monsters to leave the dungeon.”</p>
<p>“If Lady Schnee goes, there is nothing to worry about, but that human…”</p>
<p>Because of the difference in species, Shin couldn’t be trusted as Schnee was, apparently.</p>
<p>“He’s my companion. If he can keep up with me, you understand that he is strong enough, do you not?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>After Schnee’s words, the elf who objected swallowed his breath. He apparently finally realized what Shin had just done. A level of strength high enough to stop Radseya’s charge with a single kick.</p>
<p>“I leave the rest to you, then.”</p>
<p>“P-Please take care.”</p>
<p>They were allowing someone from another species into their holy area -even if it currently was a dungeon- but no elf said anything. As they fought against the monsters from the dungeon, they gradually understood that it definitely was not the case to talk about permissions or foreign species. The elves thus simply watched Shin and Schnee enter the dungeon.</p>
<p>Looking at the floor and walls, they noticed that the dungeon was made out of mist, as Tiera had written. It felt more akin to metal than a stone to the touch.</p>
<p>Shin told Schnee to wait a moment and activated 【Magic Sonar】. He wanted to reach Tiera as soon as possible, so filling in the map little by little was out of the question.</p>
<p>The goal was clear and the dungeon was above ground, unlike the ones they cleared until now, they could use more forceful methods.</p>
<p>Shin’s map displayed the dungeon’s maze-like structure. It was very complex: even seen from above, it was difficult to find the path that would lead to the exit. The World Tree was also farther than the actual distance, as if space was warped inside the dungeon.</p>
<p>Normally it would be just 500 mel from their location to the World Tree, but it was over 5 kemel inside the dungeon. Walking inside the dungeon’s tortuous paths would make it even longer.</p>
<p>“How did it get this big?”</p>
<p>“Surely they want to buy time. All other routes are unusable, after all.”</p>
<p>“What a troublesome bunch…”</p>
<p>Shin muttered his irritation as he glared at the depths of the dungeon. He checked for Tiera’s presence one more time and detected hostile presences right next to her. The presence moving around and in front of Tiera and the others was probably Kagerou.</p>
<p>“Enemies appeared. I guess they wouldn’t just sit and wait…let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>Kagerou was not an average Gruefago. No demon could easily defeat a mutated Divine Beast, and a very powerful one at that, paired with Tiera.</p>
<p>After a while, Shin and Schnee found the Radseya he had kicked inside. Its head was crushed, its body squashed as if pressed from both ends.</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Shin stopped in front of Radseya’s body and Schnee called out to him. He gestured her to wait a moment, moved Radseya’s body and looked at the wall behind.</p>
<p>As he expected, the wall was dented. In the game, dungeon floor, walls, and roof were indestructible, barring a few exceptions.</p>
<p>In this world, Shin had yet to see something that could not be destroyed. Everything had a set resilience and durability. In that case, hitting it with superior strength should make it possible to destroy it.</p>
<p>“We’re taking the shortest path to the goal.”</p>
<p>Shin then punched the wall. He didn’t use skills, but his fists alone were powerful enough to smash orichalcum into pieces. What he felt on his fist was the sensation of having punched a cotton-like substance. The wall felt metallic to the touch, but against Shin’s punches it had the same resistance as paper. With a poof-like sound, a large hole opened up in the wall.</p>
<p>“I see, a shortcut.”</p>
<p>“It’s more brittle than I thought. We’re above ground this time, so even if we go on a bit of a rampage, there’s no danger it will come down on us. It’s faster if we go straight ahead.”</p>
<p>As he talked, red and yellow globes of light formed around Shin. The 8 globes circling around him glowed in a white-hot light when he pointed forward. Each globe, measuring about 20 cemel, let out a thick laser-like beam of white-hot light. The floor, walls and roof of the dungeon melted away before the beams.</p>
<p>Boosted by Shin’s magic power, the beams pierced through wall after wall.</p>
<p>Light and flame combination skill 【Flare Blaster】.</p>
<p>Normally, this skill would create one globe of light and one beam, resulting in a red hot beam with piercing powers, but the current Shin could simultaneously cast multiple instances of the same skill.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee advanced through the melted walls. There were monsters inside the dungeon, but they ignored them all.</p>
<p>Demon Dungeons were a category of instant dungeons: if the boss was defeated, the dungeon would disappear along with the monsters inside. Fighting them was just a waste of time.</p>
<p>“It’s recovering. Guess I should have expected it.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee advanced through the gaps in the walls, directly heading towards the World Tree. They could just continue, but the Demon Dungeon wouldn’t just let them. Shin saw on the map that the melted walls were gradually repairing themselves. Not just as they were, but stronger than before.</p>
<p>“Shin, will you destroy the walls again? I will try to cover the hole with ice, to delay the recovery.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Schnee and launched another array of 【Flare Blaster】. The burning beams shot straight forward, piercing the walls as if they were nothing. Schnee then activated a skill herself.</p>
<p>Water-type magic skill 【Clear Blizzard】.</p>
<p>Crystal-like light spirals followed the paths traced by 【Flare Blaster】 beams. The burning walls and ceiling were frozen instantly.</p>
<p>Shin monitored the gaps as they ran over the ice, but there was no sign they were recovering. The freezing was acting perfectly as an obstacle for the recovery.</p>
<p>Nothing else could delay their progress now: Shin and Schnee ran at full speed towards their destination. In the end, it took them just 5 minutes to approach the exit. They didn’t pierce their way out simply because the beams might have hurt Tiera’s group. Shin busted open the last remaining wall and they arrived before the World Tree.</p>
<p>“Shin! Master!”</p>
<p>Tiera noticed Shin and Schnee as they smashed their way out of the dungeon and reacted with joy. Before Tiera and Lymliss, Kagerou was facing a monster of similar size.</p>
<p>The monster, growling while baring its fangs, was named Oggbrym.</p>
<p>It was a beast-type monster with four limbs and tiger-like yellow fur with black patches. It had a wolf and a boar’s heads and a reptile-like scaled tail.</p>
<p>Its level was 712: if Kagerou was not a mutated specimen, it would have had a hard time fighting while also protecting Tiera and the others. Kagerou’s body had injuries here and there.</p>

<p>Tiera was assisting Kagerou with her recovery skills, but the demon was mostly unscathed. Demon Dungeons provided boosts to the stats and abilities of demons. Even if its level was higher, Kagerou had to fight while defending Tiera and the others, while the demon only had to attack; the latter was clearly at an advantage.</p>
<p>“This is the end for now…loathsome guardians…!!”</p>
<p>The Oggbrym likely perceived it was at a disadvantage; its back directed to Shin and Schnee, it ran off towards the mist, as if planning to dive into it. Being a four-limbed beast type, it had reached the mist of the dungeon in a few seconds.</p>
<p>In the time required to notice Shin’s arrival, make a decision, turn on its heels and flee, Shin was not just standing idly. As soon as he saw the Oggbrym turn around, Shin moved too.</p>
<p>The Oggbrym was indeed fast, but it could not move instantly. Shin jumped high in the air, his left and raised high in a throwing motion. In his empty left hand a 4 mel long, giant lance-like weapon appeared.</p>
<p>It was a superior Ancient-grade sword specially made to mow down large hordes of weaker monsters in a single strike, named 『Geatharma』.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the 『Geatharma』 that appeared on his hand and his movements stopped for a moment. Originally, its 2 mel long blade was wrapped in red flames, but the sword that Shin wielded was engulfed in white fire. The moment the flames changed color, the silhouette of a female elf blinked before his eyes for a second.</p>
<p>He did not feel anything negative from the power transmitted from the blade to his hands. On the contrary, the flames had now a sort of sacred aura to them.</p>
<p>His hesitation lasted but an instant. Shin’s eyes turned back to the Oggbrym as he targeted the beast. The mist forming the dungeon was changing shape, letting the Oggbrym slip through.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting away!!”</p>
<p>Using a platform created via 【Flying Shadow】, Shin managed to keep his stance, despite being in the air, and launched 『Geatharma』.</p>
<p>Thanks to his superhuman strength, 『Geatharma』 flew through the air leaving behind a trail like a comet. The white flaming blade disappeared inside the mist, piercing Oggbrym’s back and stabbing the ground under the monster.</p>
<p>The shock caused the mist around Oggbrym to disappear completely.</p>
<p>“GWOOOOOHHHH!!!!</p>
<p>White flames burst forth from 『Geatharma』. As if the flames had a will of their own, they burned the beast both inside and out.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the flames turned red again. What remained was 『Geatharma』, stuck in the center of a small, charred crater.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin. What weapon is that?”</p>
<p>Shin landed on the ground and Tiera approached him. She felt that the monster had been annihilated by the weapon’s powers, rather than Shin’s strength, so she couldn’t help but be curious.</p>
<p>“It sure did something amazing, but normally it doesn’t have powers like that. I saw an elf-like silhouette when I was about to throw it, so I guess one of the past World Tree priestesses granted it her powers? We’re right in front of the World Tree after all.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at 『Geatharma』, which had turned the demon into ashes, then to the center of the room. In the center, beyond the depths of the dungeon-turned holy area, the World Tree towered over them.</p>
<p>Its trunk, about 5 mel wide, did not seem to grow any thinner no matter how high one looked. Its branches and leaves glowed with a golden hue, which made anyone who looked at it feel more peaceful with just a glance.</p>
<p>As Tiera had said, part of the tree was painted black, and its glow became fainter at times. It was probably caused by the impurity; the mist made it impossible to see the tree beyond a certain height.</p>
<p>“We defeated the demon, but the dungeon is still there…I guess it wasn’t created by that demon, then.”</p>
<p>Normally, defeating the boss demon caused the demon dungeon to disappear. However, this dungeon did not show any signs of collapse.</p>
<p>“Was that the only monster that attacked you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it suddenly came out of the mist and attacked. We could resist only because Kagerou did his best.”</p>
<p>Tiera patted Kagerou’s head. After the battle, the divine beast returned to its 1 mel wolf form. Its wounds were already healed, its eyes turned into slits as it enjoyed Tiera’s head pats.</p>
<p>“Did you finish the purification already?”</p>
<p>“Not yet. It all happened when we were about to start.”</p>
<p>“How about trying the items I gave you while you do it, then? No matter what demons come out, I’m not going to let them get in your way.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded and Kagerou howled in agreement.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Who knows when we’ll be interrupted again, and if the World Tree regains its power things might return to normal.”</p>
<p>“I m-might not be able to help much, but I’ll do my best too!”</p>
<p>Lymliss, despite not being able to keep up with the rapidly changing situation, was influenced by Tiera and expressed her resolve. The two priestesses started the purification, under Shin and the others’ surveillance. The World Tree recovery items had already been set up.</p>
<p>“~~~~~~~♪”</p>
<p>The two priestesses held their hands over their chest, in prayer, as they intoned a wordless melody. It was a rhythm unknown to Shin’s ears, but it somehow felt soothing.</p>
<p>The purification was different from what Shin and the others had witnessed before. Tiera and Lymliss’ bodies were enveloped in a gentle light as the rite began.</p>
<p>The light then grew fainter and floated towards the World Tree, mixing with its aura. As it did, the World Tree’s light gradually became brighter. At the same time, the parts blackened by the impurity decreased more and more.</p>
<p>“Schnee, could that be…”</p>
<p>“Yes, one of the past priestesses, surely. She must be lending her powers to them.”</p>
<p>After about 10 seconds from the start of the purification, a female elf with silver hair and green eyes appeared in mid-air. The silhouette floated behind Tiera and Lymliss, holding her hands as if offering a prayer. Somehow, Shin thought she looked similar to Tiera.</p>
<p>“The mist is changing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, something is bound to happen. Let’s stay on our toes.”</p>
<p>As the World Tree purification progressed, the mist started changing. Shin and the others prepared to be able to deal with any sudden developments as the mist gradually grew thinner.</p>
<p>A few seconds before the purification ended, the mist concentrated into a single point, a short distance away from the World Tree. The priestess who had appeared behind Tiera and Lymliss disappeared before they could open their eyes.</p>
<p>“The dungeon master finally graces us with their presence?”</p>
<p>Any demon dungeon had a demon as its core. If this demon wasn’t defeated, the dungeon would never disappear. Such bosses were usually located deep inside the dungeon, so it wasn’t bizarre for it to appear here. The mist changed shape, finally forming a human-sized silhouette. For unknown reasons, the silhouette had elf-like features.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the name displayed by 【Analyze】 and his brow furrowed. The reason was that the human-sized demon possessed two names.</p>
<p>One of them was Ragoj. Its level of 802 ranked it as a Duke among the demons. Being the next rank after Grand Duke, it wasn’t strange for this demon to be able to assume human form.</p>
<p>The other name was Crissot Lucent. Lucent, just like Tiera. The name of a member of the World Tree caretaker clan was displayed as the identity of a demon. Shin couldn’t help but be puzzled.</p>
<p>“…no…it can’t be.”</p>
<p>While Shin was confused by the double identity, especially the Lucent part, Tiera expressed her utter disbelief. Her eyes shook, as to express her inner turmoil, as did her head, refusing to accept what she saw. Tiera stepped back.</p>
<p>“Father…”</p>
<p>No one expected to hear the whispered words that barely escaped Tiera’s lips. In response, the eyes of the stone-faced demon turned towards her. The moment she was reflected in his pupils, the demon’s expression contorted.</p>
<p>“Ng…gah…”</p>
<p>Not only the demon’s expression, but his outline itself contorted. He too looked like he had seen something absolutely shocking.</p>
<p>“….he ran away.”</p>
<p>The demon lost its outline and disappeared as if melting in the air. Its presence was no more and the dungeon was disappearing, but no one thought he had been defeated.</p>
<p>One of the demons had been defeated, but the whole group felt that the situation had become even more muddled and complicated.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 3 Part 2</p>
<p>“Tiera, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Shin called out to Tiera, who was staring at where the demon was before disappearing with an empty look in her eyes.</p>
<p>“In any case, the dungeon has disappeared and the holy area is back to normal. The items seem to be having an effect too. Just in case, let’s get some sap and go back.”</p>
<p>“Ah…yes, right.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s response showed that she had not yet recovered, but Shin did not press her and went to collect the World Tree’s sap. He thought Lymliss would say something, but she seemed to be worried about Tiera and did not look in Shin’s direction. She looked distraught, probably regretting not being able to do anything.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I’ll give you this just in case Lymliss.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>“It’s an item that can temporarily protect you if you are attacked again. I made it, but Schnee Raizar can vouch for it, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>An incident had happened right in front of the World Tree, so it was safe to assume that nowhere was safe in Lanapacea. The item Shin gave Lymliss could only provide temporary protection, but it was still better than nothing.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, elven warriors approached their location. Now that the dungeon was gone, there was only about one kemel of distance between them. Elves riding horses were leading the group, most of them over level 230. Shin assumed they were Chosen Ones or captains.</p>
<p>“Lady Lymliss, Lady Tiera, are you safe!?”</p>
<p>The older elf leading the group inquired about the priestesses’ safety. Lymliss replied, but Tiera was still looking down, standing next to Shin and Schnee.</p>
<p>“I am the Luderia clan’s warrior chief, my name is Ordoss Luderia. Let me give you my thanks for saving our priestesses. As expected of lady Schnee Raizar, your prowess surpasses even your great fame.”</p>
<p>Ordoss probably thought Schnee was the group’s leader: after expressing his gratitude he bowed to her.</p>
<p>“No, it was not only my own strength. The World Tree itself resisted and the priestesses’ purification was effective as well.”</p>
<p>“I see. It is unprecedented for such an event to occur in the holy area. We suspect the increase in impurities may have caused it. What is your opinion, Lady Raizar?”</p>
<p>“I do not believe that is the only reason.”</p>
<p>They didn’t know what kind of person Ordoss was, so it was difficult to judge whether they should mention the demons or not. However, he did not seem charmed or confused.</p>
<p>“Perhaps…demons could be involved…”</p>
<p>Schnee was still trying to gauge him, but Ordoss spoke first. His words alarmed Shin and the others.</p>
<p>“Do you have any information?”</p>
<p>“As you probably already know, among us warriors there are some whose personalities changed…no, I should say that they became completely different people. Some elves that were born before the Dusk of Majesty hypothesize that they are under the effects of forbidden mental manipulation techniques.”</p>
<p>Ordoss continued talking, making it clear that he was revealing such information only because of Schnee’s presence. Lymliss had just been attacked by a demon, so she did not show any surprise. Ordoss probably thought that she needed to know too, so he decided to speak while she was present.</p>
<p>“Your clan head is also acting strangely…do you know anything about it?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I do. In the past few months, he has not shown himself to anyone except a select few retainers. Some warrior chiefs view this with suspicion, but there is nothing unnatural in the way he talks and he carries his daily duties as usual, so any accusation or doubt would be regarded as unfounded.”</p>
<p>Ordoss’ words were consistent with what Herald said. Apparently, there were rifts among the warrior chiefs.</p>
<p>After Ordoss mentioned that, another group of elves arrived.</p>
<p>“Let us stop here for now. The approaching warrior chief is one of the changed ones.”</p>
<p>“Understood. We will investigate the matter on our own too.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Ordoss bowed again, then stood beside Lymliss. Soon enough, another elf arrived, accompanied by troops. The newcomer looked still young.</p>
<p>“Lady Lymliss, are you safe!?”</p>
<p>The elf leading the group then rushed to her, but Ordoss stepped in front to stop him.</p>
<p>“Sir Ordoss, what is the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>“Lady Lymliss’ protection is my duty. Yours is to inspect the holy area, is it not? Let us both carry out our duties.”</p>
<p>Ordoss apparently had no intention of letting the newly arrived elf approach Lymliss. It was true that it was Ordoss’ duty to guard Lymliss, so the other elf did not object.</p>
<p>“We’ll go back to the residence, then.”</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment. Lady Tiera is the priestess of the now defunct Lucent clan. Now that the Lucent are part of our Luderia clan, is it not proper for her to come with us?”</p>
<p>Because of Tiera’s presence, the elf that came after Ordoss stopped Shin’s group when they tried to leave. However, his request was not one they felt willing to accept.</p>
<p>“Tiera is our companion. We’ll protect her no matter what happens.”</p>
<p>“Who are you, human? I am speaking to Lady Raizar!”</p>
<p>The elf clearly looked down on Shin. They couldn’t know if that was his original personality or his transformed one, but it was clear that their interaction would hardly be friendly.</p>
<p>“I agree. If anything happens, we are capable of protecting Tiera. Or do you say that you cannot trust my words?”</p>
<p>“Hm…no, if Lady Raizar says so, then I suppose her safety is guaranteed.”</p>
<p>The warrior chief was probably aware of Schnee’s strength, so he did not object any further. Thinking that staying any longer would only lead to more trouble, Shin turned around and headed towards the residence. They walked normally through the streets this time.</p>
<p>When they returned, they found the female elf in charge of the residence waiting for them, clearly distressed. She had heard of the appearance of the dungeon and was very worried.</p>
<p>Tiera was in low spirits because of her father’s matter, but she smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“So…here we are. It’s really hard to ask, but we can’t ignore it, unfortunately. Tiera, you said that the demon took the appearance of your father? What does that mean?”</p>
<p>Shin wished he could leave Tiera alone, but the matter had to be addressed.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what’s going on either. But yes, that appearance was definitely my father, Crissot Lucent.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group gathered in the residence after taking a short break. It could be said that they took some time for Tiera’s sake. She seemed to have calmed down a bit, but her expression was still stiff. Her tone was also different from usual.</p>
<p>Even so, they needed to talk about it. After all, a member of the Lucent family, a World Tree caretaker clan, could be allied with the demons.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, you’ve told us about your mother before, but never about your father.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I never said much about him to master either.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at Schnee and she gave a small nod.</p>
<p>“My father was the Lucent clan’s head. It might be biased coming from his daughter, but he was well-loved and trusted by everyone. He was a really admirable person.”</p>
<p>He treasured Tiera and his wife Irene, without ever spoiling them. Tiera continued, saying he was a good, strict father.</p>
<p>Those happy days, however, ended abruptly. Without the slightest hint or notice, Tiera was stricken by the curse. When she was still allowed to live in the village, she witnessed Crissot being slandered or insulted many times.</p>
<p>The day Tiera’s exile was decided, her mother and father made another important decision. Tiera’s mother, Irene, would take Tiera and flee from the village, while her father would remain. It was a painful, heart-rending choice made by parents trapped between the heavy burden of responsibility as a World Tree caretaker clan and love for their child.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened to father after that. When I returned here I learned that he died due to an illness a few years ago, but nothing else.”</p>
<p>His grave was apparently located in a location separate from Tiera’s mother’s, but Tiera did not feel ready to visit it when she returned, so she had not gone to see it yet.</p>
<p>“Did anyone take care of him before he died to this supposed illness?”</p>
<p>“Despite the circumstances of my curse, he was still the head of a caretaker clan, so they tried curing him. During that time, the doctor took care of him. I knew him, so I went to ask about it, but he told me that there was no mistake about it.”</p>
<p>Elves are a species with high longevity: as long as they are not killed, they could easily live for hundreds of years. That is the reason why Tiera could talk with the doctor who oversaw her father’s care. Crissot’s funeral services were held and he was properly buried.</p>
<p>“In this village, people are buried by—”</p>
<p>“They’re buried in the ground, yes. Elves and Pixies believe that after death one should return to nature.”</p>
<p>“I see, so it’s just like that guy…”</p>
<p>Shin recalled <a href="https://the-new-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Eline_Sperizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eline</a>, who in Palmirack killed himself and turned into a demon. This time the host died by illness instead of being killed, but the dead body was clearly being manipulated.</p>
<p>“It kind of feels different from that time, though.”</p>
<p>“The demon reacted to seeing Tiera. It might retain some memories or will from the past life.”</p>
<p>“Wait, that can’t…no, it might be.”</p>
<p>Shin listened to Schnee’s hypothesis and recalled something. In the game era, he participated in a demon-related event that involved rescuing NPCs resisting possession by demons. Ultimately the NPCs would die, but thanks to the players’ intervention they could be freed of regrets and leave items behind.</p>
<p>In other words, as Schnee said, it could be possible to retain one’s memories even after a parasite-type demon inhabited one’s body. It would explain why it seemed to recognize Tiera. However, that would also cause suffering to both him and Tiera.</p>
<p>“I’m alright, I could see the demon’s name too. I am not going to plead you to save my father…I wish for him to rest in peace as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke with a brave smile on her lips, without showing her sadness and anger, so Shin and the others responded in earnest.</p>
<p>“Tiera’s father, Crissot. Did he really die of an illness? In Eline’s case, he was clearly controlled and killed by a parasite demon.”</p>
<p>“That seems to be clear. The illness itself was a common one. Anyone can catch it, but normally people get better. If you push yourself too hard or are in bad shape, it can get worse. That’s the kind of illness it was.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s explanation made it seem it was a sort of cold. If it worsened it could be lethal, but it all depended on the person’s condition.</p>
<p>“The doctor said that he was already at his limits, in more ways than one.”</p>
<p>His wife and daughter were lost, his clan disbanded: reason enough for him to be extremely distressed, both physically and mentally. However, Crissot’s suffering would not end so easily.</p>
<p>At the time, he was about 400 years old: as an elf, he was still young.</p>
<p>Because of that, he continued to live — or rather, was kept alive — as a “stud”, needed in case the bloodline of the caretaker clans began dying out or the Luderia and Lulac clans failed to produce new priestesses.</p>
<p>In the end, he didn’t give birth to any offspring, but, while necessary to preserve the bloodline, it had to be a harrowing, painful decision beyond Shin’s imagination. He thought that he would have probably abandoned his duties to flee with his family.</p>
<p>“That might have made him a target for the demons.”</p>
<p>“That’s right…for them, he would have been an ideal host.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded in response to Shin’s words. The conditions necessary for Crissot to be possessed were all there, almost too conveniently.</p>
<p>“It is strange, however, that despite targeting Tiera’s group, he faltered after seeing her. I would understand if he had been hiding to spy on us though.”</p>
<p>“Demons sometimes fight among their ranks too, or it could be that he was just told that their target was a priestess, with no other details…though it sounds a bit out there.”</p>
<p>Demons often acted independently. Even in the game, the miasma lords’ lineage or each demon’s powers could provide a hint, but were not enough to accurately predict their actions. In the current world their level of freedom was even higher, so even making a general guess would be difficult.</p>
<p>“We won’t get anywhere just thinking about it at this point. What we know is that Crissot is being manipulated and we have to defeat him. I’m sorry, Tiera. I wish there was something else we could do.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I know that there are things that not even you can do, Shin. Besides, I’m furious that they would use my father’s body like that. Please, don’t hold anything back.”</p>
<p>Tiera still seemed a bit down, but her last request was spoken with strength in her voice.</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess this is all the information we needed. I’ll go back to Shibaid and the others, they might worry if we take too long.”</p>
<p>“I was wondering why he wasn’t with you.”</p>
<p>“I asked him to guard the Lulac priestess. Though very few people know of her return, it’s just in case.”</p>
<p>Shin entrusted Tiera to Schnee and headed towards the Lulac residence. This time, he didn’t feel the bizarre sensation he had as the first time.</p>
<p>After making sure no one was around, Shin was about to knock on the door of Herald’s room, but the door opened first. It opened just like an automatic door, so Shin was frozen in a “knocking” pose.</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had opened it. Shin had reached and defeated the demon quickly, so he lost the timing to summon her.</p>
<p>“Ah! Sir Shin! You’re safe!”</p>
<p>“Ah…er, yeah. We defeated one demon, for now.”</p>
<p>“For now…?”</p>
<p>Behind Yuzuha and Lina, happy to see Shin back, Herald cocked his head to the side, wondering if taking down demons was so simple. His reaction was the most normal one.</p>
<p>“At the very least, there is another one in hiding somewhere. Please stay safe.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>He knew that there were limits to what Herald could do, but Shin said so all the same. Resisting the demon possessing Crissot and escaping would be difficult even for a Chosen One. Although the items Shin offered could provide some assistance, there was nothing else he could do if he wasn’t with him.</p>
<p>However, Herald refused to accept the items offered by Shin.</p>
<p>“Okay, brother, I’m off.”</p>
<p>“Yes, make sure you fulfill your duty.”</p>
<p>Shin returned to the residence with Lina. Before he left the residence, Herald told him — careful not to be heard by Lina — that if he was ever manipulated by a demon, Shin should kill him without hesitation. His expression showed that he accepted that it might be the last time they met.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 3 Part 3</p>
<p>The following day, a messenger from the Luderia clan visited the residence where Shin’s group was staying.</p>
<p>“You wish to know what happened in detail?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We have heard Lady Lymliss’ report, but she is not very well versed in combat, thus we would like to hear more details from you.”</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of a dungeon and demon attack. Lymliss did not panic, but she was a beginner in terms of fighting. We were going to start the purification but a dungeon appeared, we were attacked, we fought, Shin and Schnee arrived and saved us. Lymliss’ account had apparently been very general.</p>
<p>The fact that the holy area was being transformed into a dungeon was a very serious event. Not being satisfied with such a report was very understandable. Other than Lymliss, the only person who knew what happened in detail was Tiera.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee could tell what happened after their arrival, but it was more natural to ask Tiera, as she had been present since the beginning. Unlike Lymliss, she was versed in combat, so she was more likely to give a less confused account, excluding Crissot’s appearance.</p>
<p>“My master and her companion actually defeated the demon, so I will comply only if they are present as well. I am sure that more information can only be helpful.”</p>
<p>“Naturally, we would be thankful if they participate too.”</p>
<p>The messenger readily accepted Tiera’s polite request. Maybe because they were not in the clan head’s faction, the request was easily granted. The messenger had to have a certain degree of authority.</p>
<p>Tiera had already decided to be with Shin and the others; if they were not allowed to participate, she would refuse, so they were glad that there was no need for negotiation.</p>
<p>“Okay then, what are they going to do to us?”</p>
<p>“I wonder. The dungeon transformation might be unrelated to the clan head’s plans…but if it is, they will surely know what happened. They might show that they are handling the situation very seriously.”</p>
<p>Schnee mentioned a possible meaning behind the inquiry. If they had already compiled information, there had to be another motive behind it.</p>
<p>It was also possible that they wanted to pin the blame on Shin’s group to restrain them and maybe to give them the same treatment as the warriors who radically changed personality.</p>
<p>“We should prepare ourselves as much as we can. We can’t bring Lina with us either, so I’ll ask Shibaid to look after her during this time.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to be a burden…”</p>
<p>“No, you’re not a frontliner, so don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Shin brightly encouraged the dejected Lina. After all she would help with the purification. On the other hand, there was not much Shin could do to help the World Tree.</p>
<p>The group made the necessary preparations and headed to the Luderia residence at the appointed time.</p>
<p>“And we’re here, waiting.”</p>
<p>“They told us to come at this time, why aren’t they ready yet?”</p>
<p>They arrived at the appointed time, but were told to stand by in a sort of waiting room, as the clan head was not yet ready.</p>
<p>They were served tea and biscuits, because of Tiera and Schnee’s presence, but they didn’t touch them. Shin expected to be asked to relinquish his weapons, but thanks to his position as Schnee’s companion, he was let through without any particular condition.</p>
<p>“Anyway, this is really bad…even I can feel it.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere was something similar, yet different, to both impurity and miasma. A sort of noxious atmosphere filled the whole residence. Shin was not as sensitive as Tiera or Schnee, but it was thick enough that he could tell.</p>
<p>“I am sure that there are people who would turn strange simply by living here. Though the person who let us in didn’t seem to notice anything…”</p>
<p>Schnee pensively voiced her thoughts. The expressions of the elves they saw in the residence were all fairly normal.</p>
<p>“I can feel negative aura leaking from everywhere…it’s sickening. Why doesn’t anyone notice it? It wasn’t like this last time I came either.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while rubbing her arms. She was very sensitive to negative auras and such, so she looked more affected than Shin and Schnee. Next to her, Kagerou looked worried.</p>
<p>After about an hour of waiting, they were finally told that preparations were done.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what they have in store for us…”</p>
<p>They followed the elf attendant through the residence, making sure to map it as they went. There were many similar corridors, twists and turns, like a maze. Also, because of the attendant’s leisurely pace, it took them about 10 minutes to reach the clan head’s quarters.</p>
<p>The room was structured like many others, making it very difficult to differentiate from other rooms they had passed. Shin thought that the residence seemed to be made to hinder and repel enemy attacks.</p>
<p>“Enter.”</p>
<p>A male voice was heard from inside the room. The attendant then opened the door.</p>
<p>Inside there was an elevated seat, surrounded on all four sides by thin curtains, and several elves sitting on the right and left sides of the room. Shin noticed Ordoss and the elf warrior who had arrived after him and guessed that the elves present where warrior chiefs and other elves close in rank.</p>
<p>There was a silhouette behind the curtains: likely due to a special enchantment they had, 【Analyze】 was unusable. It wasn’t completely unusable, however: albeit disrupted, some information was still displayed.</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera, sit in front of the head. Lady Raizar and companion, behind her.”</p>
<p>The instructions came from Ordoss. Their seats were already decided and denoted by cushions.</p>
<p>There didn’t seem to be any traps. After Tiera and the others sat down, the elf sitting next to the elevated seat asked her a question. He was tasked with speaking for the clan head, who, apparently, would not talk with them directly.</p>
<p>Covering a relatively wide range of topics, the questions were first about the World Tree, then the demons and monsters that appeared in the dungeon, and finally the impurity.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee answered for Tiera when she didn’t know, such as the types of monsters in the dungeon and how powerful they were. Tierra had been attacked by the demon before she encountered any monsters, so she couldn’t answer even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>During the process Tiera asked some questions herself, but was always answered that the Lulac and Luderia would deal with the situation, so she could not obtain any information. She had been summoned just to provide information: the Luderia had no intention to have an information exchange.</p>
<p>While Tiera was answering questions, Shin examined the clan head for a while. The information displayed by 【Analyze】 was gradually increasing. Perhaps because Shin was the user, or something was lending him strength, he would soon be able to tell the clan head’s name and level.</p>
<p>He had to keep the target within his field of view to maintain the skill, so Shin glanced at the right and left sides of the room, without moving his head.</p>
<p>Many of the elves on the right side looked at Tiera with disrespect, while the ones on the left glared at them with anger and spite.</p>
<p>The elves on the left were probably still sane, while the ones on the right were the ones who had radically changed. Ordoss was also on the left. Shin also noticed another familiar face: Anaheit, the elf standing guard at the gates of Lanapacea. His surname was Luderia, but Shin thought that, as a gate guard, he wouldn’t be called to such a meeting.</p>
<p>“The next question is…what? No, yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>The inquirer seemed to be perplexed, so Shin looked back at him. He was visibly confused.</p>
<p>“Ehm, the next question, then. What were you doing after the banishment?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Tiera was confused as well. All questions until then were related to the dungeon and the demons, so it was normal for her to be surprised by the sudden shift to her actions after being banished from the village.</p>
<p>“What is the matter? Answer.”</p>
<p>“Er, it has nothing to do with the matter at hand, though.”</p>
<p>“Answer already!!”</p>
<p>Not only Shin, but also other elves around them were perplexed by this exchange between Tiera and the inquirer. Both sides of the room focused on him, wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>“What would you do after knowing something like that now?”</p>
<p>Tiera had no intention to simply answer such a question and asked what its purpose was. The clan head’s silhouette was hidden by the curtains, so the eyes of all present focused on the inquirer.</p>
<p>“That’s…my lord? Asking such a question at this time would—”</p>
<p>The clan head was probably urging the inquirer to obey his orders, but the latter looked more and more confused, especially as he was the center of attention in the room. His eyes went back and forth from the clan head to Tiera and the rest of the room, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>“T-the inquiry is over! You may leave!”</p>
<p>The clan head clearly had more questions to ask, but the inquirer tried to forcibly close the meeting. Considering the nature of the previous question, Shin imagined that the following ones concerned Tiera personally. The clan head’s voice could not be heard, maybe because of the curtains’ properties.</p>
<p>However, the meeting was not allowed to be closed. Before Shin or Schnee could ask what was going on, the inquirer’s body was pierced by ashen thorns.</p>
<p>“If only 【Analyze】 ended a little earlier…”</p>
<p>【Analyze】 fully displayed the information of the figure beyond the curtains just one second before the inquirer was stabbed by thorns. Hiding the name and level until the very end was truly a demon-like deceit.</p>
<p>The inquirer was stabbed by six thorns in total. Sharp through their tips, all of them pierced his body. His heart was also likely pierced, as the elf was instantly killed and his HP gauge vanished instantly.</p>
<p>“Watch out!! That’s not the head, it’s a demon!!”</p>
<p>“It transformed into the head!?”</p>
<p>“Draw your weapons!! Protect lady Tiera!!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted to warn the elves on the left side of the room. Being warrior chiefs, their response was almost immediate. On the other side, the elves on the right moved rather slowly in comparison. They were probably under some sort of influence.</p>
<p>The elves only mentioned Tiera likely because they knew that there was no need to protect Schnee or Shin.</p>
<p>“PrOtEct!!”</p>
<p>When the elves on the left started moving, a twisted voice rose from behind the curtains. As soon as it was heard, the elves on the right started moving towards Tiera, with agility and speed completely different from seconds before. They really were under the demon’s control.</p>
<p>“Now that’s not what I’d expect a demon to say…”</p>
<p>Shin had immediately jumped next to Tiera. While knocking down the attacking elves, he couldn’t shake a strange feeling about the demon’s order. It was difficult to hear because of the demon’s twisted tone of voice, but he was fairly sure that the demon said “protect”.</p>
<p>In fact, the elves on the right were not only trying to take down Shin and Schnee, but also trying to capture Tiera. Their weapons were not aimed at her. They were trying to take a priestess, the natural enemy of demons, without hurting her. It might be feasible in a situation where they had an absolute advantage, like when Lina was kidnapped, but now they had to fight Shin, Schnee, and the elven warrior chiefs.</p>
<p>The elves on the demon’s side charged without regards for their wounds.</p>
<p>“What has happened to you…fools…!”</p>
<p>The elves protecting Tiera alongside Shin and Schnee shouted. To avoid killing their brethren, they attacked with the dull side of their blades and similar methods.</p>
<p>Shin recalled the elf he met when going to meet Lymliss: it was possible to talk normally with them, but now they stood back up no matter how many times they were hit, like living dolls. Their movements seemed separate from their will.</p>
<p>“The clan head is manipulating them. No, the fake clan head is!”</p>
<p>Shin materialized 『Moonless』, wrapped it with swirling water and swung it towards the clan head.</p>
<p>Katana/Water combination skill 【Glacial Moon Blade】.</p>
<p>A crescent moon-shaped blade of ice slashed through the curtains, speeding towards the clan head. However, before it could reach, the target moved away. A shadow jumped out of the curtains, landing in a corner of the room.</p>
<p>Having cleared the dungeon that appeared in the holy area, Shin recognized that the thorns that pierced the inquirer looked like they were made of concentrated mist, just like that of the dungeon.</p>
<p>That was enough to confirm the demon’s identity, and, thanks to 【Analyze】, he had further proof.</p>
<p>Crissot Lucent – Level 952</p>
<p>The demon’s level had jumped up since their last encounter. Half of its body had a mist-like form, while the other half maintained the figure of an elf. The elven part looked at Tiera with a fiendish expression, while the mist part was very similar to an amoeba, extending and retracting without a fixed shape.</p>
<p>“What the!?”</p>
<p>“It’s a monster…”</p>
<p>“It can’t be…you are…”</p>
<p>The elves were shaken by the shadow’s real identity. Some of them recognized the elven side of the demon, but could not believe their eyes.</p>
<p>“Schnee, please take care of the enemy elves. I’m going to deal with that.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Schnee moved to aid the elves who had been slowed down by their confusion and shock. Shin’s attack caught Crissot’s attention, but the movements of the hostile elves did not change. They were damaged enough to be unconscious, but their movements did not stop or even dull.</p>
<p>In that case, they would either need to be either physically stopped by breaking their limbs or by status ailments such as paralysis. Schnee could surely deal with the situation in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The problem was that the demon also decided to act during such a situation.</p>
<p>Maybe because it was using the body of Crissot Lucent, Tiera’s father, the demon’s eyes were still fixated on her, despite the fact that Shin was standing before him, armed and ready to strike. He looked full of openings.</p>
<p>However, the mist part was different. It changed shape like an amoeba, but it ignored the elves and targeted only Shin. It clearly saw him as an enemy.</p>
<p>“AgAIn…yOu dARe tAke fROm mE agAIn!? I gaVE my whole lifE, all I ever had, to protect the world, protect the world tree, and this is what I receive!?”</p>
<p>Blood red tears streamed from Crissot’s eyes, dripping on the floor. He didn’t bother wiping them, but little by little his tone of voice lost the demon-like twisted tone.</p>
<p>Even as he shouted, the same thorns that pierced the inquirer continued attacking Shin. Along with its level, the demon’s stats had increased too. Every blow was fast and powerful. It was hard to believe that it was the same material which composed the dungeon walls.</p>
<p>If one of the elves was hit, they would certainly be turned into mincemeat.</p>
<p>“Peace!? Mission!? A world that curses those you love is better off gone!!”</p>
<p>Crissot’s monologue continued as Shin kept knocking away the amoeba’s attacks, making sure that no other elves were hit. Crissot’s right hand clawed at his face, carving the skin with his nails, drawing blood. His eyes were bloodshot. He was clearly no longer sane.</p>
<p>Shin thought it might be because of the demon’s influence, but even so, there was something off about him.</p>
<p>When Shin attacked the mist thorns squirmed and writhed, as if in severe pain.</p>
<p>“The demon’s information is disappearing…what’s going on here?”</p>
<p>When Shin checked Crissot’s status in the dungeon, the demon’s name was clearly displayed along with the elf’s own. The current Crissot’s status, however, was not the same.</p>
<p>As far as 【Analyze】 was concerned, Crissot was a normal person.</p>
<p>Needless to say, no normal person had a lower body composed of mist. The writhing thorns increased, so Shin took advantage of the decreased number of attacks and prepared to strike.</p>
<p>He held 『Moonless』 pointed down to the left, with a low stance, then stepped forward. It was enough for Crissot to be in the range of Shin’s blade.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Movement-type skill 【Ground Shrink】, the distance between the two disappeared in an instant. Shin was ready to strike. His katana flashed, aiming to cleave Crissot in two.</p>
<p>Katana-type martial skill 【Armor Piercer】.</p>
<p>Shin realized how the thorns had high defensive powers during the previous exchange, so he chose a skill that inflicted more damage the higher the target’s defense was. Even if the elven part of Crissot had the same defense as the thorns, the skill was powerful enough to slice him in half.</p>
<p>“You could block that…?”</p>
<p>Crissot himself could not react, but the thorns were not as helpless. Thanks to their inhuman reaction speed, all the thorns that were not writhing in pain grouped together and protected Crissot from Shin’s slash.</p>
<p>Shin managed to slice the thorns in half, but felt that his blade did not reach Crissot. His katana’s speed was slightly slowed down as it cut through the thorns. In that small timeframe, Crissot’s body leapt out of the room. The thorns helped it move at a speed impossible for humans.</p>
<p>For Crissot as he was now, the room’s walls might as well be made of paper. The very moment he moved away from Shin, he had destroyed the wall and started fleeing. The destruction of the walls and pillars did not make a sound, but the map showed that he was passing through places where walls were supposed to be.</p>
<p>It was just like he could move ignoring the building’s structure: the only possible way was that he turned into mist and passed through cracks in the walls or ceiling.</p>
<p>Shin wanted to give chase, but the Luderia warriors, alarmed by the sound of battling, poured into the room. All of them belonged to the side which underwent radical personality changes.</p>
<p>“Kh, even the residence’s guards…”</p>
<p>“Could it be that their warrior troops turned crazy too?”</p>
<p>A massive amount of warriors appeared in the room, seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Schnee and the sane elves attacked them without holding back, though while making sure not to lethally wound them. As they stood back up after being knocked down, it was clear that they were under the demon’s control too.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what exactly their current status was, but if they were under manipulation he couldn’t just abandon them.</p>
<p>“We will take care of the situation here. Please chase the demon, Shin.”</p>
<p>“I would love to, believe me, but his response disappeared as soon as he fled.”</p>
<p>The map showed no signs of the escaped icon. Shin enlarged it and used his detection skills to their maximum extent, to no avail.</p>
<p>“Rather than that…do you feel it?”</p>
<p>“Yes…people under the demon’s control have started rampaging, and not only here.”</p>
<p>The demon’s presence disappeared, but others appeared in its place. A large number of presences started moving at the same time, heading towards the city and the holy area. They started doing so at the same time as the elves poured into the room, so the other presences probably followed the same master.</p>
<p>“We can’t afford to waste any more time.”</p>
<p>Shin activated the Earth-type magic skill 【Mother Earth’s Embrace】 on the group of elves who barged into the room. A heavy pressure manifested in Shin’s surroundings, forcing the hostile elves to collapse on the ground.</p>
<p>After sealing the elves’ movements thus, Shin focused on the map. The elves he just neutralized attacked in a haphazard manner, but in the city the hostile presences were separated in groups, attacking several locations at the same time. Among them, Shin recognized the Lulac residence and the residence Tiera was borrowing.</p>
<p>“There are other demons? Or maybe some elves allied with them on their own will…”</p>
<p>“It’s possible. In any case, we can’t stay here any longer.”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee activated a Water-type magic skill at the same time, creating a wall of ice. They surrounded the hostile elves with it, blocking their movements. They also sealed the entrance to prevent any more elves from coming inside.</p>
<p>The ice, created by Shin and Schnee’s magic power, was too hard to even be scratched by the elves. Shin and Schnee then called out to the sane elves and left. They didn’t know what the demons would do next, but Crissot was very likely to target Tiera again.</p>
<p>Because of their nature, however, the demons were also likely to target the World Tree or other priestesses. Shin concluded that in such a case, they would just need to protect them all together, and decided to regroup with Shibaid and the others first.</p>
<p>“A pressure powerful enough to rival lady Schnee…what exactly are you…?”</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about that when this ruckus is over.”</p>
<p>Shin dodged the answer and blew a hole in the ceiling with magic, to open a path for him and the rest. He was sure warrior chiefs could manage to keep up.</p>
<p>Shin waited for everyone to climb on the roof, then headed out. As he had expected, all warrior chiefs easily climbed up.</p>
<p>“We will move with 【Hiding】 activated from now on. Please do not stay too far from me or Schnee.”</p>
<p>“No, we will go where lady Lymliss is. We had her wait in the holy area, in case anything happened. She is guarded by elite warriors, but if the opponents are demons, who knows what could happen. In the worst case, we have to protect her with our lives.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the World Tree’s recovery, the holy area’s power of repelling impurity and miasma had grown. At the moment, it was the safest location in the country. Some of the warriors could use Mind Chat, so they had already exchanged information. They asked Shin and Schnee to go with Tiera and said they would move separately.</p>
<p>“Will they be alright…?”</p>
<p>“Judging from their gear, they should be advanced Chosen Ones. If their opponents are just soldiers, they shouldn’t be in danger.”</p>
<p>There were warrior chiefs among the elves on the demon’s side too, but as far as Shin could tell, the sane ones were stronger. Some of them also equipped Mythology-grade weapons, albeit lower-ranked ones. As long as they didn’t encounter a demon like the one Shin defeated in the dungeon, they wouldn’t lose. If the warriors set out to kill from the start, mere soldiers could not overwhelm them, even with numbers.</p>
<p>Things would be different if they were up against demons, but that could be said about anyone. Shin’s group, capable of handling Grand Duke class demons on their own, were the abnormal ones.</p>
<p>“There’s a stronger group going to the residence…they might have sensed Lina’s return. Let’s join them quickly and head to the holy area. I’m sorry, but speed is of the essence now.”</p>
<p>Shin grabbed the worried Tiera and jumped. That was the fastest way.</p>
<p>“H-hey, Shin!? What are you…we’re flying!?”</p>
<p>Tiera was surprised to be carried like that all of a sudden, but she was even more surprised by the fact that they didn’t land after the first leap.</p>
<p>“I’d like to learn that too. Could you teach me after things are settled here?”</p>
<p>“I’d be happy to, but I honestly can’t exactly tell why it happened.”</p>
<p>Schnee floated next to Shin as they were jumping, grabbed his arm and spoke. Shin was now jumping while carrying Tiera on his left arm and Schnee on his right. In other circumstances, it would be a pretty enviable position.</p>
<p>“Here we go!”</p>
<p>Shin forcefully kicked the air. Lanapacea’s streets and houses passed like a blur under them. After a couple minutes, they saw the residence where Shibaid waited. It was already under attack: they could see magic spells and arrows being launched against it. A half-transparent veil around the residence, however, repelled them all. It was a protective barrier created by Shibaid’s weapon, the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』.</p>
<p>The elf soldiers were about 50 in number, but only attacks from Chosen Ones could affect the barrier. Shin contacted Shibaid via Mind Chat, who said that Lina and the elves working in the residence were gathered together under his protection.</p>
<p>Yuzuha by herself would be enough to rout the attackers while Shibaid stayed on defense, but as they didn’t know the current situation, they chose to contact Shin while defending the residence.</p>
<p>“These guys have negative status ailments…they’re different from the ones before.”</p>
<p>“I will heal them.”</p>
<p>Schnee activated 【Cure】, targeting all the elves. As their status ailments disappeared, they lost consciousness and collapsed. Shin made sure there was not any more danger and joined with Shibaid and the others. They didn’t have enough time to lock so many people up somewhere.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do now?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of joining with Lymliss and the others in the holy area. I can’t tell how the demon using Crissot’s body will move, but they will definitely target the holy area and the priestesses. There are probably other demons around, they might attack as a group next time.”</p>
<p>The World Tree was healed, but it could not counterattack. If other demons were higher in level, like Crissot, it could be in danger.</p>
<p>“I’m coming too. I can be of help with the purification.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do.”</p>
<p>In such a situation, concentrating all available fighting power in one location made it easier to fight. Now with Shibaid, Yuzuha, and Lina in tow, Shin’s group headed to the holy area. Shin couldn’t carry all of them while jumping, so they rode on transformed Yuzuha and Kagerou, after casting a boost on them.</p>
<p>“What do you think they will do next?”</p>
<p>“As you probably think too, I think that demon is going to target Tiera. I have not definite proof, but I believe he is taking over the demon. His words made it seem like he was governed by hate and rage, but I think that his feelings as a parent remain, as long as Tiera is concerned.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Schnee’s words. In the game, demons were always demons, monsters through and through. In this world, however, anything could happen, for better or worse. It wasn’t unthinkable for a demon, supposed to take over others, to be taken over instead.</p>
<p>The words spoken by Crissot were so powerful that they started considering that possibility. He showed a strength of will that did not disappear even after he died and was possessed.</p>
<p>“What’s this now?”</p>
<p>Before Shin’s group could arrive to the holy area, the situation shifted. He felt a sort of vibration, not caused by Yuzuha running. It was a very strong vibration: even Kagerou and Yuzuha stopped, wondering what happened.</p>
<p>“Shin, look at that!!”</p>
<p>The cause of the strange phenomenon was quickly revealed. Schnee pointed towards a rainbow-colored light emanating from the holy area.</p>
<p>“That’s…very bad.”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Shin’s expression clouded, so Tiera called out to him.</p>
<p>A burst of light. If it was as he recalled, the situation was turning for the worst.</p>
<p>“That light appears when the World Tree is reaching its limits. It will form into a Divine Beast that destroys the world.”</p>
<p>Shin had never seen it directly: in the game era, he happened to see footage of the event, recorded by another player. The light appeared the second the World Tree was cut down, then gradually formed a mass. Ultimately it turned into a Divine Beast that destroys the world.</p>
<p>Its official name was guardian divine beast Reforgerer. It looked like a wingless dragon that walked on two legs. Its face was covered by smooth scales, except on the mouth, and it had no other organs. Its large, powerful arms ended in four fingers, each equipped with claws. Its legs were extremely robust as well. Its sculpted skin appeared soft, but was harder than adamantium.</p>
<p>Reforgerer also had a long tail that could sweep city walls and destroy them. It attacked with roars that caused physical damage, direct attacks with arms, legs and tail, powerful beams from its mouth and back, etcetera. Because of its silhouette and attacks, many players identified it with a certain famous Japanese kaiju.</p>
<p>“The demons must have done something.”</p>
<p>“It was probably Crissot…”</p>
<p>Crissot had indeed fled in the direction of the holy area. It was natural to think that he could have cut down the World Tree. The most urgent problem was that they had no ways to counter Reforgerer. It used impurity as its source of energy: without the World Tree, nothing could erase impurity, so it could feed on a nigh-infinite source of energy.</p>
<p>At the very least, one needed higher rank Mythology weapons to damage it, but even so it recovered all damage extremely quickly. It was a genuine nightmare to fight.</p>
<p>The beams it launched were also incredibly powerful: without at least Ancient-grade gear, anyone would melt if hit by them. Famously, a player hit by such a beam shouted, “Screw you, devs!!” after being struck down.</p>
<p>“Whatever can we do…?”</p>
<p>After learning about Reforgerer, Lina looked at the light, speechless.</p>
<p>At the time, all Rokuten members joined in the fight, but all they could do was buy time. When the battle was about to end, only two of the six remained. The battle ended only because Reforgerer used a great amount of impurity and stopped, then Rokuten’s Cook and other players specialized in farming started planting and raising the World Tree.</p>
<p>The World Tree resurrected and the impurity started to be purified again, so Reforgerer turned back into light and disappeared.</p>
<p>No one gained anything but destruction: it was the worst event in THE NEW GATE’s history.</p>
<p>“So, Shin, that divine beast disappeared when the World Tree was planted again and its purifying power returned, right? So even if it appears now, we could do something about it with the World Tree’s powers?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the problem is that we don’t have farming skills that can make the World Tree grow quickly. I have the skill, but the level’s way too low. That time, there were more than 10 people with the skill at X, Cook included.”</p>
<p>In this world, it would be a feat just to find a person with the skill at level X. Finding several was unrealistic at best.</p>
<p>“In that case, it can work out. I can feel it, the World Tree is still alive.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so too.”</p>
<p>In the game, Reforgerer only appeared when all World Trees were destroyed. Tiera and Lina, however, both said that the World Tree was still alive. As priestesses, they could feel its presence.</p>
<p>“If the World Tree is still alive, then maybe that’s not Reforgerer? I can’t think of anything else, though…”</p>
<p>“I wonder…looking at that light, it might be trying to forcefully summon Reforgerer. If not even Rokuten’s members could defeat it, it could provide more than enough fighting power, even if not at peak strength.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, that could be. Just the omen of its summoning creates such intimidating pressure.”</p>
<p>Shin too felt his skin crawl. In the game, players from various guilds cooperated to fight it, but still failed to defeat it. It was far superior to average bosses, so one could say it was obvious that it couldn’t be defeated the first time. Reforgerer, however, was powerful no matter how many times you fought it. Too powerful.</p>
<p>Shin noticed that, without realizing, his hand was on 『Moonless』 and looked away from the pillar of light.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s go to the holy area. If Reforgerer appears, I will fight.”</p>
<p>“I shall accompany you. Diverting enemy attention is my forte.”</p>
<p>“….no, Shibaid, I need you to act as guard. We have Kagerou too, but please stay with Tiera. She can’t fight if she starts the purification, after all. We might have enemies other than Reforgerer.”</p>
<p>Shin talked, mixing what he really thought with what he felt he had to say.</p>
<p>“Hmm, if you say so. Understood.”</p>
<p>Shibaid was not completely satisfied, but understood that he was best suited to what Shin asked him to do, so he nodded.</p>
<p>Shin and the others headed to the holy area, noticing that there was smoke billowing from several locations. The pillar of light rose from the deepest area, right next to the World Tree.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Tiera, Lina, always stay close to Shibaid. Kagerou, you assist Shibaid.”</p>
<p>Shin left the defense to Shibaid and went on the attack, with Schnee and Yuzuha.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, stay with Schnee.”</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>“Please”</p>
<p>“….kuu.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha was unhappy too, but after seeing Shin’s expression, she replied faintly and hopped on Schnee’s shoulder. Only Shin truly knew the extent of Reforgerer’s powers. It was the absolute strongest in THE NEW GATE: even Element Tails or Ishkar could not compare.</p>
<p>During the past battle against Reforgerer, only two of Rokuten’s six members survived. Shin was not one of them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 4 Part 1</p>
<p>“It’s starting to take shape.”</p>
<p>Shin was looking at the erupting light as it gathered and started to solidify. When it reached its complete form, Reforgerer would be born.</p>
<p>“If we can defeat the demon before it becomes the Divine Beast, we don’t even have to fight it, right?”</p>
<p>“I think it might work… From what I remember, it appeared and started rampaging immediately.”</p>
<p>Time had passed since Shin and the others first saw the pillar of light. In the game era footage he had seen, Reforgerer had appeared less than a minute after the pillar manifested, so he couldn’t deny the possibility of what Tiera said being true. However, it would be extremely difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>“There’s a cluster of presences. Let’s go there first.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group advanced straight into the holy area, heading towards the presences he had detected. As expected, he found Lymliss and the elf guards escorting her. They noticed Shin’s group approaching them but did not appear to recognize Shin’s group, as they had their weapons in hand, ready for battle.</p>
<p>Yuzuha and Kagerou were in their original forms — although Yuzuha’s was not complete —, so their large bodies and high levels would surely be intimidating. The guards probably noticed that Shin and the others were riding the beasts, but they couldn’t afford not being wary.</p>
<p>“We are not enemies!”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke on behalf of the group. Thanks to the authority of the priestess’ words, the elven warriors were reassured and put down their weapons.</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera, a light appeared from the World Tree…and I feel an unpleasant presence too.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably the cause of all this. We came to protect the World Tree…and we need the power of purification. It will be dangerous, but we need your help.”</p>
<p>There was no time to explain in detail what was going on. Lymliss, however, understood that the situation was truly dire, so she nodded with a stiff expression on her face. Despite the abnormal phenomenon, the World Tree was still alive. Lymliss could feel it too.</p>
<p>Some elves objected, saying it was too dangerous for her to go, but Lymliss convinced them saying that, if she didn’t go now, there would be no point in her being a priestess anymore, so they did not try to stop her.</p>
<p>Though the elite guards knew they could never fulfill the priestess’s critical role, they were experienced warriors and couldn’t help but feel restless before the appalling fear of the pillar of light.</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do?”</p>
<p>“Schnee, Yuzuha, and I will deal with the monster that will come pouring out. Meanwhile, I want you to purify the World Tree and get rid of as much impurity as possible. You might encounter demons, so Shibaid will go with you.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will protect them, even if it costs my life.”</p>
<p>Shin was giving orders instead of Schnee, but no one interjected.</p>
<p>He had already removed all 【Limiter】 restrictions to be ready whenever Reforgerer appeared. The elite elves understood, through their instincts, rather than reason, who was the most powerful person present.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of making the residents in the area evacuate, but with the situation as it is…”</p>
<p>Fighting among elves had broken out throughout the city. It was impossible to make people evacuate in a situation like that. Reforgerer’s attack power also made it meaningless to just go a little farther away.</p>
<p>“If we take care of the cause, the manipulated people should turn back to normal.”</p>
<p>“I really hope they do.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group headed towards the World Tree, together with Lymliss and the elven elites. The gradually shaping light was relatively far from the World Tree. The reason was unknown, but it worked in their favor. After entrusting Lymliss to Shibaid, Shin, Schnee, and Yuzuha headed towards the light.</p>
<p>“Are we too late?”</p>
<p>Shin saw the light before them glow stronger. Then, as it quickly disappeared, a giant figure replaced it, exactly as he remembered.</p>
<p>—— Guardian Divine Beast – Reforgerer</p>
<p>【Analyze】 displayed Reforgerer’s data. The lack of a level display and the “Guardian” title before its name matched Shin’s memories.</p>
<p>In the same location as Reforgerer, Crissot’s presence appeared as well. As expected, he was the reason for the divine beast’s appearance. He might have become one with the divine beast or possessed by it, but, in any case, he was a very dangerous existence.</p>
<p>Reforgerer did not immediately start moving, so there was still some leeway for observation. Its head was covered by a smooth silver carapace, only showing its large mouth lined with snaggleteeth, clearly unsuited for eating. Its body was covered by a rough dark green, almost black, colored skin accompanied by two robust arms and an even more massive set of legs.</p>
<p>Its tail, about as long as its body, was also covered in the same armored hide and appeared very flexible. The tip, about 10 mel long, was covered in an extremely sturdy-looking shell. The guardian also had crystal-like minerals growing from its back, which it could use to fire searing hot beams.</p>
<p>Once Reforgerer received a certain amount of damage, the crystals would turn into rainbow-colored wings, which could also restore its HP and were very sturdy to boot. A player armed with a large sledgehammer had tried to smash them to prevent the monster from restoring its HP, but was blown back without even managing to crack them, or so Shin remembered.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit smaller than normal?”</p>
<p>“That might not be its complete form. Based on what you told us, it was not summoned in a legitimate way.”</p>
<p>“Kuu! There’s a mix of miasma in its aura!”</p>
<p>The monster before them was clearly smaller than what Shin remembered. Looking at it from the side, Shin also noticed that its back was not lined with as many crystals as he recalled, they were missing here and there.</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s observation also corroborated Schnee’s hypothesis. A sort of black aura enveloped the monster, one it did not have before: miasma. It might be the reason why Reforgerer had not moved yet.</p>
<p>“Hm? That’s…”</p>
<p>Reforgerer was not moving, but there were monsters sticking to its arms: a large shelled spider with a human-like upper body and a horse-like beast with two tiger heads.</p>
<p>As 【Analyze】 showed, they were both demons.</p>
<p>Shin wondered what they were trying to do, when Reforgerer finally moved. It started closing its paws, clutching the demons. They both tried breath attacks or blowing strings to resist, but Reforgerer’s scales repelled everything.</p>
<p>“If he still retains his feelings as a parent, it won’t leave any demons alive, as they could target priestesses…I guess.”</p>
<p>The demons were crushed to death in the divine beast’s paws, with a squelch-like sound. They were probably Crissot’s former allies.</p>
<p>We’d be lucky if it’s weaker than normal, since it was summoned in an irregular way… so thought Shin, but it did not look like his hopes would come true. As he considered starting the offensive, he felt a horrifying chill down his spine. Reforgerer’s gaze had turned towards them.</p>
<p>Shin could tell. The eyeless Reforgerer was looking right at them.</p>
<p>“Behind me, all of you!!”</p>
<p>Shin noticed a faint bluish-white glow seep out of Reforgerer’s closed mouth and stood in front of Schnee and Yuzuha before thinking. Shibaid did the same, shouting as he stood in front of the group. They prepared the『Great Shell Shield of Collision』, activated a defensive barrier and another protection skill.</p>
<p>Reforgerer’s beam struck as soon as the double protection was set up. The transparent white beam of light filled the distance between them instantly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18393 jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ShinAndShibaid.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1"></p>
<p>The double barriers created by Shin and Shibaid provided a small delay to the beam before shattering.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s smaller, it’s as strong as before!?”</p>
<p>“What incredible power…!”</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid shouted as they held the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』 against the beam. The beam was wider than the shield, but it was Ancient-grade gear: it managed to scatter the beam and prevent it from hitting those behind the shield.</p>
<p>However, as a blacksmith, Shin could tell that the shield’s endurance was gradually decreasing. The 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』 had been powered up since the game era, but it still wasn’t enough. If the elves were targeted, they wouldn’t be able to defend themselves.</p>
<p>“What in the world…”</p>
<p>“How can you fight with such a monster…?”</p>
<p>Thanks to Shin and Shibaid’s defense, the whole group was unscathed. However, the scattered heat and pressure of the beam caused explosions wherever it landed. Although weakened, the beam’s damage was enough to dispel any optimistic outlook of the situation.</p>
<p>The elven warriors were especially surprised, as the weakened blasts were more than enough to blow whole houses away. Some of them lost the will to fight because of the overwhelming power of Reforgerer’s beams.</p>
<p>“Kuu, its attacks are mixed with miasma too!”</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid were too focused on parrying the beam to notice, but Yuzuha, behind them, could tell. Miasma had been released together with the beam, as if enveloping it. Considering that the miasma might be boosting the beam’s power, it might be even more dangerous than the game era’s Reforgerer.</p>
<p>“This position is bad. It shouldn’t be able to fire beams like that often. I’ll draw its attention while going to the other side! Tiera, you guys, go to the World Tree!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted so that Schnee and the rest could hear. With Lanapacea behind them, they couldn’t simply dodge the monster’s attacks. If they let the beams through, the whole country would turn into a sea of flames. In the worst-case scenario, it might even hit the World Tree. They definitely could not fight it there.</p>
<p>Shin thought that the most effective strategy at present was for Tiera and the other priestesses to purify the World Tree while they acted as decoys.</p>
<p>The beam started weakening and vanished after about one minute. The ground in front and around them had changed completely. Behind them, the ground remained intact. Before, the ground was demolished and completely liquified, even boiling here and there.</p>
<p>“I’m going ahead!! Shibaid, I leave Tiera to you!!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>Shin kicked the ground and leaped high in the air, Shibaid’s reply trailing behind him. The melting ground shattered and scattered. He could now freely travel through the air, so he jumped as high as Reforgerer’s eye level and headed straight towards its head. The guardian’s head moved to follow his movements.</p>
<p>“You can see, can’t you.”</p>
<p>In the game era, he never had the luxury to observe it in detail. As the players scattered to avoid its beams, he never felt the guardian’s eyes on him so clearly.</p>
<p>“There’s more than Crissot’s will at play here.”</p>
<p>The beam would have struck down Tiera too, if Shin and Shibaid didn’t block it. Crissot’s will to protect Tiera was possibly mixed with the demon’s will to slaughter humans and Reforgerer’s original will to attack humanity.</p>
<p>“Whoa!?”</p>
<p>A black shadow darted into the edge of Shin’s field of view. He quickly sidestepped and the large mass flew by. It was a Reforgerer’s tail, as fast as whiplash and much more powerful than a hammer.</p>
<p>In the past it was enough to crush any “tank” player, without a chance to block it. Scouts or rear guard players would be killed instantly if it just brushed by them.</p>
<p>He was worried about Schnee and the others, but the equipment he gave them was reinforced as much as possible. At the very least, they shouldn’t be killed instantly.</p>
<p>“I’m not the same as last time we fought!!”</p>
<p>Shin’s grip on 『Moonless』 tightened as he closed in on the monster. Before, approaching Reforgerer was a feat in itself. Aside from its gigantic frame, the divine beast was also extremely fast. Its movement was not too quick, but its arms and tail moved as if they were separated from its body.</p>
<p>Without any restrictions on his movements, Shin could avoid them in the three-dimensional plane, easily slipping up close to the beast. His target was its neck, as tall and as large as a building.</p>
<p>Shin knew well about Reforgerer’s healing capabilities. However, it was still a living creature. If its neck was cut off, it couldn’t move again so quickly.</p>
<p>Shin’s 『Moonless』 emitted a grinding sound. Shin’s powerful grip, without【Limiter】, was making it wail. Even so, Shin did not relax his arms. He could not hold anything back against this opponent: he knew that, in the worst case, he would throw away the weapon.</p>
<p>The light shining on the tip of his blade was as blazing hot as Reforgerer’s beam. Stone or flesh, living or not, he would cut through it all. With such strong conviction in his heart, Shin activated a skill.</p>
<p>Katana and Flame combination skill 【Shiden – Blaze Divide】</p>
<p>A white-hot slash arced in the air, as if it could cut the very atmosphere. The blade sliced through the scales and cut the monster’s flesh. But, it was not deep enough to slice the monster’s neck. The technique was powerful enough, as it cut open a much wider slice than the arc drawn by 『Moonless』. Even then, it only managed to sever about one-third of Reforgerer’s neck.</p>
<p>The guardian’s beast’s scales were very sturdy, but its flesh was extremely tough as well, so Shin’s slash did not go as deep as he expected.</p>
<p>Shin had unleashed the skill aiming to cut cleanly through the guardian’s neck: if the opponent wasn’t Reforgerer, the slash would have surely reached as far as the forest in the distance.</p>
<p>“You’re seriously tough.”</p>
<p>The response Shin felt through 『Moonless』 was the heaviest he had ever felt. He managed to draw the blade out, but, if he didn’t give it his all, it may have remained stuck in the monster’s flesh. Many players had lost their weapons in such a way.</p>
<p>“But I can still cut you.”</p>
<p>Shin managed to damage Reforgerer more than their previous encounter. In the past, he needed multiple attacks just to destroy the scales, so he felt more confident in his ability to fight it. Such confidence, however, created an opening.</p>
<p>“Shin!! Above you!!”</p>
<p>Shin heard Schnee’s almost shrieking voice and looked upwards. He was located close to Reforgerer’s neck, so above him there would be…its head, naturally. Its mouth, ready to fire another searing hot beam. Blue and white lights leaked from Reforgerer’s mouth.</p>
<p>Shin was right next to the divine beast’s neck, so he was not in danger of being hit, but he knew that without Schnee or anyone telling him.</p>
<p>Claws came from the right and the tail from the left, centering on Shin’s position. If he was caught between them, he didn’t know what would become of him, even as he was now. If he jumped away, however, he might end up in the beam’s course.</p>
<p>Shin thus decided to jump diagonally forward. If he slipped by next to its neck, he would not risk being hit by any attack.</p>
<p>“Shit…!!”</p>
<p>Shin planned to stick next to the monster’s neck and climb it. If he reached its back, he risked being hit by the crystals’ beams this time. Because he knew that, his response was delayed.</p>
<p>Beam attacks from the mouth and back, claw and tail attacks. Shin focused too much on them and neglected to consider attacks from other sources.</p>
<p>The scales covering Reforgerer’s body started glowing in unison. The power and heat were low, but it was undoubtedly a beam attack. Thanks to his high stats and defensive gear, Shin did not receive any damage.</p>
<p>But, that was not the problem.</p>
<p>Shin had gained the ability to move freely in midair, but in the end he always leapt: he could not float or fly. He could parry attacks from above, but could not stay in place while being attacked from other directions.</p>
<p>Shin quickly shot a fireball in the direction he was blown to, using the explosion’s shockwave as a buffer, to prevent Reforgerer from putting more distance between them. His position was just outside the range of the guardian’s beams.</p>
<p>I can dodge them here.</p>
<p>So thought Shin, an instant before his field of view was engulfed in white light.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 4 Part 2</p>
<p>As Shin’s group started fighting Reforgerer, the group led by Shibaid headed towards the World Tree. No one intended to go help them. Looking at the scale of the battle, they understood that any support they could provide would be a hindrance instead.</p>
<p>Their current location was also still inside the attack range of Reforgerer’s tail. If they attracted the divine beast’s attention, its tail would pound them like a hammer. Tiera moved as quickly as possible, knowing that their best way to help Shin was for all the priestesses to reach the World Tree as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“We will be okay…right?”</p>
<p>“Without a shred of a doubt. We could block its most powerful attack with the shield. There is no need for concern.”</p>
<p>Shibaid replied calmly to Tiera’s doubt. She had seen the beam blocked before her eyes. What Shibaid said was definitely true.</p>
<p>(And yet…)</p>
<p>Everyone in the group had seen Reforgerer’s massive body and the power of its beam, as well as Shin blocking it. Only Tiera was slightly different.</p>
<p>Until now, she had encountered Grand Duke demons and even one of the most powerful monsters in the world, Ishkar, all opponents much, much stronger than her. Because of that, she had the leeway to observe the shield defending them from the beam.</p>
<p>(It’s melted a little. If someone takes the full brunt of that attack…)</p>
<p>The image of Shin disappearing within Reforgerer’s white blast of light appeared in her head, which she desperately tried to shake away.</p>
<p>The shield’s surface was melted and deformed here and there. Shibaid probably realized it too, but there was no time to fix it, nor anyone capable of doing so.</p>
<p>Even an Ancient-grade shield tempered and reinforced by Shin was not indestructible.</p>
<p>Shields were designed to protect the wielder, being more resilient and sturdy than offensive weapons.</p>
<p>It was very rare for weapons crafted by Shin to break. The only instance she could remember was during the battle with Girard, but that was a weapon with less endurance than a shield.</p>
<p>(We have to do something quickly, to end this battle as soon as possible!)</p>
<p>Tiera hurried with a renewed conviction in her heart.</p>
<p>“We cannot lower our pace. Follow us if you can keep up.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we must. Everyone, run as fast as you can!!”</p>
<p>Next to Tiera, looking straight ahead, Shibaid and Ordoss called to the others. Tiera looked back and saw that the number of guards with them had decreased.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“We’re going too fast for them. Tiera, your stats increased a lot, so I guess you didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>“That’s….”</p>
<p>Tiera was surprised and found herself at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Tiera knew the warrior chiefs as elites among the elite in Lanapacea. She knew that she had grown stronger during her travels, but she believed they would still be superior.</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera, you have grown much stronger indeed.”</p>
<p>Ordoss was running next to her, but he was short on breath. Tiera’s wasn’t though. She could still go faster.</p>
<p>“It might be thanks to your gear too. Everyone, the World Tree is near! Give it your all!!”</p>
<p>Tiera’s group had taken a detour to reach the World Tree, in order to avoid being involved in the battle between Shin and Reforgerer. Even if they were separated, they wouldn’t be too far.</p>
<p>After a while, Tiera reached the base of the World Tree. They discovered that the tree had turned to a pitch black color. About 70, 80% of the World Tree was completely black: it was barely alive. Tiera called out to Lymliss and Lina, riding on Kagerou.</p>
<p>“The condition is horrible…but it’s still alive! Lend me your strength, both of you!!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Both priestesses had a very stern expression on their faces. However, they did not show the slightest sign of giving up. They jumped down from Kagerou, stood side to side with Tiera and spread their arms in front of them, closing their eyes to focus.</p>
<p>“This is…!”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s surprised voice reached Tiera’s ears, but there was no time to ask about it. Tiera calmed her spirit and focused on the tiny light deep within her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if it was really a light. She focused on the tiny, faint, yet powerful existence that resided within her from as long as she could remember, and enlarged it inside her.</p>
<p>The light eventually filled her body and overflowed. She directed it in front of her.</p>
<p>Tiera’s eyes were closed, but she could clearly see the presence of the World Tree and the impurity that was corrupting it. She released her light towards the turbid aura that enveloped the World Tree. It was a special kind of purification, different from the one used with miasma, exclusively performed for the World Tree.</p>
<p>Tiera could see that two similar lights flowed to the World Tree from her sides. Hers was a pale emerald green, Lina’s was yellow mixed with orange, and Lymliss’ transparent blue.</p>
<p>As each light touched the impurity, it gradually disappeared as if melting away. However, because of Reforgerer’s appearance, the purification was different than usual.</p>
<p>“Aah…”</p>
<p>After about a minute, a pained whisper escaped Lymliss’ lips. She was sweating profusely, despite the temperature not being high at all. Lina, on the other hand, did not emit a sound, but her light was trembling. It was a signal that there was something wrong with the priestess releasing it.</p>
<p>Tiera wondered what could have happened to them, when a horrifying sight suddenly appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a battlefield: people slashed by swords, people impaled by lances, people scorched by magic, people devoured by monsters. Various kinds of death appeared one after the other before her eyes, and she could also feel their pain.</p>
<p>The pain itself was probably less than what would actually be felt in such a situation, but being forced to experience dozens, hundreds of different kinds of pain would be simply excruciating, even if it was not actual physical pain.</p>
<p>(I see, so that’s how it is.)</p>
<p>The two priestesses next to her were suffering because of this. Tiera was experiencing the same pain, but could somehow keep her cool. Unlike the other priestesses, always protected by guards in the village, she had been chased by monsters, lost people dear to her, and risked her life, without a shred of hope supporting her.</p>
<p>After joining with Shin and the others she had encountered powerful foes many times and had witnessed battlefields of people and monsters. Thanks to those experiences, she knew that the pain and suffering she was experiencing now were nothing but illusions.</p>
<p>“These are all illusions created by the impurity!! Get a hold of yourselves!!”</p>
<p>Tiera’s voice echoes forcefully. As if called by it, several globes of light appear around her. Their shapes changed and took an elf-like form. Some of them were known, others were not. The only thing they did know was that they were all World Tree priestesses.</p>
<p>Floating in the air, they surrounded each of the 3 priestesses. Light began flowing from their bodies, enveloping Tiera, Lymliss, and Lina.</p>
<p>“I’m okay now. I can do it!!”</p>
<p>“I have to be useful. It’s now or never!!”</p>
<p>Lymliss drew a deep breath, Lina firmly focused again, then they loudly shouted together. The priestesses’ lights probably dispelled the illusions tormenting them. Their light of purification regained its original strength.</p>
<p>Tiera then felt something warm on her shoulder. There was no physical sensation, but she could tell there was a warm hand holding her. Somehow, she felt she knew that sensation from before.</p>
<p>“Allow me to use your power!”</p>
<p>It was not the right time to think about that: Tiera focused anew on the purification. Something warm seeped inside Tiera from the hand on her shoulder. It was a purification force, but different from Tiera’s or the other two priestesses’.</p>
<p>The past World Tree priestesses, who had become spirits and could not purify the World Tree directly, did so through the bodies of the three priestesses physically present. The powers to protect the World Tree, to protect the world, to protect all people became one.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 4 Part 3</p>
<p>“Shin!?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay!!”</p>
<p>Shin managed to switch to the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』just before the beam struck. It was one of the remaining functions from the game, weapon swap. The beam was weaker than expected as he was blown away, but received no damage. Shin replied to Schnee and Yuzuha’s worried calls, then stood back up. He had been hit in midair, so he had crashed into the ground.</p>
<p>Shin looked at his surroundings and understood what Reforgerer had done. The ground was scorched in a ripple-like pattern, with Shin at the center. The attack range was wider than the regular beam, but he should have been buried deeper into the ground and burned by the higher temperature having been struck from such a close distance. Shin’s location was also outside the usual beam’s scope.</p>
<p>“Less power, more range, huh.”</p>
<p>Such an attack did not exist in the game era. The range was too wide and therefore difficult to avoid. The sole disadvantage was that it lacked power.</p>
<p>The shield’s durability had barely decreased, so Shin realized that the defensive gear he had equipped should be enough to resist it.</p>
<p>“If I get too close, claws and tail…if I stay far, beam attacks, In a 360° range to boot.”</p>
<p>Shin tried talking casually to make the situation seem less dire, but it didn’t work very well. Since the guardian could have other unknown attack patterns, it was difficult to go on the offensive. Reforgerer’s attacks were usually lethal.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I should be thankful that he’s only targeting me…not that I know why.”</p>
<p>Schnee and Yuzuha attacked Reforgerer to gain its attention, but the divine beast was focused on Shin. At first, he thought it was because Shin was the first to attack, but it kept attacking Shin even after Schnee and Yuzuha started attacking.</p>
<p>Was it because he was the strongest among them? Or maybe because of the force Yuzuha mentioned. Or some other reason. However, there were other things to do before thinking about this.</p>
<p>Shin stood back up and Reforgerer’s tail came down to strike him. It was like a whole skyscraper coming down on him. Compared to the beams, it was easy to deal with. For players, fighting against larger opponents was fairly common. After all, bosses were often gigantic monsters.</p>
<p>Shin kept the shield pointed upwards, holding it diagonally. The moment the tail struck, he swung his arm upwards and activated a skill.</p>
<p>Shield-type Martial skill 【Shock Glide】</p>
<p>It was a variation of the skill that allowed the user to counter enemy attacks, a so-called parry, powered up for large size monsters. The tail, aiming to crush Shin into the ground, slid along the shield and was directed up as if it were only natural.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t get your neck, but what about your tail?”</p>
<p>Reforgerer’s tail gradually grew thinner towards the tip. Shin couldn’t sever the divine beast’s neck, as it was protected by both scales and robust muscle fibers, but the tail was different.</p>
<p>While the tail was packed with muscles, they were thinner and less resilient than those in the neck, because they needed to maintain flexibility. Shin readied his blade targeting the tail, full of openings now that it missed its mark. He made full use of his unfettered stats as he jumped high in the air and swung down with 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>Katana/Water combination skill 【Still Water】.</p>
<p>Following the slash, the tail was enveloped in blue light. The next instant, with a clear, sharp sound, a 10 mel portion of the tip of the tail was cut off and danced in midair.</p>
<p>“Okay, I can cu—-”</p>
<p>Reforgerer’s rage for this wound made it roar. Shin was ready to follow-up, but a very worrying crack-like sound reached his ears. At the same time, he felt a slight vibration run through his right hand.</p>
<p>Shin looked down to his right. There he saw 『Moonless』 with a crack in the center of its blade. Part of the blade was missing, and cracks spread through it like shattering ice.</p>
<p>“Seriously!? I just cut it twice…!”</p>
<p>The katana’s remaining durability was just 20%. Shin estimated that it was not damaged by the monster’s scales or flesh, but by his own power. He could see the cracks spread as he continued to grip it.</p>
<p>His blacksmith skills could tell him what happened: the magic power he imbued into the blade when using skills exceeded the weapon’s limits.</p>
<p>“…will I run out of weapons first, or will Tiera complete the purification first…?”</p>
<p>Even an Ancient-grade weapon could only do so much. A Mythology-grade weapon would not even withstand one strike. Shin was prepared to sacrifice his weapons, but did not expect them to be consumed so quickly.</p>
<p>He mentally recounted his available weapons, then looked at Reforgerer. It wasn’t attacking because Schnee and Yuzuha were giving their all to keep it occupied.</p>
<p>“Even their attacks won’t prove lethal for this beast.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s 『Blue Moon』 slashed the scales and the flesh under them, Yuzuha’s claws and magic spread the wounds. They had hardly ever fought together before this, but their attack and defense were seamlessly coordinated. Even so, the damage they caused to Reforgerer was minimal.</p>
<p>Reforgerer’s HP was incredibly high, so no matter how much it was damaged, it was hard to tell if it could really be defeated.</p>
<p>Can we defeat it? Shin asked himself.</p>
<p>A pointless question, he answered.</p>
<p>I’ll cut off its neck first. If that doesn’t work, I’ll crush its heart. If it doesn’t die even with that, I’ll keep attacking it until it does, or seal it. There’s a lot of things I haven’t tried yet. I can’t die until I have tested them all, nor will I let anyone else die.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I last fought like this.”</p>
<p>With his conviction renewed, Shin browsed through his item box and materialized new weapons.</p>
<p>An enormous battle axe appeared on his left hand, a longsword on his right. The battle axe was not the regular single-sided or double-sided blade type: its single-sided blade extended along with the handle, to protect the wielder’s grip. Being as tall as Shin, it looked like a fusion between an axe and a broadsword. A yellow, almost golden aura surrounded the blade.</p>
<p>The longsword on his right hand was a simple double-edged weapon without decorations. The blade was painted in black and blue, with a reddish-black streak running along the center. This sword was enveloped in a very dark red and blue aura.</p>
<p>Shin’s left hand wielded the “Thundersteel Axe”, 『Keravnos』.</p>
<p>His right hand held the sword “Cursed Storm”, 『Stormbringer』 .</p>
<p>Both of them were superior Ancient-grade weapons. The usage of two different weapons at the same time was one of the battle styles Shin developed in THE NEW GATE in order to survive.</p>
<p>“Using all sorts of weapons, one after the other, that’s how a blacksmith fights!”</p>
<p>After shouting something that all blacksmiths in this world would vehemently disagree with, Shin ran forward, holding 『Keravnos』 and 『Stormbringer』 like spreading wings, heading straight towards Reforgerer.</p>
<p>Thanks to Schnee’s and Yuzuha’s attacks, the guardian’s attention was drawn away from Shin. He concealed himself with 【Hiding】 and approached the monster.</p>
<p>“Here goes nothing!”</p>
<p>Using his running momentum, Shin swung 『Keravnos』.</p>
<p>Lights flashed, and a moment later, thunder roared.</p>
<p>Axe-type Martial skill 【Core Breaker】.</p>
<p>It was a skill that created large openings, so it could not be used often, but it ignored enemy defenses and, paired with an axe’s normally very high offensive power, was powerful enough to blow away monsters many times the size of the wielder.</p>
<p>What would happen if the current Shin used it? As an answer to this question, Reforgerer’s massive, robust right leg was carved for more than half of its width and disappeared.</p>
<p>In exchange,the tip of 『Keravnos』’ blade cracked and shattered.</p>
<p>Shin quickly turned it into a card and put it away, then kicked the ground. Reforgerer, having lost most of its right foot under the ankle, lost its balance.</p>
<p>Shin twisted his body in midair, targeting Reforgerer’s head with 『Stormbringer』. The longsword emitted grinding sounds because of Shin’s powerful grip. Focused fully on his target, Shin did not notice that 『Stormbringer』’s blade was wrapped in a bright purple aura.</p>
<p>“Take thiiiissss!!!”</p>
<p>Shin thrust 『Stormbringer』 with as much strength as he could. He was still far from Reforgerer’s head, but an enormous half-transparent blade extended from 『Stormbringer』, quickly filling the distance.</p>
<p>Sword-type Martial skill 【Shiden – Dimension】</p>
<p>This skill ignored enemy defense. It could be used only with a thrusting motion and created a blade of magic from the tip of the wielder’s weapon. Its strongest characteristic was that the blade of magic could extend. The blade grew thinner as it stretched, so at its limits it was only a few cemel wide, but it was still enough to target the opponent’s head or heart.</p>
<p>It was a physical attack with a magic blade, so it could damage even frontline warriors. Because of this, in a certain period the bizarre combo of “sword snipers” was fairly popular in the game. Because of this, management “nerfed” the skill, making it unable to damage units other than the target and making it less damaging the more distance there was between the caster and the target. In the current situation, with the opponent coming closer to Shin on their own, there was no problem.</p>
<p>Shin’s target was Reforgerer’s throat, the spot he damaged with 【Blaze Divide】. Shiden-caused wounds healed slowly, so the gash was not fully closed yet.</p>
<p>The blade wrapped in purple sparkles of light did not fail: it stabbed the wound on Reforgerer’s throat and pierced through its flesh, boosted by the skill’s power, Shin’s muscular strength — supported by the ground — and the monster’s own weight.</p>
<p>The blade’s width depended on the user’s stats. Shin’s 【Dimension】 blade was much wider than what it was during the game era, because of his reinforced stats.</p>
<p>It would be plenty for him if it was three times the size of the blade, but it stretched as far as ten times the original width.</p>
<p>“Your head…is mine…!!!”</p>
<p>Shin felt it as 『Stormbringer』 pierced the center of Reforgerer’s throat and swung it to the side. Normally, the blade would break if it was forced to do such a sweep. The sword wrapped in light, however, showed a sturdiness that 【Dimension】 normally did not have. Slowly but surely, the blade cut through Reforgerer’s neck.</p>
<p>However, the divine beast would not sit still.</p>
<p>Above the half severed neck, the monster’s mouth opened. A flash of light then formed Reforgerer’s searing beam. Even with its throat slashed, it could apparently still fire.</p>
<p>“(Shin!?)”</p>
<p>Schnee and Yuzuha’s voices overlapped. Shin, still holding 『Stormbringer』 high, had no way of dodging. The beam reached Shin, but split in a ripple-like shape before hitting him, scorching the ground.</p>
<p>Shin, holding 『Stormbringer』 with one hand, used the other to quickly materialize the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>He managed to deflect the beam with the shield, but the 【Dimension】 blade shattered. He could not protect the blade extending from his hands to Reforgerer’s neck with the shield.</p>
<p>As the beam vanished, Reforgerer’s claws struck. After all, it was a monster through and through. Even with most of its neck cut off, it continued attacking.</p>
<p>“Tch!”</p>
<p>Shin clicked his tongue and jumped away. He turned『Stormbringer』, only a handle after its blade shattered, back into a card and materialized a lance glowing in gold and a large katana with an emerald hue.</p>
<p>The “Divine Lance” 『Gungnir』 in his left hand and the “Cleaving Blade” 『Murakumo』 in his right. It was a festival of Ancient-grade weapons.</p>
<p>“(Schnee! Yuzuha! Act while I’m drawing its attention!)”</p>
<p>Shin called them via Mind Chat, then launched 『Murakumo』 towards Reforgerer’s neck, holding back some of his strength so as not to break it.</p>
<p>It’s still looking at me. This confidence prompted Shin to attempt the shot. 『Murakumo』, flying boosted by a skill, was knocked away before it could reach the scales covering Reforgerer’s head. The shock, however, pushed the monster’s head back, enlarging its wound. Then, Reforgerer’s body touched the ground.</p>
<p>With a heavy, dull sound, the ground shook. Reforgerer was solely focused on attacking, with no regards for defending itself.</p>
<p>“Here comes the big one!!”</p>
<p>Shin had jumped just before the monster came crashing down, so he was not affected by the tremors. He readied 『Gungnir』, calmly targeting the divine beast’s wounds. Ignoring the grinding sounds coming from the handle, Shin activated a skill.</p>
<p>Spear-type Martial skill 【Flying Circle Thrust】.</p>
<p>『Gungnir』 would always strike its target when thrown, but, thanks to the skill, its aura shone even brighter. Collapsed on the ground, Reforgerer had no way to defend itself.</p>
<p>『Gungnir』 flew straight and true.</p>
<p>Even in such a situation, the monster moved. It shot the wide-range beam, the same attack that had surprised Shin earlier. Its power was reduced, so it could not destroy 『Gungnir』. The weapon’s aim, however, was deflected.</p>
<p>『Gungnir』 was supposed to strike the remaining part connecting Reforgerer’s head to its body, but passed through the already severed section, finally impaling the ground, blowing away a huge chunk of the surrounding terrain. The remaining flesh on Reforgerer’s neck had just been brushed against: about 10% of it remained.</p>
<p>The strategy to cut off that remaining 10% had already been prepared.</p>
<p>Something cast a shadow over the collapsed Reforgerer. It was Schnee, glowing in gold thanks to Yuzuha’s assistance, wielding 『Murakumo』 veiled in a light purple hue.</p>
<p>Schnee activated a skill, adding it to Shin’s power lingering within 『Murakumo』.</p>
<p>Katana-type Martial skill 【Shiden – Heaven Slash】.</p>
<p>The coup de grace. If it connected, the monster’s neck would be completely severed. Reforgerer still would not give up. Its massive tail flew towards Schnee.</p>
<p>“Not a chance!!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, in giant form, created magic from her tails and used it in a mass to repel and blow away the monster’s tail. She was clearly regaining her original strength.</p>
<p>They were completely out of range of beam attacks. The monster’s claws would not reach, its tail was knocked away. Reforgerer’s defenses were finally spent.</p>
<p>“This is the end!!”</p>

<p>Schnee’s tone was brimming with conviction. The blade she swung severed Reforgerer’s neck completely. The slash’s shockwaves carved deep into the ground, transmitting the high power of the skill.</p>
<p>Reforgerer’s head rolled away on the ground, as strength clearly abandoned its torso. They couldn’t let their guard down yet since its HP was still not zero.</p>
<p>“What’s going on now?”</p>
<p>The torso remained the same, but the monster’s head was changing shape. It turned into a sort of mist, then took human form. Using 【Analyze】 showed not Reforgerer’s name, but Crissot’s.</p>
<p>“Aah…Tie…ra….Tie…ra….”</p>
<p>Before Shin, still armed, Crissot whispered such words before vanishing without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>“He teleported…? It can’t be that…he went where Tiera and the others are?”</p>
<p>Shin did not know how he did it, but he could only think of one place where Crissot might have gone. Sure enough, moments after the disappearance Shin and his group received a Mind Chat from Shibaid. Crissot had suddenly appeared before them.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Chapter 4 Part 4</p>
<p>“Father…”</p>
<p>It all happened so suddenly.</p>
<p>Crissot appeared before Tiera and the other priestesses purifying the World Tree and extended a thin rope made of mist towards her. At the last moment, Shibaid managed to stand between them, but the rope was much stronger than it seemed. Because his stance wasn’t ideal, Shibaid was knocked away.</p>
<p>“I suppose Shin and the others did it.”</p>
<p>Shibaid spoke while holding up his shield. Tiera had noticed too. Reforgerer’s gigantic body could be seen from the holy area, but it was nowhere in sight anymore. They thought it was defeated, but the World Tree priestess Tiera knew Reforgerer hadn’t disappeared yet.</p>
<p>She could feel something close to its powerful presence right in front of her.</p>
<p>“Lina, Lymliss, please continue with the purification.”</p>
<p>“Lady Tiera, that’s…”</p>
<p>Lina replied to Tiera, but the latter did not notice. Lymliss had heard her words: she looked at Tiera, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“This is something I must put an end to.”</p>
<p>She was about to do something reckless. Tiera herself knew it. She might even end up ruining the efforts of Shin’s group. There might be a safer way.</p>
<p>But, she felt it. That Crissot’s soul, her father’s soul, was right there.</p>
<p>She could not sense her father’s soul when Reforgerer was still active, but now she clearly could tell. His presence was the reason why it had appeared here, and that he was not trying to attack.</p>
<p>“Tiera, what are you…?”</p>
<p>Shibaid was focused on Crissot, but looked at Tiera with bewilderment, standing beside him.</p>
<p>She knew the reason. Her figure was probably different from normal. When Crissot appeared, she felt something descending inside her. She had experienced it many times when she lived in the village, it was quite a nostalgic sensation.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Please leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Tiera stepped forward, beyond Shibaid’s shield. Crissot did not attack in the meantime.</p>
<p>“Aah…aah…”</p>
<p>Crissot reacted to Tiera stepping forward with a sort of pained, or very emotional, lament. From his eyes, marked by trails of blood, now flowed transparent tears.</p>
<p>“So this is spirit channeling…”</p>
<p>Tiera could hear Shibaid’s comment. She put her hands forward and saw someone else’s hands overlapping hers. Lymliss and Shibaid were probably surprised by them.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it.”</p>
<p>They weren’t someone else’s, a stranger’s hands. She could tell. She had a premonition. The features of the elf Shin and Lina saw matched with someone Tiera knew. Her whole body was filled with a nostalgic sensation. Tiera knew that warmth very well.</p>
<p>She approached Crissot, slowly. As she did, mist rose from Crissot’s body, melting away like steam. Tiera knew: it was miasma. As the miasma vanished, Crissot’s body started to change. His figure, identical to how he looked when still alive, started to shrivel.</p>
<p>It was a natural change, as what kept Crissot alive was disappearing. When Tiera was in front of him, half of Crissot’s body turned into a mummy.</p>
<p>“Father.”</p>
<p>Tiera softly embraced her father’s pitiful figure. The miasma’s presence was no more.</p>
<p>“I am here, I am alive. Your daughter lives on, strongly.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s feelings mixed with those of the woman enveloping her and turned into words. Tiera did not actually know what to say. She could understand Crissot’s pain, but she could not feel it. At the time, she was doing all she could to survive and did not have the leeway of thinking of her father’s feelings.</p>
<p>She gained some peace after she was in Tsuki no Hokora, but she unconsciously put away the painful memories of her village. Thus she now responded to the emotions transmitted by Crissot.</p>
<p>About how she was rescued by Schnee and stayed at Tsuki no Hokora. How she met Shin and her curse was lifted. How she met all sorts of people and visited many places. Tiera talked about an adventure she could have never experienced, had she stayed in the village.</p>
<p>Crissot’s arms moved. Thin arms that could break at any moment embraced Tiera in return.</p>
<p>“Aaah…I’m so glad….”</p>
<p>His words trailing in the air, Crissot disappeared. The wind moving through Tiera’s hair brought the ashed Crissot dissolved into the sky. The wind circled the World Tree once, then vanished in the air. Crissot was no more. It had all happened in mere moments.</p>
<p>The emotions Crissot transmitted were all born from concern about Tiera. There was nothing about himself. It seemed like the hate towards the world he shouted about during his first battle against Shin never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>“Was this…alright?”</p>
<p>The question was not directed to Shin or another party member, nor to a priestess like Lymliss, but to the silver-haired woman who appeared after Crissot vanished.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Irene, Crissot’s wife, Tiera’s mother, embraced her daughter, silently. She had no physical body, but Tiera could feel her embrace all the same. Even without words, she could feel her emotions. Sadness for not being able to protect her. Pain for not being able to save her. Anger towards their absurd circumstances. They all lingered within her, even after death.</p>
<p>Those were not all that lingered, however.</p>
<p>Tiera’s growth, the smile she showed her, the fact that she saved Crissot, filled her with happiness and love. Her emotions not as priestess, but as mother, passed into and filled Tiera’s heart.</p>
<p>“Mother…”</p>
<p>Tiera’s voice trembled. She held back, she could not cry. This time, this dialogue, was a miracle that would never come again.</p>
<p>World Priestesses are the guardians of the World Tree and the bonds between people. The cornerstones of peace. There was something that not even Shin and his companions knew, however. That priestess was not allowed to use their powers for themselves.</p>
<p>Priestesses with the ability to speak with the deceased — barring certain exceptions — were not allowed to willingly summon their parents, siblings, or anyone close to them. Because of that, this was the only chance Tiera had to express her feelings. Once it was over, she could not do it anymore.</p>
<p>Because of that, Tiera smiled. She did not want the last expression her mother would see to be a crying one. She wanted her mother to remember her smiling.</p>
<p>“Be healthy and strong, my beloved daughter…”</p>
<p>Irene left these words as she disappeared. She turned into a small, flickering light and joined the other lights that appeared, to be absorbed once again in the World Tree.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>“So, is it all over?”</p>
<p>Shin whispered while looking at the fading lights. He had left Reforgerer’s body to Schnee and Yuzuha and had moved first. When he arrived, Tiera was already embracing Crissot. He saw that Shibaid was not interfering, so he decided to wait as well.</p>
<p>Just in case, he checked the presences in the city via his map, but could not find any moving in a way that suggested there was fighting going on.</p>
<p>“Reforgerer has disappeared, so I believe we can say so.”</p>
<p>Shin heard Schnee’s words from behind him and used 【Through Sight】 to look in the direction where Reforgerer was. Its icon was on the map no more, leaving only a large crater where it had collapsed, but not even the smallest scale. It was clearly completely gone.</p>
<p>Shin looked again at Tiera, who had not moved a step and was completely still.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Losing to the silent pressure coming from Schnee and Shibaid’s gazes, Shin eventually called Tiera. Lymliss and Lina also noticed, but found it hard to approach her.</p>
<p>“Shin…”</p>
<p>Tiera turned towards Shin. She had held back her tears for long: they were now gleaming on her eyes. Tiera let herself go, as if falling on Shin’s body.</p>
<p>“Did I..do good enough…?”</p>
<p>“….they were both smiling. You did for sure.”</p>
<p>Her voice trembled. Shin replied to her question with confidence.</p>
<p>Both Crissot and Irene showed a peaceful smile in the end. Looking at their expressions, no one would think she had failed.</p>
<p>“I see…I see…”</p>
<p>Her voice trembled even more.</p>
<p>You don’t have to hold back anymore. So Shin wanted to express as he lightly embraced Tiera and patted her head. Tiera’s body turned stiff for a moment, then she started to weep loudly.</p>
<p>The World Tree watched over the group, silently.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 15 Side Story</p>
<p>This is a tale from the time when the girl did not yet know about the absurdities of our world and lived every day in happiness and bliss.</p>
<p>The tale of how she met the partner she would meet again years later.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>“Who is this?”</p>
<p>Someone was calling me.</p>
<p>Some people would not react, but the young child did. Her golden eyes glanced about, her silver pigtails fluttering about.</p>
<p>The little girl was in the woods when it happened. Normally, it wasn’t proper for a small child to play in such a place, but for the young elf, it was like home. It was an environment where normal people could easily get lost, but she was very familiar with it.</p>
<p>“Hm? Hmmm??”</p>
<p>The little girl put her hands on her long ears and closed her eyes. She could hear the rustling of the trees and her fairy friends whisper and murmur. Among such noise, she also heard a faint whimper which made her worry. Eventually, the little girl’s ears shook.</p>
<p>“Over there!”</p>
<p>She ran off, confident. The tall grass made it hard to see, but she hopped lightly over it, her pace even gaining speed. What she eagerly reached was what the adults called a “barrier”. If she but stepped over it, armed adults would come running with scary looks on their faces.</p>
<p>It wasn’t actually easy to cross the barrier, but the little girl’s priestess abilities allowed her to pass it easily. She had sneaked out once and was scolded very harshly. Remembering this, her pace slowed down a little.</p>
<p>The little girl advanced, careful not to step over the barrier’s bounds. Soon enough, she spotted a ball of fur near a tree.</p>
<p>“….?”</p>
<p>The little girl tilted her head, curious about the shuddering little thing. It didn’t look alive and smelled funny too. Gotta get closer to check. The little girl’s childish innocence made her waddle forward.</p>
<p>“It’s a doggie!!”</p>
<p>There she found a puppy-like animal. It was small enough for her to be able to carry it, about the size of a newborn puppy. If you were bad, you couldn’t enter the barrier: the little girl thus decided that there was no danger.</p>
<p>“Oh no! You’re hurt!”</p>
<p>The funny smell was a mix of blood and feral odors. The little tomboy often got hurt during her romps, much to the adults’ worry. Because of this, she knew that the red thing was not good. Without a concern for her clothes getting dirty, the little girl picked up the small animal.</p>
<p>A wild beast would surely resist if a stranger did such a thing out of the blue: the puppy, however, did not. The little girl did not know that she could expect such a reaction. In the end, she ran back with the puppy in her arms, as fast as she could.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>When she arrived at home, a big commotion started. First of all, the gate guards screamed when they saw the little girl dirty with the puppy’s blood. They promptly informed her parents, who yelled too.</p>
<p>She had run back quickly, so the puppy’s blood was smeared on her clothes, leading them to believe that she was hurt too. The adults then noticed that she was carrying an unknown monster, leading to more yelling and confusion among the guards.</p>
<p>Indeed, what the little girl had found was not a puppy, but a monster. Small, but an unknown monster nonetheless. No matter how much the little girl plead, the guards could not let a monster inside the residence.</p>
<p>They could not resist for long the little girl’s tearful prayers of letting the creature in, so they were truly at a loss about what to do.</p>
<p>While they were not connected by blood, the little girl was like a daughter for them. They wanted her to grow up healthy and often felt saved by her innocent smiles. If she started hating them, looking the other way every time they met, they would definitely suffer heavy emotional damage.</p>
<p>“Don’t be difficult now. Can’t be helped, I’ll take a look at it, so go change.”</p>
<p>The mother’s words offered salvation to the guards. Looking at the mother consoling her child, they looked more like sisters with some age difference than mother and child.</p>
<p>“Lady Irene said that, but…will you really cure it?”</p>
<p>So asked one of the guards. Irene was the name of the little girl’s mother.</p>
<p>The question was asked to the little girl’s father, the Lucent clan’s head, Crissot. The little girl was the only daughter of the Lucent clan, Tiera.</p>
<p>“If it crossed the barrier, it means that it bears no hostile will. It is also true that we do not know its true identity. I am sorry for Tiera, but if we find out it is dangerous, we will have to get rid of it.”</p>
<p>Crissot’s expression was grave. The kindness to heal those in need the little girl showed should be respected. Both the father and the guards knew about Tiera’s kind feelings. Even if it was weak, however, a monster was still a monster. Its sharp fangs could easily tear a child’s throat.</p>
<p>Crissot ordered one of the guards to stay at Tiera’s side, with the pretext of observing how the recovery proceeded.</p>
<p>“You’re all better now!”</p>
<p>What were the adults worried about? Next to the monster, which barely managed to recover from a very bad condition, Tiera was smiling gleefully.</p>

<p>Irene’s healing skills were renowned in Tiera’s hometown of Lanapacea. They worked admirably on the small monster of unknown origin too, as evidenced by how calmly it slept.</p>
<p>“You’re all better now? That’s it? Don’t surprise mommy like that anymore, okay?”</p>
<p>“But mommy, it was hurt!”</p>
<p>“You should have called mommy first, then. This is probably a wolf or a similar monster. Even if it’s small, it’s very dangerous. Sometimes they attack anyone that comes closer.”</p>
<p>Irene talked slowly, to make sure Tiera understood.</p>
<p>“Next time, call mommy or daddy first. If you don’t, no snacks for a week. Am I clear?”</p>
<p>“Whaat? You’re turrible…!”</p>
<p>Tiera didn’t try to hide her dissatisfaction. It might be too light a punishment, but it was difficult to teach a child how dangerous monsters could be. Especially in this case: the wounded monster was a child as well. It looked small and lovely. Even if it was said to be dangerous, it wasn’t very convincing.</p>
<p>“Am-I-clear?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes!”</p>
<p>Irene’s smile gained intimidation and Tiera nodded while backing away. She knew well that she shouldn’t oppose her mother when she was like this.</p>
<p>“Good kid. Lyla prepared the snack, so go and have some. I’ll watch over the puppy.”</p>
<p>“Okay!!”</p>
<p>“No running! That kid is always in a rush…”</p>
<p>Irene looked at her daughter run off in search of snacks and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m here, Growlie!”</p>
<p>A few days after Tiera picked up the monster pup, “Growlie,” as she called it, was completely recovered and became her playtime partner. They looked just like a little girl playing with her puppy. No one would think that Growlie was a monster after seeing how affectionate it was with Tiera.</p>
<p>“Nothing new yet?”</p>
<p>“The elders say they have never seen anything of the sort, not even the Tamers had a clue. Some of them tried to tame it, but they all failed.”</p>
<p>Crissot and a subordinate talked while looking at the smiling Tiera. They were looking down at the square where she was playing from the 2nd floor of the residence, so she could not hear their conversation.</p>
<p>“A monster that cannot be tamed…might it because of level difference?”</p>
<p>Some monsters had levels superior to people even from a young age. That could be a reason why taming failed.</p>
<p>“No, its level is only 10. I doubt that is the cause.”</p>
<p>The subordinate added that, looking at the monster puppy playing with Tiera, it did not look like it had any outstanding abilities. Tiera’s physical abilities were about the same as a normal child: she could not keep up with a monster, even a young one, when running around or playing tag.</p>
<p>“That wolf puppy is special, then.”</p>
<p>Crissot looked at the puppy with a stern expression. It was clearly not a normal beast, but a monster. Its identity, however, was still unknown.</p>
<p>“To think that not even a level V 【Analyze】 works…”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow we will have lady Acheame perform 【Analyze】 secretly. If even that doesn’t work, we don’t know what else to do.”</p>
<p>The bearer of the highest level Analyze in Lanapacea would observe the monster puppy. If the monster’s name was revealed, they would also know how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>If it was the puppy of a species Crissot and the others could not handle, in the worst case they would have to kill it. Even if it had grown attached to Tiera, it was always a wild monster. No one knew when it could bare its fangs towards Tiera. They were letting them play now just because Irene casted several defensive skills on Tiera.</p>
<p>Crissot and the others knew that it did not possess clear hostility or ill will, since it crossed the barrier, but it did not mean that it was absolutely innocuous.</p>
<p>“I hope it turns out it’s just a rare monster.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>They didn’t want to cloud Tiera’s innocent smile. Crissot and the others were more concerned about that than the monster’s identity.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>“So this is the monster little Tiera picked up?”</p>
<p>The next day, the lady called Acheame, the only elf in Lanapacea with Analyze VIII, visited the residence. She was born before the Dusk of Majesty and was the oldest member of the Lapanacea village. Other than her long ears, she looked just like an elderly human.</p>
<p>Since she knew the heads of all clans since they were children, she also knew about many embarrassing episodes of their past. She was a woman to be feared, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>“Yep, he’s Growlie!”</p>
<p>“My my, what a lovely name…it’s not under a contract, it seems.”</p>
<p>Acheame looked at the puppy Tiera was holding and whispered to herself from her bed.</p>
<p>She had already been informed that Tiera supposedly heard the puppy’s voice, so she suspected that it could have formed a partnership contract. It would explain why the other elves could not tame it.</p>
<p>“You said you heard its voice, right? What did it say?”</p>
<p>Many things could change based on that. Acheame looked intently at Tiera.</p>
<p>“Um, it said, someone help me.”</p>
<p>“It asked for help, I see…It didn’t call your name, did it now?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Tiera nodded and Acheame looked at the puppy again. Her eyesight was poor because of her age, but maybe to counterbalance it, her analyze skills only improved. She could thus see the puppy’s name.</p>
<p>“It’s all recovered now, I see. No need to worry.”</p>
<p>“Really? Yay!!”</p>
<p>Crissot told Tiera to bring the puppy to Acheame to make sure its wounds were really recovered. Tiera, overjoyed, was dancing around with the puppy in her arms, but it did not bark, howl or squirm. Its eyes, however, kept looking at Acheame.</p>
<p>“I must speak with lady Acheame. Tiera, and Irene go back first.”</p>
<p>“Okay! Lady Acheame, thank you!”</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome, come visit again.”</p>
<p>The gleeful Tiera and Irene exited the room, leaving Crissot and Acheame alone.</p>
<p>“Could you learn anything?”</p>
<p>“Easy now. You are the Lucent clan’s head. Stay calm and listen, even if you’re worried about your pretty daughter..”</p>
<p>Crissot spoke as soon as the door closed, so Acheame urged him to settle down.</p>
<p>“E-even if you say so…”</p>
<p>“As restless as usual, aren’t you. Listen well then, that’s not a normal monster. It’s the child of a divine beast.”</p>
<p>“A divine beast…?”</p>
<p>Some considered them messengers of the gods, while others regarded them as deities themselves.</p>
<p>“Its name is Gruefago. As far as I know, it’s harmless unless provoked. But the fact that a wounded puppy entered the village gives me a bad feeling. Even divine beast parents don’t abandon their children. Either the parent died or it got lost and ended up here.”</p>
<p>“The barrier has no effect on divine beasts?”</p>
<p>“Divine beasts are special, my boy. Unless they attack or are hostile, they can pass through it. It was probably attracted by Tiera this time.”</p>
<p>Acheame closed her eyes and talked. Some divine beasts had the role of preserving the world’s balance. Tiera’s priestess talents could have attracted the wounded Gruefago.</p>
<p>“Should we leave them be? If it grows, won’t it become too strong for us to handle?”</p>
<p>“It surely will. Before the Dusk of Majesty, many powerful warriors were beaten by divine beasts. In that era, there were incredible people who even made a sport of hunting down divine beasts, but such warriors are no more. Even before that little one grows, if the parents misunderstand and think it was kidnapped, the damage and casualties would be enormous… we are always near the World Tree, however. Even the parents would hesitate a bit. Besides, many divine beasts have intellect superior to our species. I doubt they would attack all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>“If they have a reason to, however…”</p>
<p>It was not under anyone’s control. If someone attacked it, out of fear, the retaliation could be tragic. As a clan head, Crissot had to consider this possibility. Divine beasts were even capable of causing natural catastrophes at times.</p>
<p>“….could we possibly make it become a guardian beast for priestesses?”</p>
<p>Crissot turned silent for a few moments, then spoke again.</p>
<p>A priestess protected by a divine beast. For someone who knew how important priestesses were, there was no better reassurance. In this world, there were many monsters that people could not handle. Dangers were few in the village, but still not zero.</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you spouting? It’s impossible if you can’t form a contract. The royals wouldn’t keep quiet either. They have elves like me, born before the Dusk of Majesty. If they learn that an uncontracted divine beast is roaming freely in the village, the relationship between the royal house and the caretaker clans will go to the pits. They’re going to send an extermination platoon, with Mythology-grade weapons to boot.”</p>
<p>Acheame rejected Crissot’s proposal outright. Few of those born after the Dusk of Majesty knew personally how powerful divine beasts were. Some of the royals did, however. Elves lived long lives, so some of them knew how to kill divine beasts and had the necessary equipment. Their strength was far above the warrior chiefs of the Lucent or other clans.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for Tiera, but the only way is to let it go out, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that is the only way…will it work out, however? Tiera is still young, so her memories of the divine beast will be hazy at best, but I fear it won’t be so easy for the divine beast itself…”</p>
<p>Very few people, Tiera included, knew about the divine beast. If she forgot, there was no risk of rumors spreading. If no one knew about the divine beast, there was no risk of anyone fearing it or trying to use it.</p>
<p>Mental manipulation skills were considered taboo, but Acheame could at most confuse a child’s recent memories, and it only worked with very small children. She could modify their perception to remember things only vaguely. It was a skill that only Acheame, born before the Dusk of Majesty, had; very few knew about it.</p>
<p>The problem was if it could work on the Gruefago puppy. It would be perfect if it forgot about Tiera and Lanapacea, but if it didn’t it might come back. While it was a puppy, they could force it out again, but once it grew up it would be harder to hide it and it would definitely create a commotion. It might also see the elves that keep throwing it out as enemies.</p>
<p>“All we can do is talk with it. That divine beast puppy understands our language, you know. It doesn’t go off on its own or hurt anyone, right? It learned from your conversations that it shouldn’t. It was studying me the whole time it was here too. It looks small, but it is still a divine beast. You better not think it’s some puppy. Well, thanks to that, it’s possible to talk with it.”</p>
<p>Acheame talked, with her years of experience as basis, to the worried Crissot. She said that if it was possible to forget, that would be the best, though.</p>
<p>The wolf puppy was attached to Tiera, but Acheame’s ability could make her forget. If the puppy had human-like intellect, it would understand that she forgot about it.</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s better to act quickly. You should talk with it without Tiera around—oh well, this is a surprise. You were listening.”</p>
<p>“You were listening…?….Oh gods.”</p>
<p>Crissot turned after Acheame talked. From the door left slightly ajar, the divine beast Gruefago, who should have left with Tiera, entered the room.</p>
<p>“Apologies. If you have to resent someone, resent me.”</p>
<p>The wolf puppy stared at Acheame in the same way as when Tiera carried it out, growled faintly, then left again. Crissot and Acheame could hear Tiera’s voice calling for its name.</p>
<p>“Did it…understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s really smart. It probably understood it couldn’t stay here too long.”</p>
<p>Acheame felt that its growl was tinged with sadness. Even so, they couldn’t let it stay there. The age when people and divine beasts could coexist based only on a relationship of trust was long gone.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>Thus it was decided to release the wolf puppy into the wild. A certain problem arose, however.</p>
<p>“No!!”</p>
<p>“Tiera, we aren’t doing this because we’re mean. It’s for his sake too.”</p>
<p>“I said noo!!!”</p>
<p>Obviously, Tiera was vehemently against it.</p>
<p>Maybe because of their longevity, elves did not produce many children. Because of this, Tiera had very few peers of the same age. On top of that, she was the only daughter of a World Tree caretaker clan. She also had the potential to be a priestess, reducing even more the number of children her age who spoke to her normally.</p>
<p>Only the child of the caretaker clan Luderia and children of families of relatively high rank did. Even so, they couldn’t just play together easily. For Tiera, the presence of the wolf puppy, which would always play with her, was extremely important.</p>
<p>As Acheame said, the puppy was very intelligent: it would quickly understand once it was told what could be done and what couldn’t. It never protested when it was bathed, its fur was fluffy and clean. Lyla and the other servant elves often saw Tiera take her afternoon naps using the puppy as a pillow.</p>
<p>That’s how close they were. She would never simply accept being separated. It was natural that she would whine and complain.</p>
<p>“Growlie didn’t do anything bad! I’m taking good care of him!!”</p>
<p>Tiera protested, her eyes brimming with tears. It was true that she took care of the puppy’s feed and baths and even cleaned the bucket used for its excretions without being prompted to. She didn’t just play with it: she took proper care of it, as much as a child could.</p>
<p>“That’s…daddy knows that, but…”</p>
<p>Attracted by a pet’s cuteness, children sometimes proclaimed they would take care of it to keep it, but would do so only for a few times. Elves were no different: taking care of living creatures was difficult for a child. Tiera, however, never complained.</p>
<p>Irene had healed the puppy, but Tiera took care of everything else by herself, asking Lyla for advice when needed. That’s how invested she was.</p>
<p>We’ll be together forever. That’s what her childlike mind probably thought.</p>
<p>“No…I don’t wanna…”</p>
<p>Tiera started crying and Crissot did not know what to say anymore.</p>
<p>Both Tiera and the wolf puppy had committed no mistakes. This was all caused by adults worrying about “if” something happened.</p>
<p>There was the option of acting without saying anything to Tiera. She probably would not have cried in that case. The adults, however, were not as cruel as to do such a thing.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to say goodbye?”</p>
<p>Tiera continued standing in front of the wolf puppy, even while crying. Acheame approached her, using her walking stick as support.</p>
<p>“….no.”</p>
<p>“But you know, my dear, this puppy has parents too. They want to see him soon, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>A wolf puppy wounded, all on his own. Parents that did not come to look for it. Acheame, Crissot and the other adults did have an idea about what happened to them. Even so, they used the “parents” as an excuse.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be happy if you couldn’t see Crissot and Irene anymore, would you?”</p>
<p>“….no.”</p>
<p>She probably thought about the puppy, in her own way. Tiera wiped her tears, turned around and hugged the sitting puppy tightly. The puppy laid its head on her shoulders, as if to absorb her warmth. After a while, the little girl and the little wolf moved away from each other at the same time, as if they agreed on the timing.</p>
<p>“….bye bye.”</p>
<p>Tiera waved a little hand and said goodbye. Her eyes welled once again with tears, which slowly started streaming down her cheeks. The puppy wolf too howled a goodbye and turned its back to Tiera. It disappeared into the forest, without turning around even once.</p>
<p>The Gruefago left Lanapacea and Tiera, for the sake of the village, was conditioned to forget about it, leaving only fragments of memories in her heart.</p>
<p>The fated reunion of the girl and the wolf would come many years later.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 1 – Part 1</p>
<p>Shin was in Lanapacea, an elven village and Tiera’s hometown.</p>
<p>The World Tree located in the village, a pillar maintaining the world’s balance, was weakened and in danger.</p>
<p>Shin and his comrades attempted to heal the tree, but eventually discovered that its corruption was planned by Crissot, Tiera’s deceased father, who had fallen under the demons’ control. Furthermore, the Divine Beast Reforgerer, a being that could cause the world’s destruction, appeared too.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, Shin managed to defeat Reforgerer.</p>
<p>Crissot was freed from the demons’ control and his soul, after saying his farewell to Tiera, rose into the skies—.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s finally taken care of, so let’s handle the other issues too!”</p>
<p>Tiera, who had wept as she parted with Crissot and Irene’s souls, now showed a very relieved expression.</p>
<p>It looked a bit forced, as she was probably embarrassed for crying so much in front of other people. Shin thought that it wasn’t the tears which made her ears look so red now.</p>
<p>The demons nestled in Lanapacea half self-destructed while using Crissot to further their plans.</p>
<p>The other elves presumably under demonic control were no longer acting wild either.</p>
<p>Reforgerer also disappeared at the same time as Crissot’s body.</p>
<p>For the time being, the factors threatening the destruction of the village were gone.</p>
<p>Even if there were still demons nearby, there was no way of knowing at the moment.</p>
<p>“Is the World Tree okay?”</p>
<p>Shin looked up at the World Tree after he heard Tiera’s words.</p>
<p>The World Tree had absorbed the globes of light, representing Irene’s soul and possibly Crissot’s, and was now shining with holy light. There was no more trace of miasmic impurity. Shin just asked to be sure.</p>
<p>“For the time being. It looks like a huge amount of impurity has been spent to fight against you and the others. What I felt is that Reforgerer consumes great quantities of impurity just by existing. If not, even if it was fighting against you, Shin, it would be impossible for that unnatural amount of impurity to decrease so much.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re probably right. I can see that its strength was supported by massive amounts of energy.”</p>
<p>It was known that Reforgerer used impurity as an energy source, but Shin and the other players thought it used impurity to power up its attacks and body.</p>
<p>Shin thought that Tiera’s theory was probably more correct.</p>
<p>If Reforgerer was considered as a creature that consumed impurity in order to preserve the world’s balance, it was perfectly plausible.</p>
<p>“Well, regardless of the secrets to its powers, it’s not an opponent I want to face ever again…”</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself while looking at the cards of the Ancient-grade weapons rendered useless during the battle.</p>
<p>Shin could compete against Reforgerer only because the latter wasn’t in its complete form and Shin himself was powered up to levels far beyond his past self.</p>
<p>Without the “double stats” title, in particular, he wouldn’t have been able to cut the beast’s neck.</p>
<p>The casualties were just a few weapons.</p>
<p>Compared to the possibility of Schnee and the others being wounded, it was nothing. It was nothing, but—</p>
<p>“If it happens again, it’ll be really bad…”</p>
<p>Even if they did so through using Crissot, who belonged to a lineage of priestesses, the demons had successfully summoned Reforgerer nonetheless.</p>
<p>They knew of a way to do it. If they made preparations without Shin’s party knowing, no one could stop it.</p>
<p>They couldn’t rely completely on the mysterious power that Yuzuha mentioned, which supposedly led Shin to the World Tree when it was in danger.</p>
<p>They couldn’t say with confidence that it wouldn’t happen again. There was also no guarantee that a possible “next time” wouldn’t involve a fight against Reforgerer in its complete form.</p>
<p>Even in its incomplete form, four Ancient-grade weapons needed to be sacrificed. If it became complete, who knew what it would take to stop it.</p>
<p>Even if Shin was capable of forging Ancient-grade weapons, materials were limited. No matter how high his blacksmithing skill could be, weapons couldn’t be forged without materials.</p>
<p>“『True Moon』should be…”</p>
<p>“Still broken. If Sety pours her power in it, we should be able to go to the next step, though.”</p>
<p>As Shin had prioritized curing Schnee’s memory loss, he hadn’t asked Sety to pour her energy in 『True Moon』 yet.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what exactly would happen after she did, but Shin was sure that it operated in a different manner than the weapons he knew.</p>
<p>“ I guess we have to take care of the loose ends here first. The government is going to act, right? Though ever since we came here I haven’t noticed any action by them…”</p>
<p>“The demons probably ceased communication with the government or took control of the messenger. Otherwise the army surely would have responded to a situation like this.”</p>
<p>Some time had passed since the controlled elves started going wild.</p>
<p>At the very least, the government had to have noticed Reforgerer’s appearance.</p>
<p>There were military troops other than the warriors of the World Tree caretaker clans, so even if the emergency happened suddenly, it would be obvious for them to react somehow.</p>
<p>“They might have seen Shin’s battle against Reforgerer…”</p>
<p>Tiera sounded anxious.</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t know about Reforgerer, its massive size and the power of its beams were clear even at a distance. She was worried that they might classify Shin as a dangerous individual, as he took such a monster head-on.</p>
<p>“I went all out, after all…”</p>
<p>Shin had used Ancient-grade weapons and advanced skills without restraint. It was a battlefield that not even Chosen Ones would dare approach.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what kind of people there are in this country…if anything happens, can we use Schnee’s fame to somehow get away with it?”</p>
<p>Their most reliable asset at the moment was Schnee. They might be able to get away by overwhelming any opponent through force, but it was the very last resort.</p>
<p>“Shin is Schnee’s companion. She would never associate with someone who turns violent for no reason. He’s an elite warrior even among advanced Chosen Ones…if we put it like this, I believe they will respect us instead of getting any bizarre ideas.”</p>
<p>For the average person and Chosen Ones with only relatively high stats, advanced Chosen Ones — especially those on the level of Schnee and the others — were on a completely different planet.</p>
<p>Their strength levels were too different, so they had no means to even compare them, stated Shibaid.</p>
<p>“A battle of that magnitude just happened, though. Some might request for such powerful warriors to stay in the country.”</p>
<p>Shibaid then turned towards Ordoss and the others.</p>
<p>They had not seen everything, but they had seen enough to realize how out of the ordinary Shin was.</p>
<p>Especially if Ordoss, captain of the protectors, talked about Shin’s feats, the king or other related parties might ask for him to stay.</p>
<p>The same could be said for Lymliss and the priestesses.</p>
<p>There was no guarantee that the demons wouldn’t return, so they might request for Shin to be her personal guard, or maybe even husband.</p>
<p>“Indeed, we have witnessed Sir Shin and Lady Schnee’s strength firsthand. If they would choose to remain here, it would be truly reassuring for all of us. And among the government’s elites, who did not fight against that monster, there might be some who could resort to the means Sir Shibaid mentioned.”</p>
<p>Thanks to his long life experience, Ordoss correctly understood what Shibaid implied.</p>
<p>Even if Lanapacea’s elves were in charge of protecting the World Tree, not all of them were pure and honest, as the current incident clearly showed.</p>
<p>“Lady Schnee, however, never remains long in a single place. Sir Shin and his party are also adventurers who travel often to fulfill all sorts of requests. Keeping them here would be difficult. Additionally, I doubt that the army’s late start allowed them to witness the whole battle. Lady Schnee fought the monster in a more visible manner, so if we say that its defeat was at her hands, without mentioning Sir Shin’s exploits, the top brass will not be able to say much. Furthermore, at present there is no one among us capable of stopping Sir Shin.”</p>
<p>Ordoss did not simply deny it, but said it in a way to admonish the other warriors.</p>
<p>The warriors, while reacting in slightly different ways, all nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>In the end, as Ordoss said, if Shin’s party said they would leave, there was no one that could stop them. The warriors had seen why with their own eyes.</p>
<p>“In any case, I believe that calming down the people’s discontent is our first priority.”</p>
<p>“Let us go together until we reach the residence, then. Even if the demons are gone, their influence might not disappear so quickly.”</p>
<p>“I could not ask you to do that….no, I see. If the situation was like before, Lady Lymliss and Lady Lina would be in danger too. My deepest apologies for the trouble, but please lend us your strength for a while longer.”</p>
<p>Ordoss bowed and the other warriors also kneeled and lowered their heads. If the warriors and the priestesses showed themselves in town, everyone would believe that the fighting was over.</p>
<p>“Let us go, then.”</p>
<p>The warriors formed a circle, with Shin’s group at the center, and started walking. Lymliss and Lina were able to speak, but they were physically spent, so they were riding on Kagerou.</p>
<p>Shin used his map and detection skills to make sure there weren’t any presences still rampaging in the city.</p>
<p>He couldn’t directly see the scanned locations, so he couldn’t be completely sure, but that was all he could do at the moment. As a result, he didn’t find any dangerous-looking presences.</p>
<p>The closer they went to the town, the more elves not belonging to the warrior class increased.</p>
<p>Everyone looked concerned: they were not panicking, probably because they saw Reforgerer collapse.</p>
<p>After all, the Divine Beast’s massive body could easily be seen as far as the city.</p>
<p>“ Sir Warrior Chief could you tell us exactly what happened?”</p>
<p>The elves looked at Shin’s group while maintaining a certain distance, but one of them eventually resolved to approach them.</p>
<p>“Did you see something in the direction we came from?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A monster as large as a mountain…is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Indeed…the demons summoned that monster. Thanks to Lady Schnee Raizar and our priestesses, however, it has been felled. Please rest easy.”</p>
<p>The warrior chief nodded heavily and the elf seemed relieved.</p>
<p>“People, listen to me! I am sure many of you saw the monsters appearing from the forest. However, there is no need for concern! The famous elf, Schnee Raizar, has graciously lent us her powers, and, together with our priestesses, dispatched all the monsters! Go inform those not present here that the situation has been resolved!”</p>
<p>Ordoss probably was considerate of the fact that Tiera was worried about Shin. He did not mention him as he proclaimed that the exploit was thanks to Schnee and the priestesses.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ordoss’ authority as warrior chief, all elves who listened to his words looked relieved.</p>
<p>If Shin had spoken instead, they would have just thought that a strange Human started rambling all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid were attracting a lot of attention, after all.</p>
<p>A Human and a Dragnil in a group of elves would surely stand out. The warriors did not say anything, however, so they probably did not think they were a threat.</p>
<p>At the very least, Shin did not feel any hostility or ill will from their gaze.</p>
<p>“We’re finally here.”</p>
<p>The group toured the city, with Ordoss proclaiming the situation was settled and Shin’s party attracting attention, a total of seven times. They were now finally in view of the Luderia residence.</p>
<p>Shin sighed, because being the target of the elves’ attention for so long was not exactly pleasant. Even if there was no hostility or malice, it was mentally taxing.</p>
<p>One of the elves standing guard at the gate saw the warriors approaching and ran inside the residence.</p>
<p>“Tiera!!”</p>
<p>“Lina!!”</p>
<p>Shin exhaled in relief as two elves rushed out of the residence, calling Tiera and Lina’s names.</p>
<p>They were Orlean and Herald: both of them had come to the residence. Since they were not wearing shoes, it was clear that they hurried outside as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Maybe because they saw that the two elves were safe, or maybe because they met Shin and the others’ eyes, they restrained themselves from running and bowed to Schnee.</p>
<p>“We have heard about what happened. We are deeply thankful for saving the village from the catastrophe our blunders have created.”</p>
<p>Ordoss apparently sent one of his subordinates ahead, as they already knew of Reforgerer’s defeat and the World Tree’s recovery.</p>
<p>Behind Orlean, Herald was bowing to Shin too.</p>
<p>“I am sure you are tired, but could you let us know what happened in detail?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is why we came here. I trust you are the representative, yes?”</p>
<p>“Yes. As…that kind of thing happened to the head of our clan, I am the temporary representative.”</p>
<p>Orlean was definitely conflicted about the situation, as he answered Schnee with a stern look on his face.</p>
<p>Staying in front of the gates would attract attention, so they entered the residence for the time being.</p>
<p>People had already been sent to the room used by the clan head to inspect it. Naturally, they were people trusted not to be under the demons’ influence.</p>
<p>“Can we see it too? In Bulk’s case there were traps, so it might be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“That’s true—could we send someone from our group to see it too? Since it was used by a demon, it is likely to contain traps or other devices.”</p>
<p>Shin whispered a suggestion and Schnee agreed, so she made a proposal to Orlean. The room used by the father who plotted within the church was trapped, as Shibaid had reported.</p>
<p>Schnee made the proposal herself because Orlean did not know that Shin was the party leader. Without knowing about him, most people would assume that Schnee was the leader of the group.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see. There might be something beyond our abilities to find, so we would be glad to have your cooperation.”</p>
<p>“I’m going, then. Since there might be miasma involved, can you come too, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Shin left the rest of the explanations to Schnee and headed to the room in question with Tiera. Orlean seemed a bit perplexed, but Schnee said it was fine to leave everything to them, so he raised no objections.</p>
<p>The elf that accompanied them to the room explained the circumstances to the elves who were inspecting the room.</p>
<p>“We haven’t found anything like that at the moment.”</p>
<p>Since the elves heard Shin was with Schnee Raizar, they did not treat him particularly coldly, and he could ask them what they had discovered.</p>
<p>Tiera’s face was well known throughout the village, so they reacted with a mixture of confusion, fear, and reverence.</p>
<p>Based on the elves’ average longevity, they probably knew or remembered Tiera’s exile. Their attitude towards her at the time showed through their reactions.</p>
<p>“It’s true that it doesn’t look like there’s anything like last time in this room…”</p>
<p>In Palmirack it was extremely obvious, but this time not at all.</p>
<p>The elves said they found a booby-trapped box, so Shin activated his trap detection skill. He then felt a reaction from behind a bookshelf.</p>
<p>“This is pretty classic.”</p>
<p>It was a pretty common spot for hiding a secret room. Removing the bookshelf, however, showed a completely normal wall, so it was well hidden.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, Shin found out that opening it normally would trigger a trap that would cause multiple level X status ailments.</p>
<p>Since many of them affected the mind, it was probably used to control anyone who noticed the device.</p>
<p>Even if Shin triggered it, however, it wouldn’t affect him. It wasn’t powerful enough to exceed a High Human’s resistance.</p>
<p>Shin deactivated the trap and part of the wall revealed an opening. Inside there was a book and a golden crystal.</p>
<p>“That’s…father’s diary…”</p>
<p>Tiera looked at the cover and seemed to suddenly recall what it was.</p>
<p>Since it might contain important information, they decided to check it after regrouping with Schnee and the others, then turned towards the golden crystal.</p>
<p>It was about the size of an adult’s fist, glowing brighter in the center and more faintly on the surface. The center was gold, while the surface tended to the color white.</p>
<p>If it was a mineral, Shin’s【Appraisal】could identify it, but it only showed unintelligible gibberish. It was like so-called buggy text.</p>
<p>“Let’s analyze it later, then.”</p>
<p>They continued to examine the room for traps, but did not find even hidden safes or storages.</p>
<p>Shin asked Tiera for confirmation, but she did not feel any miasma in the surroundings.</p>
<p>“Let’s pick them up and go back to the others.”</p>
<p>Shin touched the crystal to turn it into an item card, but then it happened.</p>
<p>“Gah!?”</p>
<p>His sight blurred, static rushed through his ears.</p>
<p>In the blur he could see skyscrapers and other buildings, crowded street crossings, a classroom filled with students attending a lecture, and then— Shin himself, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>—I can see.</p>
<p>The faces of his friends, of his beloved teachers, a house without him. His parents, slightly leaner than before. His younger siblings, grown older.</p>
<p>The changes brought in the time without him.</p>
<p>—I can hear.</p>
<p>The noise of the city, cars speeding by, voices calling my name. My mother’s voice, my little brother’s voice, my little sister’s voice, my friends’ voice.</p>
<p>Nostalgic sounds I can’t hear now.</p>
<p>—I can feel.</p>
<p>The barrier between the real world and the other world. An invisible wall.</p>
<p>A crevice that separated the worlds.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>

<p>“—nn!! Shin!! Shin, can you hear me!?”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>Shin’s conscience was brought back by force. He turned towards the warmth on his back and found Tiera.</p>
<p>“What’s gotten over you? You froze up all of a sudden…”</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing, just…the crystal’s response was strange, so I was thinking about it.”</p>
<p>Shin laughed, so Tiera would not worry.</p>
<p>What he saw, what he heard, what he felt. He couldn’t remember them clearly anymore, they disappeared from his memory like a dream after waking up.</p>
<p>Shin could still, however, feel some sort of pain lingering in his chest.</p>
<p>(When I touched this, something happened…I’m sure of it…)</p>
<p>The only thing he could remember is that something must have happened.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating feeling, but he thought it wasn’t the time to talk about it, as he turned the diary and crystal into item cards and placed them in his item box.</p>
<p>He then told the elves they would go and returned to Schnee and the others. They had already exchanged information, so they should be talking about future plans at this point.</p>
<p>“Did you find anything?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t analyze it yet, but we collected what was hidden.”</p>
<p>“May I listen too?”</p>
<p>Orlean interjected in Shin and Schnee’s conversation. Because of the place they were in, he couldn’t keep silent.</p>
<p>“We’ll tell you anything we discover. Without doing the analysis first, however, I can’t tell what we are going to find out.”</p>
<p>It was the honest truth. The crystal they found was different from anything Shin had seen before. He felt it wouldn’t go like his usual blacksmithing work.</p>
<p>“I believe it’s better if we look at this together, though, so let’s do it once we finish talking.”</p>
<p>Shin took out the diary and everyone focused on it.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Crissot’s diary. Tiera said there’s no mistake about it.”</p>
<p>Tiera nodded to Shin’s words too.</p>
<p>“Let’s read it together once we wrap up the conversation, then. We might learn about what actually happened.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Shin put away the diary for the time being and the conversation resumed.</p>
<p>“I talked about the battle against Reforgerer and the state of the World Tree. Apparently there were little to no casualties and damage in the city.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>The battle had happened in an ideal place, in a way. The enemies had been led away from the city, so Shin was relieved to hear the results.</p>
<p>“Then it all depends on how the Forest King moves.”</p>
<p>“Yes. They will quickly find out that we couldn’t solve the situation ourselves. Even if the High Elf Lady Schnee was a key factor, there will surely be some kind of interference.”</p>
<p>The priestesses, very special individuals, and the warriors protecting them. As Lanapacea itself was founded to protect the World Tree, its caretakers and the government’s top brass were on equal standing.</p>
<p>Because of this commotion, however, such a balance would crumble. That was how grave their failure was.</p>
<p>Not even Orlean and Herald said they could predict how the country would act.</p>
<p>“A messenger will surely come in the next few days. I believe they will ask you to relate what happened again, Lady Schnee.”</p>
<p>“That is not a problem. There are things we can do and things we cannot, though, I hope that is clear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we understand.”</p>
<p>Orlean bowed politely.</p>
<p>Behind Orlean, who thought that Schnee was the leader, Herald was showing a very awkward expression.</p>
<p>Based on when Shin brought Rina to the residence or the way they talked, he might have noticed that Shin and Schnee were not simply allies.</p>
<p>“Then we should take a look at the diary Shin and Tiera found.”</p>
<p>Both parties shared all the information they had, so the only thing remaining was to look at the diary. Shin took out the diary and gave it to Tiera.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“There might be painful things written in it, but I believe you should read it first, Tiera.”</p>
<p>Tiera hesitated a little, but after hearing Shin’s words she decided to take the diary and opened it.</p>
<p>For a while, only the sound of flipping pages could be heard in the room. Everyone kept as quiet as possible, in order not to disturb her.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>When Tiera reached a certain page, her expression contorted. A teardrop she couldn’t hold back ran down her cheek.</p>
<p>“….thank you.”</p>
<p>Tiera said so to Shin after reading the diary to the end.</p>
<p>He took the diary she gave back to him and opened it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was written in elven characters, which Shin couldn’t read, so he had Schnee read it in his stead.</p>
<p>It was impossible for all present to read it at the same time, so Schnee read it aloud.</p>
<p>The diary entries’ dates had no semblance of regularity: Crissot probably wrote only when he felt the need to.</p>
<p>Maybe there were previous diaries too: the first entry mentioned Tiera.</p>
<p>A father’s feelings of pride for her increasingly growing abilities as priestess, the resolve to protect her. Short sentences expressing such emotions.</p>
<p>After that, the diary mentioned the wife’s delicious cooking, the soldiers’ training showing results, Crissot being conflicted about Tiera’s fiance.</p>
<p>Topics that any father, from anywhere in the world, could have written about.</p>
<p>Both as father and as a guardian, Crissot was probably a good person. Any reader would have reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Such peaceful topics, however, came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>The following entry was written more than one month after the previous.</p>
<p>—What have we done to deserve this?</p>
<p>Everyone in the room realized what had to have happened in the period left blank.</p>
<p>Tiera had received the 【Cursed Gift】.</p>
<p>It was simply horrible after that. The period between entries grew longer and longer, the previously neat calligraphy grew rougher and rougher.</p>
<p>At that point, the diary lost much of its primary function.</p>
<p>Doubts concerning his priestess daughter and the curse she received.</p>
<p>Fear and anger towards the insults and humiliation reserved to the cursed, towards the horrible treatment his blameless daughter received.</p>
<p>Restlessness towards the increasing opinion that his daughter should be exiled.</p>
<p>Pain and sadness about not being to protect his daughter because of his position.</p>
<p>It was the scream Crissot couldn’t voice.</p>
<p>The letters were sometimes blurred, the pages wrinkled, showing clearly what Crissot must have felt at the time.</p>
<p>The last entry of the diary simply stated that his wife died.</p>
<p>Nothing else was written after that.</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>Shin and the others were silent for a while. The diary was short, its entries brief.</p>
<p>It was very heavy, however.</p>
<p>Especially in the latter half, it was like the words and letters themselves carried a curse.</p>
<p>“Mother did not die immediately after we separated. The people who were not in favor of my exile took her under their protection. But she was hurt where she was already mentally weak, so she did not live long after that, apparently.”</p>
<p>Tiera had learned this from former Lucent clan members. Shin thought that she surely did not want to talk about it.</p>
<p>“From the change in the entries, we can assume that Tiera receiving the 【Cursed Gift】 was the turning point. The timing seems too perfect, though. They were probably waiting for a chance since before.”</p>
<p>Shibaid calmly analyzed the situation.</p>
<p>Shin agreed with his view too.</p>
<p>“Do you think it could be on purpose?”</p>
<p>“I am not positive it was, but considering what happened with Reforgerer, I believe there is a possibility. It would involve a witch doctor, an enchanter, and a necromancer though.”</p>
<p>The witch doctor was a job specialized in debuffs, casting curses and lowering the target’s stats. Enchanter and necromancer did not specialize in them, but were similar jobs as well.</p>
<p>The problem was that Shin was not knowledgeable about any of those jobs.</p>
<p>He knew that curses and necromancy skills were to be wary of as a target, but he did not know much about the jobs themselves.</p>
<p>As they had similar styles, the alchemist Hecate probably knew about the enchanter job, as the summoner Cashmere did about the necromancer job, but they were impossible to contact now.</p>
<p>“Then it’s this thing’s turn.”</p>
<p>The diary told them little. After making a few hypotheses, Shin took out the golden crystal from his breast pocket.</p>
<p>“That’s…a crystal?”</p>
<p>“It looks like one, but it’s probably something different. We found this in Crissot’s room with the diary. I am pretty knowledgeable about high-rank materials, but I have never seen nor heard about something like this.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Orlean’s question.</p>
<p>Shin predicted the crystal-looking item was the key to summon Reforgerer.</p>
<p>“It’s just bizarre. It was hidden by a demon, but I can’t feel any miasma coming from it.”</p>
<p>Tiera explained while looking at the crystal. She couldn’t feel any miasma from the crystal or the diary either.</p>
<p>“The room was trapped, but there was barely any miasma in it.”</p>
<p>“Did the clan head usually work in that room?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s correct. The residence is large, however, and the head had access to all rooms. He could have had countless options to hide things.”</p>
<p>Schnee followed Shin’s words with a question, which Orlean answered with a clouded expression.</p>
<p>Even if they tried narrowing down to the most suspicious places in the clan head’s range of movement, it would be difficult if he could have access to the entire residence.</p>
<p>Orlean said that he would order the residence’s workers to inspect the locations where the head was often seen.</p>
<p>“Could you let us analyze the crystal? I do not know anyone more knowledgeable about materials than Shin. In case of necessity, we can also travel the continent to consult other specialists.”</p>
<p>“….if Lady Schnee says so, then I’m sure even the king will have no objections. If you find out anything, please let us know.”</p>
<p>After a short hesitation, Orlean nodded.</p>
<p>Schnee’s ability was proven and she received requests from all over the continent, often from royal families and lords. She could surely obtain any necessary support easily.</p>
<p>Shin thought that Orlean probably reached such a conclusion before agreeing. Things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly if the proposal came from him, surely.</p>
<p>“We will return to the residence for the time being, then. If we stay too long we might end up encountering someone from the army.”</p>
<p>Schnee said this after they agreed on the methods of future communication.</p>
<p>They checked the map for any movements that could suggest the army was on the move, but it wasn’t an infallible tactic. Shin’s party also needed time to discuss what to do next.</p>
<p>“Understood. If something comes up we will contact you.”</p>
<p>Orlean saw the group off, bowing to Schnee as he did often during the conversation, and Shin’s party left the Luderia residence.</p>
<p>Orlean seemed to want to speak with Tiera, but he didn’t forget himself to the point of saying it in that kind of atmosphere.</p>
<p>“I wonder when they’ll let us go…”</p>
<p>An audience with the king was probably inevitable.</p>
<p>They did defeat Reforgerer, but the commotion was not over yet.</p>
<p>Half of the warriors of the caretaker clan of the Luderia had turned hostile, if only temporarily. Even if the demons were gone, they couldn’t work just like they did before.</p>
<p>Not only Orlean’s Luderia clan, but also the Lulac clan was likely to be punished.</p>
<p>Since Schnee was on their side, the king would not ask anything outrageous, but it was hard to think that they would be let go just like that.</p>
<p>“It all depends on how they move.”</p>
<p>“It would be nice if it was like an extermination quest, defeat the monster and you’re done…”</p>
<p>Shin knew that there was no point in saying it, but he couldn’t help himself.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
 <p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 1 – Part 3</p>
<p>“The king is coming? He didn’t summon us, is he going to come here directly?”</p>
<p>The following morning after breakfast, they received a surprising message.</p>
<p>It was true that Orlean and the others knew that Shin’s party was staying at the former Lucent residence.</p>
<p>Orlean said that a messenger was likely to come, so they knew that they could not avoid meeting the king.</p>
<p>However, not even Shin would have predicted that the king would personally visit the residence.</p>
<p>“The king is waiting outside the residence. Can we let him inside?”</p>
<p>The elf who came to bring the message seemed shaken too.</p>
<p>Though he was a member of a caretaker clan, directly dealing with the country’s king was not an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>“Is there a room used for audiences or something similar?”</p>
<p>“There is a room for special guests, but…how many people are there in the king’s entourage?”</p>
<p>“Including the escorts, about 20.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot…”</p>
<p>It was not a room meant for discussing matters in secrecy, but it could not house that many people.</p>
<p>They couldn’t say that they had to limit the number of participants because they didn’t have a large enough room, so they decided to meet in the relatively large main hall.</p>
<p>Shin’s group entrusted the residence worker with the message and went ahead to the main hall. After a while, the worker accompanied a group of elves inside.</p>
<p>Leading the group was an elf clad in a gorgeous, robe-like garment. He held a golden staff in his right hand and wore a silver tiara. Both items were Mythology-grade.</p>
<p>Erdyne Lu – Level 255 – Pope</p>
<p>(Level maxed out, and his job is also the highest one in the cleric category. I guess he’s a Chosen One)</p>
<p>Level, equipment, job. Everything expressed how he wasn’t any ordinary elf.</p>
<p>Erdyne emanated an aura that Shin found similar to the kings he’d met in the past.</p>
<p>As should probably be expected, he carried the charisma of one who leads others.</p>
<p>“Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am Erdyne Lu, king of Lanapacea, and….”</p>
<p>Erdyne’s words then stopped.</p>
<p>He wasn’t looking towards Schnee, who was standing in front of the group as its leader, but towards Shin.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, is anything the matter?”</p>
<p>An old elf behind Erdyne spoke.</p>
<p>Erdyne, however, continued looking at Shin, as if there was something he had to confirm.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, he turned around to face his entourage.</p>
<p>“Padan, stay with me. Everyone else shall wait outside.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!?”</p>
<p>The escorts and the functionaries were shocked by the king’s words. It was clear that the king was speaking and acting differently than the Erdyne they knew.</p>
<p>“Did you not hear me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, however….”</p>
<p>The elves who were reluctant to agree, judging from their clothing, were probably civil functionaries. Shin could understand deciding that there was no need for an escort, but could not fathom why the king would tell all other functionaries to leave the room.</p>
<p>“Enough. You are making our saviour wait.”</p>
<p>The old elf was probably Padan. He was startled at first, but quickly recovered his composure.</p>
<p>Realizing that there was no point in further discussion, all elves other than the king and Padan left the room.</p>
<p>Shin’s party did not say anything either.</p>
<p>“Padan, soundproof.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Padan obeyed the king’s orders and cast a soundproof spell on the room.</p>
<p>Erdyne then turned again towards Shin’s group and kneeled down. The country’s king, Erdyne. Behind him, Padan kneeled too.</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>“Our humblest apologies for forcing you to act because of our blunders, o noble souls.”</p>
<p>Erdyne answered Schnee’s question without raising his head.</p>
<p>Shin, looking at him, suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>Erdyne and Padan were kneeling in a slightly different direction, facing towards Shin.</p>
<p>“A country’s king should not kneel so casually.”</p>
<p>“Before someone lauded and praised since the Dusk of Majesty, who some even called “God”, a king is of little importance.”</p>
<p>“God?”</p>
<p>Erdyne’s words made Schnee’s aura change. She often received requests from the top brass of many countries, but she was never treated as a god.</p>
<p>The king was not looking at her during the previous conversation either.</p>
<p>“To be able to bask in your presence once again is an indescribable honor, o Noble Shin.”</p>
<p>“Er, where have we met…?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the kneeling Erdyne and tried jogging his memory. Ever since he arrived in this world, he had visited various places. No matter how hard he thought, however, he did not recall ever meeting Erdyne.</p>
<p>The king would rarely, if ever, leave his country, after all.</p>
<p>“It happened before the Dusk of Majesty, so it is not strange for you not to remember.”</p>
<p>“Ah…wait…could it be that you know about my species…?”</p>
<p>“Among all High Humans, the esteemed members of Rokuten were widely known, both in name and appearance, after all. In this country, only I and Padan ever saw you.”</p>
<p>Shin looked at Padan, who nodded silently. He probably quickly regained his composure because he realized who Shin was.</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s how it is. Anyway, please stand up. As you can see with Schnee taking the position of party leader, I do not openly say I am a High Human. Besides, if you really know us from the past, you wouldn’t place such importance on things like that, right?”</p>
<p>In THE NEW GATE, Shin and the others were among the top league of players, but they never looked down on other players or NPCs.</p>
<p>“…if you graciously say so…”</p>
<p>While carefully looking at Schnee and the others’ expressions, Erdyne and Padan stood up.</p>
<p>Even if Shin himself said so, Schnee and the others might not share the same opinion. Even if they didn’t say anything, if they leaked their aura of intimidation just a little bit it would create a strong pressure.</p>
<p>Even if Erdyne was strong, by this world’s standards, and was equipped in precious gear, he wouldn’t be much different from the average citizen when compared to Schnee and the others.</p>
<p>Since Schnee and the others did not exude any such aura and simply stood there quietly, however, such worries were completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>“In any case, it would be a great help if you could consider our participation in this incident to be under Schnee’s leadership.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will speak of the truth to no one.”</p>
<p>If information about the return of a High Human went public, many countries would surely act to verify the truth of such information. In such a case, many would learn that Shibaid left his country or about the man often seen together with Schnee.</p>
<p>Consequently, they will learn of the adventurer who shared the same name as the High Human Shin.</p>
<p>Some already knew about Shin’s outstanding abilities, so they could make the connection.</p>
<p>It was possible that some had already reached this conclusion, but Shin had no intention of revealing his identity as a High Human all the same.</p>
<p>If Erdyne was willing to keep quiet about it, it would be the best thing they could hope for.</p>
<p>“I assume that since you asked about that, you have some business with us, yes?”</p>
<p>Even if the king approached the High Human Shin, if he used meeting Schnee as a pretext no one would suspect anything. Shin’s party would have an audience with him as if they would do with any other king, then be on their way.</p>
<p>There had to be a specific reason why the king did not choose this method.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it is not about something I wish you to do. There is something I must give back to you, Noble Shin.”</p>
<p>“Something…to give back to me?”</p>
<p>Shin had no idea about what Erdyne meant.</p>
<p>Ever since coming to this world, he had used up and thrown away some weapons, but there was no reason why Erdyne would give him back such things.</p>
<p>“Noble Shin, do you remember the Reforgerer which appeared before the Dusk of Majesty?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>Being blown away, shield and all, was not an experience that could be easily forgotten.</p>
<p>“I participated in that battle as well. Of course, if the players did not participate there would have been no chance of overcoming the situation.”</p>
<p>Other than the players, many NPCs also participated in the battle against Reforgerer. Erdyne was one of them, apparently.</p>
<p>“What I wish to give back to you is the blade part of a weapon Master Cook used in that battle. I would have never thought to see you today, so I did not bring it with me, however.”</p>
<p>“Cook’s weapon…? Now that I think about it, that time her weapon broke, so I fixed it…”</p>
<p>The battle against Reforgerer in the game era was completely a battle of attrition.</p>
<p>Cook was part of the group in charge of resurrecting the World Tree, but it did not mean that they only provided rear support.</p>
<p>From Reforgerer’s standpoint, they were trying to block its source of energy, making them an obstacle. They would naturally get targeted too.</p>
<p>Shin had gotten blown away while preventing Reforgerer from targeting them, but they did not come out of it unscathed. Cook’s weapon was broken because Shin’s group could not defend them in time, Cook and other elites stood in defense of their group.</p>
<p>As a result, Cook’s weapon was broken cleanly. Shin remembered that when he materialized the item card Cook gave him, only the handle of her special cooking knife remained.</p>
<p>As a weapon it belonged to the sword category, but cooking knives were used to assist in cooking. In battle it was inferior to others in the same grade: against a monster like Reforgerer, it was no mystery that it would break.</p>
<p>“We should have given it back to you sooner, but we did not have the means…”</p>
<p>“No, I had given up on the blade part, so I thank you for preserving it until now.”</p>
<p>Shin then bowed. In the game weapons often broke down, so he hadn’t given a second thought about the shattered blade part.</p>
<p>Erdyn and the others, however, kept it safely until now.</p>
<p>Their situation was different, of course, but as a blacksmith Shin felt that he owed them gratitude.</p>
<p>“Please, we have done nothing worthy of your gratitude. We have done research on it, after all.”</p>
<p>“Even so, I must thank you.”</p>
<p>Even if it was broken, the blade still belonged to an Ancient-grade weapon. It wasn’t strange to research to garner some information, replied Shin while laughing.</p>
<p>“I am relieved to hear that.”</p>
<p>The king said that they would have the blade delivered the next day and moved to the next topic.</p>
<p>“It’s about Lady Tiera…”</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent events, no one would doubt Tiera’s innocence and her strong purification powers.</p>
<p>Those who did not witness her feats might still doubt her, but Reforgerer’s massive body and the resurrection of the World Tree were visible as far as the royal residential district. There were also the other priestesses’ testimonies.</p>
<p>Erdyne also added that any elf of enough ability could see the number and quality of the spirits around Tiera.</p>
<p>It was clear that her strength had surpassed the realm of the average priestess.</p>
<p>Tiera’s abilities were originally superior to the average elf too.</p>
<p>In this world, it was both an advantage and a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“In the current Lanapacea, Lady Tiera could be a trigger for conflict. People are attracted to what glows bright, and their eyes are eventually blinded. For those who seek the light, this impulse is probably irresistible.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the room understood that the king was talking about the former retainers of the Lucent clan.</p>
<p>Even after Tiera’s exile and the death of the last clan head, there were retainers who served the Luderia or Lulac, but remained loyal to the Lucent at heart.</p>
<p>For them, Tiera was an ideal “flag” to rally under.</p>
<p>“I do not mean to say that all of them are like that, of course. Having said this, I ask: Lady Tiera, do you intend to stay in Lanapacea?”</p>
<p>Differently from how he spoke to Shin or Schnee, Erdyne addressed Tiera with the expression of a king.</p>
<p>“…no, I do not plan to stay in this country. I only came here to visit my parents’ graves in the first place.”</p>
<p>Tiera was almost intimidated by Erdyne’s presence, but managed to give a clear reply. Her expression suggested that even if she was requested to stay, she would not comply.</p>
<p>“I see.—my apologies.”</p>
<p>Erdyne spoke quietly yet firmly.</p>
<p>The words he uttered while lowering his head contained various different meanings.</p>
<p>“The blade we have preserved will be delivered tomorrow. There will be no more interference from us in your activities.”</p>
<p>“We will depart as soon as we receive the blade, then. If we stayed longer we might trigger other commotions.”</p>
<p>Shin’s words were meant not only for Erdyne, but also for Tiera to hear. She probably realized it, as she silently nodded.</p>
<p>“Sorry for leaving so suddenly.”</p>
<p>After the conversation ended, Shin checked that there was no one else around and said so.</p>
<p>Even if they were involved in an unexpected incident, Lanapacea was still Tiera’s hometown. Shin wanted to leave early so that they would not be involved in other problems, but he also thought that they could stay a little longer.</p>
<p>“My business here is done, so don’t worry. Rather, where are we going to go next?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of looking for my guildhouse first, but there’s no clues as to where it could be, and searching blindly doesn’t feel constructive…so I was thinking of starting from Romenun, since we know where it is at least. We should meet with Oxygen and Hydro too.”</p>
<p>Because of the series of incidents the group had to deal with, the search for the guildhouses had been pushed back.</p>
<p>The timing was right, so they decided to head for Romenun.</p>
<p>“It’s not close, though, so it’ll take a few days, that’s the issue.”</p>
<p>Based on the information obtained from Berett, support character of “Golden Merchant” Reed, Schnee — who was familiar with the continent’s geography — estimated that with a normal horse-drawn carriage it would take about six months to reach it from Lanapacea.</p>
<p>Romenun was located in a forest area southeast of the region that connected the continent’s upper and lower half.</p>
<p>There weren’t any paved roads leading all the way to the location, and even if they used the available roads, it would probably take that much time.</p>
<p>“Our carriage and Kagerou’s power combined, we can reduce that to less than half. Well, we don’t have any other urgent business to take care of, so we could take it easy once in a while.”</p>
<p>After being teleported away, Shin and Schnee managed to spend some relaxing time.</p>
<p>Tiera and Shibaid were busy in Lanapacea, Filma and Sety in the city taken over by the demon, however, so they did not have any time to rest properly.</p>
<p>Filma and the others were as strong, physically and mentally, as Shin and Schnee were, but they still needed to rest. Shin thought that they should take advantage of any rest time they had.</p>
<p>“Who would have expected that they found out my species, though…”</p>
<p>Shin said that he was really taken aback by it.</p>
<p>He would have never expected Erdyne, just an NPC in the game era, not even a support character, but one of the mass-produced ones, to remember him.</p>
<p>Shin wondered if the king acted and spoke so politely throughout the visit because he witnessed Shin’s battle and was careful not to say anything unpleasant.</p>
<p>Another reason for this suspicion was that, about the crystal found in Crissot’s room, Erdyne simply said that he would like to know whatever information they could extract, but only if possible.</p>
<p>“I believe there are a fairly large number of such people among the species with great longevity. There might be others who noticed it already too.”</p>
<p>“For Humans and Beasts, it’s the stuff of legends, but Elves and Pixies might have witnessed it with their own eyes, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that, if they had actually seen his past battles, they would be rightly terrified. Players like him were those who hunted the monsters told in this world’s tales as capable of destroying entire countries, after all. They were able to converse, but in case of battle they would be no different from the monsters they hunted.</p>
<p>Thinking about it again, Shin realized that Erdyne’s complexion looked sickly the whole time.</p>
<p>“Talking together like this, anyone should realize that there’s nothing to be afraid of, though.”</p>
<p>“They were probably on the same level as those called Chosen Ones, elves with relatively high strength. Because their powers were often superior to others, they realized how much of a difference there was between them and Shin. If that is the starting point, then reducing the distance is difficult.”</p>
<p>Shibaid probably spoke from experience. He answered Tiera’s perplexed comment while looking at the door Erdyne left from.</p>
<p>“Being in charge of a whole country, he surely has many things on his mind”</p>
<p>“That is true. One man’s decision influences the fate of thousands. The pressure is overwhelming. Not that Shin would ever destroy a country on a whim, though.”</p>
<p>“That’s for sure…”</p>
<p>Shin looked like it was too much even as a joke. If they considered whether he physically could or not, he probably could: that was what made it awkward to laugh.</p>
<p>In actuality, such a feat was possible for all members of his party.</p>
<p>Even Tiera, who had the lowest stats of the group, was far beyond the standards of this world.</p>
<p>Her stats already rivaled advanced Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>Combined with the equipment crafted by Shin and Kagerou’s support, she could probably bring down a smaller country by herself.</p>
<p>Tiera was an elf, naturally proficient at using bows, and the bow she used had a much longer range than normal ones. Normal soldiers and even Chosen Ones below the advanced level would be nothing but fodder for her.</p>
<p>“Okay, enough about this. Let’s contact Filma and decide where to meet up.”</p>
<p>The conversation was gradually heading in a dangerous direction, so Shin abruptly changed the topic.</p>
<p>On Filma’s side, the situation was not as dire as Reforgerer’s summoning.</p>
<p>Since there was no contact from them, it probably meant that nothing worse than that had happened.</p>
<p>“If they say that the crisis hasn’t been solved, I’m thinking of going to join them.”</p>
<p>“I agree. It’s in a different direction than Romenun, but going there ourselves or meeting halfway wouldn’t change much.”</p>
<p>The country where Filma and Sety currently were was located north of Lanapacea. It wasn’t the opposite direction to Romenun, but it was nonetheless out of the way.</p>
<p>Both groups, however, could travel much faster than ordinary horse carriages. Compared to the distance that separated them from Romenun, it wouldn’t make much of a difference where they regrouped.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait for the delivery tomorrow, then leave. Be careful so that they don’t notice, just in case.”</p>
<p>They would depart even if the elves knew, but it would surely be better to go quickly without anything happening.</p>
<p>The next day, Erdyne visited the residence again, accompanied by a heavy-duty escort.</p>
<p>“Well now….”</p>
<p>“This item has no equals in this world, so even the king cannot take it out without a proper escort.”</p>
<p>Padan approached Shin’s group first and explained the reason behind the large escort.</p>
<p>In this world, Ancient-grade weapons were considered national treasures, even if broken.</p>
<p>If it was put on sale, billions of gold Jul coins would move. It was obvious that it had to be well guarded.</p>
<p>“This is the item I promised.”</p>
<p>Erdyne presented the blade, laid on a cloth. Schnee was the one to take it: even if Erdyne knew about Shin’s species, he couldn’t be the one to receive the blade since other people were present.</p>
<p>In the game era, Schnee knew all Rokuten members other than Shin.</p>
<p>In the previous day’s discussion with Erdyne, they reached the conclusion that Schnee’s abilities and the fact she was trusted by many countries made her a fitting person to entrust the blade to.</p>
<p>“I shall preserve it safely until my master or Master Cook return.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Erdyne watched Schnee turn the blade into a card and put it into the item box, then left. Some of the other elves looked like they wanted to speak to Tiera, but since the king was leaving they couldn’t stay back, and in the end there was no contact between them.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go then.”</p>
<p>Shin said they would take a look at the city’s current situation and left the residence. They did not head for the city center, however, but for the gate leading outside.</p>
<p>“They didn’t say anything, but is this really alright?”</p>
<p>Shin asked if there wasn’t anyone Tiera was close to. If her saying goodbye would start a commotion, that would be inevitable, he thought.</p>
<p>“I came here suddenly anyway, so it fits to leave as suddenly.”</p>
<p>Tiera said it was nothing.</p>
<p>Shin’s party used less crowded streets and concealment-type skills as they walked out of the village. Tiera said that she wanted to walk a bit slowly when they left, and Shin wouldn’t ever refuse to cooperate.</p>
<p>“You are…”</p>
<p>When they arrived at the gate they found the same elf that Shin met when he arrived, Anaheit. They could have passed the gate while still invisible, but Tiera asked to not hide at least when they crossed the gate.</p>
<p>“….are you leaving?”</p>
<p>Anaheit noticed Tiera, Shin and the others and asked for confirmation.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have no reason to stay.”</p>
<p>After Tiera replied, the other elves noticed her too. However, Anaheit raised one hand and the elves who were about to move stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>“Sir, are you really sure?”</p>
<p>“Our duty is to guard the gate. When Lady Tiera was exiled, us gate guardians did not agree or disagree with such a measure. If we were strong enough to deal with the monsters, however, that tragedy might have been prevented. If she has decided to leave, there is no way we could ever stop her, is there?”</p>
<p>Anaheit answered one of the elves’ questions without any hesitation. Apparently, he was the gate guardian 100 years before too. His words were meant to convince the other elves, but also to apologize to Tiera for his powerlessness.</p>
<p>“Farewell, then.”</p>
<p>“I pray your travels will be safe.”</p>
<p>Probably thanks to Anaheit’s words, no one tried to stop them. Though, they all lowered their heads.</p>
<p>They likewise probably served as gate guardians 100 years before, like Anaheit. Thus his words affected them deeply.</p>
<p>Shin materialized the horse carriage, which Kagerou drew. Tiera continued looking at Lanapacea, until the trees concealed it from her sight.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 1 – Part 4</p>
<p>After leaving Lanapacea, Shin’s group proceeded north. Their first objective was to regroup with Filma and Sety.</p>
<p>Afterward, they would head to Hecate’s guildhouse, the “5th Daze Garden Romenun”.</p>
<p>They contacted Berett from the Golden Company to check if there were any updates on the information, but Shin’s “1st Mysterious Studio Demi Eden” and Reed’s “3rd Moving Base Miraltrea” had not been found yet.</p>
<p>“Looks like Filma and Sety wrapped things up on their end, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But it wasn’t all good news, apparently.”</p>
<p>Schnee had contacted Filma while Shin asked Berett about new information.</p>
<p>According to Schnee, Filma and Sety had defeated the demon, but when they arrived the damage was already severe and it would take a long time before they could restore the country to its original state.</p>
<p>“They are apparently pleading for Filma and Sety to stay.”</p>
<p>“I understand how they must feel…”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t hide his feelings of sympathy for them.</p>
<p>The demon’s hands had reached as far as the country’s top brass and even the king. Only a young prince had survived among the royalty. Some ministers and functionaries still remained and were trying to somehow support the prince.</p>
<p>The problem was mainly with military officers: most had either been killed by the demon or executed for siding with it, so their numbers were abysmally low.</p>
<p>The country’s walls were still intact, so monsters couldn’t easily enter, but even maintaining public safety inside the country was becoming problematic. Even if the demon was defeated, the future seemed rather dismal.</p>
<p>In such a situation, if those responsible for the demon’s defeat simply took off and left, what would happen?</p>
<p>Many citizens did not revolt only because they had seen Filma and Sety fight and thought they were staying in the castle, or so the ministers said.</p>
<p>Among the royals, who failed to protect the people from the demons’ evil clutches, only the prince survived. His personal guards, as well as most military troops, were gone. If the people revolted, no one would be able to stop them.</p>
<p>“Even so, requesting them to stay to keep the country stabilized is an absurd request…”</p>
<p>After learning about the country’s current state, Shin could understand the reason behind their request. But, it would take an incredible amount of time until the army was reformed, the town rebuilt and the country could stabilize once more.</p>
<p>Shin was willing to lend a hand as the country was victim of a demon’s rampage, but helping with reconstruction efforts was beyond his capacity.</p>
<p>Helping temporarily as he did in Erkunt, rescuing people and rebuilding lodging facilities -and a very limited number of them- was all he could do, and he couldn’t do it forever. Rebuilding a whole country was far beyond his scope.</p>
<p>“The people don’t have the luxury of thinking about capturing the prince now anyway, right?”</p>
<p>“Even if they don’t, some people require an outlet for their dissatisfaction. It might be small at first, but it will propagate among those who share similar thinking and grows larger and larger. Especially when the whole country’s existence is at stake, like in this case.”</p>
<p>Punishing a member of the royal family wouldn’t change anything, in fact, it could easily worsen the situation. If a revolt started, it would lead the country straight to destruction, so said Shibaid. It was like he had witnessed the very same situation unfold.</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anything we can do?”</p>
<p>“We can offer some assistance, but temporarily. In order to support a whole country, we’d have to be a country or large trading company. Well, Shin might be able to pull it off, though.”</p>
<p>“No way, we don’t have enough people or money. We cannot act on compassion this time.”</p>
<p>To give extensive support to a country they had never visited before, where they did not know anyone. It was too ridiculous to even consider.</p>
<p>Shin’s party was connected to the Golden Company, one of the largest trading companies of the continent, but even it did not possess trading routes extending throughout the continent. Even if they asked them for support, it would be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Even in the real world, such catastrophes happened regularly.</p>
<p>Japan was no exception. It was well known how much time, assets, and people were required for restoration.</p>
<p>Other than defeating monsters, they would get involved only in things closest to them, only small feats they could perform as individuals. So Shin had decided.</p>
<p>He actually always decided what to do case by case, so the span of his choices was quite broad, but this time Shin was positive that the situation was beyond his capacity.</p>
<p>“As soon as we meet with Filma and Sety, we’re going to Romenun.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“As you say.”</p>
<p>“….okay.”</p>
<p>Schnee replied frankly, Shibaid with relief, Tiera not completely convinced.</p>
<p>Shin heard the three different replies and turned towards the direction they were heading to.</p>
<p>When the sun set, he materialized Tsuki no Hokora for the party to spend the night in.</p>
<p>It was concealed by magic to be invisible and inaccessible to anyone other than the party. Even if anyone happened to come closer to it, because it was invisible, they could never approach it.</p>
<p>In Tsuki no Hokora’s smithy, Shin was facing the golden crystal found in Crissot’s room.</p>
<p>The fist-sized crystal was a hexagonal prism, with hexagonal cones on both ends.</p>
<p>Its form was too clean to imagine it had formed naturally.</p>
<p>Shin’s analysis skills showed gibberish, like before.</p>
<p>“What will happen if I pour magic in it?”</p>
<p>Some items exhibited peculiar reactions when infused with magic. Shin tried pouring his magic in the crystal, and the reaction exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p>The golden crystal turned a light purple color. He stopped pouring magic, but the color did not change.</p>
<p>“….did I mess up?”</p>
<p>There was only one crystal. He had to research it, but Shin worried he did something irreparable.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he concluded that since pouring magic changed its color, maybe it could return to normal after absorbing it, so he tried to.</p>
<p>“A little more…wait, what’s this feeling…?”</p>
<p>Shin used a MP absorption skill and the crystal regained its golden glow. When he absorbed the crystal’s MP, however, Shin felt something unusual.</p>
<p>Because of the skill, Shin’s MP slightly recovered. The unusual sensation, however, was not about the MP he absorbed.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure whether something had flown into him, or had been taken from him. It was a contradicting sensation. It was something frustratingly difficult to put into words.</p>
<p>He wondered whether it was something only he could feel, or anyone else would too, and wanted to test it, but it could be dangerous.</p>
<p>The item was probably related to the Reforgerer’s summoning. Anything could happen.</p>
<p>Shin was examining it alone because the smithy was especially sturdy and, if anything happened, the other members wouldn’t be in danger.</p>
<p>“You are examining it by yourself as expected.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s voice was heard from the entrance to the smithy. Maybe because of the peculiar sensation emanating from the crystal, Shin hadn’t noticed her presence.</p>
<p>“You found me.”</p>
<p>“Well, the same thing happened before too…”</p>
<p>Schnee was referring to something that happened in the game era. Some items would explode or release toxic gases if they weren’t examined properly.</p>
<p>Whenever Shin examined such items, he never let his support characters inside the smithy.</p>
<p>“Let me help you.”</p>
<p>“…it might be dangerous.”</p>
<p>Shin had high stats and was equipped with high-grade gear.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t die easily, so he could examine items with mysterious effects such as this. Since the crystal didn’t exist in the game era, he had to be especially careful.</p>
<p>“I am prepared for that.”</p>
<p>Schnee then continued.</p>
<p>“If I tried to do something like that, you would say the same thing I did, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“…I give up. It’s just as you say.”</p>
<p>Shin placed the crystal on the anvil and raised both hands. To keep an important person away from danger, in order not to risk endangering them. If the person in question wished for that or not, however, was a whole nother story.</p>
<p>To experience the same thing for the first time and finally realize what others must have felt when you did it. In stories and tales, it was a common device.</p>
<p>Even if he was aware of it, he would pick that option all the same. Shin, however, did not force her to stay away. Even if he tried to, Schnee would come closer all the same. Shin could realize that now.</p>
<p>“There’s something I would like you to try, Can you give me a hand?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Shin had tested it himself first, so it shouldn’t be dangerous. He then handed the crystal to Schnee.</p>
<p>Shin explained to her what happened, then Schnee poured her magic power in the crystal. It changed this time too, turning to a light blue color. A different color than when Shin did it.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it probably the wavelength of the magic poured into the crystal that determines its color?”</p>
<p>“Wavelength?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s something like a fingerprint. Magic power quality is different from person to person, and we call it wavelength, as well as other terms.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s explanation made Shin recall that he heard something similar before.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I think I heard something like that in Bayreuth.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to himself and tried to jog his memory for several minutes. The time passed since he arrived in this world was not too long yet, but still it already felt like it was in the distant past.</p>
<p>In a forest close to the first country he visited in this world, Bayreuth, Shin defeated a monster called Skullface and the weapon held by the monster was sent flying away.</p>
<p>The magic power lingering on the greatsword revealed that Shin was the one that defeated the monster and he was summoned to the castle to meet the second princess.</p>
<p>He recalled that when he heard the explanation at the time, he thought it was a fantasy version of DNA analysis.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you can see a faint aura like that, right? So that was magic power?”</p>
<p>“You have skills that let you see magic power, Shin, so you can see it even without meaning to. If you focus, you should be able to see your magic power as well.”</p>
<p>Shin immediately put it to the test: he looked at his hand and activated the 【Light】 skill, which created a source of light, at minimum power. He could see a faint purple light covering his hand.</p>
<p>“So Schnee’s is light blue.”</p>
<p>Schnee used 【Light】 too, and a faint light the same color as the crystal enveloped her hand. Shin compared the two and thought that his looked thicker, or rather, less limpid.</p>
<p>“Next, try using MP drain and absorb the magic power you poured in, and our first test will be done.”</p>
<p>Shin gave the crystal to Schnee again and asked her to absorb magic power, like he did before.</p>
<p>The crystal changed back from light blue to gold, just like it did in Shin’s case.</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>“Schnee?”</p>
<p>The reaction was the same.</p>
<p>Shin then wanted to ask if she felt anything unusual, but noticed that something was off about Schnee. Her eyes were open, but it was like she was looking at something that wasn’t actually there.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, what is it?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s my line.”</p>
<p>Shin shook her shoulders and Schnee finally responded. It looked like she hadn’t heard Shin’s words.</p>
<p>“I can’t remember clearly, but I think I saw something like a thread.”</p>
<p>Shin said that she seemed unconscious for a few moments and Schnee tried recalling what she saw.</p>
<p>She was probably looking through her own eyes. She was in a pitch-black space, and a golden thread, probably generated from her body, was stretching somewhere in the darkness. Schnee said she saw such a light.</p>
<p>She added that she probably saw something else too, but couldn’t recall what.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I didn’t see anything like that. I felt like something was coming into me, or being taken out of me, a strange sensation like that. I wanted to ask you how it felt, but maybe it’s better to have everyone else try it too?”</p>
<p>It would be difficult to make theories with just two specimens. In the end, he decided to have Shibaid and the others perform the same experiment.</p>
<p>Tiera didn’t have MP drain skills, so Shin gave her a gauntlet attached with one.</p>
<p>As a result, Shibaid didn’t feel anything in particular. The silver became silver with streaks of black.</p>
<p>Tiera saw something like a large, brightly glowing tree. The crystal turned green.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha seeing the same things as Schnee was pretty unexpected.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha too could pour and absorb magic power, so Shin had her try too, but she remembered things more clearly than Schnee.</p>
<p>In a pitch-black space there was a star-like light and the golden thread was extending towards it. In Yuzuha’s case the crystal didn’t change color, but its glow turned brighter.</p>
<p>“Do you two have something in common?”</p>
<p>One was a support character, the other a partner monster. In game terms, they were completely different creatures.</p>
<p>Everyone tried thinking of any possibility, but no clear answer came up.</p>
<p>“Could it be that…, no, but…”</p>
<p>“Any idea?”</p>
<p>While everyone was deep in thought, Shibaid mumbled to himself and Shin asked if he had come up with something.</p>
<p>“I came up with an idea, but…Schnee and Yuzuha. Both of them have a deep bond with Shin. That’s not the whole reason, but it could be one of the causes.”</p>
<p>“A bond, huh…but in that case, you’re a support character like her, Shibaid.”</p>
<p>They were created at different times, but both of them were Shin’s support characters. Most of what characterized Schnee would fit Shibaid too.</p>
<p>“The bond I speak of is spiritual, or something more ambiguous. That’s why I said it was just an idea. Yuzuha originally cannot become a partner, but here she is, at Shin’s side. Judging from her words and actions until now, there is clearly a special bond between you.”</p>
<p>Shibaid then turned towards Schnee.</p>
<p>“And about Schnee….well, you know. Your wish has been fulfilled, has it not? I believe that is a different kind of bond than the one with me or Filma.”</p>
<p>Shibaid finally laughed, saying that if it was all baseless conjecture, they could have a laugh at it too.</p>
<p>“Who’s laughing? There’s so many things we don’t understand that we can’t deny that possibility. I do think we have a special bond.”</p>
<p>In the end, no clear conclusion could be found. If the special bonds Shibaid mentioned were a cause, however, there was more relief than concern. At least, they were positive bonds.</p>
<p>“Kuu! Special!”</p>
<p>“That’s right. If that’s the reason, I can understand why we saw the same things.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha looked very happy after she heard Shibaid’s theory about the bonds and was wagging her tail energetically. Schnee did not show her emotions as clearly as her, but her smile was broader than before.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Only Tiera seemed a little dissatisfied. Her cheeks were slightly puffed, her gaze sharp. It was like she wanted to say that she belonged to that side too.</p>
<p>Considering that Marino had inhabited her body, it was not strange to think that Tiera could have a special bond with Shin too.</p>
<p>Tiera, however, had not seen the same things as Schnee and Yuzuha. That’s what she was unhappy about.</p>
<p>“……..”</p>
<p>Shibaid finally realized it and looked at her with an expression that screamed “I messed up!”.</p>
<p>Shin noticed it too, but thought it wiser not to say anything. Or rather, he could not come up with anything to dispel Tiera’s dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“Kuu.”</p>
<p>Both men were frozen still. Yuzuha ignored them completely, took the crystal in her paws and stared at it, while crying softly. Sometimes, she powerfully wagged her tail.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, did you find something?”</p>
<p>Gradually, everyone’s attention fixed on her. Shin was still feeling awkward, so Schnee asked in his stead.</p>
<p>Yuzuha wrapped the crystal in her tail and handed it to Shin.</p>
<p>“You should keep this with you, Shin.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Shin took the crystal and replied with a question. It had been used by a demon, so he didn’t exactly have a good impression of it. If Yuzuha said so, however, then it had to be true, Shin thought.</p>
<p>“Can I ask why?”</p>
<p>“This is a fragment of the originator, crosser of worlds.”</p>
<p>“Crosser of worlds…?”</p>
<p>The unexpected answer prompted another question from Shin. He had too little information and had no idea what she meant.</p>
<p>“Do you remember Origin?”</p>
<p>“…yeah. I could never forget.”</p>
<p>The last boss of the death game, the opponent he fought against until moments before coming to this world. It wasn’t an opponent he could ever forget.</p>
<p>He had collected all drop items that appeared after defeating Origin, though. There were no crystals like that among them.</p>
<p>All items were of unknown usage and were still sleeping quietly in Shin’s item box.</p>
<p>“That is the originator. One of the seven beings which shaped this world. Its true name was Origin – I.”</p>
<p>“I heard about it, yes. I see, so that was the original Dragnil.”</p>
<p>In the game, the first individuals of all races were called the Seven Saints.</p>
<p>Based on what Yuzuha said, there had to be six creatures like Origin remaining.</p>
<p>“Why was the last boss only that one, though? If the other six were there too, I wouldn’t have stood a chance.”</p>
<p>At the end of the dungeon there was only one Origin. Facing seven of them would have been an impossible feat.</p>
<p>“Kuu, I don’t know. I can’t remember everything yet.”</p>
<p>“If you remember, you’ll know the reason why I came to this world too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know how much I know, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that Yuzuha might know the answers about everything, but she couldn’t tell if it was true or not.</p>
<p>Maybe she did, maybe she didn’t. Retrieving her memories could become another goal for their travels.</p>
<p>“So anyway, why should I hold onto it?”</p>
<p>“Only Shin fought against Origin. And if anything happens, Shin will be okay.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean now…”</p>
<p>Yuzuha probably meant that Shin was the safest person to hold the crystal. She might have meant something else too, but she couldn’t say why at the moment.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m going to analyze it anyway, so I guess it’s best for me to have it…”</p>
<p>There still were other things to experiment with.</p>
<p>Shin decided to continue as they proceeded towards their destination.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 1 Part 5</p>
<p>A few days later, Shin’s party met with Filma and Sety.</p>
<p>“We’re finally together! It’s been a while, camping outside really takes a toll.”</p>
<p>“My bed…my bed is calling my name…”</p>
<p><img loading="eager" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18946 jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled" src="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FilmaAndSety.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FilmaAndSety.jpg?resize=698%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FilmaAndSety.jpg?resize=204%2C300&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FilmaAndSety.jpg?resize=768%2C1127&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/FilmaAndSety.jpg?w=1009&amp;ssl=1 1009w" data-lazy-loaded="1" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px"></p>
<p>The two newcomers, Sety in particular, looked exhausted. Sety would surely drift off to dreamland the moment she touched her bed.</p>
<p>Shin thought that, since she had been protecting the private area with the Tsumugins, she wasn’t used to camping anymore.</p>
<p>Even so, she looked unnaturally tired.</p>
<p>In the game era they did not camp outdoors often, but even if she was a rear support member, Sety still had stats much higher than this world’s standards. She should get tired much more slowly than the average person.</p>
<p>What would have caused her to be so exhausted?</p>
<p>Sety made it seem like they faced an especially powerful demon, but Filma, on the other hand, did not seem tired at all.</p>
<p>In her travels around the world, she probably camped often. Seeing her pull the dazed Sety’s hand made them look like sisters.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop here for today, then.”</p>
<p>After looking at their state, with a wry laugh Shin materialized Tsuki no Hokora. Schnee then brought Filma and Sety inside.</p>
<p>“I’d really like a portable building like this too. I thought it would be the same as before I was sealed, but after traveling with you guys, not having a bath is pretty harsh.”</p>
<p>“Something like this might happen again, so I guess it’ll be worth making some.”</p>
<p>“Rather than that, an item that doesn’t make you feel sleepy…”</p>
<p>As Shin commented, Sety wobbled towards him. For whatever reason, she looked about to cry.</p>
<p>“Sety isn’t exhausted because of the camping, she just lacks sleep.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Aaah!! Aaah!! Aaaahhhh!! Don’t say it!!!”</p>
<p>Filma’s words apparently shook Sety awake: she tried with all her might to stop her from continuing.</p>
<p>“In the first big battle after joining with us, against the evil deity, she couldn’t do much, right? She was super focused though, so I guess she had too much energy left in her. So in reaction to that, she really did her best this time. Day and night, she was out fighting demons. Thanks to that, you won’t find a demon no matter where you look in that country, but those efforts took their toll, and this is the result.”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s why only Sety looks so spent.”</p>
<p>Shin, convinced by Filma’s explanation, smiled at Sety, who was covering her face out of embarrassment.</p>
<p>She worked that hard because she was worried about Schnee. Shin realized once more that she felt the same way as him and could not help feeling happy.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Sety.”</p>
<p>“I can feel a lukewarm gaze from everyone’s eyes…but more than that, why is big sis Schnee carrying me…?”</p>
<p>Also because she looked very young, Sety’s words and actions made her look like a little girl that tried to act mature.</p>
<p>Sety was thus picked up by Schnee and carried inside Tsuki no Hokora.</p>
<p>“That’s…?”</p>
<p>“Sety is like the party’s little sister, but Schnee is the one that treats her like that the most, no?”</p>
<p>“More than a little sister, that looks like…”</p>
<p>A mother carrying her daughter. Shin did not finish his sentence, though. They looked like sisters, like Filma and Sety did, but Schnee’s aura made them seem more like mother and daughter.</p>
<p>Shin had set Sety as the party’s little sister, but he thought that even if he hadn’t, her personality would have assigned her to such a role all the same.</p>
<p>“Let’s go inside too.”</p>
<p>Shin and the rest followed Schnee inside Tsuki no Hokora. As announced, Sety was brought to the bath.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll go too then.”</p>
<p>Filma also headed towards the bath.</p>
<p>It was still a bit early for dinner. So, Shin decided to progress with the crystal’s analysis, while asking Shibaid, Tiera, and Yuzuha for their opinions.</p>
<p>Unlike Filma, Sety skipped dinner and slept until the morning.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>The next day, the party resumed traveling.</p>
<p>“After getting used to big sis Schnee’s cooking, eating in normal restaurants feels kind of lacking.”</p>
<p>Shin’s party departed after breakfast. Sety, sitting next to Shin on the coachman’s seat, whispered to herself.</p>
<p>She was the only one to sleep until the morning, so she found it a bit embarrassing to ride inside the carriage.</p>
<p>“If you cook by yourself, though, you don’t really care how it turns out.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s so right!”</p>
<p>When the party met Sety again, she was in the middle of cooking.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t recall her having the Cooking skill, but she probably learned in the hundreds of years she spent on her own. At present, it had grown to Cooking IV.</p>
<p>“I heard that big sis Schnee has Cooking IX. I was surprised, but I guess it’s obvious. Her dishes are almost as delicious as master Cook’s.”</p>
<p>“Schnee did eat Cook’s dishes after all. She probably used them as reference and is trying to see if she can’t make them even more delicious.”</p>
<p>Even if her skill level was inferior, Shin thought that Schnee’s cooking might have surpassed Cook’s, as the latter was limited by the game system.</p>
<p>His stomach was already in the palm of her hand. As well as the rest of his body.</p>
<p>“By the way, what happened before we met? I heard a bit before we left, but devils? World Tree? It’s stuff you barely even hear mentioned in this world, but you sure have been involved with both a lot.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t go looking for them, mind you. The devils were in the place we were teleported to. One of them is coexisting peacefully with humans too.”</p>
<p>Former players Hilamee and Masakado, Luxuria and Avaritia, the World Tree and Reforgerer. Shin told Sety about them to share the information with her.</p>
<p>“I guess that being with you means experiencing all sorts of rare events.”</p>
<p>“Let me assure you that none of it is deliberate.”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t deny it, but resisted the allegations as much as he could, a bitter expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Anyway, since you were alone with Schnee, was there any progress? Out with it, come on.”</p>
<p>“Now that was sudden…”</p>
<p>The question came from Filma: she was probably listening to Shin and Sety’s conversation. She crossed over to the coachman’s seats, eager to take the opportunity.</p>
<p>“It’s like Schnee’s aura got softer than before. That’s what tipped me off. Come on, out with it, and spare no details. Sety, get the other side.”</p>
<p>While chuckling ominously, Filma grabbed Shin’s arm.</p>
<p>Kagerou was drawing the carriage, so they just needed to occasionally give it instructions for it to know where to go.</p>
<p>Filma knew the carriage was in good hands, so she grabbed Shin’s left arm so he couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>“Roger. I’m interested too.”</p>
<p>Sety promptly obeyed and grabbed Shin’s arm as well. Blocked both left and right, Shin had no way of escape.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, Yuzuha, out of the way, please.”</p>
<p>“Yuzuha be considerate! I want to know what happened! Time to talk!”</p>
<p>“Everyone is worried about you. Here no one other than us can listen”</p>
<p>“Look at that grin on your face! You’re enjoying this, aren’t you!?”</p>
<p>Shin heard some quarrelling going on inside the carriage too.</p>
<p>Conversation from the coachman seat could easily be heard inside. What Shin said to Filma and Sety would be heard clearly by the others too.</p>
<p>Everyone already knew that Yuzuha had made it possible for Shin and Schnee to spend time by themselves.</p>
<p>Shibaid already figured out everything when Shin called Schnee his “wife” in Lanapacea.</p>
<p>Yuzuha had an inkling too, but was curious about the details.</p>
<p>Only Tiera did not say anything, nor move an inch.</p>
<p>From the map and the presence it wasn’t possible to tell a person’s expression, so Shin couldn’t tell how Tiera was looking at the situation.</p>
<p>“Don’t bully Schnee too much, okay?”</p>
<p>“That all depends on you, Shin!!”</p>
<p>Shin realized that Schnee’s prediction was perfectly accurate, as Filma and Sety spoke in unison. He laughed, saying that they sure looked eager.</p>
<p>“Can’t be helped then. Let’s start from after we were teleported.”</p>
<p>Shin started narrating what happened after he spoke with Filma and the rest of the party via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>Inevitably, there was an eruption of cheering when he got the point that they both confessed to each other.</p>
<p>Because it was the moment Schnee’s wish was realized and Shin announced that he would remain in this world.</p>
<p>“And after that you got down to business, right? Right??”</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>Filma was excited beyond measure, so much that her nose almost touched Shin’s. He leaned the other way, towards Sety, and found her silently yet excitedly blowing air out of her nose, prompting him to go on.</p>
<p>“Whoa, I’m not going to talk about that! It’s too embarrassing!!”</p>
<p>Shin meant to conclude the evening by simply saying that they “became one”, shifting to the next morning, but the pressure on his arms requested otherwise.</p>
<p>Why were they so interested in learning such intimate details? He staunchly refused to speak.</p>
<p>“Eeh? Really? Come on, what do you have to lose?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah!”</p>
<p>“Pipe down, you two!!”</p>
<p>Shin unleashed forehead flicks on both girls to quiet them down.</p>
<p>The quarreling inside the carriage had calmed down as well.</p>
<p>Shin, while thinking that Schnee was probably blushing violently to the tip of her ears, gave instructions to Kagerou about where to go.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 1 Part 6</p>
<p>“What about you, what happened in that country?”</p>
<p>After a while, Shin asked this question to Filma and Sety.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard about what had happened to them yet.</p>
<p>“Pretty much what I said during the Mind Chat the other day. We were teleported to a normal coast, but the country we visited to understand where we were was under demons’ attack, we were really surprised.”</p>
<p>Sety noticed the demons’ presence first and secretly traced it back to the mastermind.</p>
<p>The most unexpected thing was that the demon was hiding in the throne room. Based on the number of presences, they thought it had taken control of the king and his close retainers, but it was making them kill each other instead.</p>
<p>Sety stopped the spell at the last moment, but the king and his subordinates thought they were under attack and surrounded them. When Sety and Filma showed that they had incapacitated their opponents without wounding them, the king and his subordinates finally agreed to listen to them.</p>
<p>Most of the people in the throne room were affected by mental manipulation status effects like 【Confusion】 and 【Charm】, so after removing the debuffs they finally realized what was going on.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what would have happened without Sety. I can take care of myself, but I’m not good at healing others.”</p>
<p>“I’m specialized in offense though.”</p>
<p>Sety was a support character specialized in buffing allies and offensive magic. Having high INT also boosted the effects of healing magic so, thanks to her high MP as a Mage, she was one of the best healers in their party.</p>
<p>When Shin formed a support character party he put Filma, Girard, and Shibaid in front and Sety as rear support. Shin and Schnee attacked, supported, or healed depending on the enemy type.</p>
<p>Filma did not attack the enemy to attract their attention, like Shibaid, nor did she attack them at high speed to confuse them like Girard. She was a unique kind of fighter who maintained a steady offensive revolving around HP-draining attacks.</p>
<p>Because of this, she was skilled in healing herself, but not others.</p>
<p>If Filma had been with Shibaid instead, they might not have been able to fully heal the victims of mental manipulating status ailments.</p>
<p>“After that, well, we healed every single person with a status ailment and checked suspicious places, people, and items. Sety was a savior, let me tell you.”</p>
<p>Magic spells could be adjusted to work in various ways. Filma, being a combat specialist, mostly watched as Sety took center stage.</p>
<p>“You cut down the demons though Filma.”</p>
<p>The country Filma and Sety were teleported to — called Acuracan — was not attacked by powerful demons of the Duke or Marquis class, but several lower-class demons, such as Viscounts and Barons.</p>
<p>For a normal person they would be fearsome enemies, but for someone on Filma’s level, they were just small fry. The moment she found one, they were cleaved in two and pulverized.</p>
<p>Eventually the demons started acting more stealthily, so finding them took more work than defeating them. That was the reason why, among all the members of the party, they took the longest time to solve their situation.</p>
<p>“I heard they were pleading for you to stay though. Did you leave the country without saying anything?”</p>
<p>“We told them that there were no more demons in the country, as far as we could tell. Sety really did her best, so unless they hid extremely well, I don’t think they’ll have to fear demons for a while. If we failed to find any, it means that they were beyond our abilities to find.”</p>
<p>“We took down the captain, or rather, a demon in charge of commanding the others, pretty early, so they weren’t cooperating well. I think that if there are any survivors, it’s demons which ran away before we could find them.”</p>
<p>Sety added that they made sure to defeat any demons which fled, so there shouldn’t be any survivors, as she straightened her hat which had been moved by the wind.</p>
<p>Sety and Filma cooperated with Acuracan’s troops and hunted down the demons by forming a circle which first encompassed the entire country, then became smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>Excluding the case that any demons fled from the encirclement when it was at its widest, they should have successfully hunted them all down. Since they defeated the demon in charge of command early, they could take down the demons running on their own one by one.</p>
<p>“We helped a bit with the wreckage too. Then they’ll have to take care of things themselves. If people like us stay too long, they’ll rely on us for everything.”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety removed the wreckage too large for normal people to handle on their own. Filma’s final words were based on her experiences during the confusion after the Dusk of Majesty which she had personally witnessed along with situations she had heard about during that time.</p>
<p>As they didn’t intend to reside in that country for a long time, they only helped to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Shin thought the same way too. If they were going to stay just a short while, they should limit themselves to only simple volunteering.</p>
<p>“What were the demons planning to do in that country, anyway? They targeted the royal family…right?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like it was some big plan or anything. There was only one demon in charge of command, and it was just one rank higher than the others, so things just automatically developed in that direction. I suppose they just obeyed their primordial instincts, nature, or whatever, to attack people?”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety didn’t think that the demons exhibited any particular conduct, such as looking for something specific or acting in special ways against a particular species.</p>
<p>The demons that infiltrated Bayreuth acted in a similar way, so their hypothesis was probably correct.</p>
<p>In the game era, demons of inferior rank did not make intricate plans, or at least Shin never heard of such things happening.</p>
<p>“If you find a demon, kill it. Search and destroy, as they say. They’re never going to stop spawning anyway.”</p>
<p>Sety was not mistaken: demons were the enemies of humanity, after all. The possibility of making peace with them never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>The reason for their birth also resided within humanity, but there was nothing Shin’s party could do about it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 2 Part 1</p>
<p>Shin knew that she was a woman, so her hairdo, gestures, and speech reminded him of the male role actresses of a certain all-female theater troupe.</p>
<p>Her beauty was the kind that was often more popular among women than men, though the curves under her lab coat were very feminine.</p>
<p>Her light blue eyes, the same color as Oxygen, looked at Shin with interest.</p>
<p>“Master Shin, does your return mean that Mistress Hecate has returned as well?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m sorry but it’s only me. I don’t think that the others could return even if they wanted.”</p>
<p>Hydro didn’t seem to think that Hecate died. Since she hadn’t kept in contact with the outside world, she probably didn’t know that Hecate, as well as the other Rokuten members, were thought to be dead.</p>
<p>Or maybe, like the other support characters, she thought that Hecate simply *wouldn’t come back*.</p>
<p>“I see. It’s a shame, but I suppose it can’t be helped. She was a whimsical person, after all.”</p>
<p>Hydro spoke while looking somewhere in the distance, giving the impression that she was acting her lines.</p>
<p>“You don’t look like you’re sad, Hydro…”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t say it out loud, but he thought the same thing. He felt like he was watching a play.</p>
<p>“I was created to have meaning when paired with you after all, Oxygen. I do not possess feelings of longing myself.”</p>
<p>What would be the reason to pair a young boy like Oxygen to a masculine beauty like Hydro? Shin decided not to think about it anymore.</p>
<p>“Oh, but enough about us. What will you do now, Master Shin? If you don’t have any plans, there is something I would like to discuss.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything pressing, yeah. Any trouble?”</p>
<p>Shin was about to say that something seemed to go wrong wherever they went, but Hydro’s words completely betrayed his expectations, in a good way.</p>
<p>“Baomultan’s area is right next to this, you see. As far as I know, it shouldn’t be dangerous, but I wanted to hear your opinion, just in case.”</p>
<p>The name Hydro mentioned was very nostalgic for Shin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 2 Part 2</p>
<p>Baomultan.</p>
<p>Affectionately called “Baltan” by fans, it was a monster that, despite its horrendous looks, became so popular in THE NEW GATE that it was even turned into merchandise.</p>
<p>It was called “environmental protection monster”, as it visited polluted areas, absorbed the pollution and returned the areas to their normal state.</p>
<p>As a result, in the areas recently visited by Baomultan it was temporarily possible to find high-quality metal and rare plants.</p>
<p>If the player defeated Baomultan before it completely purified an area, it was possible to obtain parts for powerful equipment highly resistant to status ailments.</p>
<p>Because of this, conflicts often broke out between the players who wanted Baomultan’s parts and the players who wanted to gather the materials that appeared after the purification.</p>
<p>“This Baomultan monster isn’t strong?”</p>
<p>“So-so. At full power, it can be a match for Kagerou.”</p>
<p>“And you call that ‘so-so’!? It’s definitely dangerous!!”</p>
<p>“Before the Dusk of Majesty it wasn’t really dangerous. Besides, there were other circumstances in the conflict.”</p>
<p>In the game, a great number of players hunted Baomultans, so no one thought that it was dangerous.</p>
<p>Information about it was commonly available, so the players who couldn’t defeat it did not even try fighting.</p>
<p>There were also other players who chose not to fight it, for different reasons.</p>
<p>They were the “Baltan Protection Squad” and “Baltan Playpals”, organizations outside the scope of guilds.</p>
<p>It sounded like a silly joke, but they actually existed.</p>
<p>At first glance Baomultan looked like an undead dragon, but it actually had a mellow personality and did not attack approaching players unless provoked. It was even possible to touch it a little.</p>
<p>There was a certain player recorded footage of what various monsters did in their natural habitat, how they reacted when players approached etc. and posted it online.</p>
<p>Eventually, the player released a video with Baomultan as target.</p>
<p>A few days after the video was released, things began to unfold.</p>
<p>In the battle between the players who wanted Baomultan’s parts and the players who wanted the parts that appeared after purification of the area, the “Protection Squad” and the “Playpals” suddenly burst in.</p>
<p>The video had instigated the secretly formed community of Baomultan fans into action.</p>
<p>Their stance was close to the players who wanted the parts that appeared after the purification, so the balance of the two factions’ conflict changed greatly.</p>
<p>“Eh? What are you saying? Protecting monsters? Playpals…?”</p>
<p>Shin’s explanation utterly confused Tiera.</p>
<p>For this world’s denizens, monsters were creatures you either fight or run away from. Some made monsters their partners or worshipped them, but they were a very small minority.</p>
<p>“I know it sounds absurd but… Baomultan is just adorable…wait, adorable? No, that’s not it…anyway, it’s hard to just go fight it as soon as you see it.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t quite know how to explain it.</p>
<p>Maybe it was one of the game settings or they used a simple AI, but Baomultan and some other monsters could recognize players.</p>
<p>In Baomultan’s case, if a player approached it in a peaceful manner and touched it enough times, it would start being interested in the player.</p>
<p>When the player entered Baomultan’s area it would spontaneously approach the player and walk together.</p>
<p>When the player left Baomultan’s area, it would follow them until the edge of the area and watch the player leave.</p>
<p>Many players were moved by the lonely expression on its face as they left.</p>
<p>The posted video contained such a scene too, so the players interested in interacting with Baomultan increased. What followed could be called the “Baomultan Boom”.</p>
<p>“We started considering Baomultan a source of ‘Moe’…we’re done for…”</p>
<p>“After playing a bit with Baomultan I started thinking that its nickname, ‘Baltan’, isn’t strange at all.”</p>
<p>“ITT: monsters and moe”</p>
<p>“In my head Baltan is a cute loli: degenerate and proud”</p>
<p>These and many other threads popped up like mushrooms. Baomultan’s popularity exceeded even the creators’ imagination.</p>
<p>The fact that it spawned randomly, disappeared after a certain time and was a Divine Beast-like monster, making it impossible to tame, also contributed to its popularity.</p>
<p>It never stayed always in the same place, so after a while the time to say goodbye would definitely come. It was a half forced series of meetings and farewells.</p>
<p>“It’s still a monster, though. There were always players who wanted to defeat it for its parts, so there were often fights between those who wanted to fight Baltan and those who wanted to protect it. Sometimes they both lost, though.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Why, what happened?”</p>
<p>“When Baltan goes into fight mode, it sees all players as enemies. So it would attack the Protection Squad and Playpals too. It doesn’t matter if they had become friends before. The players who wanted to defeat it attacked it like before, while the Protection Squad and Playpals tried to get in their way. And Baomultan attacked all the players. The players who didn’t want to defeat Baomultan were fine with being attacked, so sometimes they clung onto other players and were knocked out together.”</p>
<p>They could do so since they wouldn’t actually die, but it was an incredible episode nonetheless.</p>
<p>It was unknown whether Baomultan had an affection stat.</p>
<p>Maybe it was reset during battle, or maybe when it was attacked it considered those of the same species as the attacker -if the attacker was a monster, all monsters of the same species; if the attacker was a player, all players or all players of the same species as the attacker- as its enemies, or so the players theorized.</p>
<p>“Maybe Baomultan saw them all as the same person. If it was attacked by a certain species, it could see all people of the same species as potential attackers.”</p>
<p>“I wonder. We might know the truth if we could talk with it, but it’s only possible in unique cases.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Tiera’s words while recalling the monsters he met until now.</p>
<p>The Element Tail and Kagutsuchi were primary examples. Kagerou understood what Shin and the others said, but it couldn’t talk.</p>
<p>Tamed monsters were the same. They even understood what the tamer wanted them to do from facial expressions and gestures.</p>
<p>“….wait, we could just have Yuzuha translate what it says.”</p>
<p>She did it for Kagerou before. If it was possible with Baomultan, they could communicate with it, Shin said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Kuu, I don’t think it’s possible.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha, however, mercilessly denied such a possibility.</p>
<p>“It’s not the same as you did with Kagerou?”</p>
<p>“Kagerou is like a comrade for me. That’s why I understand. Kagutsuchi is a Divine Beast and it understands human speech too. But Baltan is very different from us.”</p>
<p>Their role in the world, species, and ecology were all different. Yuzuha added that there was not a language common to all monsters.</p>
<p>“I can talk with monsters of my species or similar species, but Baltan and I are too different.”</p>
<p>In this world, most people spoke the same language.</p>
<p>Some species used unique alphabets, but they were only used on very rare occasions within the same species, so not knowing them would never be an inconvenience.</p>
<p>Among human-like creatures, then, there would never be a situation in which communication was impossible.</p>
<p>For Shin and the others, Yuzuha and Baomultan both belonged to the monster category, so they thought that they could communicate normally.</p>
<p>“I see…not all people speak in the same language either, after all. I guess it can’t be that easy.”</p>
<p>In Shin’s former world, it was common for people from different countries to speak different languages. To not be able to communicate with other human beings was a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>Considering this, Yuzuha’s explanation made sense.</p>
<p>They decided that they would try once, just in case, then moved to the next topic— or tried to, but Hydro and Oxygen stopped them.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, you two?”</p>
<p>“Shin, You’re talking like it’s completely normal, but who is that boy? Or girl? I mean, I see the name, but it’s beyond our imaginations…”</p>
<p>“If what we see is not wrong, it’s an Element Tail? A real one?”</p>
<p>“Kuu?”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro stared intently at Yuzuha, who was perplexed by their reaction. Shin’s party was used to her, but their reaction was the normal one.</p>
<p>Shin had asked them to stop calling him master, so both Oxygen and Hydro started addressing him without titles.</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s a real Element Tail. A lot of things happened, and now she’s my partner monster.”</p>
<p>“I thought Divine Beasts were impossible to tame, but you overcame even that…I’d like to know what happened in detail. Oh, and can we take some of her hair as a sample? I’d like to perform an endurance test.”</p>
<p>“I’m intrigued too. Could we have some tears too? There’s a concoction I would like to try.”</p>
<p>“Hey now, you two…”</p>
<p>Shin was sure that they were really interested only in experimenting. After hearing the conversation, Yuzuha hid behind him.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, we are just joking, of course. We would never use Shin’s partner for an experiment!”</p>
<p>“Of course not~.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t sound like a joke when you two say it…”</p>
<p>“True, true.”</p>
<p>Filma commented with a sigh, followed by Sety nodding. They were a High Lord and High Pixie duo, so their words and movements were pretty similar.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I suppose we went a little overboard. Let us be a little more serious, then.”</p>
<p>“Just a little?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha!”</p>
<p>Shin wondered if Hydro had always been like that, but he didn’t know the other support characters’ personalities in detail, so he concluded that she probably was always like this.</p>
<p>“Back to the topic of Baltan, then.”</p>
<p>Shin returned the conversation on the right track and Tiera raised a hand.</p>
<p>“Ehm, that…Baltan, right? It appears to purify the land, right? In that case, I might be able to help too.”</p>
<p>Shin had started calling Baomultan by its nickname, so Tiera adopted it too.</p>
<p>After learning about Baomultan’s abilities, she thought that maybe she could help it with her own.</p>
<p>Shin, however, shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, Baltan’s purification has nothing to do with miasma. Everyone started saying it absorbed pollution, so that became the common term, but it actually isn’t all bad stuff. I guess it would be more correct to say that…it takes in minerals that are oversaturated in one spot and redistribute them. When certain things accumulate too much in the same place, the environment and ecology can be damaged.”</p>
<p>“So it’s like when plants absorb too much nutrients and dry up instead?”</p>
<p>Tiera apparently grasped the concept and tried giving her own interpretation.</p>
<p>Its redistribution of materials was the reason why Baltan was called the “environmental protection” monster.</p>
<p>Probably because of the game settings, unnatural concentrations of specific materials sometimes randomly appeared. After Baomultan appeared, the affected area would return to normal.</p>
<p>The areas visited by Baomultan became rich in resources because their balance was restored and resources were better distributed, or so the players thought.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough to explain the phenomenon, but in this world there were many elements that did not exist in reality, so accepting that explanation was the only way.</p>
<p>Baomultan could even restore haunted forests and cursed lands, so it definitely had abilities other than absorption.</p>
<p>“Yes, I think you got the gist of it. Of course, it also absorbs materials that would clearly have negative effects. I didn’t see it all with my own eyes, so you just need to remember that it doesn’t just remove impurities.”</p>
<p>“Okay. So does that mean that there is an unnatural concentration of something in Romenun now? If you say that the vegetation is currently receiving negative effects, I think I can see it…”</p>
<p>Tiera recalled the plants she saw on her way to the building.</p>
<p>Elves could sense the state of plants and the earth. She had felt that the situation was like what Shin explained.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. Baomultan didn’t come to purify Romenun.”</p>
<p>“I thought so. That’s the normal state of Romenun’s vegetation, after all.”</p>
<p>Oxygen answered Tiera’s question, then Schnee interjected.</p>
<p>Tiera was mildly shocked to learn that the plants she saw were in their “normal” state, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>Baomultan often appeared in areas so unnaturally changed that they seemed to be rotting, in decay.</p>
<p>Around Romenun there were many plants scattering status ailments only because of the effects of the guild house, but the land itself was in its normal state.</p>
<p>“…is it Durgin?”</p>
<p>Shin mentioned the name of a monster that formed a “duo” with Baomultan.</p>
<p>Durgin also removed pollution from the earth, but it didn’t purify it like Baomultan, it simply absorbed noxious elements into its body.</p>
<p>The difference was that it couldn’t purify the land like Baomultan did.</p>
<p>“Correct. I think it happened about 500 years ago, after there was a large tremor and Romenun’s position changed from its original one. A Durgin fell on the area next to Romenun, and it was larger than any Durgin I had ever seen.”</p>
<p>Hydro’s words suggested that she probably did not know about the Dusk of Majesty. The tremors and Romenun’s movement were probably caused by the crustal shift that occurred after the Dusk of Majesty.</p>
<p>Durgin fell into a lake formed by the crustal shift, but did not float to the surface or move.</p>
<p>Hydro added that the fall probably killed it, or it was already dead.</p>
<p>“After that, it was truly horrible. Maybe because it released everything it had absorbed until then, the lake turned a nasty color and the smell was foul too. The land around it started changing colors too. The area under Romenun’s influence was safe, but the rest turned a horrible color, a sort of greenish-black, in a radius of about 5 kemel.”</p>
<p>The land was dying: it was a scenery so horrible that such words came to mind.</p>
<p>The Durgin had probably absorbed noxious elements beyond its capacity and then turned into a poison itself.</p>
<p>It was said that some could contaminate the earth when they landed and could spoil the very air.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the original relationship of Durgin gathering pollution and Baomultan purifying would be broken.</p>
<p>Baomultan could not purify such an extent of pollution.</p>
<p>“If I recall correctly, the first Baomultan arrived about 1 year later, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think that’s about right. The Durgin was pretty large, so the Baomultan was rather large too. We’re used to seeing it by now, so it doesn’t really feel big anymore.”</p>
<p>Oxygen thought for a bit, then replied to Hydro’s question.</p>
<p>“The first? Do you mean that others came?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that the first Baomultan probably failed to purify the pollution completely, but Hydro and Oxygen both shook their heads.</p>
<p>“No, only one Baomultan came. It probably reached full capacity, though, because it didn’t stay long.”</p>
<p>It couldn’t fully purify the pollution and was severely exhausted, so after about 1 year it died.</p>
<p>“From here started phenomenons outside our knowledge. We were really surprised, I tell you. We tried burying the dead Baomultan, but its corpse disappeared, replaced by another Baomultan.”</p>
<p>More precisely, the remains of the dead Baomultan slowly turned transparent and disappeared, then after it vanished completely another Baomultan appeared out of the empty space.</p>
<p>“After witnessing it, I thought that Baomultan had a phoenix-like ability, that allowed it to return to life after death.”</p>
<p>“I, instead, thought that Baomultan wasn’t a monster, but a purification device created by the planet to protect itself.”</p>
<p>They were both researchers at heart, so they started theorizing about Baomultan’s abilities.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, how did monsters increase?</p>
<p>Some monster species had both male and female versions, but they were rare cases.</p>
<p>Cashmere’s monster ranch mainly housed tamed monsters.</p>
<p>Shin had heard Cashmere mention about monster babies being born, so she might have been knowledgeable about it.</p>
<p>“Okay, setting Baomultan’s ecology aside for a moment…how’s the current situation?”</p>
<p>“The purification progressed, I’d like to say, but it looks like it will still take a long time. Just how much had that Durgin accumulated? Since we know how it looked like at first, we can tell that things are getting better, but I guess it will look different in your eyes. We can only stay in that area for 30 minutes max.”</p>
<p>Baomultan’s area was on the opposite side of the direction Shin’s party came from, beyond Romenun.</p>
<p>Shin knew that Hydro and Oxygen had high resistance to status ailments, as they had to perform all sorts of experiments, so if even they had a time limit the area had to be incredibly polluted.</p>
<p>“Should I go take a look?”</p>
<p>“It would be really helpful. We’ll explain what we discovered first. You’ll probably find it hard to believe, though.”</p>
<p>After this premise, Hydro started talking.</p>
<p>At first, not even moss would grow in the polluted area.</p>
<p>At present the lake looked very different, it changed from a mass of sludge to a blue surface.</p>
<p>Even if it looked clean, though, it was actually something like sulfuric acid, a liquid that would melt anything it touched. The lake was also continuously spewing toxic gas.</p>
<p>The land too had regained a natural-looking color, but it exhaled toxic gases too, different than the ones emanating from the lake.</p>
<p>The toxic gases from the lake and the ground interacted with each other and covered the ground in a sort of mist 1-2 cemel thick. It had to be cleared before you could see the actual ground.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon that Hydro and Oxygen did not know about also occurred.</p>
<p>“There are flowers blooming. A lot of flowers of all colors, covering the ground…or, considering how it looks, covering the fog.”</p>
<p>Various flowers in full bloom, without any respect for the season, their usual habitat or the original vegetation.</p>
<p>“Are they really flowers?”</p>
<p>“We wondered that too and researched them, but did not find any poison or elements they wouldn’t naturally have. The fact that they grow and bloom there is unnatural, but we could not find anything strange about the flowers themselves.”</p>
<p>“The vapors, poison gas and the mist emanated by the lake and the ground are all noxious for plants. We can say with certainty that there are no places in that area without poison. Normally, it would be impossible for any plant to grow there. We tried planting Bluehinnes and Harbellas, which can absorb poison, but they shriveled and died in half a day.”</p>
<p>Hydro mentioned plants that were also used as ingredients for antidotes and potions that gradually restored HP. Shin was familiar with them too and knew their effects well.</p>
<p>Those plants had strong antitoxin effects and should be able to withstand even very strong poison. If they could only live for half a day, the area they were planted in had to be a land of death.</p>
<p>“Is Baltan exhibiting any strange behavior?”</p>
<p>If the situation was so unnatural, it might have affected the Baomultan too, so Shin asked about it to Hydro.</p>
<p>“It isn’t acting differently from what I know about it, at least for now. It moves a bit in the area, but it generally simply stares at the lake.”</p>
<p>“Normally it just needs to be there for the purification to take place. As far as we have observed, it’s completely calm.”</p>
<p>Baomultan did not need to eat. It was so docile that you could approach it and touch it, so it hadn’t caused problems at the moment.</p>
<p>Its personality was just as Shin remembered; Hydro and Oxygen had interacted with it several times, so now it recognized them as individuals.</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>Shin noticed something in what Hydro and Oxygen said.</p>
<p>When Baomultan completed a purification, it normally lied down on the ground and disappeared. Then useful metals could be excavated from the ground and the ground itself grew richer.</p>
<p>Judging from the way it disappeared, it didn’t look like it died, but more like it completed its task and was teleported somewhere else.</p>
<p>It sometimes looked at the players before disappearing; there had been barely any reports that a Baomultan died before fully purifying an area, too.</p>
<p>“…you said that it died many times, right? Do its remains disappear every time?”</p>
<p>Shin thought that if its remains did not disappear Hydro and Oxygen would have collected them for research, so he asked them about it.</p>
<p>“That always goes according to knowledge. We have witnessed it collapse multiple times, but it turned transparent and disappeared every time.”</p>
<p>“…by the way, the flowers started blooming after the first Baltan died, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so?”</p>
<p>Hydro said that the first Baltan appeared about 1 year after the Durgin fell. It was more than 500 years ago already.</p>
<p>Hydro asked Oxygen for confirmation, but after such a long time he couldn’t say it with confidence either.</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment. The research records from that time….here they are. Let’s see, 351 days after Baltan died the first sprouts were found, which increased day by day. Eventually they increased so much that we couldn’t keep track of the exact number.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro could stay in the polluted area only for a limited time, so they couldn’t record the exact number of the flowers.</p>
<p>“As expected of a researcher, you kept really precise records.”</p>
<p>Shin was impressed, he knew he wouldn’t be that diligent.</p>
<p>“Observation and recording are the basis of research, after all. This is all we have observed in the polluted area. Then there’s one thing that we noticed.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“It’s about the remains of the Durgin in the lake. Since Durgins and Baomultans are a set, we thought that the Durgin might come back to life too. It hasn’t moved at all in 500 years, though.”</p>
<p>It was a concern, but still just a possibility. Differently from Baomultans, Durgins were aggressive, so their ecology was still for the most part unknown.</p>
<p>“We’ve built a long relationship with that Baomultan, at this point. It looks like its memory resets every time it resurrects, but we’ve watched over it all this time, so we’re kind of attached. It’s nearing its limit now, so we might be getting a little nervous.”</p>
<p>About 10 years passed since the current Baomultan appeared, so based on past trends it should be nearing its death, Hydro continued.</p>
<p>Berett said that they couldn’t approach the area, but if Hydro and Oxygen wanted they could leave Romenun.</p>
<p>The reason why they did not do so was Baomultan’s presence. Even if it was a monster, they had grown attached to it.</p>
<p>“Let’s go take a look after lunch, then. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find out anything, but I want to see it with my own eyes. Even if it comes back to life, I’m sure I can chase it away.”</p>
<p>Shin trusted Hydro and Oxygen’s words, but after seeing the situation with his own eyes he could have a different impression.</p>
<p>Additionally, using skills such as 【Through Sight】, 【Far Sight】, and 【Clairvoyance】 he might also find out something about the Durgin’s remains.</p>
<p>“Thank you. We are pretty confident in our research skills, but as you know our fighting power is low!”</p>
<p>“Not much we can do about it.”</p>
<p>“No reason to be proud about it either…”</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen were far superior to average players in their field of research, but being specialized in research meant that their fighting power was low, or rather, they had little to no battle experience.</p>
<p>Even with level and stats inferior to theirs, it wouldn’t be difficult to defeat them with some battle experience.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, Tiera could probably win too.</p>
<p>“Besides, if you use the items you invented you can even win against people with higher stats, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s our job after all.”</p>
<p>Oxygen replied while blushing and Shin sighed.</p>
<p>They had little fighting experience and some of their stats were on the same level as advanced Chosen Ones, or a little lower. The stats they focused less on were probably around 300.</p>
<p>The tools they developed, however, covered such disadvantages more than enough. Battles weren’t only about punching each other, after all: they used all sorts of items causing status ailments.</p>
<p>Items that prevented status ailments were extremely rare and depending on the quality of the materials and skill of the creator, it could be possible to break through the protective effects of such items.</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen’s master was Hecate, the most knowledgeable among all Rokuten members about item crafting.</p>
<p>The items and materials she used had completely different rarity.</p>
<p>Normal resistances and immunities meant nothing: her items would break through them, inflict all sorts of status ailments and gradually lead the opponent to a nightmarish death.</p>
<p>Even Shin was careful not to risk having to fight her, despite being protected by most status ailments by his high immunities.</p>
<p>“I bet you made lots more in these 500 years.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, they have surely created dangerous items we have never heard of.”</p>
<p>“You know, there’s a word for people like you: “mad scientist”.”</p>
<p>Filma and Shibaid agreed that Hydro and Oxygen probably had many more dangerous tools up their sleeves, and Sety used a word she learned who knows where.</p>
<p>Shin mentally agreed with all three of them.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk again after lunch. I’ll borrow the kitchen, then.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it sure is nice to be able to eat Schnee’s cooking after all this time. Do you need me to show you the way?”</p>
<p>“No, I remember where it was. Do you have enough ingredients? I can bring more if you need anything.”</p>
<p>“I harvested this morning, but with these many people we’ll need a little more. I’ll go pick them up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you, then. I want to see what you have too.”</p>
<p>“Understood. Come this way, then.”</p>
<p>Hydro started walking in an affected way, maybe because she was leading Schnee.</p>
<p>Schnee sighed a little. Apparently Hydro’s passion for cute and beautiful things was still present.</p>
<p>“Sorry about her. Schnee is beautiful, so Hydro is feeling excited for the first time in a while.”</p>
<p>“I know she’s that kind of person, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Oxygen explained apologetically, but Shin told him not to worry. His personality was not as extreme as Hydro: on the contrary, he was pretty normal.</p>
<p>“Hmm, what can I say, I’m speechless.”</p>
<p>“I truly lament my lack of vocabulary.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro both felt their expression loosen as they tasted Schnee’s cooking.</p>
<p>Schnee prepared a simple menu: salad, soup, and pasta (carbonara).</p>
<p>The ingredients grown in Romenun had very high quality, thanks to the soil, fertilizer, and environment. Cooked with Schnee’s expertise, they would surely turn delicious.</p>
<p>Shin and the others were very satisfied too, of course.</p>
<p>“Cooking, hmm. I always thought that as long as you could have the necessary nutrition you didn’t need anything else, but after tasting something so delicious I must change my mind.”</p>
<p>“We can’t recreate this ourselves, though.”</p>
<p>“You have the time, so why don’t you train your Cooking skill?”</p>
<p>“That time is for research!!”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro turned down Schnee’s proposal in unison.</p>
<p>If they had the time to train their Cooking skill or anything else, they would use it for research. That was the basis for all their actions.</p>
<p>They were concerned about Baomultan also because it was a subject of research.</p>
<p>Many researchers cared little for anything they were not interested in. So Oxygen and Hydro had been created, and remained like that even now.</p>
<p>“That contradicts what you just said…”</p>
<p>“I said that I would have a change of mind, not that I would train my Cooking skill.”</p>
<p>“That’s just sophistry!”</p>
<p>Hydro did not seem to even register Filma and Sety’s interjections. In a way, she was refreshingly frank about it.</p>
<p>“We have had our enjoyment, now shall we proceed to the research? I’d like to observe you too, Shin, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“What did you say now, all casually like that?”</p>
<p>Even High Humans were subjects of observation. Oxygen and Hydro had not changed at all.</p>
<p>Shin checked how much poison resistance their equipment had. If it was higher than the equipment of Shin’s party, it would be dangerous for them to enter the area.</p>
<p>“I should have expected it, your equipment’s specs are higher than ours. To think there is such a gap between the items we made and the ones made by Shin.”</p>
<p>“The materials’ rarity is different too. The technique isn’t enough to cover for the base materials’ quality, after all.”</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen looked at Shin’s equipment and expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Shin thought they were using equipment Hecate gave them, but they were both using gear they crafted themselves.</p>
<p>“If we used the equipment Mistress Hecate gave us, we could probably stay in the area longer. We have our pride as researchers, though. We cannot rely forever on something that was given to us, you see”</p>
<p>Both Oxygen and Hydro strove to continue their research in order to one day create something on par too, then superior to Hecate’s creations.</p>
<p>“We’re going to use it this time, though. We cannot become a burden for you.”</p>
<p>“Can I see that equipment too, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. But I think you made these, Shin.”</p>
<p>Oxygen then showed Shin an accessory he knew well, the 『Age of Gods Earring』.</p>
<p>On request by Hecate, it was specialized to prevent and weaken status ailments caused via physical matter and even weaken the effects of attacks that broke through status ailment immunity, often used by the highest class of monsters.</p>
<p>Shin crafted them with the highest rarity materials available at the time, so paired with a High Human’s natural resistances they could prevent most status ailments not caused by magic.</p>
<p>“Your goal is this?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The materials are too rare for us to obtain, so we’re trying to get closer to it with other methods.”</p>
<p>“We still have a long way to go, though.”</p>
<p>“The results are showing, though. At least, back then I couldn’t have attached so many effects to these materials.”</p>
<p>Shin talked while looking at the full-face gas masks Oxygen and Hydro had created, called Prototype 6522.</p>
<p>Even with a high crafting level and advanced facilities, if the quality of the materials was poor there was a limit to what one could do.</p>
<p>Shin knew more or less what effects could be attached to the materials used to make Prototype 6522, and concluded that he wouldn’t have been able to craft the items he was looking at.</p>
<p>It was the result of Oxygen and Hydro’s efforts.</p>
<p>“It truly feels rewarding to hear that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right…”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro smiled proudly, praised by the creator of the items they were aspiring to one day overcome.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 2 Part 3</p>
<p>“This is….incredible.”</p>
<p>After checking their equipment, Shin’s group headed to Baomultan’s area. Hydro and Oxygen had explained how it looked, but even so he couldn’t hide his surprise.</p>
<p>“The earth is weak and the air impure, but the flowers are brimming with life. Something like this should only be possible around the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“It’s just as Tiera says. Looking at these flowers, I can see why your research didn’t find any abnormalities. Without seeing this environment, one would surely believe they were raised in a location with high quality water, soil and a perfect environment for them to grow in.”</p>
<p>Shin also thought they were impressive, but the two elves, Tiera and Schnee, praised the flowers in full bloom even more.</p>
<p>The flowers were completely different from the ones growing in Romenun: they were sets of toxic-looking and beautiful-looking ones.</p>
<p>“Since when did this area turn into this?”</p>
<p>“Let me see, they reached the edges of the area about 30 days after they started blooming. The flowers are blooming about 1 cemel from the spot where Baltan first died.”</p>
<p>The lake where the Durgin was sinking had a circular shape, about 400 mel in diameter. It was about one kemel away from the border with the Romenun area.</p>
<p>In the four kemel area on the opposite side of Romenun no flowers were blooming, it was just a barren wasteland.</p>
<p>“Looks like the flowers are blooming around the spot where the first Baltan died as their center. Its purification power might be somehow connected.”</p>
<p>It was hard to tell because of the lake and the border, but the flowers were blooming at a set distance from the Baomultan’s remains. Shin agreed that it was a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>Shin’s party proceeded, careful not to step on the flowers.</p>
<p>Nothing blocked their sight, so they could see the lake soon.</p>
<p>It looked like a lake of beautiful blue waters. It was hard to imagine that it was actually lethal.</p>
<p>“There it is.”</p>
<p>On the shore of the lake there was a massive silhouette, colored a burnt brown close to black.</p>
<p>Four robust limbs, a long tail equipped with a sharp blade and one set of wings. Its shape resembled a western dragon.</p>
<p>Its skin, however, was twisted as if it was scorched and its eyes clouded by what looked like stained glass.</p>
<p>Its wings were tattered, suggesting that it would hardly be able to fly. The blade on its tail was rusted and yellow, chipped here and there.</p>
<p>“That’s the monster that purifies the land?”</p>
<p>Tiera had already heard about Baomultan’s main features, but was still shocked after seeing it with her own eyes.</p>
<p>A monster that can purify the earth’s impurities. Despite possessing such an incredible ability, there was nothing sacred or pure-looking about its appearance.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strange to be confused by the large gap between its appearance and its abilities.</p>
<p>“It looks better when it appears, though. After some time passes, it turns like that.”</p>
<p>Before the purification begins, Baomultan is a beautiful dragon with white scales. In that state its character too is different: it flies away as soon as it sees someone approaching.</p>
<p>In that state it didn’t drop precious items, so most players left it alone.</p>
<p>“Looks like it noticed us.”</p>
<p>As Shin’s party approached Baomultan, still sitting down, turned its long neck towards them. It was looking directly at the group.</p>
<p>— 【Baomultan – Level 749】</p>
<p>— 【Weakened】</p>
<p>【Analysis】displayed information about Baomultan.</p>
<p>The weakened state was a sign of its impending demise. Hydro probably said it would die soon because she noticed the change in status.</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen waved to Baomultan, which cried in response. It was a mysterious sound, similar to a high-pitched flute.</p>
<p>”Looks like it’s interested in you and the others too, Shin.”</p>
<p>Baomultan slowly stood up and started walking towards the group.</p>
<p>If it was standing, its height reached about 5 mel, while its length was about 7 mel. It was one size larger than the Baomultan Shin remembered.</p>
<p>Baomultan approached the group, making barely a sound, and stretched its neck towards Hydro and Oxygen first.</p>
<p>The two talked to it and gently patted its head.</p>
<p>Although they couldn’t touch it with their bare hands due to the poison, Baomultan’s expression did not change at all.</p>
<p>Judging from its faint cries and the fact that it went closer to them, it was clear that Baomultan was happy.</p>
<p>It also looked like its tail was wagging a bit faster than before.</p>
<p>After a while, Baomultan turned towards Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“….what does this mean?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I have never seen one act like this before.”</p>
<p>“It also seems particularly interested in Shin…”</p>
<p>For Baomultan, all of the party members were supposed to be new faces, but for some reason it focused only on Shin.</p>
<p>Its clouded eyes made it hard to tell where it was actually looking, but Shin felt that he was being watched.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, can you try?”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Simply staring at each other wouldn’t solve much, so Shin asked Yuzuha to try to communicate with Baomultan.</p>
<p>“No good….hm?”</p>
<p>After a while, just when Shin was about to give up, something changed in Baomultan. Its body was enveloped in a white light, which gradually gathered around its face.</p>
<p>After the light disappeared, a diamond-like gemstone appeared. The fist-sized gem floated in the air in Shin’s direction.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 2 Part 4</p>
<p>Several days had passed since Baomultan gave the treasure gem to Shin.</p>
<p>The party focused on researching the various items they found.</p>
<p>They also tried determining the item’s components and elemental affinity.</p>
<p>—however…</p>
<p>“After so much research, all we could find out is that it had a strong light elemental affinity and emanates faint purification power…this item is truly a researcher’s bane.”</p>
<p>“The energy it contains is incredibly strong, though. If it can’t be extracted, there aren’t many ways to use it.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s one of those gimmick key items, you either throw it directly to the opponent or use it as it is, without any processing.”</p>
<p>Items that had very specific usages were not uncommon.</p>
<p>Keys that opened doors in special events only, key items that weakened specific monsters, items that couldn’t even be used as materials.</p>
<p>Most items in the “Key Items” column of the item box fell in this category.</p>
<p>“Since Baomultan gave it to us, I guess it has something to do with purification?”</p>
<p>“Judging by how it shines, I believe that is very plausible. The light it emanates has strong antitoxin properties too, so I can’t help but associate it with Durgin.”</p>
<p>“Why would it go all the way as to give it to Shin, then? It could simply use that force to purify the area…”</p>
<p>Shin and the others continued presenting various theories, sometimes agreeing, sometimes not.</p>
<p>Shin wondered if Baomultan understood that he could dive into the lake and wanted him to hit Durgin directly with the treasure gem, but concluded that he was probably thinking too much.</p>
<p>Baomultan gave the treasure gem to Shin on the day of their first meeting. It seemed unreasonable that Baomultan could tell Shin was able to approach Durgin at the time.</p>
<p>“In any case, thank you for crafting so much equipment. It might have been impossible to analyze the items up to this point without you.”</p>
<p>“That is but one of the results of our research.”</p>
<p>“There is still much room for improvement, but we are glad they were useful.”</p>
<p>Probably because the items didn’t follow the game’s standards, the game era analysis devices were powerless. The golden crystal found in Lanapacea and Baomultan’s treasure gem were both impossible to analyze.</p>
<p>Any results were produced but only by the devices Hydro and Oxygen invented.</p>
<p>They studied how the devices had produced their results, their internal structures, as well as the composition of items, and the devices’ mechanisms and internal workings.</p>
<p>For Hydro and Oxygen, all the machines Romenun was equipped with were also objects of research.</p>
<p>Based on the knowledge acquired from such research, they invented new original devices.</p>
<p>Among all guild houses, Demi Eden and Romenun contained the largest quantity of materials for creation, so they had all sorts of material at their disposal.</p>
<p>“I could learn about properties I didn’t know before too. I might be able to improve my creations even further.”</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen’s inventions only produced small results with the golden crystal and the treasure gem, but could tell much more about the other items.</p>
<p>Since the analysis of the two non-standard items was quickly curtailed, they tried analyzing other materials not present in Romenun, for a change of pace and to maybe find some hints.</p>
<p>Even if there was a large quantity of materials present in Romenun, it still didn’t encompass all of them.</p>
<p>Romenun tended to house vegetable materials, while Demi Eden focused on minerals: the stock depended on the owner’s frequently used items. Thus they analyzed minerals they had never tried before.</p>
<p>“In this world, you can try all sorts of things if you have the right ideas, after all. Before you could reinforce items to 50%, but now it goes all the way to 100%. Doubling an item’s effects isn’t a dream anymore.”</p>
<p>“That smile tells me that Shin and Mistress Hecate are truly made of the same mold…”</p>
<p>Oxygen looked at the grinning Shin and nodded to himself.</p>
<p>Apparently Hecate too would often flash such devilish grins.</p>
<p>Shin shook his head to bring himself back to a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Well, putting weapons aside…are there any other research methods? Honestly, I can’t think of anything else.”</p>
<p>Shin had Hydro and Oxygen attempt the magic power infusion-extraction method too, as well as Filma and Sety, who weren’t present when he first tried it.</p>
<p>As a result, they didn’t see anything, just like Shibaid. With such a small sample base, it was difficult to draw any conclusions.</p>
<p>“We’ve already used all our inventions, though. There are other things we’d like to try, but you certainly know what those are, yes?”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Hydro. There were other tests they could do, but they required having multiples of the items to test.</p>
<p>Since they had no guarantee of ever finding copies of the same item, they couldn’t risk using tests that might change the items irreparably. Thus they were completely stumped.</p>
<p>“About the treasure gem, if only we could talk with Baltan…”</p>
<p>Shin agreed too.</p>
<p>Baltan was its owner, after all. It had to know how to use the item.</p>
<p>Yuzuha said that similar monsters might be able to communicate with it, but monsters capable of speech were very few after all. Shin was already blessed enough by Yuzuha’s presence.</p>
<p>“I can think of someone who could help, but…”</p>
<p>Baomultan belonged to the dragon category: thinking about monsters that could communicate with it, Shin came up with a name.</p>
<p>The problem was that he couldn’t call it so casually. They acted together to defeat the evil deity, so if Shin explained the situation it would probably agree to cooperate.</p>
<p>Shin, however, was not sure to have it come just to act as interpreter.</p>
<p>“You know of a dragon capable of speech?”</p>
<p>“Do you know Tzaobath? It should be a pretty famous monster.”</p>
<p>“The Moonlight Reaper, right? I never saw it, but heard Mistress Hecate talk about it. So Tzaobath would be the someone you know?”</p>
<p>Hydro asked with a stern expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Exactly. Tzaobath might be willing to help. I just thought that if I had to ask it for help, I’d do it in a much worse situation. It’s immensely more powerful than normal bosses, after all. It was on our side for a while, but it was something else, I tell you.”</p>
<p>Excluding monsters outside the rules like Reforgerer, Tzaobath was one of the most powerful beings in THE NEW GATE.</p>
<p>It was not the most powerful because monsters too had opponents they had good or bad affinity with.</p>
<p>In terms of pure fighting power, the monsters with “God” in their name, which players referred to as “Divine class”, occupied the top spots of the ranking.</p>
<p>Tzaobath, however, was one of the strongest even among them. In a book Shin read in the guild during the game era, it was even called the “God-Killer Dragon”.</p>
<p>It was the most powerful dragon monster players could fight, barring a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Shin thought again that it was a real blessing that it didn’t attack unprovoked like before.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible that you could ask it for help…and that it can talk. I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>“I bet. Before you had no time to talk, you were usually dead as soon as you saw it…”</p>
<p>Being a monster in a game, it was possible to defeat Tzaobath.</p>
<p>Shin had fought and won against it too. At the time, he had all of Rokuten on his side, though.</p>
<p>They picked the ideal equipment, thoroughly studied its attack patterns and formulated a strategy before fighting.</p>
<p>Shin could still remember how fulfilling it felt to defeat it.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the first time they were utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>Even if they had the right equipment and knew its patterns, Tzaobath was so strong defeating it was never a guarantee. If they encountered it without being prepared, even Shin and the others could only flee.</p>
<p>Even Rokuten, lauded as the strongest, could do only so much. It was obviously the same for the other players too. Many players were annihilated before they even had a chance to escape.</p>
<p>As far as Shin knew, other than Rokuten only 3 guilds ever managed to defeat Tzaobath.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, Tzaobath remembered that we defeated it.”</p>
<p>Shin successfully defeated Tzaobath twice. Afterwards, it was defeated by other guilds.</p>
<p>It meant that the Tzaobath that Shin defeated had died.</p>
<p>In the game it was normal for defeated monsters to respawn, but Shin wondered if their memories were inherited as well.</p>
<p>“Well, it’d be faster to ask Tzaobath about that.”</p>
<p>They had other things to deal with at the moment, so Shin discarded that doubt.</p>
<p>“Let’s put Tzaobath as pending for now. I’ll go out a little, for a change of pace.”</p>
<p>“That thing you have been doing for a while?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I finally got the grasp of it. I’m thinking of using it for research somehow.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Hydro’s question, then explained himself.</p>
<p>They had tried most research methods currently available, so he hoped to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave that to you.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you two try it too?”</p>
<p>“Well, Schnee is a bit too stoic for us…we’ll do things our own way.”</p>
<p>They were good at using their heads, but not at moving their body. So Oxygen added while scratching one of his cheeks and looking in the distance. They would never skip on research, but were scared of Schnee.</p>
<p>“Well, you know her, Schnee is really serious.”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit too much for us, being specialized in mental work. I want to praise myself for not running away the first day, honestly!”</p>
<p>Shin thought Hydro was exaggerating, but Oxygen apparently agreed with her.</p>
<p>After all, everyone who received Schnee’s training until now -even the advanced Chosen One Wilhelm- said the same thing.</p>
<p>Shin wanted to defend her, but remembered the soldiers who agonized during the training, so he couldn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>“Even so, Shin continues to go train…might you have a masochist streak?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you say another word!! Of course I don’t!!”</p>
<p>One reason was that Schnee was in charge of training, but Shin could continue it also because he didn’t find it particularly harsh.</p>
<p>He was also very interested in the possibility of becoming able to do something he couldn’t during the game.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s do this.”</p>
<p>Shin left Romenun and activated a skill in an area temporarily reserved for training.</p>
<p>Shin tried moving his body, but it was forced to immobility.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, the magic power that tried moving his body scattered and the skill was canceled.</p>
<p>It was similar to the failed casting of a magic skill.</p>
<p>The fixed movements necessary to activate a skill were said to be like chanting for magic spells.</p>
<p>“Pheew….”</p>
<p>Shin did not lose focus and gathered magic power again.</p>
<p>He recalled how it felt when the previous skill was suppressed, confirmed that magic power was coursing through his whole body, then stepped forward.</p>
<p>What he performed was the Barehanded-type Martial skill 【Eight Petals Palm】.</p>
<p>The eight strikes, starting from a thrust, started cutting through the air. After the final roundhouse kick, Shin’s body stopped.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m finally getting it!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations. It’s showing results.”</p>
<p>Schnee, who had been watching Shin’s movements closely, smiled.</p>
<p>What Shin actually activated was not the skill 【Eight Petals Palm】, but the art 【Eight Petals Palm】.</p>
<p>Even if the movements were the same, its power and speed were inferior to the skill version.</p>
<p>But, since Shin performed it, the art would easily be more powerful than average skill users.</p>
<p>“It sure took a long time…it’s so easy when forging, why is it so hard with martial skills and magic…?”</p>
<p>Ever since coming to this world, Shin practiced magic manipulation techniques that didn’t exist in the game.</p>
<p>For players like Shin, magic power meant MP. It simply disappeared automatically when using skills, but here the user required a certain level of control.</p>
<p>They were especially important in Creation-type jobs such as forging or concocting.</p>
<p>The mysterious thing was that Shin could deftly control magic power while forging, even if he had never trained to do so.</p>
<p>In case of other skills, and especially martial ones, his grasp and manipulation of the flow of magic power were sadly lacking.</p>
<p>If the requirement was simply infusing magic power, he could do it easily.</p>
<p>“It’s probably true that things vary greatly if the target is a living creature or not. I recall hearing that the person who invented arts also said something similar.”</p>
<p>People used magic power unconsciously. Skills made it more powerful and gave it direction.</p>
<p>Movements and usage were fixed because they made magic power more powerful. So believed until now those who researched skills, or so Shin had heard from Schnee.</p>
<p>In regards to creation skills, since minerals and plants could not use their own magic power or resist outside interference, using magic power on them was easier.</p>
<p>“I think that a major factor is that using skills feels natural for us, as is entrusting our body to them. I had a hard time too, honestly.”</p>
<p>“That’s our “normal”, after all. In the game, suppressing skills or canceling them only meant creating openings, it would have been pointless.”</p>
<p>In this world, however, such actions had a point. In the game, it was impossible to feel magic power flowing through your body.</p>
<p>“Arts were invented by a cleric, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I don’t know if he truly existed, but records found in a church stated so.”</p>
<p>The person that invented arts was said to be a cleric, a normal person who could not use skills.</p>
<p>Shin too had connections with the church; curious about the topic, he asked them about it.</p>
<p>The Dusk of Majesty had plunged society into chaos.</p>
<p>Humans, who had inferior strength among the short-living species, would naturally seek salvation more than any other species.</p>
<p>The clerics born in that era faced the necessity of saving people but also fighting.</p>
<p>Thus they researched a way to fight for the sake of the weak, to ease their pain, even a little, even if they were unable to use skills.</p>
<p>They routed monster attacks and went personally to harvest materials to make medicine for those in need.</p>
<p>At the time clerics were also warriors, knights and researchers.</p>
<p>“It’s really amazing, thinking about it…the church became such a large organization thanks to people like them.”</p>
<p>If they simply continued preaching God’s word, the church would not be what it is now.</p>
<p>As they were frequently involved in battles, they could witness skills many times, so they could notice what was unique about them. The differences in the flow of magic power between those who used skills and those who couldn’t.</p>
<p>The cleric who noticed this performed further testing and research, ultimately succeeding in creating arts, a weaker version of skills.</p>
<p>The reason why both skills and arts were widely used was that skills were rare, but also that arts were easier to use and burdened the body less.</p>
<p>In this world leveling up still meant an increase in stats, but most people were born with the stats of an initial avatar, without any resurrection bonuses.</p>
<p>Naturally, their MP was lower than those with bonuses, so even if they obtained skills their low MP would prevent them from using skills repeatedly.</p>
<p>Since highly effective healing skills also had a usage limit, it was obvious that people would start fighting for the right to receive healing.</p>
<p>Skills required MP to be used and even the basic 【Heal】 could be used only about 10 times per day by an average person.</p>
<p>To reach max level and resurrect with higher stats was normal for players, but impossible for this world’s denizens, most of which would never even reach max level, further exacerbating the problem.</p>
<p>The average level of the people of this world varied by country, but was generally in the 20-30 range. Soldiers tended to be around 100. For a normal person, even 255 was an unattainable dream.</p>
<p>Those blessed with resurrection bonuses -in other words, Chosen Ones- rarely reached level 255.</p>
<p>If a substitute to skills -weaker but not requiring MP and easier to learn- appeared, what would happen? This world was the answer.</p>
<p>Highly effective but hard to learn 【Skills】 and weaker but easier to acquire 【Arts】 filled separate niches.</p>
<p>“Wow…you’re still doing it…?”</p>
<p>“Hey, no need to say it like that”</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee continued training seriously while talking. Eventually Sety approached them.</p>
<p>Her expression clearly showed that she thought Shin was a bit hopeless. She had looked at them before, but this time she apparently had something to say.</p>
<p>“I mean, you can use skills and have ridiculously high stats. What’s the point in learning to use arts?”</p>
<p>Sety didn’t mention it before, but she couldn’t understand why no matter how much she thought about it.</p>
<p>Shin was capable of repeatedly using not only basic 【Heal】 spells, but even area spells that brought down destruction and mayhem, so it was practically impossible for him to be out of MP.</p>
<p>He also had items that fully replenished MP.</p>
<p>“Schnee taught me this, but training to use arts also means that the skills will be powered up.”</p>
<p>“Skills also get powered up?”</p>
<p>Shin too was surprised the first time he heard about it.</p>
<p>“The manipulation of magic power within your body, which is necessary to use arts. Once you fully comprehend it, your understanding of skills deepens too. As a result you can increase the magic power infused in them and arrange them in various ways. It’s just like what you do when you adapt a spell to various situations. Doing this training would help you do that more smoothly and effectively.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, so that’s why…”</p>
<p>Sety had always stayed in the private area with the Tsumugins to protect it, so she wouldn’t know about it.</p>
<p>She did something similar on her own, however, as expected from a Pixie, specialized in magic.</p>
<p>“I suppose I should try it too, then.”</p>
<p>Sety decided that just looking would be a waste and tried activating a skill.</p>
<p>She was a mage, trained to fight as rear support; but to avoid being defeated as soon as the enemy managed to approach her, she had also learned close combat skills.</p>
<p>The skill she activated was one all mages were said to know, the Staff-type Martial skill 【Soundless】.</p>
<p>In terms of movement, it was a simple thrust attack.</p>
<p>Its power was weak, and, as mages usually had low STR, it would cause little damage. It was even called a “no damage skill”.</p>
<p>However, all mages learned it because it had 3 effects attached.</p>
<p>It was the fastest skill from activation to execution -though there were other skills with the same speed- and inflicted both knockback and stun.</p>
<p>Since it had multiple effects, it knocked back the target only a short distance and the stun time was brief, but it could sometimes activate even if the target equipped accessories that nullified such effects.</p>
<p>Its greatest advantage was being able to stop a player’s attacks and put distance between them.</p>
<p>“Mmngh…bwah!”</p>
<p>Sety wielded her staff, trembled for a bit, then collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>“This is hard…”</p>
<p>“Right? To grasp the flow of magic from that state is really hard.”</p>
<p>“The flow of magic power…can it be really so hard…?”</p>
<p>Sety sat up and pointed her right palm upwards. Without a sound, a fireball the size of a fist appeared.</p>
<p>“So this is an art. When I was still outside I never heard about anything like this…”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s an art.”</p>
<p>“You gotta be kidding me…”</p>
<p>Schnee looked at the fireball and stated that it was definitely an art, so Shin was surprised and shocked.</p>
<p>Sety had instantly grasped the feeling he had finally reached after many sessions of training. What she said was “hard” was only suppressing the skill, apparently.</p>
<p>“I’m not specialized in magic for nothing. Leave all your magic needs to Sety!”</p>
<p>Sety proudly puffed up her chest, a truly smug look on her face. She could arrange magic spells in her own style, after all: she was surely very proficient at controlling magic power.</p>
<p>“Want me to tell you a hint? Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Arrgh…”</p>
<p>It was all to be ready if a powerful enemy appeared; Shin suppressed his frustration and listened to Sety.</p>
<p>“First feel the magic power coursing through your body, then squeeze it and make it do what you want, then let it flow again. Repeat that to make the magic power that flows when you activate a skill turn into your own color. That’s the first step, at least.”</p>
<p>“How does that make sense!?”</p>
<p>Sety was the type that learned through practice rather than theory: unfortunately, Shin could not process her explanations.</p>
<p>“I believe she is talking about controlling the flow of magic power which activates automatically when you use a skill. To make it do what you say means to control the flow yourself. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right! As expected of big sis Schnee!”</p>
<p>Schnee translated Sety’s “practical” explanation. Elves were also proficient in magic, which probably helped her understand.</p>
<p>Shin also complimented her in his mind.</p>
<p>“To put magic power under your control, huh…”</p>
<p>Thanks to the magic power manipulation training, Shin felt that when he used martial skills magic power would flow from his heart to the whole body, while when using magic skills magic power would focus in one spot of his hands or feet.</p>
<p>While focusing on this, he tried activating a martial skill and controlling the flow of magic power to cover his whole body.</p>
<p>“Mmngh…”</p>
<p>But it didn’t go too well.</p>
<p>If he focused on the skill too much, the magic power would flow automatically and activate it.</p>
<p>Since he was so used to activating abilities through a skill to activate it, doing so via control of magic power was very problematic.</p>
<p>At the moment the most he could do was force his automatically moving magic power to stay still and prevent the skill from activating.</p>
<p>He previously succeeded because he kept his magic output low, adding just a bit more made it impossible to control well.</p>
<p>“Gah, it just won’t work.”</p>
<p>It was Shin’s turn to collapse on the ground.</p>
<p>He tried several times, but ended up just trembling, without anything happening. Maybe because he was doing something he wasn’t used to, he found himself drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>“This is normal for those used to skills. Let us persevere.”</p>
<p>“It took a long time to get to this point too, after all. Guess I shouldn’t give up yet.”</p>
<p>Shin knew that mastering the activation of arts meant that he would become able to reinforce his skills.</p>
<p>Things wouldn’t always go so well on the first attempt: Shin resolved again to continue practicing, little by little.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 3 Part 1</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since Shin’s party arrived in Romenun, when a sudden event occurred.</p>
<p>Shin was engaging in his new daily activity of practicing arts, when a shrill cry reached his ears.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin, that was…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, looks like we have an uninvited guest.”</p>
<p>The cry came from Baomultan. Its shrill voice sounded like it was crying for help.</p>
<p>Shin expanded his detection range and found 6 presences around Baomultan.</p>
<p>Of the 6 presences surrounding Baomultan, 3 of them were approaching it, then stepping away, all from different directions. They were probably attacking it while preventing it from focusing on a single target.</p>
<p>[[[Emergency! Baomultan seems to be under attack! Anyone who can move, gather immediately!]]]</p>
<p>Shin had access to Romenun’s functions, so he used them to send a message throughout the guild house. Schnee, Tiera, Yuzuha, and Filma, who were training with him, took out their weapons immediately.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Shibaid and the others arrived too. Hydro and Oxygen were equipped not with the gear they invented, but what they received from Hecate.</p>
<p>“We don’t know the enemy’s goal. From the icons’ movements, I believe they are attacking Baomultan, but it’s not clear. Don’t attack them out of the blue.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know, let’s go already!”</p>
<p>Tiera’s words reflected everyone else’s feelings as they looked at Shin. Tiera was scared of Baomultan during their first encounter, but now it spontaneously approached her.</p>
<p>“Don’t go too close. If they are fighting, Baomultan might attack us too.”</p>
<p>Shin said to Tiera as they headed towards the area. The other members had seen Baomultan attack other players, so they would probably be wary.</p>
<p>“Will it attack us too?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say anything yet, unfortunately. I do hope it doesn’t.”</p>
<p>Shin also thought he had become friends with Baomultan, so it would hurt emotionally if it attacked them. In that case, regardless of the attackers’ objective, Shin thought they deserved at least one good punch.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re really fighting.”</p>
<p>“I was sure that no normal people would ever come all the way here, but it looks like these people are pretty strong.”</p>
<p>Once they crossed the forest-like clusters of plants, the view became clear. The members who could use 【Far Sight】 already looked at Baomultan and its surroundings.</p>
<p>They saw three people in full body armor, two in robes, and one wearing a cleric garb.</p>
<p>The armored warriors approached Baomultan from the left and right to attract its attention while the two in robes launched fire and lighting spells. The cleric-like member simply held a staff high and did nothing else.</p>
<p>Baomultan was struck by the magic spells and cried, probably because it was in a weakened state. It did not move much, if at all. Its tail and claw attacks struck the armored warriors. However, they protected themselves with their shields, so they were not blown away and simply retreated a few steps, then resumed the original formation. If the battle continued like that, there was a possibility that Baomultan would be killed by them.</p>
<p>However, there was something unusual about the attackers. They were all affected by poison and paralysis and continued healing themselves, but the recovery speed was clearly too slow.</p>
<p>“Stop the fight!!”.</p>
<p>Shin, Filma, and Shibaid leaped in the air and landed in front of the armored warriors. Kagerou then howled, attracting the attention of the robed spellcasters and the cleric.</p>
<p>Shin, Filma, and Shibaid had their defenseless backs turned towards Baomultan, but they were prepared for the possibility that it attacked them.</p>
<p>“W-what are you people!?”</p>
<p>One of the armored warriors drew his sword and shouted. Only his eyes were visible through the armor and his voice was muffled, but it was clear that he was a man.</p>
<p>“We have our own reasons. Why are you people attacking Balt…Baomultan, anyway? This monster doesn’t harm people.”</p>
<p>Shin pretended he wasn’t about to say “Baltan” and questioned the man who shouted.</p>
<p>If they had mistakenly thought that the poison covering the area was generated by Baomultan, Shin planned to explain the situation.</p>
<p>“People in this land of death?”</p>
<p>“What a powerful presence…we cannot win.”</p>
<p>The other two armored warriors seemed to be shaken. One of them had apparently perceived the strength of Shin’s party, as he abandoned the fighting stance and raised his hands.</p>
<p>The spellcasters and the cleric looked left and right, trying to assess the situation.</p>
<p>“We have no intention to fight. We wish to speak with you.”</p>
<p>“…are you…human?”</p>
<p>The armored warrior who shouted first asked this question to Shin.</p>
<p>They were acting as if it was nothing, but the area they were in was a place filled with deadly poison, where normal people would fall to the ground writhing in pain after just breathing the air a little.</p>
<p>Someone who didn’t know Shin and the others couldn’t believe any human being would enter such an area without a protective mask or helmet, showing their face like that.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strange for their humanity to be doubted.</p>
<p>“We are. We don’t need to hide our mouths like you because we have an accessory protecting us from the poison. You have some decent equipment, can’t you see that we do too?”</p>
<p>Shin noticed that they were wearing medium or possibly inferior Mythology-grade equipment.</p>
<p>In a world where even Legend-grade equipment was treated as national treasures, they were all clad in equipment even superior to that. They were definitely bizarre by this world’s standards.</p>
<p>They were either related to players or were players themselves. Or maybe some special corps skilled enough to be assigned such equipment. These were all plausible options.</p>
<p>“Our equipment is…decent..? No, one look at your equipment is enough to understand. Lower your weapons, everyone. Resisting them would be pointless.”</p>
<p>The man Shin spoke with seemed to be the leader: other than the armored man who had already put down his weapon, everyone else lowered theirs.</p>
<p>“Thank you for putting down your weapons. I would like to start our talks immediately…but first, let us offer a safe place to do so. You won’t last long with that equipment.”</p>
<p>The attackers’ HP was gradually decreasing as they talked.</p>
<p>Shin knew they couldn’t talk like that, so he took a card out of his item box and materialized it.</p>
<p>What materialized in Shin’s hand was a blue rhombus-shaped pendant. He then threw it in a direction away from the lake.</p>
<p>Before hitting the ground, the pendant glowed brightly, revealing a log house after the light dissipated.</p>
<p>“The poison won’t affect us there. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Shin went inside the log house first, followed by Schnee and Shibaid. He asked Filma and Sety to watch over Baomultan via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>The attackers’ leader hesitated a little, then shook his head and entered the log house. The other members quickly followed him, paying attention to Baomultan, Schnee, and the others.</p>
<p>“We’ll be safe here. The poison’s effects are gone, right?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it…the poison is really gone.”</p>
<p>The first one to respond to Shin’s words was the cleric. The equipment covered everything but the eyes, but the voice revealed that she was a woman.</p>
<p>Once she removed her equipment, since her body did not show any particular features, Shin thought that she was probably a Human.</p>
<p>“You’re the healer, don’t remove your equipment first!”</p>
<p>“What’s the use of being suspicious now? If this boy planned to get rid of us, he wouldn’t have led us in here, one skill and we were gone. Am I right?”</p>
<p>The cleric spoke so frankly that even her comrades were at a loss for words. In terms of possibility, something was like that was indeed possible for Shin.</p>
<p>“We truly wish to talk with you, can I assume that you believe us?”</p>
<p>“It would be pointless to do this if you were lying, I suppose. We’d appreciate it if you listened to our circumstances too.”</p>
<p>“It would be a problem if you didn’t talk, actually.”</p>
<p>Shin answered the cleric with a wry laugh. Thanks to their exchange, the other members removed their equipment too.</p>
<p>“Let’s start from introductions. I’m Shin, a Human. The Elf is Yuki, the Dragnil Shibaid. Together with the people outside, we’re all adventurers.”</p>
<p>Sety wasn’t registered with the guild yet, but, since it would be troublesome to explain, Shin said they were all adventurers. Incidentally, Yuki was a fake name used by Schnee.</p>
<p>“So we’re in the same business. Let us introduce ourselves too, then. I am Garon, a Dwarf. I’m wearing armor like this now, but my main job is blacksmith.”</p>
<p>Garon removed his helmet and introduced himself while caressing his long beard.</p>
<p>He was about as tall as Tiera, with thick arms and broad shoulders, so he looked wider than he was tall. He was equipping a large round shield and a mace.</p>
<p>“My name’s Mavlov. I’m a bear Beast, as you can see.”</p>
<p>Mavlov also removed his helmet before introducing himself. He wasn’t as tall as Shibaid, but he was easily over 2 mel tall. He was the one who suspected the humanity of Shin’s party. He was equipping a tower shield over 1 mel tall and a mace.</p>
<p>“Agarj, wolf beast.”</p>
<p>The final armored warrior, who spoke in a slightly nervous tone, was named Agarj. He held kite shields on both hands.</p>
<p>Like Mavlov, he was a Beast type that looked like the base animal in human form. He was rather large, though not as much as Mavlov; standing next to Garon, they made him look like he was a child compared to them.</p>
<p>“My name is Risha, I’m a Human like you.”</p>
<p>Risha had the air of a tough, gutsy mother. She looked like nothing would scare her easily.</p>
<p>“Asha, Human.”</p>
<p>“Mesha, Human.”</p>
<p>The last ones to introduce themselves were two young girls, apparently twins. They were a bit taller than Sety and holding staffs taller than themselves.</p>
<p>Apparently they could turn their gear into cards, which they did after removing it.</p>
<p>“So, why were you fighting with Baomultan? As I said before, there’s no need to pick such a dangerous fight, is there?”</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t be doing this if we could avoid it either. At this point I care little about money or honor.”</p>
<p>In other words, they had a reason to engage in such recklessness.</p>
<p>“(Schnee, I can’t tell for sure, aside from the twins, aren’t they all pretty old?)”</p>
<p>Shin asked Schnee a question via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>The Human Risha’s white hair and wrinkles clearly showed that she was of advanced age.</p>
<p>Mavlov and Agarj retained an animal-like face and Dwarves like Garon looked old no matter their age, so Shin couldn’t tell their actual age.</p>
<p>Their tone, gestures, and atmosphere, however, made Shin wonder if they weren’t all pretty old.</p>
<p>“(All the men are, yes. I believe they are more than 70 years old. For short-living species, they are quite advanced in age.)”</p>
<p>Schnee could apparently tell, but refrained to comment on the female member for some reason.</p>
<p>According to Schnee, even if in that world skills and magic potions existed, short-living species could not expect to live very long lives.</p>
<p>“The twins weren’t supposed to come this time.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>Mavlov talked while looking at the girls.</p>
<p>“The request we received is a very important one: the existence of a country depends on this. If someone has to die, it would be best for someone old relics like us.”</p>
<p>The eyes of the adults of the group focused on the girls.</p>
<p>In case of emergency, they probably planned for the two of them to escape safely.</p>
<p>“Er…sorry but it doesn’t look like we can do anything about that. Could you get to the point?”</p>
<p>Mavlov’s words seemed to upset the twins, so before the topic derailed further Shin brought it back to the original one.</p>
<p>“My apologies. Let me explain now. Our goal is Baomultan’s materials: we need them to craft equipment in order to defeat a certain monster. That’s the request we took.”</p>
<p>“And that certain monster is?”</p>
<p>A name flashed in Shin’s mind.</p>
<p>“A monster called Durgin. If you know Baomultan, you’ve probably heard about it as well, yes?”</p>
<p>Shin’s prediction turned out to be true. A Durgin other than the one sunk into the lake was apparently up to something.</p>
<p>“Well, more or less. Just to be sure, the extermination request didn’t come just because a Durgin was spotted, right?”</p>
<p>“If that was the case, we wouldn’t have accepted it…”</p>
<p>Garon added that in Durgin’s case, extermination requests would not be posted if it was only spotted and caused no damage.</p>
<p>“Durgin is threatening our country as we speak. That’s why the extermination request was created.”</p>
<p>“Durgin is threatening your country? You mean that it’s going to attack it?”</p>
<p>As far as Shin knew, Durgin only attacked players if they entered within a certain radius.</p>
<p>Shin initially thought that someone had probably provoked it.</p>
<p>“Exactly. At first it was just flying over the country, but 2 weeks ago it descended, spreading poison in the surroundings. There aren’t any casualties yet, but a growing number of people have been rendered unable to move.”</p>
<p>“Is there a possibility that someone attacked Durgin?”</p>
<p>“I cannot say there isn’t. In that case, however, it would come to attack directly, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>Apparently, Durgin had been flying back and forth over the country for one month.</p>
<p>As Garon said, if it wanted to retaliate after being attacked, it wouldn’t do something like that.</p>
<p>“Have you noticed anything else?”</p>
<p>“Nothing that could prove useful. We only came to find Baomultan because we happened to find records about it.”</p>
<p>“Is it a well-known fact that Baomultan is here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how well-known it is, but most people know about it in our country. It’s a popular tale. Deep within the mists of death lives a dragon that feeds on poison. If you don’t behave I’m going to leave you in the dragon’s den…parents commonly say this to children to keep them quiet.”</p>
<p>It was a variation of the common “if you don’t behave, ___ will come to get you!” spiel parents would use with unruly kids.</p>
<p>It was used as a fairytale, but the mists of death really existed and the country’s top brass, as well as the guild’s executives knew about the dragon’s existence. Thus Garon’s party was sent to retrieve its parts.</p>
<p>“Since fighting Durgin without poison resistant equipment would be difficult, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Even if we try fighting it, the most we can do is resist the poison without dying.”</p>
<p>In the game, poison would gradually decrease HP, but in reality it wouldn’t be so simple.</p>
<p>Weak poison would be one thing, but powerful poison like the one Durgin used would prevent anyone affected from even moving properly.</p>
<p>Durgin scattered the most powerful type of poison: 【High Poison】.</p>
<p>For Shin it was a rather common status ailment, but apparently it was being buffed by something, as it took a very long time to heal.</p>
<p>Anyone affected needed to be healed too, so, even if they focused on defense and healing, they could barely keep alive, said Garon.</p>
<p>“How high is Durgin’s level? I’m sure it usually varies a lot.”</p>
<p>“672. If it wasn’t for the poison, I’m sure we could take it down, even if it meant sacrificing our lives…”</p>
<p>The level was not too high.</p>
<p>Garon’s party was equipped with Mythology-grade equipment, and, judging from how they fought, they had good control of their weapons and it didn’t look like they were suffering from penalties because of lacking stats. If all of them were like that, they were quite powerful by this world’s standards. Even in the game era, with the right strategy they could surely win. The problem was, just like Garon said, countering the poison.</p>
<p>“The level is the same as the Durgin I know. But it sounds like its poison was boosted by something. Could it be that it was instigated to attack your country?”</p>
<p>“Ours is a small country with little to no strength, though? I can’t think of anything that could be earned by attacking us.”</p>
<p>The country, Passner, was a small kingdom located to the north of Baomultan’s area. When many new countries were founded after the Dusk of Majesty, Passner was built in a relatively dangerous area to reduce the appeal of outside forces coming to take it over.</p>
<p>Passner was not easily accessible and did not have any particularly interesting specialties. It was so small that there was little distance between the royal family, the nobles, and the common folk and it was ruled in a generally peaceful way. Being close to Baomultan’s area, there were very few powerful monsters in the surroundings, so it was perfect to spend one’s old years, or so Garon explained.</p>
<p>“We were relatively famous adventurers once, but now we’re just a bunch of old geezers. We’re supposed to be Chosen Ones, but we can’t move like we did anymore. This time it’s different, though: we have to do something about Durgin. What do you plan to do with us?”</p>
<p>Garon’s whole body projected intimidation.</p>
<p>His party intended to defeat Baomultan, while Shin’s wanted to protect it. Shin could clearly feel that Garon’s party would fight if Shin and the others stood in their way, even if they knew that they were no match for Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“We have our own reasons for not letting you defeat Baomultan.”</p>
<p>Shin understood their circumstances, but had no intention of letting them have their way.</p>
<p>“Is that so. Unfortunately—”</p>
<p>“There is one more thing I would like to confirm, though. Do you mind?”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>
<p>Garon’s words were interrupted by Shin’s question and the Dwarf found himself in an awkward posture. He was probably going to draw his weapon.</p>
<p>“Basically, all you need is a way to counter Durgin’s poison, right? If you had that, you wouldn’t need Baomultan’s materials anymore.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We took this risky route just because we had no other options.”</p>
<p>Shin asked for further confirmation and Garon nodded with conviction in response. Risha probably understood what Shin was going to say and looked at him with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“So if I can provide that poison resistant equipment all our problems will be solved, am I right?”</p>
<p>“What are you…no, after all you all were here in this area of deadly poison as if it doesn’t affect you…”</p>
<p>Garon recalled that Shin’s party wasn’t constantly healing themselves, nor equipped with any masks or other protection: they were walking in the poison mists as if they were taking a stroll through town.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s okay for us to ask, but…what exactly are you people?”</p>
<p>Risha, who had been quiet during the conversation, finally joined in. Shin turned towards her, thinking that she probably didn’t like the fact that he offered to give them equipment all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“We’re suspicious, is that what you mean to say?”</p>
<p>“More than suspicious, you’re incomprehensible. Your equipment is so full of magic power that it’s giving me the chills just by looking at it. But you’re wearing it as if it was completely normal. Are you sure you aren’t monsters?”</p>
<p>Risha, the party’s cleric, seemed especially sensitive in regards to magic power. She could probably tell what grade Shin and the others’ equipment was too.</p>
<p>“Risha! Why do you address them with such disrespect?”</p>
<p>“Don’t stop me, Mavlov. We don’t have time to waste chatting like this. We can’t stay here leisurely reading each other’s intentions, can we?”</p>
<p>Mavlov tried to appease Risha, but she wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p>Durgin could be attacking the country as they spoke. If they returned to find the kingdom in ruins it would all be pointless.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Let us reveal our identities then. We are Schnee Raizar’s party members. I’m the blacksmith of the group.”</p>
<p>While talking with Garon, Shin and the others had discussed this plan via Mind Chat, and finally put it into action. When in trouble, go with Schnee Raizar.</p>
<p>“Schnee…Raizar?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard the name before?”</p>
<p>“Of course we have. I did wonder if it was really her, but since you spoke first…”</p>
<p>Apparently, they had seen Schnee once, but many years ago.</p>
<p>Since she was introduced not as Schnee, but Yuki, and Shin spoke for the party, they thought she just resembled Schnee.</p>
<p>Schnee was not using her camouflage this time.</p>
<p>Female Elves, however, all had beautiful features and usually had long hair. Silver hair and blue eyes was a common combination, so there were many similar-looking Elves.</p>
<p>“Allow me to introduce myself again. My name is Schnee Raizar. Let me talk from now on.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>“Wait just a moment. What proof do you have that you’re the real one?”</p>
<p>Garon was intimated by Schnee’s smile, so Risha stepped forward in his stead.</p>
<p>“You’re being disrespectful again…”</p>
<p>“The fate of the country is at stake! Don’t go all gaga just because she’s pretty!”</p>
<p>Garon tried to stop Risha again, but she retorted sharply. Her eyes were serious, clearly expressing that she didn’t tolerate lying.</p>
<p>“Proof…well, if you can use 【Appraisal】 you could try removing my camouflage, if you think I am using one.”</p>
<p>“You’re stronger than us, though. Even if you showed camouflaged fake stats, we wouldn’t see through them.”</p>
<p>It was an effective method if the user’s stats were superior to the target, but if the user was inferior the result would be like Risha said.</p>
<p>“Mmgh…what about her guild card?”</p>
<p>“It’s just issued as a placeholder, so I wouldn’t call it proof.”</p>
<p>“So…how about we materialize Tsuki no Hokora?”</p>
<p>Tsuki no Hokora was classified as “Whereabouts: Unknown” officially. In this world, Tsuki no Hokora was known as Schnee Raizar’s shop, so they thought it could work as proof.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard about Tsuki no Hokora, but I’ve never seen it with my own eyes. If you had a good fake, I’m not sure I could tell.”</p>
<p>“Even if you say that…”</p>
<p>Since Risha had never seen the real Tsuki no Hokora, she couldn’t be sure that whatever Shin materialized was real or fake.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, proving one’s identity in a situation like this was rather difficult. The guild card too, even if it couldn’t be used you could present someone else’s card to fake your identity.</p>
<p>Showing proof of identity was more complicated than expected.</p>
<p>“…I have a proposal, can I speak?”</p>
<p>Shin’s party was wondering what else they could do, when Agarj, who had kept quiet the whole time after introducing himself, raised a hand.</p>
<p>“Please. Any method would be welcome.”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you one thing first, don’t misunderstand. Could you let me smell her?”</p>
<p>“Smell?”</p>
<p>Agarj was a wolf-type Beast, so his sense of smell was probably very sharp. Shin didn’t see how it could be useful in this instance, though.</p>
<p>“Let me explain. Before I joined Garon’s party, I used to be in Falnido. It was just a short while, but I stood on the frontlines with the First King, Girard. I don’t know if you remember, but it was when Lord Girard and Lady Raizar fought together.”</p>
<p>Agarj’s sense of smell was apparently unusually keen even among other wolf-type Beasts: he said that he remembered Schnee’s smell and could use it to verify her identity.</p>
<p>“I just need to smell her weapon. I remember well the smell of Lord Girard’s Swift Fang. It’s still in my memory, though, so I don’t know if it can count as proof.”</p>
<p>“No, that is enough. Your nose can be trusted. I have no doubts.”</p>
<p>Agarj said the last words apologetically, but Mavlov, standing next to him, spoke with confidence. They were bear and wolf, but both being Beasts, Mavlov too knew that such senses could be trusted.</p>
<p>“Yes, his nose has saved us plenty of times already. If he says you are the real one, I will believe it.”</p>
<p>After Mavlov, Garon nodded too. At the same time, Asha and Mesha were nodding too.</p>
<p>“Well, I do know that I’m asking for a lot. I’m not going to doubt the words of a comrade.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Risha, who raised both hands in surrender.</p>
<p>“How close should I come?”</p>
<p>“1 mel will be enough.”</p>
<p>Agarj then walked up to 1 mel from Schnee and smelled the air. He didn’t need to put his nose next to the weapon, apparently.</p>
<p>Schnee’s current main weapon was『Blue Moon』, but she didn’t use it at the time, so she took out the weapon she had used then from the item box.</p>
<p>“There’s no mistake, she’s the real one.”</p>
<p>Agarj confidently stated that it was the same smell he felt when he was fighting behind Girard.</p>
<p>“You have a really good memory, though.”</p>
<p>“People like Lord Girard and Lady Raizar have particular smells.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t about being strong or weak, but it felt like a majestic and powerful aura, together with the smell, passed through one’s whole body. Various people perceived it differently, but Agarj said that was the impression he got.</p>
<p>Schnee added that the Beasts’ sharp sense of smell allowed them to tell how strong someone was by their smell, which could have influenced it as well.</p>
<p>“Now that we have verified that I am the real one, can we proceed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. You said you could offer us poison resistant equipment?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If you are experienced adventurers, you surely know about Chosen Ones. He is an advanced Chosen One and a skilled blacksmith capable of forging even Mythology-grade gear. He can craft equipment with higher poison resistance than what you could make with Baomultan’s parts.”</p>
<p>“I suppose as much.”</p>
<p>Schnee’s explanation of the difference between them shocked the group, with the exception of Garon. Maybe because most Dwarves were well versed in smithing, he had already figured out that Shin was a blacksmith.</p>
<p>“You are a blacksmith too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I crafted most of their equipment too. I can’t even compare with your skills, though. You crafted the gear you are all wearing, yes?”</p>
<p>Garon spoke with confidence while looking at Shin. He could tell that Shin made their equipment.</p>
<p>Shin wondered for a second if he was being tricked in admitting it, but Garon’s eyes were completely serious. He was apparently sure to be right.</p>
<p>“If you can craft something like that, it’s no wonder that you could create gear superior to what I could do with Baomultan’s materials.”</p>
<p>“Are we settled, then?”</p>
<p>“…there’s something I want to ask.”</p>
<p>This time, the spellcaster twins raised their hands.</p>
<p>“Why do you help us? I don’t think you need to go so far.”</p>
<p>“It would be easy for you to chase us away. That would be enough to protect Baomultan.”</p>
<p>The two girls were encouraged to speak, and did so in a very frank tone.</p>
<p>“Well, you see. Looking at your fight, I could tell right away that you were putting your lives at stake. Then I heard about your reasons. I thought we could help. That’s pretty much why we offered to help. Well, I’m also curious about Durgin’s behavior, to be honest. To put it simply, we’re sticking our nose in your business.”</p>
<p>To help or not help others. Shin did not have a clear basis to choose between these two options. In the end, it mostly depended on what he felt and what he thought. He didn’t think he wanted to help anyone he saw in need.</p>
<p>“Can you accept my reasons?”</p>
<p>Shin’s words might sound too casual for the party that would receive his help. The twins’ expression, in fact, was still clouded.</p>
<p>“That’s reason enough to help others.”</p>
<p>The first one to nod to Shin’s words was Mavlov.</p>
<p>“We have done similar things in the past. This time we’re going to be helped instead of being the ones helping. That’s all there is to it.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Haha, now that you put it that way, you’ve really hit the nail on the head.”</p>
<p>The details were different, but they too did similar things in the past. Garon agreed to Mavlov’s words and laughed heartily. Agarj too nodded silently, while Risha emitted a small sigh.</p>
<p>“No one has any objections, yes? Please, tell us more.”</p>
<p>Garon and the others were finally convinced and asked to go on with the conversation.</p>
<p>“I’m the party’s blacksmith, so let me talk now. Well, it’s just as I said before, though. We can offer you poison resistant equipment. But in exchange, let Baomultan go. I would also like to observe that Durgin, so I ask you to let us come with you to your country.”</p>
<p>Equipment with resistance to multiple status ailments was incredibly rare in this world.</p>
<p>Equipment with a single resistance, like what was necessary in this case, was not so uncommon.</p>
<p>It was relatively rare nevertheless, but after seeing the resolve of Garon’s party, Shin wouldn’t hold anything back.</p>
<p>He did add the second request off the top of his head, but he was naturally serious about it.</p>
<p>Shin was sure Durgin wouldn’t attack human dwellings without reason, and since he was involved with Baomultan right as an incident involving Durgin happened, he felt that he would end up having to deal with it even if he chose to do nothing this time.</p>
<p>“We have nothing to lose in this offer. Are you really sure, though? This is more than just doing us a favor.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not doing it completely out of the good in my heart anyway. Durgin and Baomultan share a connection, after all. If something had happened, gathering information about it will be valuable for us too.”</p>
<p>Shin replied that it was reason enough for them.</p>
<p>Garon’s party probably did not know about the Durgin’s remains in the lake.</p>
<p>Was there a connection with the Durgin threatening their country? That’s all Shin wanted to know. He hoped there wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Information, I see. That could be valuable indeed. I apologize for derailing the topic. So, when could you give us the poison resistant gear? It pains me to push you like this, but we want to return to our country as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“I have the gear ready. You just need to equip it, if there are any adjustments to be done I’ll take care of them.”</p>
<p>Shin then pulled out from his pocket -actually from the item box- a series of cards.</p>
<p>When facing an enemy that inflicted specific status ailments, it was essential to be prepared to prevent them. Shin’s item box was filled with various such gear, from prototypes to complete items.</p>
<p>Garon’s party, however, was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Equipment in card form, I see…it wouldn’t surprise me if you had an item box, but to see you pull them out so casually…”</p>
<p>“Considering the place we are, I prepared all sorts of things, you see. Rather than that, try them on and let me know if anything feels strange. You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, this is no time to fret over the details.”</p>
<p>The other members nodded to Garon’s words too.</p>
<p>The men changed on the spot, while the women used another room.</p>
<p>“—incredible. I’ve used equipment that adjusted itself to your size before, but it never fit so perfectly.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, this isn’t inferior to our current equipment.”</p>
<p>Agarj and Mavlov talked while lightly moving their bodies.</p>
<p>Garon changed too, but his expression looked sour.</p>
<p>“Is there anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing…nothing at all. It’s simply perfect, I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>Shin asked the Dwarf if he had any concerns, but his reply was in line with Agarj and Mavlov.</p>
<p>After a while, the party’s ladies returned, wearing Shin’s equipment. They did not have any problems either.</p>
<p>“Let’s head to Passner immediately then. We made you spend time talking, after all.”</p>
<p>Durgin could attack Passner at any time, so they decided to leave right away. Shin thought that, being Schnee Raizar’s party, they had some leeway to do things out of the norm, so he materialized their modified carriage.</p>
<p>There was no guarantee that Durgin wouldn’t attack places other than Passner, and since Baomultan was weak, he asked Shibaid, Tiera, and Kagerou to stay back.</p>
<p>Baomultan understood that they had stopped the attackers, so it didn’t do anything when they came out again. Shin looked at it lying on the ground, stroked by Tiera, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“If anything happens, let us know immediately.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>The carriage would be pulled by Yuzuha. After making sure all members of Garon’s party were on, they left quickly.</p>
<p>“Is this carriage floating?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t vibrate at all, does it. Is this a smithing technique too?”</p>
<p>Agarj and the others were surprised by the utter lack of vibration as the carriage moved.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 3 Part 2</p>
<p>Shin’s party reached Passner less than a day after they left Baomultan’s area.</p>
<p>They had left after noon, so, when they arrived, the sun had already set, but, considering that with a normal carriage it would have taken days of travel, the speed of their arrival was incredible.</p>
<p>Garon’s party had also prepared a carriage, but the speed was too different so they let the horses go and recovered only their luggage and the carriage itself. The horses were trained to return to Passner on their own, apparently.</p>
<p>Acting as Schnee’s party also allowed them to use the item box freely, so they turned all the luggage into cards.</p>
<p>“I did think we were going fast, but to think we’re already here…”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely faster than us running. Even if the carriage was drawn by a tamed monster, this speed is truly incredible.”</p>
<p>Kagerou had stayed back with Tiera in Baomultan’s area, so this time the carriage was drawn by Yuzuha. She accepted the task because it was an emergency along with the condition that Shin did one thing she asked too.</p>
<p>Her size was about three mel, smaller than her original form, but she was strong enough to be able to go faster than any other animal suited to pulling carriages.</p>
<p>If she pulled a normal carriage with the same strength, everything other than the pulling ropes would surely break into pieces. That’s how much strength she had.</p>
<p>Shin’s carriage was much more durable and stable than a normal one because he modified it in various ways.</p>
<p>“We can’t enter at night, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“It’s alright, we asked to be let in even after they closed the gates at night. I’m sure the sentinels noticed our arrival too. I will go talk to them, please wait.”</p>
<p>At least, it seemed that Durgin did not attack the country while they were away. The walls and watchtowers stood tall, and they could see soldiers protecting them too.</p>
<p>The soldiers had noticed the group’s arrival; Garon approached them while waving and several of them hurried closer to him.</p>
<p>There were bonfires alight, but in this world the darkness of the night was very deep. They had lit some light globes to prevent monsters from approaching the carriage, so the soldiers probably understood who had arrived pretty quickly.</p>
<p>“Usually, doing this makes monsters more prone to attack.”</p>
<p>Risha recalled the trip and sighed. The night was the time of monsters: many animals were also more active during the night. Normal travelers used animals to avoid monsters and stood guard throughout the night. When traveling at night, they used as little light as possible, erased their presence as much as possible, and proceeded while avoiding being spotted as much as they could.</p>
<p>Advanced Chosen Ones could also travel as Shin’s party did, but traveling at breakneck speed while being surrounded by lights was completely insane by this world’s standards.</p>
<p>“With a partner monster like that pulling the carriage, I bet even a dungeon boss would get out of its path.”</p>
<p>After listening to Risha’s words, Agarj spoke while looking at Yuzuha.</p>
<p>When the wolf beast Agarj saw Yuzuha transform from small fox mode to her current form, in order to pull the carriage, he shook like he had been struck by lightning, kneeled down and shed warm tears.</p>
<p>He probably felt something deeply in that sight. Yuzuha’s power was gradually recovering to her original level, so similar monsters and Beasts might be able to feel something special in her aura.</p>
<p>Though, Shin made him stop immediately.</p>
<p>“Ah, looks like everything went well.”</p>
<p>Garon was heading back towards the party while waving his hands and Sety waved in return.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. We are going to explain the situation to the king, so please come with us. He doesn’t doubt our words, but he would like to see us all in person.”</p>
<p>Garon had an item that allowed him to communicate over long distances, so he had informed the kingdom of their return ahead of time.</p>
<p>Since they returned much earlier than expected, the king of Passner was worried that an accident had occurred. Garon had already sent a brief explanation, but meeting people in an area of deadly poison was not normal, so he wanted someone to come.</p>
<p>Shin thought that, if they used Schnee Raizar’s name, they wouldn’t be thought of as suspicious, but still they couldn’t leave everything to Garon’s party and move on their own.</p>
<p>Shin knew that they would probably have to meet with the king directly to explain the situation, so he quickly agreed to Garon’s request. The group was not very large, so they decided to go all together.</p>
<p>“I also heard that there were no attacks while we were away.”</p>
<p>Seven days had passed since Garon’s party left Passner. During the last attack, Durgin had not been wounded, so Shin wondered why it would do nothing for all that time, but could not come up with an answer.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of the gate guards and the night shift soldiers, Shin’s party entered Passner. The king was already waiting in the royal palace, so they headed there immediately, led by Garon and his party.</p>
<p>“It’s so dark. Are they keeping the street lights down to be ready in case Durgin attacks?”</p>
<p>“Unless you’re in a big city, it’s like this everywhere at night. What are those…street lights? you talked about, young lady? Contraptions that emit light, I suppose…?”</p>
<p>Based on what Garon said, there were no devices to illuminate the streets at night in Passner.</p>
<p>Sety was lighting the party’s path with globes of light, but the only other lights were the ones faintly filtering from the houses. When the people turned in for the night, the streets would turn even darker.</p>
<p>Shin recalled that it was like this in most cities he had visited.</p>
<p>The only illuminated areas were around shops that were open until late at night. It wasn’t uncommon for certain alleys or areas to be pitch black.</p>
<p>In this world, people rarely left their house at night. It sometimes happened, but going out in near total darkness entailed various risks.</p>
<p>Sety explained that street lights were magic tools installed on the streets at fixed distances, used to illuminate the night. Not only was Garon surprised, but the other party members were as well.</p>
<p>“They’re lit all night? They must consume an incredible quantity of magic power…”</p>
<p>“And they’re all over the city…I can’t even begin to imagine how many mages they need to power them.”</p>
<p>In the game era there was no need to worry about such magic power supply, so whole cities were illuminated just like the real world. Back alleys far away from the main streets were darker, but still pretty well lit when compared to this world of total darkness.</p>
<p>“The world before the Dusk of Majesty…if I could see it I would want to see it, but it’s all fairy tales for us.”</p>
<p>Naturally, only a few members of the long-living species knew what the players’ hometowns looked like.</p>
<p>Many NPCs also lived in the hometowns, but most of them lost their lives in the tumult after the Dusk of Majesty, and, even for members of long-living species, it wasn’t uncommon to not know how the world was then. Naturally, no members of short-living species did.</p>
<p>Even if they heard about how things were 500 years before, it was difficult to believe it was true.</p>
<p>“There are many things I would like to talk about, but let’s keep quiet for now. We’re going to have an audience with the king, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You guess…?”</p>
<p>“You’re Schnee Raizar’s party, aren’t you? In terms of rank, you’re higher than he is.”</p>
<p>As Garon said, both in terms of fighting prowess and contributions to various countries, Schnee was superior to the king of a small country like Passner. Garon continued saying that, since they would save the country from a great crisis, they would be welcomed with all honors.</p>
<p>“Is it really fine to do this, though? It won’t have grave effects, maybe, but there’s still poison in the air.”</p>
<p>“The king is thinking about what happens after the battle, yes?”</p>
<p>“Correct. Besides if, by any chance, your temper turns sour, this country is finished, you know? If I was in his position, I would have done the same.”</p>
<p>Garon agreed to Schnee’s words and continued.</p>
<p>“We have come here with our own goals, so there’s no need to do so much, though.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. I did tell them that you would probably say something like that, but it looks like they have to do something. In the future, we will have to tell people of a certain rank that Lady Raizar has visited the country. There are people connected with other countries too. I know that you wouldn’t mind, but if others hear that Schnee Raizar came here and nothing was done to welcome her, they would surely interpret it in the worst way possible.”</p>
<p>Since Schnee offered her assistance to defeat Durgin, the king was already looking at the future beyond the battle. Based on her abilities, it was pretty obvious for him to do so. If the Durgin was as powerful as Shin expected, not even a horde of them could stand up to Schnee. Because of this, they had to think about what would happen after the battle.</p>
<p>“All politics, then.”</p>
<p>“If I could spare you this, I would. I hope you’ll understand.”</p>
<p>From the king’s standpoint, it was an inevitable step. Shin and his party had quite a few acquaintances among royalty too: he could understand what Garon meant.</p>
<p>Eventually the group arrived at the royal palace’s gates and Garon spoke to a guard. They had already been informed, so they passed through smoothly. They had not publicly announced the arrival of Shin’s party, however, so they entered through a small entrance, reserved for the gate guards.</p>
<p>“…hey, Schnee…isn’t the poison getting thicker?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The more we approach the royal palace, the thicker the poison becomes.”</p>
<p>“What did you say!?”</p>
<p>Schnee replied to Shin’s question by agreeing with him.</p>
<p>Garon heard their exchange and turned pale. If the poison grew stronger as they proceeded towards the castle, it was normal to think that the source of the poison was inside.</p>
<p>If the place where the king and the other individuals in charge of leading the country gathered every day was the source of the poison, they had a grave emergency on their hands.</p>
<p>“The gate guards did not look sick, though. If the castle was filled with poison the people inside would surely suffer from its effects, so the gate guards would be affected too. It can’t be that they didn’t notice anything, can it?”</p>
<p>“Something was done for them not to notice. You can feel it in the air.”</p>
<p>After Sety’s observation, Shin looked at the castle with more focus. Even if it was filled with poison, it looked like any other castle. Despite this, Shin could feel goosebumps on his skin.</p>
<p>“A mental manipulation skill…it’s a weak one, set to make small changes feel like they were your imagination, but it could surely trick anyone other than Chosen Ones.”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s how it feels to resist a mental manipulation skill…it’s a bit different than before.”</p>
<p>Sety added that since she had lived in a Faerie Village for most of her time, it was her first time to be targeted by a mental manipulation skill after the Dusk of Majesty. It felt in a different way compared to the game era.</p>
<p>“Why are you people so carefree? Aren’t you even a little anxious?”</p>
<p>Garon couldn’t keep quiet while looking at Shin and his companions’ reaction.</p>
<p>He didn’t start hurrying towards the castle either. He knew well how dangerous it could be to act carelessly during an emergency.</p>
<p>“I’m scanning the situation inside. Looks like most people aren’t moving.”</p>
<p>Shin could tell what was happening inside the castle even while still outside, thanks to the map and his detection skills.</p>
<p>A few presences were moving, albeit very slowly. Their bodies probably couldn’t move well because of the poison.</p>
<p>Even so, there was one reason why Shin was not especially concerned.</p>
<p>The poison filling the castle was not lethal: it was a type that limited the target’s movements via paralysis.</p>
<p>When his stats were still low he too used this kind of poison often, so he knew it well.</p>
<p>“Paralysis poison, I see. I can’t feel anything either, is this equipment protecting us from that poison too?”</p>
<p>Shin explained about the poison and Garon’s party nodded in understanding, as it wouldn’t outright kill anyone affected.</p>
<p>If anyone with ill intentions had infiltrated the castle, not being able to move was naturally dangerous, but Shin could not spot any monsters or presences moving normally.</p>
<p>“The equipment I gave you is specialized against poison, so if the opponent uses magic or skills that cause paralysis, it won’t have any effect. Since this paralysis comes from poison, the equipment can prevent it.”</p>
<p>The poison status ailment simply decreased HP. As an item, however, poison was slightly different.</p>
<p>The status ailment-causing attacks Hydro and Oxygen used were closer to that: the effects they caused and the countermeasures against them were different from regular status ailments.</p>
<p>In this case, to prevent paralysis, it was necessary to adopt countermeasures against poison.</p>
<p>On the contrary, even if one had taken countermeasures to avoid paralysis, they would be affected by this paralysis, at least to a certain degree. That was one reason why status ailment-causing attacks were so hated.</p>
<p>Shin, who used poison himself, did not understand what the game creators had in mind when he first read the explanation and grumbled to himself “I just don’t get why it doesn’t prevent it!”.</p>
<p>“Let’s go see the king first. If we find anyone affected by the poison on the way there we’ll help them. Is this okay with you?”</p>
<p>“I feel bad for the others, but we have to prioritize the king. Any objections?”</p>
<p>All party members shook their head at Garon’s question.</p>
<p>Shin took the lead and, soon enough, they found a collapsed soldier. They erased the poison in the surroundings with a skill, healed the little energy he had lost due to the poison and woke him up.</p>
<p>According to the soldier, he had been feeling unwell since last night and this morning as soon as he started his shift, his limbs were paralyzed. He lost consciousness, so he didn’t know what happened afterwards.</p>
<p>“Considering the time, it must have been after I sent my message.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. It’s a slow-acting poison, so the symptoms probably vary from person to person. Even so, the soldiers being unable to move should be the perfect situation for the culprit to do whatever they were planning, but it doesn’t look like anything happened…what is going on here?”</p>
<p>Shin gave the soldier an item that temporarily subdued the poison’s effects, then told him to leave the castle. They couldn’t take the soldiers they helped along with them, after all.</p>
<p>“The king’s chambers are up ahead. He’s probably waiting there, but can you detect his presence?”</p>
<p>“Supposing the presences in the corridor are guards or attendants, there are five presences two rooms ahead and two in the room next to it. I’m guessing the king is in one of these rooms.”</p>
<p>To locate someone they had never met before using only the map and detection skills was rather difficult. Shin searched the room where the king was more likely to be, in order to find him as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Shin’s prediction turned out to be correct: when they entered the room with five presences, they found all of them collapsed on the floor. Garon quickly approached a man dressed clearly more elegantly than the others and helped him up. He was the king of Passner: the other presences were the queen and their personal guards.</p>
<p>After administering the antidote and healing them, all five quickly regained their consciousness.</p>
<p>“Garon, is that you…? Looks like you have saved us yet again.”</p>
<p>“No, this time I have done nothing to deserve your thanks. If it wasn’t for them, we would have been done in.”</p>
<p>After the king stood up, Garon explained again the situation.</p>
<p>“So you people are the allies Garon spoke about?”</p>
<p>The king first looked at Schnee, who was leading the group, then the other members behind her. He then slowly kneeled down.</p>
<p>“Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am Graffior Passner, king of Passner. Lady Schnee Raizar, I have heard much about your exploits. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for helping my friend.”</p>
<p>A country’s king was kneeling to a normal person. It was something normally unthinkable.</p>
<p>In Schnee’s case, not so much. Her position was equal, or maybe superior, to the king of a small country like Passner.</p>
<p>“Please, that will be enough as a greeting. Rather, could you let us know what happened before you lost consciousness?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I fear I cannot give you any valuable information, though. At first my body felt somewhat heavy, but I did not notice anything else. I did not notice any intruders before I collapsed, nor can I recall anyone forcing me to take any drugs or poison.”</p>
<p>Graffior added that it all happened suddenly.</p>
<p>The soldiers had said the same. The only difference was that Graffior might have collapsed later than them. There were few clues.</p>
<p>“In the end, the people in the castle were just paralyzed? What is the culprit thinking?”</p>
<p>“A reason to force everyone inside the royal castle to immobility…maybe they wanted to kidnap an important person? But in that case they would just need to use a stronger poison on this person and take them away. Maybe they wanted to steal a valuable item…or paralyze the country’s ruling powers…hmm…”</p>
<p>Shin voiced all the possibilities he could come up with.</p>
<p>“Are there any rare items of materials that other countries might not have here?”</p>
<p>“Not that I can think of…we have many precious items in our treasury, but nothing that could warrant such a large-scale plan to steal. The equipment Garon’s party is wearing right now seems more precious to me.”</p>
<p>Graffior said that they had items other than gear, but nothing extremely precious.</p>
<p>“There might be items with yet undiscovered effects. Could we take a look at the treasury?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>In other countries it wouldn’t be so simple, but Graffior gave them permission as they were Schnee Raizar’s party.</p>
<p>“Shin, Schnee, I’ll leave that to you two then. Sety and I will go take care of anyone in need of healing.”</p>
<p>“Understood. We’ll also heal anyone if we find them.”</p>
<p>Schnee and Sety often acted as the party’s healers: having them act independently would be more effective.</p>
<p>The poison filling the castle was something even Filma could heal without trouble, so Sety’s burden would be smaller.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, you stay here to protect them. Whoever scattered the poison might still be around.”</p>
<p>“Kuu!”</p>
<p>Small fox mode Yuzuha cried, then turned into her two mel size. Graffior and the others were surprised, but were convinced when Shin said that she was his partner monster. She could use healing skills too, so even if other kinds of poison appeared, there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>“Do you have an inventory list or something similar?”</p>
<p>“I believe the person in charge of our resources does, but if they aren’t in the department, I don’t know where they could be.”</p>
<p>Graffior, considering that Shin was a member of Schnee’s party, answered his question politely.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee thus decided to check the department the king told them about first; if they couldn’t find the functionaries in charge, they would just check the treasury for any traces of intrusion.</p>
<p>While heading towards their destination, they healed and gave antidotes to any soldiers and functionaries affected by paralysis.</p>
<p>According to the words of one of the soldiers they helped, they learned that luckily the functionary in charge of storage and preservation were present.</p>
<p>The functionary was surprised and wary of Shin and Schnee’s sudden visit, but the royal guard that accompanied them explained that they had obtained permission directly from the king, so they could act right away.</p>
<p>“I apologize in advance for the rude question, but can you confirm that this is the castle’s treasury?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is. Is there anything that troubles you…?”</p>
<p>“Well, actually…”</p>
<p>Shin gave a vague reply to the functionary in charge, who led them to the treasury.</p>
<p>If Shin’s senses weren’t betraying him, the poison grew stronger the more they proceeded. The source of the poison had to be close by.</p>
<p>Shin had given the royal guard an item that nullified all poison under a certain threshold, so he would be safe.</p>
<p>Shin informed the functionary of his findings. Since the latter was within the radius of the item’s effects, he wouldn’t notice that the poison was growing thicker.</p>
<p>Shin proceeded while removing the poison, leaving a safe path in their wake.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s here.”</p>
<p>“Yes. In a place like this there wouldn’t be a risk of anyone finding it by chance. There are traces that the lock was opened.”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes could clearly see the traces — red handprints — that a skill was used to open the lock. Schnee should be able to see them too.</p>
<p>“Traces, sir…?”</p>
<p>The royal guard and the functionary could not see the handprints, so they looked at the lock with stern expressions.</p>
<p>Thanks to their skills, Shin and Schnee could see the fingerprints on the lock, so without using anything it would naturally look like any other lock.</p>
<p>“Since we can see them so clearly, I guess the culprit was confident no one would ever find out?”</p>
<p>“Or they didn’t have any methods to erase the traces, I would say.”</p>
<p>Most players with thief-related jobs would learn such skills. In a case like this, which involved more than just opening a lock, skills to remove any traces of unlocking were necessary too.</p>
<p>Most players who used such skills were PKs or those who stole from other players.</p>
<p>There were many players who specialized in lockpicking, but even so, it felt unnatural for the traces to remain so clearly on the lock.</p>
<p>The more skilled the user was, the fewer traces would remain. Shin’s experience told him that only beginners would leave so many clear traces.</p>
<p>“The treasury is structured as to contain more valuable items the further you advance. Weapons and related gear are on the right, while all other items are on the left.”</p>
<p>The group opened the lock and entered the treasury. Shin advanced in the direction the poison felt stronger, while listening to the functionary’s explanations.</p>
<p>The treasury was a rectangle-shaped room, extending deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Shin stopped when they reached the middle of the room. He approached a display of precious jewels, grabbed the edges of a stand housing a necklace decorated with purple gems and moved it.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>The royal guard and the functionary swallowed their breaths. The stand concealed a stone-like object that could only be described as solid poison.</p>
<p>The octagonal object was the size of a fist and, upon closer inspection, revealed that it could filter light. It was probably a gemstone originally.</p>
<p>Shin picked it up and used his analysis skills. He knew there were no traps and the poison could not affect him.</p>
<p>“This gem is enchanted with a poison that causes paralysis. But that’s it.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough to spread poison throughout the castle. Shin analyzed the base of the necklace on a whim and discovered that it was enchanted with a spell to spread the poison.</p>
<p>“Let’s take these with us. If they are turned into cards, the poison won’t be able to spread anymore.”</p>
<p>Schnee stored the gem and the necklace base in the item box. They looked for any other such contraptions, but did not find any.</p>
<p>“(What did the culprit want to do with this…?)”</p>
<p>Shin asked Schnee a question via Mind Chat. The timing had been perfect to do something, but no action was taken. Extremely visible traces. Something felt definitely wrong in the whole affair.</p>
<p>“(The gemstone enchanted with poison couldn’t be analyzed, so this might just be an experiment.)”</p>
<p>Shin tried to analyze the gemstone enchanted with poison, but couldn’t tell exactly what type it was. It looked like a gemstone, but it could also be a mineral.</p>
<p>Shin thought it resembled the gem Baomultan gave him, but he couldn’t start comparing them when the royal guard and the functionary were still around. Thinking they should make their report first, Shin’s group headed back to the king’s room.</p>
<p>“An item producing poison? Why would such a thing be in the treasury…?”</p>
<p>Graffior’s expression was grave.</p>
<p>“(Do you think demons might be involved in this?)”</p>
<p>Graffior was deep in thought, so Shin connected a Mind Chat to Schnee and the others. Since they were in the same party, the message would reach Shibaid and the others too, even if they were far apart.</p>
<p>“(Waah!? Eh? W-why can I hear Shin’s voice!?)”</p>
<p>Before anyone could reply, however, they heard Tiera’s confused voice.</p>
<p>The chat function he used belonged to the “old generation” of the game era, so Tiera, a member of the “new generation”, wasn’t supposed to be able to hear it.</p>
<p>The chat message sent to the whole party, however, reached Tiera too.</p>
<p>Shin heard her surprised voice and wondered if it was an after-effect of her fusion with Marino.</p>
<p>He had never sent personal messages to Tiera, so he wouldn’t know when she could start hearing them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fusion with Marino was the only trigger he could think of.</p>
<p>“(T-this is so embarrassing…)”</p>
<p>Even if only Shin and the party would hear, Tiera was subjected to the embarrassment of all her thoughts being displayed publicly until she got used to the Mind Chat.</p>
<p>According to Shibaid, she was blushing so hard you would expect steam to come out of her head. Even Baomultan was looking at her with concern.</p>
<p>“(Er…I’m sorry.)”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t think the Mind Chat would connect to Tiera, but he was the cause nonetheless, so he honestly apologized.</p>
<p>“(Don’t talk about that anymore, please…)”</p>
<p>“(Got it. So, about the demons…what do you think, everybody?)”</p>
<p>Tiera feebly implored Shin to change the topic and he promptly complied, thinking of making amends to her in some way later.</p>
<p>King Graffior and the others were talking about what countermeasures they could take, so Shin continued the conversation while paying attention not to show any unnatural response.</p>
<p>“(It does feel like something’s off. The demons we’ve seen up till now wouldn’t let a chance go like that.)”</p>
<p>If Shin’s party didn’t come, no one in the castle would have been able to move. Even if it was just a preparation for something, it was odd that there was no action at all after the poisoning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no miasma could be found in the gem and base that Shin collected.</p>
<p>“(Whoever infiltrated the treasury was probably controlled. It would explain why we didn’t find any miasma. We still don’t know the extent of what they could have done though.)”</p>
<p>Schnee recalled cardinal Greyl, who had teleported Shin, Schnee, and second princess Rionne from Bayreuth to a Sacred Place.</p>
<p>He had been affected by various status ailments and cooperated with the demons unbeknownst to him.</p>
<p>“(This time the plan seems more complex, if there really is a demon behind this, it must be a pretty smart one, no? But in that case, why would it set up something like this in the first place?)”</p>
<p>“(Since it has a high degree of intellect, it’s using it to make people suffer?)”</p>
<p>Sety answered Filma’s question with a theory. Something like that had happened in the past.</p>
<p>The demon who kidnapped the church’s holy woman crafted a plan to make people suffer.</p>
<p>It could easily have killed them at any given time, but didn’t. Shin and the others learned directly that such demons existed too.</p>
<p>“(Based on the demons we have faced up until now, we can say that their methods have changed a little. It’s also safe to say that they might have abilities we aren’t aware of. There’s not much we can do, but let’s keep each other informed about anything we notice.)”</p>
<p>If they continued the Mind Chat too long they wouldn’t be able to follow Graffior and the others’ conversation, so Shin cut it for the time being.</p>
<p>Schnee looked like she could keep up without trouble, but Shin was struggling to keep up with two conversations at once. Especially this time, there were many things to think about, so he was afraid of saying the wrong thing to the wrong person.</p>
<p>Schnee had taken the lead in the conversation with Graffior and the others, so it had worked out until now.</p>
<p>“Let’s use items and purify the poison in groups. The demons might do something, but if we go individually the castle and its functions will remain paralyzed. There might be some who could die because of the poison.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that is inevitable. If the enemy is planning something outside the castle, spending too much time here would play right into their hands. This is quite a difficult decision. To think there might really be demons, though. I honestly thought they only existed in old tales.”</p>
<p>Shin’s party had faced them various times, but few people in this world were aware of the demons’ activities.</p>
<p>Even kings like Graffior were no exception.</p>
<p>Shin thought that they should inform their connections that the demons were on the move again, once the current situation was resolved.</p>
<p>After the conversation, they began purifying the castle of poison. The affected area was wide, but the poison itself was not very strong.</p>
<p>Shin quickly crafted antitoxin items with his skills and gave them to the healed soldiers. He also asked Sety and Filma to continue removing the poison and administering antidotes.</p>
<p>The healed soldiers would in turn become healers, so it didn’t take much time until all the soldiers in the castle recovered.</p>
<p>The menu displayed that it was still a little after 10 PM.</p>
<p>The group arrived in Passner a bit after 7 PM, so about three hours had passed since they started heading for the castle. The actual poison removal took about two hours.</p>
<p>“I thought Durgin would attack, but looks like nothing’s happening at the moment.”</p>
<p>“Right. Why did they spread that poison anyway? No attacks from Durgin or anyone else, nothing was taken, no one was kidnapped. It’s beginning to sound like a sick joke.”</p>
<p>In a room assigned to the party, Shin spoke while looking out of the window and Filma, sitting on a chair, replied while cocking her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>They had been assigned individual rooms, but they gathered in Shin’s room to discuss.</p>
<p>“If the enemy is truly intelligent, it might have noticed our presence and concealed itself…”</p>
<p>“The poison was spread before we arrived, though. That seems a bit far-fetched, no?”</p>
<p>If the demon had only average fighting power, it might have perceived how powerful Shin’s party was and fled, said Filma while thinking.</p>
<p>As Sety pointed out, it didn’t sound plausible.</p>
<p>“Even if it was an indiscriminate terrorist act, the effects are too mild. Could it be that the mastermind is not a demon after all?”</p>
<p>“The possibility is there. It’s not like demons are responsible for all bad things that happen.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed with Schnee’s hypothesis.</p>
<p>In this world monsters were an ever-present threat, but countries would still wage war against each other at times.</p>
<p>At present, because of the power relations between countries and the relations between neighboring territories, no large-scale wars were going on, but the possibility of conflict breaking out in the future still existed.</p>
<p>After the Dusk of Majesty smaller conflicts broke out in various regions, as Shin had learned from a document he had read earlier.</p>
<p>The possibility that this act was caused by a foreign agent was not zero. Even if it was, there were still many unclear points about the whole affair.</p>
<p>“I can’t feel miasma, but there is a strange aura here. Something like…a mixture?”</p>
<p>Only Shin and his party was in the room, so Yuzuha took human form and spoke. Sitting on a sofa next to Shin, she looked perplexed.</p>
<p>Yuzuha could also perceive miasma, but she confidently said that there wasn’t any in the surroundings. She could feel an unusual aura, though.</p>
<p>“A mixture? How does that feel exactly?”</p>
<p>Shin thought it would be difficult to explain such a sensation, but decided to ask Yuzuha all the same.</p>
<p>“Like a negative feeling, close to miasma…I guess?”</p>
<p>It was not a strong impurity, but something closer to lingering negative emotions.</p>
<p>Yuzuha added that Shin and Schnee couldn’t feel it because it wasn’t miasma and it was also very faint.</p>
<p>“Either a long time passed or it was faint from the beginning. We can’t tell for sure about this either. We do know that it’s definitely hostile towards us and that Durgin landed here for a reason.”</p>
<p>The causes were still unknown, but there definitely was a mastermind hiding in the shadows.</p>
<p>Durgin, like Baomultan, was a creature necessary for the world. If possible, Shin wanted to do something for the monster.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep our guard up for today. I’m thinking we should take turns sleeping, what do you all think?”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded to Shin’s proposal. They had all rested plenty in Romenun, so their condition was perfect.</p>
<p>There were items that helped a user not feel sleepy.</p>
<p>According to Shibaid, while convenient these items let exhaustion accumulate faster and made it easier to lose focus, so it was better to rest when possible.</p>
<p>Shin had never used such items after coming to this world, so he decided to follow Shibaid’s advice.</p>
<p>There also were skills that could alert the user if any monsters approached.</p>
<p>Someone would stand guard just in case while the others slept, but there was no reason for everyone to force themselves to stay awake.</p>
<p>“First it’ll be me and— ”</p>
<p>“And me.”</p>
<p>Schnee raised her hand before Shin could end his sentence. Filma and Sety nodded, knowing smiles on their lips.</p>
<p>“I will stay up too!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha joined in while leaning against Shin. She had recuperated most of her powers and looked almost like an adult, but many of her gestures were still childish.</p>
<p>She was taller than before, so her pointy fox ears could touch Shin’s. They would move sometimes, which Shin found a bit ticklish.</p>
<p>“My my, looks like Schnee has a rival here.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem. Shin is not such a fickle person.”</p>
<p>Schnee sharply replied to Filma’s joke, smiling in return. Her behavior and words fully expressed her trust in him.</p>
<p>“Schnee would always panic a little in these situations, but look at her confident smile now…! They definitely did it…”</p>
<p>“This feels more like big sis Schnee, though. She isn’t the type to catch someone and keep them chained, but to catch someone and make them feel like they don’t want to escape. I bet Shin is already caught in all sorts of ways already. Like through his stomach.”</p>
<p>“You two? You do know that if you continue saying whatever you please like that, I will have to take the proper countermeasures?”</p>
<p>Schnee’s aura changed.</p>
<p>Filma and Sety understood that they were about to step in dangerous territory and quickly left, saying they would go to sleep first.</p>
<p>“They’re always ready to make fun of me, those two…”</p>
<p>“Your aura became softer, after all. I guess it’s easier to joke like that now.”</p>
<p>Shin was sure that they wouldn’t have said so much before.</p>
<p>“It’s a problem if they find me easier to make fun of.”</p>
<p>“They’re not just having fun at your expense, you know that. Just let them have a bit of fun.”</p>
<p>“You can say that because they don’t make fun of you, Shin. Besides, they ask me all sorts of embarrassing things when you’re not around.”</p>
<p>Schnee looked really embarrassed, as she went red up to her ears. They apparently dug really deep, probably without restraint as they belonged to the same gender.</p>
<p>Shibaid also wanted to know more about what happened, but, because of his personality, he would never ask intimate questions like Filma and Sety did.</p>
<p>“I kind of understand Filma and Sety. Shibaid never asks me anything though.”</p>
<p>Like Filma and Sety with Schnee, for Shibaid it would surely be easier to ask Shin about what happened while he was alone with Schnee.</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t recall being asked such questions, though.</p>
<p>“I wonder if he’s holding back?”</p>
<p>When they met in this world, Shin told Shibaid to be unrestrained with him, but the Dragnil clearly still felt their master-servant relationship strongly.</p>
<p>They belonged to the same party and entrusted each other’s backs to the other in battle. Even so, Shin felt that there may not be a wall, but a line clearly traced between them.</p>
<p>“In Shibaid’s case, I think it’s more due to his personality than restraint. If Girard was here, he would ask questions as brazen as Filma’s, I think.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed that Girard would have done just that. Even if they were both warriors, Girard and Shibaid’s personalities were quite different.</p>
<p>“Shibaid’s thinking has become more flexible. I suppose his time as king has been beneficial.”</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t think that he changed much…no, I guess he did.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled what Shibaid said when they met again, words like a general meeting his king, and retracted his statement.</p>
<p>In the game era, Shibaid would never have casually addressed Shin unless ordered it.</p>
<p>“…everyone’s changed. Everyone has lived all this time. Of course they would.”</p>
<p>“Shin?”</p>
<p>Schnee, finding him different from usual, couldn’t help but call his name.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that I’ve never properly asked everyone about how they lived, what they did while I wasn’t around.”</p>
<p>He had talked about it with Schnee while they were alone, but apart from her, the only one Shin talked with at length was Girard.</p>
<p>Considering he had lived over 500 years, it was just a tiny moment, but for Shin it was something unforgettable.</p>
<p>He had heard very superficial things from Shibaid, Filma and Sety.</p>
<p>While talking with Schnee and Yuzuha, Shin thought that he should talk with those three much more.</p>
<p>“Let me start by speaking about them from my viewpoint, then. It’s better than just waiting, no?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed to Schnee’s proposal, had the sleepy Yuzuha turn into small fox mode and picked her up in his arms. She cuddled up and quickly drifted off to dreamland.</p>
<p>Yuzuha said she would stay awake, but evidently succumbed to sleep.</p>
<p>“It’s already Yuzuha’s bed time.”</p>
<p>“Hard to think that she is a legendary monster…”</p>
<p>Yuzuha usually turned in early at night.</p>
<p>Except when an enemy was near, on normal days she would always sleep soundly. So maybe today there would not be enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Maybe she was getting accustomed to her body while she slept, so she could be doing it now too.</p>
<p>“You can’t go to sleep too, okay Shin?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I know.”</p>
<p>Shin placed Yuzuha on his lap, careful not to wake her up, stroking her fur as he listened to Schnee.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 3 Part 3</p>
<p>The next morning.</p>
<p>Shin and Schnee had spent a peaceful night; Filma and Sety came to switch places, so Shin and Schnee did not have to wake them up.</p>
<p>“No attacks after all.”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled to himself while looking at the town’s citizens, busy with their daily activities.</p>
<p>Even if there were rumors that Durgin might attack soon, if they stayed in their houses they couldn’t keep on living. Everyone had all sorts of different reasons, but they tried to live their usual lifestyle without succumbing to fear.</p>
<p>According to the maid assigned to Shin’s party, there were fewer people out and about.</p>
<p>“The presence of the item they installed is gone, so they’re being more careful?”</p>
<p>“It’s a possibility.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Sety’s question, a clouded expression on his face.</p>
<p>The poison filling the castle did not belong to Durgin.</p>
<p>Durgin’s appearance and the poison incident could even be completely unrelated. There were too many possibilities to consider.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do today, anyway? We could stay in the castle and monitor the situation, I guess?”</p>
<p>The castle was located in the center of the city: it was a location that allowed quick access to any place Durgin attacked. As such, Filma’s proposal was valid.</p>
<p>“I’d like to do something before it comes over the city, though.”</p>
<p>If Durgin’s wings were damaged by weapons or magic attacks, it could be possible to make it crash into the ground, though that would cause damage to the city.</p>
<p>Durgin was a flying monster, so no one could tell what location would turn into a battlefield until the battle started. Evacuating the citizens immediately would be difficult. If Durgin crashed on a building, the people inside might be hurt and would surely find it difficult to escape later, even if they survived.</p>
<p>If it scattered its poison, normal people without resistance would die on the spot. If possible, they wanted to bring the fight outside the city.</p>
<p>“Does it always come from the same direction?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear anything about that. We should confirm it.”</p>
<p>Schnee answered Filma’s question after trying to recall if they had heard anything. Therefore, Shin’s party decided to consult Garon and the others, who were lodging in the castle as well.</p>
<p>“The direction Durgin comes from? It was north, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. But we only know the direction, no one knows if there is something that way. It might be coming here after attacking another country’s city or similar.”</p>
<p>Durgin always came at different times, so that would be difficult to predict.</p>
<p>“So, as far as we know, it has always come from the north. Maybe it has a nest somewhere…though that doesn’t sound very likely.”</p>
<p>“Even without a nest, a single Durgin would easily find a place to rest, I’d wager. Well, there’s not much we can do even if we find out its dwelling, though.”</p>
<p>Garon shook his head at how hopeless the situation seemed.</p>
<p>To the north of Passner there were several cities, though none were the size of a country. There were several villages too, and Garon was worried about any casualties or damage they might have suffered.</p>
<p>Shin tried recalling everything he knew about Durgin, but it was a monster that traveled all over the world and appeared randomly. Finding its dwelling was a nigh impossible feat. In the game era, the most effective way was to find cursed areas or polluted areas and monitor them.</p>
<p>“In the game, we would usually set items to attack incoming monsters, though.”</p>
<p>There were regular events in which monsters attacked cities.</p>
<p>Most cities were equipped with magic devices created by players specialized in item crafting, so except in the very early days of the game, monsters never dared to fly over cities.</p>
<p>A certain city was so well armed that such events would be resolved without direct intervention from players.</p>
<p>Such a maniacal pursuit of item crafting and magic devices had left even the creators flabbergasted.</p>
<p>It was something impossible to recreate now, so it was quite the problem to deal with.</p>
<p>“Did you come up with something?”</p>
<p>“No, I was just talking to myself.”</p>
<p>Garon had apparently heard what Shin whispered to himself. Shin replied that it was nothing and started thinking again.</p>
<p>After more discussion, they decided that Shin would stay in the center of the city, while the other party members would stand guard on the city walls: Schnee on the north side, Filma on the west side, Sety on the east side and Yuzuha on the south side.</p>
<p>Garon’s party would guard the king, with the equipment Shin gave them. There were royal guards too, but since it was Garon and his comrades, the guards accepted their cooperation. They were adventurers that could use Mythology-grade equipment and had braved the perils of a deadly area for Passner’s sake, so no one expressed any discontent.</p>
<p>“(Bored, kuu.)”</p>
<p>After half a day of guard duty, Yuzuha sent this message.</p>
<p>Shin also understood how she felt.</p>
<p>To wait for something that might come at any time, or not come at all, was more tiring than expected. Especially because it was something they’d rather never came.</p>
<p>The soldiers on guard duty had been informed that Schnee and the others would join them. They knew that the king had personally requested their help, but to see unknown adventurers do their job, it would be normal for them to think that they weren’t trusted and glare at Schnee and the rest of the party with looks of discontent.</p>
<p>The soldiers, however, had directly experienced how terrifying Durgin was. They knew that now wasn’t the time to act proud, and they welcomed Schnee and the others.</p>
<p>The soldiers even acted politely and courteously to Yuzuha, who had the appearance of a young girl.</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s Mind Chat was delivered to Schnee and the others too, but they probably understood that she meant the message for Shin and did not say anything.</p>
<p>“(I’ll groom you all nice and pretty later, so do this for me, please.)”</p>
<p>“(Kuu! Okay!)”</p>
<p>The Mind Chat was pretty peaceful, for the time being. Yuzuha sounded playful, but she was carefully watching the surroundings too.</p>
<p>The changes finally happened after one full day of guard duty, just as the morning hustle and bustle began quieting down.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Chapter 4 Part 1</p>
<p>“(Multiple responses coming from the north. The sky looks abnormal. Dark clouds are gradually covering it. Can everyone confirm?)”</p>
<p>Schnee sent a Mind Chat to the party.</p>
<p>Shin looked up at the sky and saw dark clouds covering it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the type of darkness one could see on cloudy days. It looked like someone was painting the sky with tar.</p>
<p>The speed at which the sky was turning dark was unnatural too. It was spreading all over.</p>
<p>Anyone recognizing clouds drifting through the sky would realize this was a completely different phenomenon.</p>
<p>The clouds were progressively increasing, like a carpet being rolled over a surface. Once they appeared, they stayed in place, heavy, unmoving.</p>
<p>No one would think it was a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>The height of the clouds was a bit above the castle Shin was in: it was far too low for them to be real clouds.</p>
<p>Shin could clearly see that the black clouds were dividing the earth from the sky, where white clouds hung.</p>
<p>Filma and the others too reported seeing the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>“(Multiple responses are heading our way. They are…)”</p>
<p>Shin boosted his detection range and detected multiple presences heading towards Passner. He also reinforced his eyesight with【Clairvoyance】and uncovered their identity.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was a gigantic dragon in the lead.</p>
<p>It was smaller than the one Shin saw in Baomultan’s area, but still larger than Shin remembered. Its appearance was just as Shin recalled.</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>Mister XXX knew who Shin was.</p>
<p>He probably knew about Shin’s fighting style and prowess too. There was no way to tell if Hellscream had acquired this information, but Shin attacked as if it did.</p>
<p>Shin attacked in a way that, even if the monster didn’t react, it would only be damaged, not sliced in two; as the monster dodged, Shin continued as planned and activated a skill.</p>
<p>“【Cure All】”.</p>
<p>Shin cast the highest level healing spell, which could heal even unique status ailments, on the Hellscream.</p>
<p>【Mirage Step】required the user to touch the ground, so looking at the user’s feet could reveal which direction it would dodge to. A way to counter it was to make the opponent dodge on purpose, then *place* an attack in the position it was expected to move to. Shin tried it and succeeded.</p>
<p>Golden light enveloped the Hellscream.</p>
<p>In the case of normal 【Possession】, the possessed and the possessor would have been separated after a few seconds.</p>
<p>The Hellscream, however, did not even flinch because of the light and attacked Shin instead.</p>
<p>Its four arms stretched out of the robe, wrapped in black and purple light. With them it absorbed the golden light, then its large hooked claws reached towards Shin.</p>
<p>Shin blocked the venomous claws with 『Moonless』. The coldly shining katana reflected the light and drew two arcs in the air.</p>
<p>The devilish smile on Hellscream’s face turned into a grimace of pain.</p>
<p>It probably used physical attacks over the magic it was more proficient with because it had acquired information about Shin. As a strategy, however, it was rather poor.</p>
<p>Shin planned to slash the right arms’ hooked claws with the first slash, then cut both claws and wrists of the left arms with the returning strike.</p>
<p>『Moonless』could affect undead spirit-type monsters like Ghosts and Raised too, so such a result should be inevitable.</p>
<p>Even if the monster had a player as its base, it shouldn’t be able to fill the gap in ability between itself and Shin.</p>
<p>“If this doesn’t work either, I’m all out of options.”</p>
<p>The Hellscream shrieked in pain as it retreated and Shin used his final resort: he activated 【Purification】.</p>
<p>Normally this skill was only used to remove Cursed Gifts, but in this world, it had other effects as it had shown in Tiera’s hometown.</p>
<p>【Cure】 had no effect both before and after the transformation, so Shin did not expect much from it, but maybe 【Purification】 could. Shin reached this conclusion, tried it and—</p>
<p>“…no good?”</p>
<p>The Hellscream did not show any changes. On the contrary, in the short time Shin used to cast 【Purification】 its arms reformed.</p>
<p>“Let’s take it down, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s finish this.”</p>
<p>Shin and Filma had no other options. He nodded to her and changed his grip on 『Moonless』. He activated a skill and the katana’s steel-colored blade glowed white.</p>
<p>Katana/Light combination skill 【Evil Cleanser Blade】.</p>
<p>It was one of the skills that caused extra damage to certain types of monsters, the one especially effective on undead spirits.</p>
<p>The Hellscream probably sensed the blade was dangerous: it concentrated power in its hooked claws to the maximum and prepared to counterattack.</p>
<p>Shin stepped closer.</p>
<p>He used 【Ground Shrink】 doing the same movements as before, but at a much higher speed.</p>
<p>Overwhelming speed, almost like instantaneous movement. The Hellscream had no time to move its hooked claws.</p>
<p>Shin swung 『Moonless』.</p>
<p>One slash on the monster’s defenseless body and everything would be over.</p>
<p>Just when the blade was about to hit—</p>
<p>[[I don’t want to die]]</p>
<p>Such a voice reached Shin’s ears.</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>There wasn’t enough time to say those words. No voice actually made the air vibrate. But Shin was sure that it was the voice of the man before he transformed.</p>
<p>Are you in there?</p>
<p>Is your conscience still there?</p>
<p>Since Shin was the one accelerating, he could have time to act before the attack connected.</p>
<p>The hesitation in his heart transmitted to his sword arm.</p>
<p>The blade that was about to cleave Hellscream in two stopped.</p>
<p>The monster’s mouth twisted into an arc. Its iconic scream, which had brought so many players to ruin, resounded in the surroundings.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I should have expected that.”</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself while hearing the scream.</p>
<p>Hellscream probably had the ability to use the player’s voice to make the opponent hesitate. It could be a trump card against opponents it thought were too much for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the scream was just noise: Shin could cut down the Hellscream at any time. He was slightly irritated, however, by the Hellscream gloating about its successful move.</p>
<p>Thus Shin decided to teach the monster a lesson.</p>
<p>“You better watch your back.”</p>
<p>Shin pointed behind the monster, to show that he wasn’t paralyzed at all.</p>
<p>Shin’s presence and his skills attracted Hellscream’s attention too much. Shin was not fighting alone, after all.</p>
<p>“Rest in peace.”</p>
<p>The Hellscream turned towards the source of the voice. There it found 『Scarlet Moon』’s blade, swinging at a speed it could never hope to dodge.</p>
<p>Filma specialized in cutting down her opponents head-on.</p>
<p>However, she could erase her presence and ambush them with ease too.</p>
<p>Filma’s own ability and speed, paired with the speed boost granted by the magic power output of her equipment. Together, they would let her easily ambush the Hellscream, focused completely on Shin.</p>
<p>The Hellscream was cleaved in half, without even a chance to let out a final scream, then vanished in midair.</p>
<p>“It won’t leave a corpse behind?”</p>
<p>Shin whispered to himself while looking at the empty space where the Hellscream was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an unusual way for an incorporeal monster to die, but because of the way it manifested, Shin thought that something would have remained.</p>
<p>“Shin, this isn’t the time to get all sentimental.”</p>
<p>Shin looked closely in search of any remains, then Filma called him.</p>
<p>He looked in the direction Filma was looking at and saw the horde of Garmags and Kikiuz. Durgin was still collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Let’s call Sety and wipe them out. Durgin had a sort of 『Collar of Subjugation』 on, so I’ll try to remove it.”</p>
<p>The Garmags and Kikiuz were large in number, so Shin decided that it was Sety’s turn, since she specialized in large scale offensive spells.</p>
<p>Shin contacted her via Mind Chat, asking her to come with Yuzuha, while Schnee would stay in Passner, in case anything happened.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! It’s my turn, finally!”</p>
<p>Sety, who arrived riding on Yuzuha’s giant form, was very gung-ho about the task she was assigned. The Garmags and Kikiuz didn’t leave the contaminated area created by the black clouds, so she said she would erase them from one end of the area to the other and started attacking. The area was very wide, so Filma went with her to get rid of any survivors.</p>
<p>“You’re next, then.”</p>
<p>Shin watched Sety and Filma go, then turned towards Durgin.</p>
<p>During the fight against Hellscream and afterwards, it didn’t move at all. 【Analyze】 showed that it was still affected by 【Brainwash】.</p>
<p>Its state was a little different from the effect of the 『Subjugation Collar』.</p>
<p>The collar itself had a different design than the one Shin was familiar with. It looked even more ominous than the one Shin had previously found.</p>
<p>Its aura, or rather, the evil air it emitted was the same. When Shin touched it, the collar emitted a faint metallic sound and shattered.</p>
<p>Shin used 【Heal】 and Durgin regained HP and its status recovered. It didn’t look weakened as it did when it had collapsed.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Durgin stood back up, looked at Shin for a while, then its body suddenly started glowing. The light then gathered in front of the monster.</p>
<p>“This light…I’ve seen it recently.”</p>
<p>As Shin expected, the light formed a gemstone, which dropped into Shin’s hands.</p>
<p>“What do you two want me to do…?”</p>
<p>Shin looked at the gemstone. He knew no one would answer, but couldn’t help but ask all the same.</p>
<p>He had predicted that he would have had to use Baomultan’s treasure gem on Durgin, but Durgin gave him a treasure gem instead.</p>
<p>The two treasure gems were probably a pair, but Shin had no idea how to use them.</p>
<p>They could be used as materials to craft items, but since he already equipped powerful gear, there was no need to use them for something like that.</p>
<p>Durgin had nothing else to do there, apparently: after roaring once, it soared in the sky and flew away. The black clouds did not form behind it any longer. It would probably be safe to leave it alone now.</p>
<p>“Sety and Filma don’t seem to be having problems, so what’s left is…”</p>
<p>Shin looked at Sety launching large scale destruction spells in the distance, then looked at the shattered collar.</p>
<p>He predicted that the collar was the cause behind Durgin’s 【Brainwash】 status.</p>
<p>Shin picked up one of the larger fragments and examined it.</p>
<p>“….there’s the creator’s name?”</p>
<p>Players with creation-type jobs could see the name of the creator of other items. The hawk emblem Shin put in his creations had to be chiseled manually, but the creator’s name appeared automatically.</p>
<p>And the collar showed it.</p>
<p>Maybe because the collar was broken, the creator’s name had turned into unreadable gibberish.</p>
<p>Since a name was there, it was clear that the collar had been crafted by someone.</p>
<p>The creator might have crafted it while under someone else’s control.</p>
<p>Or maybe they had created it of their own free will.</p>
<p>In any case, there was surely trouble ahead.</p>
<p>If the collar could be mass-produced, the entire continent would fall in chaos and turmoil.</p>
<p>The words left by the man and a dangerous collar. It was something that needed to be investigated not by a small party like Shin’s, but by a large organization like a country.</p>
<p>“I should talk about it with Schnee first.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, during their adventures, they had built connections with royals and powerful merchants. If they used them, they might be able to do something.</p>
<p>While thinking this, Shin contacted Schnee via Mind Chat.</p>

<p>Vol. 16 Side Story Part 1</p>
<p>The Dusk of Majesty.</p>
<p>For those living in THE NEW GATE’s world, this day was like a bolt out of the blue. Large scale tectonic shifts and similar natural disasters. Of course, the Rokuten guild’s NPCs were affected too.</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro, servants of the “Red Alchemist” Hecate, braved the tremors in the “Fifth Daze Garden Romenun”.</p>
<p>“Aaah! Our precious prototypes!”</p>
<p>“This place shouldn’t shake even a bit during normal earthquakes…!”</p>
<p>The whole building shook violently, first vertically, then horizontally. This continued for a good while, at an irregular pace.</p>
<p>Not only the medicine prototypes on the desks but also tubes, dishes, balances, and other tools came crashing on the floor.</p>
<p>The racks were specially reinforced, so their contents were still safe at least.</p>
<p>Tremors that made it difficult to even stand up continued for one whole day.</p>
<p>“That was really violent…”</p>
<p>Oxygen stood back up. Because of the long tremors, his hair was all messy and he had trouble standing straight.</p>
<p>“Agreed. Not only is Romenun built to withstand quakes, but also suppresses tremors. Despite all this, to experience tremors of this scale…I suppose it’s enough for smaller cities to be completely destroyed.”</p>
<p>Hydro reflected on the tremors and went to look outside. From Romenun’s location, it was possible to see the nearest city in the distance.</p>
<p>Using sight boosting skills or items, it could be possible to see the state of the city walls and their surroundings. There was also the need to check the state of the area around Romenun.</p>
<p>“…well well, I did think that something unprecedented happened, but…what is going on here?”</p>
<p>Hydro looked outside the window, then laughed wryly. Afterwards, she shrugged and sighed.</p>
<p>“Ahaha…really, there’s nothing to do but laugh.”</p>
<p>Oxygen stood next to Hydro, carefully avoiding the broken prototypes and materials.</p>
<p>The edges of his lab coat touched the ground, so avoiding them did not mean much, but that wasn’t a concern at the time. He laughed hopelessly, then sighed like Hydro.</p>
<p>The scenery outside the window was completely changed.</p>
<p>The guildhouse itself was still intact, but the various plants that were growing around it were gone. What remained was but a desert wasteland, a ravaged land filled with cracks.</p>
<p>“The vast forest that extended all around the guildhouse is gone, and there’s a lake over there too. But…how could the mountain disappear too? I suppose this is nature’s power.”</p>
<p>Oxygen looked in another direction, then exhaled, impressed.</p>
<p>Romenun was located in a mountain range, about 30 kemel from the nearest city.</p>
<p>No matter where they looked, however, the city was nowhere to be found. The ground level had probably sunk deeply, as Romenun’s position was much lower than before.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that a phenomenon like this was caused naturally? Easy there, Oxygen, did you accidentally inhale a prototype during the tremors? The mountain disappearing is not an illusion.”</p>
<p>“The possibility isn’t zero, right? That was a joke though. Not even our mistress could do something of this scale. The only cause I can think of is the “management” the mistress once told us about. But the scale is completely different this time. This is not just a new dungeon appearing out of nowhere…”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you are still sane. So then…”</p>
<p>Hydro was about to start discussing what they should do next, when she noticed something and stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Oxygen did not say anything about it, and they continued looking at each other for minutes.</p>
<p>After about five minutes passed, they opened their mouths at the same time.</p>
<p>“This is too strange. I cannot find any explanation.”</p>
<p>“This is too strange…a lot stranger than the scenery out there…”</p>
<p>What they noticed was not something external, but something related to their own bodies.</p>
<p>Something so shocking they almost forgot about the violent tremors they just experienced.</p>
<p>“Why can we—”</p>
<p>“Why can we—”</p>
<p>“Why can we talk so normally?”</p>
<p>It was so natural that it took time for them to notice.</p>
<p>The behavior limitation that always accompanied them had disappeared completely.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Side Story Part 2</p>
<p>“I believe that we were in this state since the experiment started.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro realized their current state. Thinking back on their recent actions, Oxygen stated his conclusion.</p>
<p>“I agree. I recall that we discussed things like this during the experiment too.”</p>
<p>Hydro added that the temptation to connect the changes with the tremors was strong, but agreed with Oxygen’s theory. They were both alchemists: even if the earthquakes were a very suspicious phenomenon, they wouldn’t tie all unexplainable things to it. They simply registered it as one of the possibilities.</p>
<p>“We have undergone a change once in the past. This would be the second then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is true. Let us consider any similarities with that time.”</p>
<p>The first change had also happened suddenly. They recognized their own existence, processed all incoming information, ultimately leading to independent thinking. What made all of this possible was—</p>
<p>“The “Death Game” that was what our mistress’ friend, Master Shin, talked about, right? Since our mistress wasn’t around we acquired the information relatively late, but that is surely the case. I do find it unpleasant that there are simply no other viable options.”</p>
<p>When they became able to think independently, they acquired information about what was going on in the world.</p>
<p>The formerly immortal players became mortal: when the “Death Game” swept through the whole world, the players who were not present could not come to that world anymore.</p>
<p>“That time, even we were at a loss for what to do. Of all Rokuten members, only Master Shin was on this side too.”</p>
<p>“We were lucky that at least he was though. They said that many were left by themselves and simply did not know what to do.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro could move a little by themselves as the world underwent such dramatic changes, but they weren’t completely shut out from the outside world.</p>
<p>Even when the players weren’t around, NPCs had an auto-mode that allowed them to manage shops, take small quests, acquire items, and manage finances automatically.</p>
<p>The results were flimsy, but this mode was set in Hydro and Oxygen too, and they exchanged information with other NPCs through it.</p>
<p>“There weren’t any geographical changes that time. It’s not rare for new dungeons to appear and unlocking new areas happened before too.”</p>
<p>The “Gate to the Netherworld” dungeon Shin entered was one of such areas. Some dungeons were accessible only during what players called “events” and some dungeons also formed automatically.</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro agreed that there weren’t any completely new changes.</p>
<p>“As for us, we acquired the ability to think and our behavior limitations were slightly reduced. The same thing happened this time too. Our limitations were further removed this time as well.”</p>
<p>Even if they had become able to think, it felt like dreaming for the most part. Their movements were mostly fixed patterns, so most players did not realize that something had changed.</p>
<p>In comparison, the change this time was nothing short of dramatic. It was like the puppets of a controlled world had suddenly turned into living creatures.</p>
<p>“Will another “Death Game” be forced upon us?”</p>
<p>“Both ‘Logout’ and ‘Login’ are not possible anymore; what would be the point of doing another? The most important factor for the players, that dying here means their actual body dying too, would be the same.”</p>
<p>Oxygen recalled the changes undergone by the players and stated his opinion.</p>
<p>It was like trying to turn off a magic tool that was already inactive. There was no point.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. If we hypothesize the first ‘Death Game’ was meant to instill a change in us, and the effects on the players were just a secondary effect, could it be that causing it again gave us more freedom?”</p>
<p>The effects on players were just a bonus. Hydro considered this possibility, resting her chin on her hand.</p>
<p>“It would be difficult to disprove that theory. I suppose it is possible. But isn’t the effect aimed at us and the effect the players received too different? Even if we acquired the ability to think, the first time didn’t change much for us. It was a muddled feeling, a state between awakening and slumber. Thinking about it now, it was quite unpleasant. But the confusion on the players’ side was something completely different. If that was what actually happened, it would be an extremely inefficient method, something you’d maybe try just because you could. Definitely not something well researched before the implementation.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I suppose it was a bit too far-fetched…”</p>
<p>Hydro would not be bothered even if her theory was doubted. She knew that it wasn’t a plausible story.</p>
<p>“Even if we want to examine the current situation, we know nothing except the changes that occurred to the land. We need to do more research before we discuss it.”</p>
<p>“That’s true too. We got caught up in conversation…I suppose this is a sign of our change as well.”</p>
<p>The first topic was to look for similarities with the past event, but it shifted to the goal of the current event. Despite the fact that they didn’t yet know if it had been caused artificially or was a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some coffee first. What we need to do now is calm down.”</p>
<p>Hydro made this proposal after hearing what Oxygen mumbled.</p>
<p>They concluded that they were both too restless, decided to take a break and started boiling a pot of water.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Side Story Part 3</p>
<p>“Let’s start by researching our surroundings then. The plants are gone and with them the poison has disappeared too, which I suppose is lucky in these circumstances.”</p>
<p>Hydro wore her equipment and looked at the surroundings from the entrance to Romenun.</p>
<p>Normally, because of the many plants growing everywhere around the guildhouse, any research would be impossible without proper equipment.</p>
<p>For added safety, they brought anti-poison items in their item boxes.</p>
<p>“Where should we go first? Romenun’s self-defense functions are still active, so we know there are no abnormalities in a radius of several hundred mel.”</p>
<p>“All the plants being gone isn’t abnormal?”</p>
<p>“I can see them buried here and there. The plants around here won’t die because of something like this. You know that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>The sleeves of Oxygen’s lab coat pointed in a direction where plant-like vines were climbing out of the cracks in the ground.</p>
<p>Thanks to 【Appraisal】, Oxygen had confirmed that they belonged to a species of plants growing around Romenun, so he nodded back to Hydro.</p>
<p>The plants were buried in the ground, but were not in danger of dying.</p>
<p>“This looks quite unnatural too.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro left Romenun and headed towards the lake they had seen from the window. The surroundings were nothing but wasteland, so there was no other difference with the rest of the environment.</p>
<p>Hydro described it as unnatural because the lake was much wider and deeper than expected. The ground hadn’t just formed a depression: a depth like that would have required extensive work to be formed.</p>
<p>With their sight boosting skills they could only see the lake’s surface from Romenun. When they arrived at the lake and used 【Through Sight】, they couldn’t help being surprised.</p>
<p>“You think this is natural?”</p>
<p>“That would be difficult to say…”</p>
<p>It was too large to believe that only in that area the ground had sunk in. It was also filled with water, brought from who knows where.</p>
<p>“There isn’t anything on the bottom though? If at least there was a monster or something, this situation could be easier to explain.”</p>
<p>“No, that might not be wrong though…”</p>
<p>Hydro was peering into the depths of the lake. Oxygen’s response prompted her to ask what he meant. Oxygen then said that it would be faster to look, and pointed towards the sky. Still doubtful, Hydro looked up and noticed a black spot.</p>
<p>“Take a look at the map.”</p>
<p>“Map? Oh yes, we can use that.”</p>
<p>The map was normally only accessible to players, but Oxygen’s words made Hydro recall that they could use it too now. Then she marveled at the size of the response.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too big?”</p>
<p>“We can flee at any time.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro could fight, but it wasn’t their primary role. They didn’t have high fighting power like Schnee or Shin’s other support characters.</p>
<p>They prepared smoke bombs that disrupted the opponent’s eyesight and even magic power with sounds and smell and their trump card, a teleport crystal, then hid.</p>
<p>They hid behind a large rock and used camouflage mantles to blend with the surroundings.</p>
<p>After a while, the silhouette of the black spot became visible.</p>
<p>“It really looks like Durgin.”</p>
<p>“It’s much bigger than usual though.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro had seen the falling monster before. It was rather well known as an environment preservation monster. Its appearance hadn’t changed much, so they could identify it with certainty.</p>
<p>The only difference was that each one of its body parts had grown many times in size while maintaining the original ratio. Such was the Durgin currently falling from the sky.</p>
<p>“There seems to be a sort of black mist trailing behind it?”</p>
<p>“The mist too, but the Durgin itself is pitch black as well. I suppose it’s in that state after absorbing pollution.”</p>
<p>Oxygen knew of the cause behind the change in the color of Durgin’s body surface. He recalled Hecate telling them about it.</p>
<p>The Durgin eventually fell inside the lake, as if aiming for the center of the water surface.</p>
<p>The fall of Durgin’s large body displaced a large amount of water. A wave the size of a small tsunami struck the surrounding land.</p>
<p>The wave reached even the boulder behind which Oxygen and Hydro were hiding and left them drenched.</p>
<p>Making a commotion could alert Durgin, so they quietly observed the situation. Thanks to 【Through Sight】, they could observe Durgin from behind the boulder.</p>
<p>“…did it sink?”</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”</p>
<p>Durgin wasn’t incapable of swimming. It appeared wherever there was pollution, so it could act both on land and in water. Oxygen and Hydro continued to observe the lake, but it did not look like Durgin was swimming up.</p>
<p>Then they both expressed their thoughts.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t moving.”</p>
<p>Durgin came falling, its body huddled in a ball, without moving. Their impressions about the monster matched completely.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see the level, but was it dead?”</p>
<p>“It didn’t look injured though. Judging from the color, it could have absorbed an excessive amount of pollution.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro had never seen Durgin in a state of maximum absorption of pollution, so they didn’t know what actually happened to the Durgin that fell into the lake.</p>
<p>They could not see its HP, so they couldn’t confirm whether it was alive or dead.</p>
<p>“Should we try to get closer?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t see its level with 【Analyze】, so it’s definitely stronger than us…”</p>
<p>Since they couldn’t see its name or level, there definitely was a stats gap so wide that it couldn’t be filled with technique.</p>
<p>They couldn’t approach it with confidence just because they had high-performance equipment and items.</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro weren’t battle-oriented characters, so if Durgin was alive they could be in danger.</p>
<p>“The curiosity engraved in my soul is telling me to go though.”</p>
<p>“I know…I suppose this is the “setting” our creator infused in us. It feels kind of mysterious.”</p>
<p>Hydro expressed her restlessness and Oxygen laughed at the new sensation. They hadn’t heard it from anyone, nor read about it anywhere. They could tell, however. It was set as top priority in their behavior.</p>
<p>“Curiosity killed the cat, they say.”</p>
<p>“But also that even death can’t cure stupidity.”</p>
<p>It was too dangerous to approach the lake just out of curiosity. Would it be right to go back like that however?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it better to clarify Durgin’s current status?</p>
<p>They could easily come up with such excuses. Neither of them said them aloud, however.</p>
<p>“Are we cats, or are we stupid?”</p>
<p>“We’re both, obviously.”</p>
<p>Using their “setting” as an excuse would be easy. They had already understood, however, that their “setting” wasn’t forcing them to act anymore.</p>
<p>Thus this was an overlap of their “setting” and their thoughts. They simply happened to be both going in the same direction.</p>
<p>“Shall we stop looking for excuses to go back?”</p>
<p>“Right. There are so many *interesting things* happening, so going back to Romenun without doing any research wouldn’t be like us at all!”</p>
<p>They were cats afflicted with the sickness called stupidity. Hydro confidently stated that they were beings with no shred of common sense, who valued curiosity over their own lives.</p>
<p>Oxygen laughed and agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>We could get better equipment. We could get other items. They could easily find reasons to go back.</p>
<p>However, they would still go.</p>
<p>They didn’t want to wait until *later*, they wanted to see it *now*. They wanted to know *now*. If they died, then that was that.</p>
<p>They were both sure that if Hecate was there, she wouldn’t scold them: she would send them off with her blessings.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Their mantles’ camouflage was still active. They activated skills that concealed sound and smell and left the boulder.</p>
<p>They prioritized their curiosity, but had no intention of dying. They would obviously do everything they could to prevent any risks.</p>
<p>The large wave had been absorbed by the ground, which turned muddy as they approached the lakeshore.</p>
<p>The terrain, changed by the tremors, had a rather firm quality, so after absorbing water it was rather slippery to walk on.</p>
<p>“It makes me want to harden it with magic.”</p>
<p>“Durgin is sensitive to magic, so don’t.”</p>
<p>Hydro disliked how hard it was to walk, but Oxygen stopped her plans.</p>
<p>They didn’t know if Durgin would react, but since they were hiding it would be ridiculous to show their presence like that.</p>
<p>Although, Oxygen shared Hydro’s displeasure.</p>
<p>Their lab coats had been crafted by the “Dark Blacksmith” Shin. They were one rank higher than other equipment of the same category. That was why they were using them now too.</p>
<p>Oxygen’s lab coat was too long for him, however, so the edges that touched the ground were getting muddy and dirty. It was completely white before, so now it was so dirty that it looked pitiful. The water it absorbed also made it heavier.</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro approached the lake, the former making dragging sounds, the latter without any noise.</p>
<p>They arrived close enough that they could touch the water if they crouched, but Durgin did not show any reaction.</p>
<p>“It’s huddled like before, not moving an inch. Either it died or is resting…but we can’t tell which.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have handled it if it attacked us, so this is better for us.”</p>
<p>Oxygen whispered while peering at the bottom of the lake and Hydro replied with a shrug. If Durgin moved, their only option would be to run.</p>
<p>“Oh, something changed.”</p>
<p>“The water is getting turbid. I suppose we should go a bit farther away.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro realized that the water around Durgin was changing and moved away from the lake.</p>
<p>The water was changing in a ripple-like fashion, with Durgin as its center.</p>
<p>Would the change affect only the water? Or the ground too? Careful to keep the 【Through Sight】 and 【Far Sight】 skills active, they continued their observation.</p>
<p>The water wasn’t crystal clear to begin with, but because of Durgin it started turning to mud-like colors.</p>
<p>The change eventually affected the whole lake and a sort of steam started rising from it. The ground’s color started getting darker as well.</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen did not need to talk before taking gas mask-like items from their item box and wearing them.</p>
<p>The gas masks were equipment that protected against poison absorbed via the nose and mouth, like powder or steam.</p>
<p>The white steam that started rising from the lake after the changes caused by Durgin took place did not look safe to breathe at all.</p>
<p>It could also be absorbed through the skin, so they used another item for protection too.</p>
<p>The white steam, carried by the wind, approached them.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be wise for both of them to come in contact with it, so Oxygen stayed in the same place while Hydro wrapped a rope around Oxygen and moved away.</p>
<p>If the items’ effectiveness ran out she would drag Oxygen away and go back to Romenun together. Incidentally, they decided who would stay with a round of RPS.</p>
<p>“The items are effective, but it’s only a matter of time.”</p>
<p>After a while, Oxygen stated his observations after coming in contact with the white steam.</p>
<p>Thanks to the items the poison didn’t affect him, but the items’ durability was decreasing at great speed.</p>
<p>The gas mask, which could sustain 【High Poison】 for 3 hours, wouldn’t last 10 minutes.</p>
<p>To gather as much information as possible, Oxygen collected a sample of the white steam with a preservation item prototype. He also collected a sample of the changed lake water and the ground that started changing colors.</p>
<p>After putting the samples back in the item box, they ran away through the white steam, carefully monitoring the items’ durability.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 16 Side Story Part 4</p>
<p>“It’s really poison then. The range is too wide, it couldn’t just be evaporated water from the lake after all.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro returned to Romenun and immediately analyzed the samples.</p>
<p>The steam was spreading in all directions from the lake. It apparently couldn’t enter Romenun’s area and continued to shift along its edges.</p>
<p>“The poison is a combined type that causes weakness, paralysis, and confusion. It is also three times more powerful than other poisons with the same effects. Without protective items, we wouldn’t even last 10 minutes, I suppose. If we equip an 『Age of Gods Earring』 we could stay longer.”</p>
<p>“They were given only to our mistress, the other guild members, and Master Shin’s support characters, after all. We can’t craft them ourselves.”</p>
<p>At the moment, they could use the byproducts of Hecate’s research and the samples prepared during joint development with other players. There were finished products too, but naturally the highest grade status ailment prevention accessory was not among them.</p>
<p>“In that case—wait, that’s!!”</p>
<p>Oxygen was about to say something, then his face glued to the window.</p>
<p>Hydro looked outside too and saw a monster flying in the lake’s direction.</p>
<p>“A silver Dragon-type. It must be…”</p>
<p>“If there’s Durgin, it’s no wonder for that to come too. They’re a pair after all. Not even one hour passed since Durgin fell in the lake though. Was it always so fast?”</p>
<p>The newly approaching monster was identified quickly: that’s how famous it was.</p>
<p>According to what they knew, however, it would never appear so quickly. Both Oxygen and Hydro cocked their heads, deep in thought, considering what they should do next.</p>
<p>Being Hecate’s assistants, their creation-type skills related to item crafting, such as 『Alchemy』 and 『Compounding』 were quite advanced.</p>
<p>If they reinforced the anti-poison items they had, they could stay in the poisoned area longer.</p>
<p>“To see Baomultan before it changes is quite a rare event.”</p>
<p>“We have to go.”</p>
<p>Curiosity was their driving force after all. Oxygen and Hydro quickly stored the samples, prepared the necessary items, and left.</p>
<p>Baomultan, the monster forming a pair with Durgin.</p>
<p>A monster that purified the pollution absorbed by Durgin and brought blessing to the earth.</p>
<p>Usually it had the horrifying appearance of an undead dragon, but before absorbing pollution it was a beautiful silver dragon.</p>
<p>There was very little footage of its original appearance and very few people had ever seen it.</p>
<p>If they moved now, they could see what kind of pollution it absorbed and how it changed in the process, so they rushed outside. They had completely forgotten about the 『Age of Gods Earring』 already.</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro equipped as much anti-poison protective gear as they could and charged into the white steam.</p>
<p>Even if they had forgotten about the 『Age of Gods Earring』, they remembered to equip their concealing mantles. Though it was something like a habit for them.</p>
<p>Since they hurried outside, when they arrived at the lakeshore Baomultan was still in its original form.</p>
<p>It was covered in silver scales, which produced jangling sounds whenever it moved.</p>
<p>One set of wings, two sets of limbs, a long neck and tail. It was just like what anyone would imagine after hearing the word “dragon”.</p>
<p>“It’s huge. Durgin was large too, might there be a connection?”</p>
<p>The Baomultan on the lakeshore was three times the size Oxygen and Hydro knew it had.</p>
<p>“What is it doing?”</p>
<p>Baomultan was spreading its wings, facing the lake. It didn’t look like it was doing anything in particular.</p>
<p>They supposed it would do something to turn into its familiar form, so they observed it and its surroundings.</p>
<p>What they noticed in their careful observation of any changes was that Baomultan’s appearance was starting to change.</p>
<p>Its beautiful scales visibly lost their gloss and color and started cracking. It looked like fast-forwarded footage of rusting metal.</p>
<p>When Baomultan moved, sounds of creaking metal could be heard. It was very different from the shrill, light sounds of before.</p>
<p>The change spread to Baomultan’s whole body, which turned into a horrible sight in less than 5 minutes. A block of rust, shaped like a dragon. That was the most convincing way to describe it.</p>
<p>The change was too quick, too sudden. Oxygen and Hydro swallowed their breaths.</p>
<p>“I see why so few people ever saw it. This is too fast.”</p>
<p>“So it can absorb pollution from a distance.”</p>
<p>Oxygen focused on the speed of the change, Hydro on Baomultan’s pollution absorption ability.</p>
<p>They didn’t worry about Baomultan itself because they heard that it wouldn’t die because of the pollution it absorbed.</p>
<p>“What? A reaction from 【Analyze】?”</p>
<p>Their 【Analyze】 couldn’t scan Baomultan until now, but it suddenly showed its HP. They couldn’t see its name or level, but another change surprised them.</p>
<p>“If it turns like this it’s in a weakened state? Its HP is only half too.”</p>
<p>“After seeing that Durgin, it’s not surprising. Not only the quantity, but the quality of pollution might have been different too.”</p>
<p>Around Baomultan the ground was regaining its original color. Around the lake, however, the steam had only decreased a little.</p>
<p>“Will healing items work on it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but it’s worth a try. They say that when it turns like this, it becomes more docile too.”</p>
<p>Oxygen took out an 『Elixir』 he had brought in case anything happened and approached Baomultan. He told Hydro to stay where she was.</p>
<p>Even if they had information about it, the situation was still dangerous. Their equipment, however, would prevent them from dying instantly even if Baomultan attacked.</p>
<p>If they didn’t have such insurance, they wouldn’t approach the dragon even if they knew it was supposed to be docile.</p>
<p>Baomultan noticed Oxygen’s presence and turned towards him. As the High Pixie boy was rather short, their size difference was striking.</p>
<p>“I’m going to heal you, so don’t attack, okay…”</p>
<p>Oxygen thought it would be okay, but the dragon’s form and stats were intimidating all the same. He couldn’t help but hesitate a little.</p>
<p>As Oxygen approached, Baomultan lowered its head towards him. It was close enough that Oxygen could almost touch it.</p>
<p>Its dull eyes made it impossible to see any emotion. Oxygen poured the container’s contents and Baomultan received the golden liquid on its snout, without reacting in any way.</p>
<p>The dragon’s HP recovered, but its appearance did not change.</p>
<p>Baomultan faced the lake and spread its wings again. Its large wings were tattered, it surely could not fly in this state.</p>
<p>“The HP is going down.”</p>
<p>Baomultan’s HP gauge already decreased to the point it was before Oxygen healed it.</p>
<p>The ground regained its color and part of the water surface recovered too. When Baomultan’s HP stopped decreasing the water returned to its previous color, but the ground didn’t change.</p>
<p>Baomultan retracted its wings and lay on the ground.</p>
<p>Its HP gauge was pretty much the same as before Oxygen healed it. The dragon, however, was crying in a pained tone.</p>
<p>“Healing it might not have been a good move.”</p>
<p>Hydro spoke from behind Oxygen.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s true that it uses its own lifeforce to purify the area.”</p>
<p>“It surely looks like that.”</p>
<p>Despite the HP gauge not changing much, Baomultan was progressively weakening. Something other than HP had to be decreasing.</p>
<p>“…Hydro. We came all this way, why don’t we develop an item to get rid of this poison?”</p>
<p>“What a coincidence, I was just thinking of the same thing.”</p>
<p>Oxygen and Hydro made a decision before the suffering Baomultan.</p>
<p>They couldn’t let such an unprecedented research material slip away. With such an excuse in their minds, they proceeded to collect samples.</p>
<p>Anyone would realize that it was nothing but an excuse.</p>
<p>Rokuten’s support characters were generally too kind for their own good.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 1 Part 1</p>
<p>In the tiny kingdom of Passner, Shin engaged in battle against a monster that attacked its capital city.</p>
<p>After freeing the giant dragon Durgin from its 【Brainwash】 status and defeating the Hellscream monster — thought to be the mastermind behind the attack — Shin and Filma, one of his support characters, carefully observed the surroundings for a while.</p>
<p>But there did not seem to be any more hidden hostiles or traps.</p>
<p>Shin and Filma joined with Sety, another one of his support characters, and disposed of the remaining Garmag and Kikiuz monsters.</p>
<p>𑁋</p>
<p>“ —I guess we’re done for now.”</p>
<p>Shin sheathed his katana and exhaled deeply.</p>
<p>Even if they could cast large-scale magic spells, the cloud spawned by the Durgin was very large and the spell width was limited to a specific area.</p>
<p>The Garmags and other monsters spawned only in the polluted area under the cloud, but, maybe because the Hellscream was defeated, they started trickling outside the polluted zone little by little.</p>
<p>For the average denizen of this world, even just one of them was a dangerous foe.</p>
<p>Shin also called Schnee, then they continued using magic to exterminate as many monsters as possible.</p>
<p>They used the map to make sure there were no allies or unrelated presences in range while attacking.</p>
<p>The monsters had been following the Durgin, so they weren’t spread throughout the polluted area.</p>
<p>After the cloud created by the Durgin disappeared, the polluted area also started returning to normal. Any plants and trees which had died completely could not return to their original state, but it was still better than the area staying polluted like that.</p>
<p>Shin’s group eliminated all the Garmags and Kikiuz that showed on their map, then headed back towards Passner.</p>
<p>Some monster units might have slipped through, but it would be nearly impossible for Shin’s current party to eliminate every single one of the monsters that spawned on this occasion.</p>
<p>The map could not conveniently display all Garmags and Kikiuz only, after all.</p>
<p>At the very least they could effectively perform their cleanup thanks to the Durgin scaring off other monsters and animals.</p>
<p>If the Garmags and Kikiuz moved to an area with other monsters, however, they would have to check and deal with every single monster presence: Shin’s current group was too small for such an operation.</p>
<p>“Hopefully nothing bad happens…”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing we can do, the area is just too large.”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, those monsters do not proactively attack humans, so we can only hope that applies to them too.”</p>
<p>Sety shook her head in denial and Filma frowned, a troubled tone in her voice.</p>
<p>Garmags and Kikiuz were nicknamed “cleaners”. According to the game’s settings, they could survive by feeding on corpses, without having to attack live humans or monsters.</p>
<p>It would be another issue if a place with a great number of corpses was easy to find, but Shin had heard that monsters had the ability to detect such places.</p>
<p>He wanted to hope they really wouldn’t go attacking human settlements.</p>
<p>“Anyway, we have to explain what happened.”</p>
<p>“How much do you plan to tell them? It’s rare in the current world for a human being to turn into a monster…right?”</p>
<p>Sety tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p>Filma had been sealed into a 『Drop of Erathem』 for a long time and wasn’t very knowledgeable on the current state of the world.</p>
<p>Sety too had spent a long time in a Faerie Village, so her situation was similar. However, she wasn’t forced to stay inside, so she had gathered information to a degree.</p>
<p>“I think we have to talk about that too, it’s something too grave to just gloss over it. Whether they believe us or not is up to their judgement, though. But the monsters did come out like this, and they don’t know the game like we do, so maybe it will be easier for them to accept it?”</p>
<p>A human, a player at that, had turned into a monster. An item that could control its target, much like how the Collar of Subjugation controlled the Durgin.</p>
<p>These two elements alone differed greatly from what Shin knew of how 【THE NEW GATE】 worked.</p>
<p>The people of this world knew very little of what Shin and the others knew.</p>
<p>Royals, nobles, and such higher caste members could have access to a vast range of information, but it still was very little compared to what Shin and his party knew.</p>
<p>Shin thus thought that they might have an easier time accepting the existence of such phenomena.</p>
<p>“It’s true that technology has regressed a lot compared to the past. They were surprised to see street lights, weren’t they? Well, I guess in the past it was even too advanced, maybe.”</p>
<p>Sety recalled what happened when they reached the town as she looked up to the sky.</p>
<p>“I doubt things will ever return to how they were in the past. The circumstances are too different now.”</p>
<p>Schnee too probably recalled the past, as she answered without changing her expression.</p>
<p>“Anyway, let’s go back first. I’ll tell Yuzuha what happened via Mind Chat.”</p>
<p>Shin and the others looked around carefully to see if there was anything out of the ordinary, then started running.</p>
<p>Shin was running at his normal pace.</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma kept up with him by using physical boosts.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sety kept up by sliding on the ground.</p>
<p>“You’re not flying, is that a modified movement skill?”</p>
<p>Sety’s hovering looked slightly different from the ability attached to Filma’s armor, that allowed it to expel magic power to boost her leaping abilities.</p>
<p>“This is an original skill I made, by combining non-elemental and wind magic…well, I’m just using wind as propulsion while floating, though. I’ve been practicing for a while actually, I can go pretty fast, right?”</p>
<p>Shin was not running at full speed, but she still could keep up with him easily: it certainly wasn’t a speed easily attained by a magic user.</p>
<p>Sety’s stats were focused on magic power and control, so she couldn’t move fast enough to leave afterimages in her wake, as Shin and Schnee did.</p>
<p>This technique was the result of her attempts to overcome such a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Filma’s armor did not simply make her jump by expending magic power, so it worked a bit differently than Sety’s original skill.</p>
<p>Sety apparently came up with it after seeing a player hit themselves with a fire spell to fly in the air. It was difficult to control, however, so she couldn’t fly with it.</p>
<p>With a bit of luck she might manage to fly a little, but she could drop down to the ground at any moment.</p>
<p>“With a little more control, you could fly with that…tell me how it works later.”</p>
<p>Shin’s eyes were sparkling as he inquired about the details.</p>
<p>He could use the skill 【Flying Shadow】 to jump in midair without limits now, so he could do something similar to Sety’s hovering, but in the end he was only jumping, just kicking platforms created in midair.</p>
<p>It wasn’t rare to see flying magic in fantasy fiction, so he always dreamed he could do the same.</p>
<p>“Will you be able to fly, when I’m having such a hard time with it?”</p>
<p>“People can and will surpass their limits, for the sake of a dream.”</p>
<p>Shin tried closing the topic with a cool quote: he was really looking forward to trying.</p>
<p>The only problem was that Sety’s explanations were always extremely hard to understand: he would probably have to ask Schnee to interpret for him.</p>
<p>“You two, we’re almost arrived. Let’s leave the chatting for later.”</p>
<p>The group could move many times faster than a horse, so they arrived at Passner in no time.</p>
<p>They rejoined Yuzuha, who was waiting outside the gates, and entered the town.</p>
<p>Shin had told Yuzuha what happened via Mind Chat; in turn she had informed Garon and through him the authorities, so the news that the monsters advancing towards Passner had been eliminated was already known.</p>
<p>The previously tightly sealed gates were now wide open.</p>
<p>“You really took care of it, just like that…”</p>
<p>“We could see the lights caused by magic all the way here. I almost felt pity for the monsters…”</p>
<p>Garon’s tone was a mixture of surprise and incredulity. Risha sighed helplessly too.</p>
<p>The soldiers posted on the city’s outer walls could see the flashes of magic caused by Shin and the others as they defeated the Garmags and Kikiuz, apparently.</p>
<p>Some of the magic users even trembled as they felt the power of their magic spells, transmitted through magic power shockwaves.</p>
<p>“There’s something we have to tell the authorities. Can we go right now?”</p>
<p>“We could never ignore Lady Raizar’s words, naturally. We were already told that they wished to speak with you as soon as you returned, anyway.”</p>
<p>“That is good to know.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group then headed to the royal palace, with Schnee in the lead. The members other than Garon and Risha were already inside.</p>
<p>They arrived in the room where the king was waiting and found Graffior already there, together with a few other people, likely high-ranked figures of the kingdom.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait, sire.”</p>
<p>“Please, do not say that, you are our saviors. I should apologize instead for making you come all the way here.”</p>
<p>Graffior then bowed his head. The other figures apparently already knew what Shin’s party had done for the kingdom, as they bowed their heads as well.</p>
<p>“I believe you were already informed that the Durgin which threatened the city has been neutralized. We sent the information first as we thought it was of the utmost priority, but there are also other things we must tell you about.”</p>
<p>“What would those other things be?”</p>
<p>“There is the possibility that this incident was caused by human hands.”</p>
<p>“!? …please, do go on.”</p>
<p>Schnee nodded and started explaining. The event was actually witnessed by Shin and Filma, but they had already told Schnee about it in detail.</p>
<p>Upon learning about the item that controlled the Durgin and the former player transforming into a monster, Graffior and the others had even graver expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>They were surely concerned about the existence of items that could control powerful monsters, but even more by the fact that humans could turn into monsters.</p>
<p>“This is certainly not information we can simply make public…the human turned monster appeared to be extremely powerful too. We would risk causing confusion among the populace, and nothing more.”</p>
<p>“I fully agree. I believe it is sufficient to inform only the country’s upper echelons first.”</p>
<p>In this world, it wasn’t as easy as before to gather or transmit information.</p>
<p>If a country made a public announcement it would become known to a certain extent, but even in such a case its contents would get twisted as it spread. As the information left the capital, it sometimes even changed to the complete opposite of how it started.</p>
<p>“Drawing up a countermeasure…is going to be difficult.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, unfortunately we do not know of any effective means either.”</p>
<p>【Analyze】 could reveal if the target was possessed, but as few people could use skills at present, it would be very difficult to find anyone in such a state.</p>
<p>Shin and the others were sure that any possessed humans couldn’t be found easily either.</p>
<p>If they weren’t registered as monsters when in human form, they could probably go through monster-repelling barriers too.</p>
<p>“Hmm, first of all, may I inform the kings of our allied countries? I do not know how much we will be able to do about the issue, but something might change even by just knowing about it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. We are going to inform people we deem trustworthy as well.”</p>
<p>Ability and trust. They could share information only with those who had both.</p>
<p>That was the opinion shared by all members in Shin’s party.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, they were thinking of Wolfgang from the Beast Alliance Falnido, Wilhelm in Bayreuth, former players and the support characters of 『Rokuten』 members.</p>
<p>“Countermeasures, hmm…”</p>
<p>After the meeting with Graffior, Shin’s party gathered in the room assigned to them to discuss the issue. As Schnee had told Graffior, there was nothing they could do at the moment.</p>
<p>“Could it be possible to add a status effect removal enchantment when you pass through a barrier? No, the barrier needs to have specific materials to hold enchantments, right…”</p>
<p>In the game era, a possessed target would be found out and exterminated or healed as soon as they got near a town. In the current situation, however, it wasn’t possible to fully defend all locations at the same time.</p>
<p>“We cannot deal with this on our own. Even if we spread our forces there is a limit to the number of locations we can protect, and there is no assurance we could prevent all threats either.”</p>
<p>“That’s right…”</p>
<p>The enemy’s numbers and fighting power were unknown too. Even if they set up countermeasures for possessed players, it would be pointless if the enemy attacked with large numbers of high level monsters.</p>
<p>In the current world, it was impossible to assemble large numbers of former players or Chosen Ones. If a large horde of powerful monsters appeared, even large countries would easily fall.</p>
<p>“A monster might be trying to pull off something on a grand scale.”</p>
<p>“You mean that item was made by a monster too? I know that some monsters have intellect higher than humans’, but…”</p>
<p>Sety and Filma voiced their thoughts out loud.</p>
<p>“There might be demons or devils involved too.”</p>
<p>“That’s the first thing that comes to mind, yeah. Then, the 『Summit Faction』, I guess.”</p>
<p>The church cardinal who had attempted to sacrifice a Holy Woman to a demon was part of the 『Summit Faction』 as well.</p>
<p>A demon had been pulling the strings behind their plans, but even without demon intervention the faction was always up to no good, as Shin and the others knew.</p>
<p>“By the way, it wasn’t players before, but the 『Summit Faction』 was involved in transforming people into monsters, right? We cannot be sure that demons are involved, but the enemy might be not only monsters.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The people who collaborate on their own free will are the most troublesome ones to deal with.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded bitterly to Schnee’s theory.</p>
<p>There were people not controlled by skills, items or through hostages, people that walked the path towards destruction on their own will, and they were the most difficult enemy to deal with.</p>
<p>They brought nothing but trouble to those around them, which made them even worse than others.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do now?”</p>
<p>“Let’s regroup with Shibaid and the others first. I want to check on Baltan too, just in case. I didn’t use the gem it gave me, in the end.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Yuzuha’s question with his thoughts.</p>
<p>He thought Baomultan’s gem might become useful in the fight against Durgin, but had no chance to use it.</p>
<p>He could remove the item that controlled Durgin without it, so he was confused about how he was supposed to use it.</p>
<p>“That pretty stone…I think you’ll use it soon.”</p>
<p>“You know how to use it?”</p>
<p>Yuzuha’s cryptic words came right when Shin was furrowing his brow about it, so he asked back.</p>
<p>“I feel like I do!”</p>
<p>“You can’t tell me anything concrete?”</p>
<p>“…kuu, no…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Ah!, no no, I don’t mean to blame you. Based on the timing I received it, I was sure I was going to use it in the last fight, so…”</p>
<p>Yuzuha pouted and Shin hurriedly apologized. She was in small fox mode, so he gently patted her to cheer her up.</p>
<p>After a while she started enjoying it, so he sighed in relief.</p>

<p>“…can I pet too?”</p>
<p>“….kuu.”</p>
<p>Sety approached Shin to join in the patting.</p>
<p>Yuzuha looked at Sety for a few seconds, then cried once to signal her approval and rested her head back on Shin’s lap.</p>
<p>“Ooh, so fluffy and soft…I could pet her forever…”</p>
<p>“I keep her fur in top form, after all.”</p>
<p>Brushing Yuzuha was one of Shin’s duties too. Thanks to 『Groomeister』, the highest quality grooming brush, Yuzuha’s fur never lost its luster.</p>
<p>“Guys, you’re going off topic…anyway, we’re not going back to Shibaid and the others immediately, right?”</p>
<p>“Right. We repelled the monsters, but something else might happen. I’m thinking of inspecting the town for any devices, traps or similar. It might be difficult in the royal palace, though.”</p>
<p>Every royal palace had secret rooms or passageways: if Shin inspected in detail he would surely find them, but Graffior would surely not enjoy that. Such rooms and passageways were worthy as long as they stayed secret.</p>
<p>“The king and knights could not deal with the current threats by themselves, so I think they will accept, though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, there might be something beyond their understanding hidden here, after all.”</p>
<p>Would they rebuild the secret rooms or passageways after Shin’s inspection? In any case, he doubted they would leave them like that.</p>
<p>“Let’s go ask right now, then. It’s going to take some time.”</p>
<p>As Schnee had guessed, Graffior immediately accepted Shin’s proposal.</p>
<p>A few of the other officials made rather sour faces, but did not object.</p>
<p>They probably prioritized eliminating any dangerous hidden contraptions more than an outsider exploring the castle.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s this?”</p>
<p>In one of the secret passageways connecting the interior of the castle to a forest just outside the walls, they found a trap that paralyzed and immobilized anyone who passed.</p>
<p>What Shin found intriguing was the fact that the paralysis gas tank that served as fuel for the trap was almost empty. There wasn’t enough to paralyze an adult human being.</p>
<p>“It does not seem like there are other traps.”</p>
<p>“…maybe this was his final attempt at rebellion.”</p>
<p>The man who begged Shin to kill him before transforming. Shin thought he might have set up the trap himself.</p>
<p>The inspection finished after 2 days, without any relevant discoveries.</p>
<p>Obviously enough, Shin and the party were asked to keep the castle’s secret sections to themselves.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 1 Part 2</p>
<p>“Let’s kick it up a notch.”</p>
<p>After the horse carriage left the gate and they had traveled some distance, Shin concealed it with a skill. They could move faster if they ran themselves, rather than driving at full speed.</p>
<p>Yuzuha couldn’t keep up with their speed for a long time, so she hopped on Shin’s shoulder. Shin’s speed was ludicrous, but she was a Divine Beast after all: she wasn’t going to fall off easily.</p>
<p>“Kuu! She’s floating!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha looked at Sety as she “skated” over the ground and wagged her tail in excitement.</p>
<p>She had stayed in town for safety as Shin and the others exterminated the monsters, so she had not seen Sety’s movement technique yet.</p>
<p>Floating or flying monsters weren’t a rare sight, so Shin didn’t expect Yuzuha to be surprised, but it apparently wasn’t so common to her.</p>
<p>“Hehehe, I might teach you how it’s done later!”</p>
<p>Sety was pleased by Yuzuha’s sincere reaction and gloated a bit.</p>
<p>Yuzuha realized that she might gain the ability to fly and was very eager to learn. Shin could tell by how wildly her tail wagged.</p>
<p>Would Yuzuha comprehend Sety’s “unique” explanations? So wondered Shin.</p>
<p>“Oh, there it is.”</p>
<p>Thanks to traveling at a speed physically impossible for a horse carriage, the group reached Romenun the same day.</p>
<p>“Hm? I detect monsters other than Baltan.”</p>
<p>On the edges of the poisoned area next to Romenun, Shin detected several monster presences that were not there when they left.</p>
<p>Shin turned towards the direction of the presences and activated the 【Clairvoyance】 skill.</p>
<p>There he found 5 Garmags: probably survivors of Shin and the others’ cleanup operation, which managed to travel all the way here.</p>
<p>Shin’s party had stayed in Passner for two and a half days, more than enough time for the Garmags to cover the distance at their usual speed.</p>
<p>“Should we get rid of them first?”</p>
<p>“This is a type of polluted area, so for Garmags it’s a natural habitat. They aren’t going to do any harm even if we leave them be.”</p>
<p>Poisoned areas did not invite human settlements or even animal presence: thus there was no need to go out of their way to hunt down the Garmags.</p>
<p>From the monsters’ standpoint, they had finally reached a place ideal for them to live.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know if there were corpses for them to feed on, but looking at the Garmags huddling together, he did not feel like taking them down.</p>
<p>They looked very weak and debilitated, without enough energy to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we tell Hydro and Oxygen about them? They might even start raising them as pets, saying they need to collect data or something.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s go with that.”</p>
<p>If they left this area and headed towards human settlements, they would take them down.</p>
<p>After making a decision, Shin then headed in Romenun’s direction. Soon enough, they reached the lake with the sunken Durgin.</p>
<p>Baomultan was on the lakeshore, as always, and Tiera and Shibaid were next to it. Oxygen and Hydro were likely gathering samples.</p>
<p>“Welcome back”</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Tiera and waved to Shibaid.</p>
<p>Baomultan too cried softly, as if welcoming the group’s return.</p>
<p>There weren’t any particular changes to report in Romenun.</p>
<p>The freed Durgin had passed over Romenun during its flight: Baomultan looked up at it and the Durgin looked down too, then flew on.</p>
<p>“Did we do the right thing?”</p>
<p>Baomultan answered by crying louder, then rubbing its snout against Shin.</p>
<p>Judging by its behavior, the previous cry was a form of approval: it was probably a correct assumption.</p>
<p>“By the way, there’s something I need to tell you, Hydro, Oxygen. Oh, I guess Baltan should hear too.”</p>
<p>If the Garmags were going to settle here, they would be inside Baomultan’s territory.</p>
<p>Baomultan was a peaceful monster, so unless the Garmags attacked first it would not go hunt them down.</p>
<p>So Shin thought, but he didn’t want for any trouble to happen because he didn’t tell them.</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen listened to his explanations about the Garmags while nodding with interest.</p>
<p>Baomultan too moved his head up and down, as if imitating them.</p>
<p>“Let us go capture them immediately. A monster spawned in the area created by Durgin is too rare to ignore. I wish to catch at least one.”</p>
<p>“Agreed. There’s a lot of research potential.”</p>
<p>The two immediately started their preparations, grinning and chuckling.</p>
<p>They packed their item boxes with nets and artificial lure, then wore equipment that let them temporarily use the Tamer job.</p>
<p>Such equipment was used by players that were not Tamers but wanted to catch a monster to keep as a pet.</p>
<p>Any player could easily gain the Tamer job with a little time, but most players preferred to use their time in other ways.</p>
<p>The equipment allowed the user access to several Tamer skills, so it was also used to test out the job.</p>
<p>“Okay, off we go!”</p>
<p>Prodded by Hydro, Shin led them to where he detected the Garmags. The monsters were beyond the range of Oxygen and Hydro’s detection skills.</p>
<p>The map showed that the Garmags had not moved away from their initial position, so the group reached the location quickly.</p>
<p>The Garmags apparently noticed that Shin’s group was approaching and were acting warily.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re weakened. Just perfect.”</p>
<p>Armed with the capture net, Hydro looked like a villain through and through. Oxygen did not say a word but looked as dangerous as her.</p>
<p>If the Garmags saw Baomultan they would likely escape, especially considering the difference in their stats, but they didn’t: they just tucked their tail between their legs and stood there, trembling, with no sign of attacking.</p>
<p>“I guess we don’t even need the nets? Look, we brought you food.”</p>
<p>Oxygen put out artificial feed created to make monsters more docile. The Garmags, however, simply continued trembling, not even daring to move an inch.</p>
<p>“Kuu, they’re scared of Shin.”</p>
<p>“Of me?”</p>
<p>Shin was surprised by Yuzuha’s comment. He thought they would be scared of Baomultan instead, as they were both monsters.</p>
<p>The Garmags had apparently witnessed Shin’s massacre of their brethren and the Kikiuz, so they were expecting to become his next prey and had half given up on life.</p>
<p>“I see…hey Yuzuha, if you can communicate, can you tell them that Hydro and Oxygen want them to become their companions?”</p>
<p>The Garmags were relatively close to Yuzuha in terms of species, so they could communicate. Yuzuha explained the situation and the Garmags agreed to go with Hydro and Oxygen, without a single objection.</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen had only equipped the Tamer job temporarily and could not benefit from most of its bonuses, but since they didn’t plan to fight it wasn’t an issue, or so they said.</p>
<p>“We accomplished what we came for, should we go back to Romenun? I have to tell you about what happened in Passner too.”</p>
<p>It was also the reason why Garmags had come all the way to Romenun, so Shin wanted to explain it in detail.</p>
<p>“A player transforming into a monster and an item capable of controlling a Durgin…quite worrying.”</p>
<p>“We will try analyzing it on our end too.”</p>
<p>Shin took out the collar that controlled the Durgin for Hydro and Oxygen to see.</p>
<p>Shin had performed a simple analysis too, but, at the moment, he only knew what materials it was made of. He found no clues about who made it.</p>
<p>“This is all I know about its contents. You can tell at first glance that it definitely wasn’t made to do good.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see, the main materials are orichalcum and scarletite. I supposed as much. Then…I see, nothing that you would go around gathering proactively…”</p>
<p>Shin related the results of his analysis and Oxygen reacted with a frown.</p>
<p>For Shin and Oxygen, it wasn’t strange for unique items to be made with magic metals. The problem was that the non-metal components of the item included things like blood and hearts.</p>
<p>In the game, these were nothing but item drops, but in this world, if you needed blood you needed to have a fitting container prepared and go actually harvest it.</p>
<p>If you had an item box like Shin had, you could store blood as an item card, but Shin would honestly prefer to avoid having to do that. Blacksmithing sometimes required blood to temper weapons, so he had built a certain resistance to it, though.</p>
<p>“You won’t use our facilities?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to relate what happened in Passner to several people via message card, but I think it’s better to go talk to Wolfgang in person.”</p>
<p>“Wolfgang…?”</p>
<p>Hydro and Oxygen seemed perplexed by the unfamiliar name, so Shin explained that he was Girard’s descendant. Beast types would give birth to several generations of descendants over 500 years, after all.</p>
<p>Shin preferred to meet him directly because he shared the blood of Girard, an important person for Shin. Wolfgang was also the king of the Beast Alliance Falnido, the largest Beast country in the continent of Eltnia, so he was sure it would be best to talk in person.</p>
<p>“That Girard, hmm…to think he lived until recently. That’s surprising in itself, but if he could pass on without any regrets, I suppose it’s a good thing.”</p>
<p>Shin expected Hydro to ask how a Wolf-type beast could have lived so long, but her expression did not show any such intentions.</p>
<p>Oxygen was the same too.</p>
<p>“I can’t say I am not interested, but I don’t want to think of my companions as research specimens.”</p>
<p>Shin jokingly asked about it and received this reply. They were interested to a degree, after all.</p>
<p>Shin was relieved to know that both Hydro and Oxygen did not think of their companions as research specimens.</p>
<p>Even if Hecate had created them with a mad scientist-like nature, they still treasured the people important to them.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave Girard’s descendant to you then. Leave Baltan and the monster in our care.”</p>
<p>Hydro spoke while looking at the Garmags. They normally dwelled in polluted areas, so they apparently felt right at home in Romenun’s poisoned zone.</p>
<p>Shin’s party thus left Romenun for Falnido. It was a fairly long distance via land, so they used a teleportation crystal to instantly warp to the location they registered the last time they were in Falnido.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even notice you registered a spot.”</p>
<p>“Well, no need to make a show of it, right?”</p>
<p>Shin couldn’t exactly tell he did it while taking a toilet break.</p>
<p>The party teleported to a forest, then moved by horse carriage, though Kagerou was the one to pull it.</p>
<p>Lulled by the vibrations of the reinforced horse carriage, Shin’s party headed towards the gate they were told about during their previous visit to Falnido. It was a gate reserved for those who had special permission to enter, unlike the regular one used by adventurers and merchants.</p>
<p>“Schnee and I will act as the coachmen. If the gate guards remember our faces, they shouldn’t be too wary.”</p>
<p>Shin had sent a message already, so he didn’t think they would be refused entry, but there was still the possibility of miscommunication or human error.</p>
<p>Schnee’s presence was likely to solve any issues they might have, but he wanted to avoid trouble as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Looks like they recognized us.”</p>
<p>“They were already informed of our arrival, apparently.”</p>
<p>The gate Shin’s party headed to was normally concealed by illusion skills. They didn’t affect Shin, however, so he waved to the gate guards and they waved back.</p>
<p>If Shin’s memory served him, one of the guards was there when they left Falnido the last time.</p>
<p>“Ehm, has His Majesty the Beast King informed you about our arrival?”</p>
<p>“Yes. However, for added safety could you show me the fang emblem His Majesty has entrusted you with?”</p>
<p>Shin stored the horse carriage and approached the gate, then one of the guards asked for such proof. Shin did as he was told and took out the accessory Wolfgang gave him from the item box.</p>
<p>“Duly confirmed. Welcome back to Falnido.”</p>
<p>The gate guard checked the accessory, nodded to another guard, and politely greeted Shin and the group.</p>
<p>The guards had already sent a horse messenger to inform Wolfgang of their arrival.</p>
<p>The guard said that someone would be there to pick them up and soon enough a gorgeous horse carriage arrived. It was a lavishly decorated vehicle, used to welcome important guests.</p>
<p>It was also rather comfortable, definitely of high quality for this world’s standards.</p>
<p>Horse carriages used by nobles and the royal family, while better than those used by the average citizen, still shook considerably; the lack of vibrations in this carriage clearly showed that a lot of money had been invested in it. As expected of the welcome carriage for royal guests.</p>
<p>Shin’s party was led to the same room they used when they reunited with Girard. There they found Wolfgang, Cuore, and two other Beastmen.</p>
<p>After a simple greeting, Wolfgang urged the two new faces to introduce themselves.</p>
<p>“I am honored to meet you. My name is Volk Degaro, I am a minister in the service of King Wolfgang.”</p>
<p>Volk, the Beastman who spoke first, was the type closer to Beast than human. He wore a loose-fitting uniform similar to a folk costume.</p>
<p>He had white wings, a black beak, and black hair. His physique was also larger than Wolfgang’s: if he stood up he would probably measure over two mel. He was likely a Type Eagle beast.</p>
<p>It was generally hard to tell the gender of Beastmen leaning to the Beast side, but judging from Volk’s low voice and physique he was a male, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>His level was 244. Despite the bulky physique, his job was Mage.</p>
<p>Maybe because he could detect Shin and Schnee’s magic power, he seemed slightly nervous.</p>
<p>“I am a minister too, my name is Ciel Tio.”</p>
<p>The other beastman was closer to a human: the only signs of the Beast species were animal ears and a tail.</p>
<p>Ciel had short blond hair with hints of black here and there. Her thin black eyes were darting around, observing Shin’s party closely.</p>
<p>Ciel’s slender physique suggested she was female: she also wore an easy to move outfit, similar to Cuore. She did not seem as nervous as Volk.</p>
<p>Her level was 239, her job Beast Warrior.</p>
<p>“Do they know about us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve told them already. Think of them as Lord Girard’s Rajim and Van.”</p>
<p>Close retainers worthy of trust.</p>
<p>Wolfgang said he had already told Volk and Ciel about them, but they introduced themselves all the same. As they revealed their identities, they could tell the two Beastmen looked tenser.</p>
<p>“How could I put this…your party has become even more incredible than before.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang knew about Shin and the others’ exploits already, but he couldn’t help feeling a bit awkward.</p>
<p>The cause was the presence of the former Dragon Emperor, Shibaid, as well as Sety and Filma, who were on the same level of prowess as Girard. They had heard about them from Girard, so they had an idea of how powerful Shin’s party was.</p>
<p>“Er…I know it’s weird for me to say this, but try to relax and listen.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere had turned tense after they just introduced themselves.</p>
<p>The sole exception was Cuore, who wasn’t nervous but looked extremely excited instead.</p>
<p>Shin started relating what happened in Passner and the air surrounding Wolfgang changed again. It was tense, but in a different way from before.</p>
<p>He was listening closely, as commanded by his responsibility to rule the country. Volk and Ciel too listened intently.</p>
<p>“I thought I had understood the situation after reading your message, but I cannot help feeling shocked.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang and the others took the situation gravely.</p>
<p>Wolfgang especially knew well how different players were from normal humans, thanks to knowing Girard.</p>
<p>Their knowledge and skill were very advanced, of course, but more than anything they had a certain something that set them apart from others.</p>
<p>Many of them were also famous: while Shin did not know them, the people of this world would accept most incredible events if one of them was involved.</p>
<p>“Those who know players well would be even more shocked to know this. Of course, players are living creatures like us, so they too will die eventually…but still, there is something that sets them apart from us.”</p>
<p>Volk and Ciel too nodded to Wolfgang’s words.</p>
<p>Chosen Ones were different from normal people too, but since they were born and raised in this world, they felt they did not have that different “something” players had.</p>
<p>“Really…well, let’s leave that aside for now. I wanted you to know that there’s someone out there who can do things like what happened in Passner. It’s frustrating, but we haven’t come up with any effective countermeasures, though.”</p>
<p>“No, simply knowing about it makes things very different. You have my gratitude for all your information.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang bowed his head and the other three followed suit. Shin knew that they were acting like that also because he was Girard’s master, but still thought they lowered their heads too much.</p>
<p>“Anyway, that’s all the reason why we came here. Thanks for lending us your time.”</p>
<p>Kings and royal retainers were certainly not people you could easily meet for a casual chat.</p>
<p>Considering the contents of the “chat” and the person it came from, Wolfgang and the others would surely accept to meet them, but Shin didn’t want to take too much of their time.</p>
<p>“Where will you be headed now?”</p>
<p>“I plan to visit several countries to talk with the people we know there. Some of them I can’t contact via message card, after all.”</p>
<p>Only players and support characters knew of message cards. The only exception to this rule was high-ranked people who had access to such rare items. It wasn’t unusual for even Chosen Ones to not be aware of their existence.</p>
<p>The first people that came to mind to Shin were Todo Kankuro and the Five Supreme Blades in Hinomoto, Hibineko, Shadow, and Holly in Balmel. The Five Supreme Blades had knowledge of the game as characters, so they were pretty similar to players, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>“In that case, I would like to ask you to inform the Dragon Emperor. The empire holds a vital position in the continent, so I would like them to know such information quickly. Falnido will send an official document about your report as well, but I believe that they will understand better the gravity of the situation if Sir Shibaid appears in person. If you have not decided on your next destination already, please consider it.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang added that had the report come from someone other than Shin and Schnee, they wouldn’t have believed it at first. Information from the Beast Alliance would certainly be treated with due priority, but meeting them directly would add more importance to the matter.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s a good idea. I know a bit about the empire too. It’s the country Shibaid used to be in, we can trust them. I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>Shin actually meant to go there immediately. The Beast Alliance used communication via Mind Chat, so information could be exchanged quickly.</p>
<p>As Wolfgang said, however, they could not know if the empire viewed the situation as grave or not. The greater the country, the more information it needed to parse. There was even the possibility that the Emperor hadn’t learned about it yet.</p>
<p>Shin strongly wished for them to realize the gravity of the situation, so he had no objections to having Shibaid or Schnee act as intermediaries to provide the information to the empire.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 1 Part 3</p>
<p>After leaving the Beast Alliance Falnido, Shin’s party promptly headed towards the Dragon Empire of Kilmont.</p>
<p>Kagerou was pulling the horse carriage at the usual breakneck speed. He made sure to accelerate only when there weren’t merchants around, though.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, can I entrust you with meeting the Dragon Emperor?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, things should work quickly if I go in person. I might have left the empire, but I have no objections to informing them about impending danger.”</p>
<p>Shibaid was prepared for the empire to turn hostile after his departure, as Shin heard from Schnee. Shin thus wasn’t sure it was a good idea to send him as a messenger, but both Shibaid and Schnee assured him that the empire didn’t actually consider them to be enemies.</p>
<p>“Hmm, by the way, how much do you know about Kilmont, Shin?”</p>
<p>On the path to Kilmont, this topic came up in the conversation between Shin and Shibaid.</p>
<p>“All I know is from documents I read in Falnido or what I heard while traveling, but I know that the empire acts as a breakwater against the monsters coming from the Sacred Place. Like I said before, I’ve never been there, though.”</p>
<p>“Your understanding is correct. The method they use is to build forts at fixed intervals between the capital and the Sacred Place. Troops stationed in the forts communicate regularly and cull the monsters. Monsters have a tendency to avoid the forts and move inland, so the remaining monsters are dispatched by mobile units. They cannot stop them completely, like in Balmel, however.”</p>
<p>The terrain grew thinner from the empire towards the Sacred Place, apparently as a consequence of the crustal movements.</p>
<p>Monsters spawned in the Sacred Place spread in all directions, so it wasn’t possible to eliminate every single one.</p>
<p>If the number of spawned monsters was low they attempted to eliminate them all, but when there were many, the stronger monsters or the ones with higher mobility were prioritized.</p>
<p>“One more thing, the empire also receives reinforcements from the alliance and the church. The scale of the conflict is different, so there are more people than the Balmel battle you participated in, Shin.”</p>
<p>Like what happened in Balmel, if Kilmont fell the hordes of monsters spawned from the ‘flood’ would scatter throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Considering the size of the continent, the number of monsters that spread through it could not be too high, but for the people living there, it was definitely a serious problem.</p>
<p>Animals other than human beings would suffer grave casualties as well, and, if nothing was done about them, the continent would become a den of mindless beasts.</p>
<p>For this reason, military aid to the empire was never neglected, barring emergency situations.</p>
<p>“I guess there are a lot of Chosen Ones too, then. Or rather, it would be dangerous if there weren’t many.”</p>
<p>Average soldiers could maybe deal with monsters around level 200, but if they started nearing 300, there was little the average soldier could do.</p>
<p>That was exactly what happened in Balmel, but Shin thought the empire housed greater numbers of Chosen Ones. He might even meet people he knew.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you are acquainted with them, but there are a few former players as well. Do you want to meet them?”</p>
<p>“If we have the chance, sure. Considering how many players there were in total, chances are I don’t know them, though.”</p>
<p>Having met Hibineko, Holly, and Shadow in Balmel had been a truly rare event.</p>
<p>“…or maybe not…?”</p>
<p>Could it be that the players who were transported to this world shared a connection with him?</p>
<p>The possibility had crossed Shin’s mind before.</p>
<p>Not only the three former players in Balmel, but all former players he met until now were people he knew.</p>
<p>Milt, who he met during the Holy Woman kidnapping incident. Hameln, who used an evil tag on Schnee, and Hilamee and Masakado in Erkunt.</p>
<p>Thinking about them, Shin started wondering if his theory was actually true. He had met too many people he knew, after all.</p>
<p>There were also players he didn’t know, such as the one who was transformed into a monster in the latest incident. Shin thought that there might be other conditions involved.</p>
<p>“Is there something on your mind?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually.”</p>
<p>Shin told Shibaid about the common thread among the players he met.</p>
<p>“Hmm, one of the player killers Schnee investigated, was it. Most of them were related to you somehow, weren’t they?”</p>
<p>“I wonder…you could say they were related, but at that time Shin simply cut down any and all player killers he found. Thinking about it now, they did not have a close relationship with Shin, unlike Holly or Shadow, they simply happened to meet.”</p>
<p>Schnee answered Shibaid’s question after reflecting for a short while.</p>
<p>Shin had already seen the player killer list Schnee had compiled.</p>
<p>Some of them he remembered, others did not stir any recollection from him. He cut down PKs in the same way as he did with monsters, so he did not care too much to remember each of their names.</p>
<p>According to the moral standards of his former world, it was a very dangerous way of thinking.</p>
<p>In the game world, however, where there were no police, no organizations to maintain public order, so there was no other way.</p>
<p>Shin was convinced of this even now. In 【THE NEW GATE】’s game era real-world laws were meaningless.</p>
<p>“Is that so important?”</p>
<p>Tiera, who had been listening, joined in the conversation.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I want to to find every last one of them, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t concerned.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not like you chose those… ‘players’ yourself, right? So I don’t think you should worry about them…”</p>
<p>What Shin did, regardless of whether it was right or wrong, was still within the bounds of how the game operated.</p>
<p>Things you could do and things it was OK to do were certainly different, but in the game defeating PKs did not have any penalties. Naturally, it was impossible to somehow purposefully send an opponent into another world such as the game world.</p>
<p>In that sense, what Tiera said was right. Shin hadn’t sent them to this world himself, nor did he even think that was possible.</p>
<p>“I guess you’re right, but…”</p>
<p>“While listening to you, I got the feeling that you were the one dragged into it instead.”</p>
<p>“I was dragged into it?”</p>
<p>The comment came from Filma, so Shin turned towards her.</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s not like you were supposed to come here in the first place, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s—”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety had joined the party relatively recently, so Shin hadn’t yet told them how he had come to this world. Schnee had probably informed them.</p>
<p>As far as he knew, the only people he knew that came to this world were players who died during the death game. Shin was the only exception.</p>
<p>Filma’s comment might not be far from the truth.</p>
<p>“It’s not like our present situation is going to change anyway, so it’s pointless to think about the issue any longer if you ask me. Let’s talk about something more constructive instead.”</p>
<p>Shin agreed with Filma’s conclusion and stopped thinking about things he couldn’t figure out.</p>
<p>Even if he dragged others into this world, or was dragged into it, the present was not going to change.</p>
<p>“So, what’s this constructive topic of yours?”</p>
<p>Shin bounced the ball back to Filma.</p>
<p>“The design of the ring you are planning, of course.”</p>
<p>“Wait a second, I only told Schnee about that, why do you—”</p>
<p>Shin turned towards Schnee, who was looking outside the horse carriage. The bright red color of her ears clearly explained what happened.</p>
<p>“She let it slip while telling me about your lovey-dovey days, you see.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you didn’t make her slip yourself?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, how could I ever do such a thing?”</p>
<p>Shin glared at Filma, who looked away from him immediately.</p>
<p>Seeing her poke her tongue out playfully, Shin realized he had guessed right.</p>
<p>Next to Filma, Sety had the same expression on her face. They had ganged up on Schnee and forced her to sing, apparently.</p>
<p>“Sheesh..it’s not like it was an absolute secret, but…”</p>
<p>“She was so happy with you, that she slipped a bit, that’s all— ”</p>
<p>“Big sis Schnee got so chatty when she started talking about it— ”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety looked at Schnee as if they were real sisters.</p>
<p>Schnee was usually quiet, but not laconic. Shin knew that she actually talked a lot to people she trusted. To Filma and Sety, even more so.</p>
<p>“I must know more about that matter.”</p>
<p>“You too, Shibaid…?”</p>
<p>Shibaid joined in the conversation, intrigued by a topic completely new to him. His dragon-like face made it hard to tell, but his lips were definitely curved into a grin.</p>
<p>“Of course, I will tell you all about it, even the tiniest detail.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful. I cannot join in your ladies’ talk, after all.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded to Filma’s answer, very satisfied.</p>
<p>Schnee, still looking at the scenery, seemed to be shaking — but it definitely wasn’t because of the road. Her ears, even redder than before, proved it.</p>
<p>“You can ask me about it too, Shibaid, you know…”</p>
<p>“Oh no Shin, I would much prefer to hear everything from Schnee.”</p>
<p>Living alone with Shin was something Schnee had desired for the longest time. As a support character like her and her comrade, Shibaid surely preferred to hear her talk.</p>
<p>“You guys…”</p>
<p>For Schnee, this conversation was nothing but embarrassing, but she had no way to escape as long as they were traveling in the carriage.</p>
<p>Tiera, who had stayed out of the conversation, was conflicted as to whether she wanted to hear more about it or not, and simply looked at Filma and the others.</p>
<p>Yuzuha was on Schnee’s lap and looked up, as if peeking at Schnee’s face, but Shin didn’t know what she wanted to do.</p>
<p>Shin’s party thus spent a peaceful journey towards Kilmont: they arrived at their destination after a few days.</p>
<p>Because of the monsters, it wasn’t strange for the borders between countries to be unclear. In Falnido and Kilmont’s case, the border area was managed jointly by the two countries.</p>
<p>The actual reason was that no towns or villages were built in that area, in order to use it to gather the monsters spawned during the ‘flood’, so they decided to govern the area in such a manner, as Shibaid explained to Shin.</p>
<p>Maybe because the area was used to channel monsters inside, there were large quantities of them everywhere.</p>
<p>Extermination priority was given to the monsters heading towards Kilmont, for matters of protection, so the monsters tended to move towards the alliance.</p>
<p>Falnido was aware of this and sent troops to the area, who cooperated with Kilmont’s troops to exterminate the monsters.</p>
<p>“If only there weren’t so many monsters, you could build towns here. It’s not an incredibly rich area, but the soil is very fertile.”</p>
<p>Apparently, they had inspected the terrain too. There was a small settlement near the fort used for defensive maneuvers.</p>
<p>From the countries’ standpoint, building an unauthorized settlement was surely a problem, but, because of the nature of the area and the small scope of the settlement, they turned a blind eye to it.</p>
<p>As it was unauthorized, there would be no compensation even if they suffered monster casualties.</p>
<p>“Without the ‘flood’, this area would have developed as a center for trade and communication between the two countries.”</p>
<p>It took one whole month to go from Falnido to Kilmont, even by driving a horse carriage in a straight line. Any travelers between the two countries would need to stop at the various settlements along the way during the trip, so it actually took more time. These settlements were authorized, however.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s that?”</p>
<p>Shin and the others were thus chatting as they advanced towards Kilmont, when they spotted a group of horseback knights ahead of them.</p>
<p>They were 24 in total: the knight in the lead was carrying Kilmont’s flag, if Shin’s memory served him.</p>
<p>The knights motioned at the horse carriage to stop, so Shin complied. Two knights left the group and approached the carriage.</p>
<p>“We are the 12th knight division of the Kilmont empire. I am Raekker, the captain. Are you headed towards Kilmont?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Do you have business with us?”</p>
<p>The knight who spoke first had flaming red hair and sparkling armor. There was one more knight behind him, wearing the same armor and a helmet.</p>
<p>The knights did not seem to bear hostility or ill will, so Shin and the others decided to act like they were normal adventurers.</p>
<p>“So you came from Falnido…that is why you do not know about the ‘flood’, then. Most of the monsters have already been exterminated, but some managed to flee in this direction, according to the reports. Our forces are fully concentrated on locating and exterminating them, but the area cannot be said to be safe yet. If you will proceed, please exercise the utmost caution. That is all, thank you for your time.”</p>
<p>“No, we are thankful for your warning.”</p>
<p>The knights immediately left, quickly disappearing in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>They were warning all travelers and merchants they found about the remaining danger, telling them to flee or ask nearby knights for help if necessary.</p>
<p>Their attitude was extremely polite, without the slightest sign of intimidation.</p>
<p>Shibaid said that they were one of the divisions posted in the border forts.</p>
<p>“Look, over there.”</p>
<p>A short time after the meeting with the knights, Shin’s party came in view of the fort. It had been built in a location surrounded by plains, to make it easy to scan the surroundings.</p>
<p>The fort gates were wide open, as files of troops were coming out of it.</p>
<p>“Reinforcements to deal with the ‘flood’? Maybe the fighting hasn’t ended yet.”</p>
<p>“According to the knights, they are dealing with the remnants now, but…there might have been extensive casualties.”</p>
<p>Schnee answered Shin’s question with a worried tone.</p>
<p>There were provision units among the troops heading west, and the number of soldiers was high, so her hypothesis sounded convincing.</p>
<p>“That standard’s emblem belongs to the 3rd royal knights division. They are elites who are only deployed when monsters over level 500 appear. That could be one of the survivors the knights talked about.”</p>
<p>Shibaid explained that it was a special division formed by Chosen Ones and high-level knights. It had been deployed a number of times in the past as well.</p>
<p>“Do they act outside of emergencies?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. They have been deployed on several occasions during my time as well. The situation is without a doubt risky, but it might not be an emergency.”</p>
<p>Shibaid added that if it wasn’t like that, the empire could barely continue functioning as a country.</p>
<p>“The situation must be dire, however. It might take some time before we can have an audience with the Emperor.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Shibaid’s whisper while looking at the soldiers’ advance.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 1 Part 4</p>
<p>After looking at the troops depart, Shin’s party joined the queue of adventurers and travelers to enter Kilmont.</p>
<p>During the immigration inspection, they were asked to join the monster extermination efforts, possibly because Shin and Shibaid were rank A adventurers, and the guards saw Kagerou in his large form.</p>
<p>Emergency requests were posted at the guild as well, to inform adventurers who arrived in the country after the ‘flood’, like Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“We got in easier than expected. The townspeople don’t seem too concerned either.”</p>
<p>“‘Floods’ happen more frequently here than any other place in the continent, after all. The townspeople must be used to it. The warriors’ line of defense has never been broken through, I imagine.”</p>
<p>Shibaid used the example as he knew of Shin’s exploits during the Balmel ‘flood’.</p>
<p>The “flood”, phenomenon caused by magic power accumulating in Sacred Places and turning into monsters, happened with different frequencies based on the location.</p>
<p>Some ‘floods’ happened in locations surrounded by cliffs or the sea, so they could not cause any damage, others had to be countered every time, as it happened in Kilmont.</p>
<p>“How is the inspection of the Sacred Place going?”</p>
<p>“That is probably the one thing that isn’t going well at all. Some parts are surrounded by the sea, so reaching them is arduous in itself. Besides, in the sea, there’s that.”</p>
<p>“That what?”</p>
<p>Shin judged from Shibaid’s frown that whatever “that” was, it was definitely something very troublesome. It was something related to the sea, that much was clear.</p>
<p>“I haven’t fought it personally, but Rah Muon has been confirmed to be there.”</p>
<p>“I see…that.”</p>
<p>Hearing the monster’s name, Shin understood why Shibaid would react like that.</p>
<p>Rah Muon was a gigantic merman-like monster: it was a fish in human form and looked very similar to mermen. The only difference was the size.</p>
<p>Rah Muon’s total length, its height in human terms, was about 40 mel, as far as Shin remembered. Its arms alone spanned over 20 mel. In comparison, Reforgerer looked like a cute little pet.</p>
<p>According to certain websites, it sometimes exceeded even 50 mel. It was one of the largest monsters in 【THE NEW GATE】, barring irregular ones.</p>
<p>Its mouth alone was big enough to easily swallow a small boat. Encountering it in the sea depths scarred many players forever, it was a monster through and through.</p>
<p>“There are no records of it ever attacking unprovoked, but anyone that approaches the Sacred Place islands is beaten mercilessly. I’ve seen it grab Serpents as if they were small fish and rip them apart. Even if there aren’t any records, I doubt humans could survive that.”</p>
<p>If someone was dragged in the sea by Rah Muon, they wouldn’t be found anymore.</p>
<p>Monsters that average humans would see as enormous were nothing but ants for Rah Muon. Humans were smaller than mice in its eyes: crushing them would be a cinch.</p>
<p>“It only attacks whoever approaches the Sacred Place? Not in any other circumstances?”</p>
<p>“There are records about it saving people stranded at sea before. I think its nature might be the same as before.”</p>
<p>In the game, Rah Muon was a boss monster that roamed the open seas.</p>
<p>It never did anything to players unless provoked, however. It swam in the ocean depths, so it was a rare occurrence just to encounter one.</p>
<p>Maybe it appeared sometimes in shallow waters and surprised players, but that was it. That was the reason why it was only treated as a possible source of trauma.</p>
<p>“For the time being, the best course of action is to stay away from it, then. Research of the Sacred Place won’t proceed, but to charge into a place protected by Rah Muon on purpose is a bit…”</p>
<p>There were other Sacred Places after all, so it wasn’t necessary to go stir that particular beehive.</p>
<p>“Let’s go find a place to stay, first of all.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I know a good one.”</p>
<p>Since the party entered the empire on their horse carriage, they needed to find an inn with a large enough space to accommodate it.</p>
<p>It was technically possible to turn it back into a card, but considering the carriage’s size, there was no way to do so without looking conspicuous. Shin asked Shibaid if he knew of any inns that could fit the carriage, and the latter replied positively.</p>
<p>Soon enough, they reached their destination: an inn for adventurers named “Blue Breeze Lodge”.</p>
<p>It was an inn for middle to high-class adventurers, complete with facilities such as parking spaces for horse carriages and stables for mounting beasts.</p>
<p>Shin approached a young staff member working outside and asked where he should put the horse carriage.</p>
<p>He told Shibaid and the others to go ahead and rent their rooms. It was Shin’s first time in a Dragnil country, but Shibaid and the others did not risk making mistakes due to not knowing the place.</p>
<p>After securing the rooms, the next scheduled stop was the guild. Because of its position as overlookers of adventurer activities, they could surely find information about the current state of the flood there.</p>
<p>Shibaid had already contacted the Dragon Emperor via a message card.</p>
<p>“You know, while we were coming to the inn I thought that the city looked really modern. The buildings are pretty much the same as they were in the game era.”</p>
<p>“Dragnils are a species with high longevity, after all. There are many of them who’ve honed their skills to high levels, as well as many people living ever since before the Dusk of Majesty. Since they don’t have particular preferences for the place they choose to live in, unlike other long-living species, the town developed like this, I suppose. Lord towns are also pretty close to the old capital.”</p>
<p>Pixies built villages to live in.</p>
<p>Elves stayed in forests.</p>
<p>Beasts too chose to live in specific places, according to their type.</p>
<p>Dwarves often lived close to mines or woodlands, but only because it was easier to gather materials there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Humans, Dragnils, and Lords did not have particular preferences for the place they lived in. Dragnils generally preferred warmer places, but that was it.</p>
<p>They were all long-living species, with the exception of Humans; as Shibaid said, they had the advantage in terms of honing their craftsmanship. Many of them possessed unique techniques.</p>
<p>Maybe, because of a sort of racial pride, Dwarves still were superior in terms of craftsmanship. They supervised all technical work, with the exception of magic-related crafts.</p>
<p>“The union, right? I’d like to see any documents about them, if we have the chance.”</p>
<p>Vulcan, a Dwarf Shin met in Erkunt, had procured materials about anti-devil weapons from the union.</p>
<p>Judging from the fact that they retained material about things that were considered mythical at present, the union’s network of information was not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>“We’re almost at the guild, you two.”</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid were engrossed in conversation, so Filma let them know they had reached their destination.</p>
<p>Shin looked at the guild and noticed many armed warriors going and coming out. They all seemed to be in a hurry, maybe because of the flood.</p>
<p>“Is it just me, or are we attracting an awful lot of attention?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s always like this.”</p>
<p>Shin calmly replied to Sety’s observation. They always attracted attention, ever since Bayreuth, so he had grown used to it.</p>
<p>Schnee and Tiera alone attracted envious gazes just by walking side by side.</p>
<p>Now there were also Filma, a different type, but beautiful nonetheless, and the adorable Sety; it was almost like they were asking for people to look.</p>
<p>Because of Shin, Shibaid, and Kagerou, still in his large form, accompanying the women, no one dared to go beyond looking at the party.</p>
<p>“It’s more crowded than expected.”</p>
<p>The door leading into the guild was clearly larger than the ones they were used to seeing, as it was probably built for Dragnils. Inside, they found a packed entrance hall.</p>
<p>There were people huddled around the request board and others enjoying a meal in the adjacent tavern.</p>
<p>“Some people are standing by as reserve forces, others never joined in the anti-flood efforts in the first place. It’s usually like this unless the flood is very large in scope. Some adventurers go gather consumable materials too.”</p>
<p>“That looks difficult in its own right.”</p>
<p>The more Shin learned about Kilmont, the more he realized that without it the continent would easily fall into chaos.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like they’re treating it as a crisis, but things might take a turn for the worse.”</p>
<p>Shin and the others waited for the reception to be less crowded, then went to ask about the current state of things.</p>
<p>The monster attacks caused by the flood had already happened four times. Their numbers were great, but their level was not too high, so the forts were not at risk of falling yet.</p>
<p>Among the many low-level monsters, however, there were several units of absurdly high level: the troops Shin’s party saw leave when they entered the country were headed to exterminate such dangerous foes.</p>
<p>“Should we help a bit with the counter-flood operations?”</p>
<p>“Adventurers ranked B and above are contacted if a state of alert is declared. According to the receptionist, we’re not at that stage yet.”</p>
<p>In case of a real emergency, the soldiers stationed in forts would contact the capital. The guild would also be informed immediately, so there shouldn’t be substantial lags in communication.</p>
<p>Shin and Shibaid were both rank A adventurers.</p>
<p>Even if the information was being restricted to avoid panic, adventurers of their rank could be informed privately, added Shibaid.</p>
<p>Shin, however, was concerned by the fact that he had already heard voices and rumors about the counter-flood reinforcements being late from the surroundings.</p>
<p>Because of the crowds, he couldn’t tell who said what, but he felt like he heard the same kind of worried comments multiple times. Just like someone was spreading such rumors on purpose.</p>
<p>“…anything from the Dragon Emperor?”</p>
<p>“They said someone would come to pick us up — there it is.”</p>
<p>Shibaid and the Dragon Emperor could use the new generation Mind Chat through their adventurer cards, so Shibaid had already informed him of the situation while they were on the move.</p>
<p>The guild was closer to the castle than the inn, so the carriage had been sent to the guild to pick up the party.</p>
<p>Shin and the others left the guild and waited away from the main flow of people going in and out of the guild. Soon enough, a carriage with strikingly gorgeous decorations appeared.</p>
<p>The horse carriage was even drawn by a horse-type monster, 『Bullhorse』, roughly two times larger than the average horse.</p>
<p>“It sure stands out…”</p>
<p>“They don’t have any time to waste, after all. Forgive them this one time. They also have something to discuss with us, apparently.”</p>
<p>They could talk via Mind Chat, but apparently, the Dragon Emperor wished to see Shin and the others in person. There might be something else happening that Shin’s party did not know about yet.</p>
<p>“Could it be that what we came to tell them about is already happening?”</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t look like that, at least for now. I think it’s about the flood.”</p>
<p>Shibaid had not heard the details yet either, so he pondered what the Dragon Emperor wanted to talk about, his chin resting in his hand.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the wait. We will depart immediately, please board the carriage.”</p>
<p>The coachman stopped the carriage in front of Shin’s party, quickly stepped down, and opened the door for them.</p>
<p>The surrounding adventurers and citizens looked curiously, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>The party got on the carriage, which proceeded to the castle without being stopped at the gates for inspection, as expected from a convoy for official guests.</p>
<p>When Shin and the others got off, someone was already waiting to guide them inside.</p>
<p>“(Whoa, the soldiers’ eyes are sparkling…)”</p>
<p>Shin talked to the others via Mind Chat while they followed the guide.</p>
<p>The soldiers looked at Shibaid as one would look at a famous athlete or singer.</p>
<p>“(Well, he’s the first emperor after all. He doesn’t disguise himself like Schnee either. It’s kinda strange to see adults excited like that, though.)”</p>
<p>Filma nodded as she replied, though to anyone else it would only look like she was nodding to herself.</p>
<p>“(The ‘Black Dragonlord’, the living legend who led and fought for all Dragnil…a hero among heroes who always protected his allies and bravely faced any and all foes. His halberd knows only victory, no enemy could stand after a single swing — they say that Dragnil kids all dye their scales black these days.)”</p>
<p>Something had apparently flipped Sety’s switch: she wrapped herself in her robe in some strange pose and started talking about the trends among Dragnil children.</p>
<p>“(Now that you mention it, I saw lots of Dragnils with black scales in town.)”</p>
<p>Schnee recalled seeing them on their way from the town gate to the guild.</p>
<p>“(Enough jokes.)”</p>
<p>“Ouch!?”</p>
<p>Sety’s switch had turned completely on, so Shibaid unleashed a sharp chop to stop her.</p>

<p>It didn’t look like he had put force in it, but it was still a chop from someone with very high physical attack and defense.</p>
<p>Sety was focused on magic attack and defense, so, even if he held back, the attack would be powerful all the same.</p>
<p>It was painful enough for her to express her pain out loud, instead of in the Mind Chat.</p>
<p>Shibaid signaled to the guide that nothing happened and they continued walking.</p>
<p>“(You went a little overboard there, Sety.)”</p>
<p>“(Big sis Schnee…I wanted to hear that earlier…)”</p>
<p>Despite her words of reproach, Schnee caressed Sety’s head.</p>
<p>“(Well, you’re so respected in this country, Shibaid, so you could overlook Sety’s antics, no?)”</p>
<p>“(Truthfully, I had the feeling that was not to be overlooked.)”</p>
<p>If she was allowed to continue, she might even have started pretending a dark power was awakening in her right eye or something.</p>
<p>Shibaid looked at her with a mixture of pity and compassion in his eyes.</p>
<p>“(I suppose that is a symptom that certain people develop in their teenage years.)”</p>
<p>“(Definitely.)”</p>
<p>Shin realized Sety had the same “sickness” he had contracted too. He could only hope she wouldn’t do things that she was going to be embarrassed about in the future.</p>
<p>“(We’re not going to the throne room?)”</p>
<p>Shin was mapping the castle via 【Magic Sonar】 and noticed they weren’t heading to any large chamber commonly used for royal audiences.</p>
<p>“(It seems they don’t have time for ceremonies.)”</p>
<p>Shibaid seemed to be already aware of the fact.</p>
<p>As they proceeded through the castle, the number of people around them progressively decreased. There were, however, more and more guards, so Shin concluded they were heading towards a tightly guarded section of the castle.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of walking, Shin’s party arrived before one of the rooms in the furthermost part of that section of the castle. Each door was decorated exquisitely and engraved with emblems and crests, showing the importance of the rooms they led to.</p>
<p>Two guards were standing before the door: both were Dragnils and had the Paladin job. Their level was 255, so they certainly weren’t ordinary soldiers.</p>
<p>Their equipment was very similar too, but the Dragnil to Shin’s right had an appearance closer to oriental dragons, with blue scales. The one on the right was more similar to a western dragon, with red scales.</p>
<p>“His Majesty has been expecting you.”</p>
<p>The guide silently stepped to the side of the corridor, then the red-scaled Dragnil addressed Shibaid with these words and opened the door.</p>
<p>Shibaid had contacted the Dragon Emperor, so he led the party inside the room. The rest followed him following the order: Shin, Schnee, Filma, Sety, Tiera, and Kagerou. Yuzuha rode on Shin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“It has been a long while, Shibaid. I am glad to see you again.”</p>
<p>As they entered the room, the black-scaled Dragnil sitting on the chair in the middle of the room stood up and spoke.</p>
<p>Shin felt the same air he had perceived from the kings he met until now emanating from him: the aura of a monarch, someone who ruled over people.</p>
<p>— Zaikuin Baal Kilmont Level 255 Dark Knight</p>
<p>His level was maxed out, obviously.</p>
<p>Not all the kings Shin had met had high levels, but it felt natural for Zaikuin‘s level to be so high.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that he had fought alongside Shibaid either.</p>
<p>“I believe I haven’t met your other companions, other than Lady Schnee. My name is Zaikuin Baal Kilmont, emperor of the Dragon Empire of Kilmont. It is a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>Schnee had deactivated her disguise: having worked alongside Shibaid in the past, she had met Zaikuin before.</p>
<p>Shin and the others introduced themselves too.</p>
<p>“Shibaid, so this man is your master.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>Shin felt Zaikuin’s eyes on him while he introduced himself and presumed that the emperor already knew about the High Humans. Zaikuin’s eyes were fixed on him, easily proving Shin’s assumption.</p>
<p>“Seeing him with my own eyes, I can truly feel that the myths were reality. So this is what it means to look at something apparently infinite…”</p>
<p>Zaikuin was apparently trying to gauge Shin’s capabilities, but the latter did not expect to be described as “infinite”.</p>
<p>What most people perceived and sometimes feared were the abilities provided by the game avatar and the powerups provided by the mysterious titles he received, but, if he returned to his reality, Shin was nothing but a student.</p>
<p>(If the real me had come to this world, would Schnee and the others have treated me the same?)</p>
<p>Such a thought surfaced in Shin’s head while he listened to Shibaid and Zaikuin talk.</p>
<p>“(Kuu~ No problem.)”</p>
<p>“(Yuzuha?)”</p>
<p>Shin was sure he hadn’t voiced his thoughts, but Yuzuha responded to them via Mind Chat, while pressing her paws on his cheeks.</p>
<p>“(No one stays with you because of your strength. So, no problem, kuu~)”</p>
<p>Yuzuha rubbed her cheeks against Shin’s and he felt all tension leave him.</p>
<p>He didn’t know why he had thought about something like that. But he immediately accepted Yuzuha’s words as true: if she said it, it had to be so.</p>
<p>“(Thanks.)”</p>
<p>Shin thanked Yuzuha, then looked at Zaikuin. As Shibaid’s master, he had to maintain a proper attitude.</p>
<p>“You are aware of the information already, sire?”</p>
<p>“About the transformation of humans into monsters, yes. I have seen zombies and similar creatures before, but nothing like what Shibaid told me.”</p>
<p>Not even the emperor of a large country such as Kilmont had ever heard of such happenings.</p>
<p>“Please let me know what you felt when you saw it, Sir Shin.”</p>
<p>What Shibaid knew was all through Shin, so the latter’s opinion as an eyewitness was important too.</p>
<p>Shin talked about everything he saw that day in as much detail as possible: how the human seemed to be possessed and retained part of his conscience. He also mentioned the bizarre traces of intrusion into the castle and the trap set in the secret escape passage.</p>
<p>“Hmm, if the state of possession could be dispelled, we might learn about the mastermind, but it seems that would be quite difficult. It would not be reliable either.”</p>
<p>“If they are just kept alive in the possessed state, they might turn back into corpses once it’s dispelled.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that the possessed player was alive when he saw him.</p>
<p>After seeing him bloat beyond his original form, he began wondering if it wasn’t already too late to save his physical body from the moment they met.</p>
<p>“If there is no way to save them, I suppose they should be taken down at first sight.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. The player expressed the same wish.”</p>
<p>What happened to him to make him plead to be killed so much? Even if Shin knew monsters were creatures that normally did such things, he couldn’t help but feel furious.</p>
<p>“You have my thanks for sharing such precious information. What are your plans now? Will you leave already? Shimaia wanted to see you too.”</p>
<p>The main conversation was over, so Zaikuin inquired about the party’s plans.</p>
<p>Shimaia was Zaikuin’s daughter: she could have attended the meeting, but apparently didn’t as she was not told about Shin’s High Human identity.</p>
<p>“We plan to visit several countries. In any case, I have refused already. I serve my master now, thus I cannot respond to her feelings. It would not be right to give her any expectations.”</p>
<p>Based on their exchange, Shin thought the princess had feelings for Shibaid. He had the feeling he had heard something like that before, but couldn’t remember well, so he asked Schnee for confirmation.</p>
<p>“(Shibaid stated it clearly, so I don’t think there can be doubts about it. He took care of her since she was a child, so he only sees her as a daughter, apparently.)”</p>
<p>Shin imagined that taking care of a princess was the duty of maids or servants, but since she was the first daughter, not only Shibaid but also Zaikuin and the empress tended to her as much as they could.</p>
<p>“You’re the only one who’d ever take that girl as a bride, though…”</p>
<p>“Please, that’s not funny. I am sure she has people vying for her affections everywhere.”</p>
<p>“If we disregard succession rights and hierarchies, there are many other princes and princesses. If necessary, she’d throw away her status without a second thought. She’s tougher than you think, my friend.”</p>
<p>“You’re starting to talk like when you were young, my friend.”</p>
<p>Shibaid noticed that the emperor had changed to a more frank kind of speech.</p>
<p>“In this room, there is only you, your master, and your companions, no need for formalities. I used to be an adventurer too. Besides, I never was a serious stick in the mud like you.”</p>
<p>“You never change, do you…”</p>
<p>Schnee smiled helplessly: Zaikuin was always that kind of person, apparently.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t proper for an emperor to act like that, but Shin found him much more approachable now.</p>
<p>“Hm? Someone’s coming this way.”</p>
<p>After smiling relieved at Shibaid and Zakuin’s casual exchange, Shin’s detection skills picked up something. The map clearly showed an icon heading towards the room.</p>
<p>It was a single icon, moving too fast to be walking.</p>
<p>“Could it be…?”</p>
<p>“Sorry friend, looks like she found out.”</p>
<p>Zaikuin answered Shibaid’s doubt in a troubled tone, putting his fingers to his temples.</p>
<p>The new presence was going to barge in the room just like that, or so thought everyone present.</p>
<p>“It stopped?”</p>
<p>The icon stopped in front of the door, and they could hear the guards talking with someone. An endless cycle of “let me in!” and “no can do”.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if I should say she has grown, or she’s still the same…”</p>
<p>Shibaid seemed to know who this new guest was. Shin had a pretty clear idea too.</p>
<p>“Let her in.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded and Zaikuin signaled to the guards to let the “guest” in the room. The door opened, revealing a female Dragnil.</p>
<p>Judging from her wings and tail, she was the type closer to the human side of the species.</p>
<p>The beautiful young girl had jet black eyes and deep crimson hair tied behind her head.</p>
<p>Shin thought she was the princess they talked about but was surprised to see that she was not wearing a dress, but a suit of armor.</p>
<p>— Shimaia Uru Kilmont Level 232 Dragon Knight</p>
<p>She definitely was not the type of princess Shin had envisioned: she was more like Princess Rionne of Bayreuth.</p>
<p>“Shibaid!! I heard you were visiting, so I came!”</p>
<p>“Greet us properly first.”</p>
<p>The girl’s high spirits were promptly silenced by Shibaid’s chop. It was probably more powerful than the one delivered on Sety’s head: the girl held her head in pain.</p>
<p>Shin wondered if it was alright to treat a princess like that, but since Zaikuin did not say anything, it might be a normal routine for them.</p>
<p>“M-my apologies. I am the daughter of King Zaikuin, Shimaia Uru Kilmont. I was in a bit of a rush because I heard Shibaid was visiting. Please forgive my rudeness.”</p>
<p>Shimaia stood up tall and greeted the group with a polite, noble air to her, completely different from before. Her expression was still a little awkward, probably because of the lingering pain.</p>
<p>“Honestly…I’m sorry, everyone.”</p>
<p>“Well, we have already talked about the important topics, anyway.”</p>
<p>They were just going to leave, so Shin thought the timing of her arrival wasn’t bad at all, so he reassured Zaikuin and Shibaid, who looked at him apologetically.</p>
<p>“You have finished talking? Thus you have already asked Shibaid for support, father?”</p>
<p>“Support?”</p>
<p>Shibaid looked at Zaikuin, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>Zaikuin first acted like he didn’t know what she meant, but he probably understood he couldn’t keep pretending and reluctantly started talking.</p>
<p>“You and your big mouth…don’t look at me like that, Shibaid. Now that you have left the country, I am not going to rely on you so easily”</p>
<p>According to Zaikuin, the number of monsters spawned by the Sacred Place was unprecedented, so the defensive lines were starting to crack.</p>
<p>The knights who approached Shin’s party before their arrival in Kilmont did not give out any hints about such a situation, so they were either unaware or kept it hidden.</p>
<p>“Are there reinforcements coming from other countries?”</p>
<p>“The reinforcements from the church are expected to arrive today. We have contacted our allied countries as well.”</p>
<p>Zaikuin added that the situation was still relatively secure, at least until the expected arrival date of the reinforcements.</p>
<p>The monsters spawned this time, however, exceeded even the greatest floods ever recorded.</p>
<p>There were many kinds of monsters as well, especially insects and four-legged beasts.</p>
<p>“There are many high-level monsters too, I suppose? We have seen the 2nd division leave when we arrived in Kilmont.”</p>
<p>“You guess correctly. More than 10 monsters over level 500 have already been confirmed. The damage to the forts is escalating quickly.”</p>
<p>“If so, why?”</p>
<p>“When you left the country, you said you were prepared for us to become enemies. Thus — no, that is just the facade.”</p>
<p>Zaikuin paused for a moment, then looked at Shibaid straight in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Shibaid. To rely on you means to rely on your master as well. I know — know the world before the Dusk of Majesty, know how powerful your master can be. Because of this knowledge, I cannot rely on you so easily.”</p>
<p>Zaikuin had probably seen what Shin and his party could do with his own eyes.</p>
<p>He knew what the High Humans had done, how powerful they were, not through tales or legends, but as reality.</p>
<p>“Since you are the only ones listening, I will speak frankly. I was scared out of my wits. My responsibility as the emperor allowed me to stand as if I was unfazed, but when I heard you were coming, I trembled. And after actually looking at you, I realized it: you did not simply exceed my imagination, but much more. I recalled witnessing how you faced monsters and players much stronger than us and pulverized them as if they were nothing.”</p>
<p>Even if Shin and the others did not mean to, the overwhelming power they possessed made them difficult to approach.</p>
<p>Zaikuin had actually witnessed Shin’s battles; even if he knew of Shibaid’s connection to him, he could not approach Shin without hesitating.</p>
<p>His sense of duty as emperor was what made it possible for them to meet, apparently.</p>
<p>“Shibaid and Lady Schnee have told me about you. Now that we have met and I could learn a bit more about you, I understand there is no need to fear you so much.”</p>
<p>Zaikuin’s casual attitude had been an act too. He thought he could act like that because of Shin’s nature, but was still very worried that he was being too informal.</p>
<p>“If we rely on you, however, it will be difficult to continue hiding his existence. Sir Shin’s power is far too great. People will notice, and even if they don’t, someone will surely want to know more about you.”</p>
<p>High Humans were spotted in Kilmont. It was likely for such rumors to arise.</p>
<p>“What I fear the most is to start thinking that we can rely on you when the time comes. I am not a saint: that power of yours, greater than any monster, is terrifying but also awfully appealing. I have witnessed how fearful it can be in battle, but can’t help but think like that. Those who only know it through tales and legends are in even more danger of being enthralled. Similar things happened many times when Shibaid was here too. Some of those who support Shimaia and Shibaid’s marriage do so because of his strength. Even if we did not receive your direct help, but only Shibaid’s assistance, the same concerns would arise.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like we were always relied on, anyway. There were people who feared us, even if we did not mean to make them feel that way.”</p>
<p>Schnee reacted to Zaikuin’s words.</p>
<p>Schnee and the other former support characters too possessed powers far beyond the average in this world. Because of her connections with various countries, she had surely experienced herself what Zaikuin talked about.</p>
<p>People feared and avoided the strong, but at the same time relied on and clung onto them. Shin had had similar experiences, so he couldn’t help but nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Zaikuin was slightly relieved to see Shin agree. He spoke frankly but was afraid he had gone a bit too far. Shin understood Zaikuin’s momentum grew as he talked, so he ended up saying more than intended.</p>
<p>Only Shimaia, who did not know Shin was a High Human, could not keep up with the conversation.</p>
<p>“Father? What on earth are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“There is no need for you to know…is what I’d like to say.”</p>
<p>Maybe because she was surprised by Zaikuin’s uneasy air, Shimaia did not realize Shin’s real identity.</p>
<p>From Zaikuin’s words, it was possible to guess that a High Human had returned, so she might realize it in the future.</p>
<p>Zaikuin seemed to be thinking about how he should explain it to Shimaia.</p>
<p>There were no ministers or generals in the room, even though it wouldn’t be strange for them to join in on their conversation. Zaikuin was probably the only one who knew Shin’s true identity.</p>
<p>“Shimaia, all of the people here have powers on par with Shibaid. Lady Filma and Sety too were subordinates of the High Human called the Dark Blacksmith. You know about Sir Girard, don’t you? All of the Dark Blacksmith’s subordinates except him are here now. Even I would get nervous.”</p>
<p>“Oh my! All those people who vanished for such a long time!”</p>
<p>Zaikuin shifted the topic from the High Human’s presence to his subordinates. He did not plan to reveal such a truth just like that, not even to his daughter.</p>
<p>Filma and Sety’s existence was known, but after the Dusk of Majesty they had become part of legend, so what he said was not exactly wrong.</p>
<p>Filma had been trapped in a 『Drop of Erathem』, but Sety could leave her village if she wanted, so Shin did not know she was treated as a myth in the same way.</p>
<p>He asked her via Mind Chat and Sety replied that she concealed her appearance whenever she left the village. Considering the place she was protecting, her decision was surely the right one.</p>
<p>“In that case, I believe there is all the more reason to petition for their assistance, is it not?”</p>
<p>“No, it is not such a simple matter.”</p>
<p>The empire was in a critical situation and needed all the help it could get. So said Shimaia, but Zaikuin seemed to be conflicted.</p>
<p>Shimaia’s opinion was not wrong: as the emperor, Zaikuin had the duty to resolve the current emergency and limit casualties as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Hmm, now that I think about it, you have only seen our large-scale battles, haven’t you.”</p>
<p>Shibaid had been listening to Zaikuin and Shimaia’s exchange, then spoke up as if he recalled something. At the same time, he communicated with Shin via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>He stated two of his opinions:</p>
<p>How the current flood was suspiciously different from all others before it.</p>
<p>That he wished to help with the counter-flood efforts.</p>
<p>According to Shibaid, Zaikuin’s excessive concerns stemmed from the fact that he believed Shin’s power to be uncontrollable: once it was unleashed it would bring indiscriminate destruction, much like a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>If they showed him that it was not the case and that Shin’s abilities were more limited in scope than Shibaid or Schnee’s, people would not realize Shin was a High Human.</p>
<p>Shibaid had parted ways with Kilmont, but it was still the country he used to rule, now protected by his former comrade in arms. It was natural for him to wish he could help.</p>
<p>Shin could understand that much and was concerned himself by the fact that the flood was greater than any other one yet.</p>
<p>Shin quickly nodded to Shibaid. He had helped Shin many times since they reunited, so Shin would never refuse an earnest request from him, even if there wasn’t a greater cause involved.</p>
<p>“In simple terms, it’ll be fine if no one finds out.”</p>
<p>“Shibaid?”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s unusual smirk left both Zaikuin and Shimaia dumbfounded.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 1 Part 5</p>
<p>After it was decided they would cooperate with Kilmont, Shibaid became extremely talkative.</p>
<p>He would participate in the emergency efforts as an adventurer: Shin and the others would also be dispatched as high-class adventurers.</p>
<p>Not even the monsters over level 500 Zaikuin mentioned could pose a threat to Shin’s party. If they fought on the same level and each did a similar share, Shin didn’t risk standing out too much. Depending on the circumstances, Tiera might end up standing out more, since she fought with a divine beast as her partner.</p>
<p>“With Shibaid and Schnee fighting together, I bet most people will focus on them.”</p>
<p>Two of the most famous warriors on the continent were fighting side by side: they would obviously attract a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Since standing out was one of their goals this time, Shibaid and Schnee would fight without disguises.</p>
<p>The other party members would surely attract attention too, just not to the same degree, or so Shin predicted.</p>
<p>“So now the leaders have gathered to exchange information…”</p>
<p>Shin and the others moved to a large conference room, to be introduced to the empire’s leading figures aside from Zaikuin and Shimaia and decide their upcoming strategy.</p>
<p>Looking at the imperial officials, generals, officers, and other major members, Shin muttered something under his breath.</p>
<p>“(So…why are you here?)”</p>
<p>“(Hmm, maybe because I’m the strongest in the church’s reinforcements, right?)”</p>
<p>“(Why are you asking me…)”</p>
<p>It would be suspicious to mumble by himself, so Shin switched to player chat.</p>
<p>The person he talked to was a short girl with unusually large eyes, Milt.</p>
<p>She had been manipulated by demons and forced to do their bidding. After Shin brought her back to her senses, she assisted the church in order to make amends for kidnapping the Holy Woman.</p>
<p>As part of such efforts, she joined the reinforcements sent by the church to Kilmont.</p>
<p>They talked via chat, but Milt smiled and waved at Shin.</p>
<p>“(I’m not a follower of the church, but just a collaborator, so it’s not like I’m in charge of their troops, though. I was told that I should join in this briefing because I’m their greatest asset in battle, you see.)”</p>
<p>Milt looked upwards as she continued talking via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>Her gaze pointed at a man clad in the armor reserved for church knights and a woman wearing monastery robes. They were talking with a Kilmont officer, so they were probably commander and vice commander of the church reinforcements.</p>
<p>The man introduced himself as Reiner, the woman Lourie.</p>
<p>“(I didn’t expect to see you here though, Shin. Is there a demon behind this flood?)”</p>
<p>Demons were involved in the event that led to Milt and Shin’s reunion, so she thought they might be this time too.</p>
<p>“(We came to Kilmont for another reason, we just heard about this crisis. I have no idea what caused the flood either.)”</p>
<p>“(Oh really. Can I ask about this other reason?)”</p>
<p>“(You know about it already, Milt. I contacted you a couple of days ago, right? About the player transforming into a monster.)”</p>
<p>On the way to Kilmont, Shin had contacted everyone he could about the events that transpired in Passner.</p>
<p>“(Oh, that. I was surprised, but there’s nothing I can do about it myself. There are few people who use the possession statuses to attack, so protecting myself with the item you sent is pretty much all I can do…)”</p>
<p>Shin had sent an item that neutralized the possession status with the message card, for added safety. It was a necklace, so it wasn’t visible, but Milt probably equipped it already.</p>
<p>“(Aside from that, did you talk directly with the emperor? Don’t tell me you sneaked in…wait, Schnee’s with you, so it’s possible…)”</p>
<p>“(I’m not sneaking in anywhere, with or without Schnee! Shibaid is the former emperor, so we got in thanks to his connections.)”</p>
<p>Milt was apparently unaware that Shibaid was the former Dragon Emperor, so she was very surprised.</p>
<p>“(I see. I didn’t know much about the empire, now that I think about it…)”</p>
<p>“(What have you been doing until now? Weren’t you traveling all over the continent?)”</p>
<p>“(I got manipulated once, after all. At first, I was hunting monsters close to where I lived.)”</p>
<p>She had returned to her senses thanks to Shin and helped rescue the kidnapped Holy Woman, so she was probably trusted to an extent.</p>
<p>“Milt, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Oh? I saw someone I know, so I just said hi.”</p>
<p>Reiner noticed what Milt was up to and looked at Shin. There was a rather sharp glare in his eyes.</p>
<p>“The war council isn’t over yet. Focus.”</p>
<p>“Yessir!!”</p>
<p>Milt saluted and winked in response.</p>
<p>Shin caught Rainer’s eyes slipping down towards Milt’s ample bosom.</p>
<p>He understood well what Reiner was probably feeling, so he pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>“Shin, please.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>
<p>Schnee noticed Shin and Milt’s conversation, then urged him to focus again on the meeting. He looked down at the map: the current topic was how to move the armed forces.</p>
<p>The map showed Kilmont on the right and an approximate location of the Sacred Place. The forts and symbols unknown to Shin were marked as well.</p>
<p>“We have received a report that the sixth wave of the flood is currently heading towards fort 11. The 3rd imperial knights division is heading to take down the Stoluz that spawned in the fifth wave. Based on the speed of the sixth wave they are likely to encounter it during the battle or immediately afterward. Even if the level of the monsters is low, to face a horde of them while fighting with a high-level monster would be too risky. Reinforcements have to be sent to all forts, but I wish to prioritize making sure that the 3rd division does not encounter the sixth wave horde of monsters.”</p>
<p>“The closest fort is the 9th, so sending reinforcements there is our only option, I suppose. Should we increase the numbers?”</p>
<p>“Focusing on that fort would increase the burden on the other ones, though. According to the reports, the repairs of the frontline forts are running behind schedule.”</p>
<p>The council was clearly split on the usage of their limited forces.</p>
<p>“…what do you think, Shibaid?”</p>
<p>While the commander in charge of the reinforcements and the Kilmont general were exchanging opinions, Shimaia asked what was on Shibaid’s mind, since he had only been listening quietly.</p>
<p>The people who were discussing so fervently until a moment ago turned suddenly quiet. Everyone wanted to know, apparently.</p>
<p>“I have a general idea of the casualties and damage. I wish to know more details about the enemy. What happened to the monsters from the first to fifth wave?”</p>
<p>The conference room turned deadly silent, in stark contrast with the previous heated discussion. Shibaid’s low, calm voice echoed clearly, and the captain of the first division of the imperial knights rose to reply.</p>
<p>He was a Dragnil with black scales like Shibaid, though they were slightly lighter in color, named Rhubaid.</p>
<p>Like Shimaia, his name was similar to Shibaid’s because of the Kilmont custom to name children after the country’s heroes.</p>
<p>Shin had heard about this from Schnee before.</p>
<p>“We do not have a complete understanding of the monsters that moved to the Falnido area, but all monsters up to the fourth wave should have been exterminated. Some smaller packs of the fifth wave are still scattered, however. We have dealt with the larger packs, but not with all the smaller ones.”</p>
<p>“I have heard there are several high-level monster units too?”</p>
<p>“The 3rd royal knights division is supposed to deal with them. According to our scouts, most high-level monster units are moving independently. A few of them, however, have joined smaller packs. I believe it will be necessary to send more reinforcements, from the forts or here, to eliminate them. We have already sent orders to the 2nd royal knights division not to engage in fighting beyond their capabilities.”</p>
<p>Shibaid was the former emperor, but now he was just an adventurer, so Rhubaid did not use especially polite speech to him. Shibaid did not seem to mind either.</p>
<p>The 3rd royal knights division was apparently scheduled to deal with the monster units acting independently. Even that division, created to eliminate high-level monsters, would have a hard time if said monsters joined packs of lower-level monsters.</p>
<p>“In that case, let us send Shin and Tiera to deal with them.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>Shin and Tiera reacted with surprise at being called out all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Shibaid did not use a title to address Tiera because he did not use it with the other members either.</p>
<p>Shibaid normally addressed other support characters with a title, but Schnee and the others were an exception.</p>
<p>“The adventurers with you, I see. Can they handle it?”</p>
<p>“Schnee and I both vouch for them. Think of them as having abilities on our level.”</p>
<p>“…at a time like this, I should be glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s clear words made Rhubaid’s expression cloud a little.</p>
<p>He probably thought they couldn’t be completely on the same level.</p>
<p>From Rhubaid’s standpoint, however, it meant that there were six people capable of annihilating the entire country, or at the very least bringing it to its knees, so he couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.</p>
<p>Schnee and Shibaid’s character was well known, but the same could not be said for the others.</p>
<p>“A skilled adventurer by the name of Shin…could you be the 『Slashing Hammer』?”</p>
<p>“…yes, well, I have been called that before.”</p>
<p>Shin’s nickname was mentioned by Reiner, the church knight who had reprimanded Milt before.</p>
<p>“So you are the adventurer who became famous after the Balmel flood. But wait…if Sir Shin is the 『Slashing Hammer』, then Lady Tiera is the 『Bow Princess』?”</p>
<p>“Er, I don’t know about that.”</p>
<p>“It’s the name given to the archer who shot arrows of light on the battlefield. I heard she was an elf with unusually black hair. And a party member of the『Slashing Hammer』, if I recall correctly.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that he was definitely talking about Tiera.</p>
<p>He was as famous as Schnee in Balmel, so it was not strange for him to receive a nickname. He honestly wondered why only his 『Slashing Hammer』title had gotten so popular, though.</p>
<p>He did not think that Tiera had received a nickname matching her 『Bow Princess』 gear set, though.</p>
<p>She had not used that equipment in Balmel, so the nickname probably came from the fact that she was a beautiful bow user.</p>
<p>“I have heard of your exploits as well. This flood has already reached levels close to the one in Balmel. If you have fought successfully then, we can expect great things from both of you.”</p>
<p>“Naturally.”</p>
<p>Rhubaid’s words were answered not by Shin, but by a vigorously nodding Shibaid.</p>
<p>Shin considered the Balmel events to be in the far past already, but maybe because information spread slowly, or maybe because they were adventurers, many of the people present were surprised by Rhubaid and Reiner’s words.</p>
<p>“If you allow me a proposal, could Sir Shin and Lady Tiera accompany us? Our church reinforcements are set to head to the 9th fort. If necessary, we will join with the 3rd royal knights division. As our destination is the same, I do not believe it necessary to move separately.”</p>
<p>Reiner waited for a lull in the conversation to make this proposal. Shin intended to move independently, so Reiner’s words took him by surprise.</p>
<p>“As long as the schedule we decided on is respected, we have no objections. What do you say, Sir Shin? We have been informed that Sir Shibaid and his companions are allowed to move independently.”</p>
<p>Rhubaid then turned towards the back of the conference room, where the emperor was seated.</p>
<p>He meant to implicitly ask Zaikuin for his confirmation, and the latter nodded. All final decisions about the movements of the imperial army lay with the Dragon Emperor.</p>
<p>In the case of Shin’s party, it was definitely more effective for them to move freely than to join other divisions.</p>
<p>“We will go ahead by ourselves if urgent reinforcements are needed, but unless such circumstances happen I have no issue accompanying you. What do you think, Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have no objections either.”</p>
<p>Tiera, who would have never expected to know that a nickname for her was also spreading, was still a little shaken.</p>
<p>Shin suspected that there was something behind the proposal, but as long as they went to exterminate dangerous monsters he had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>He did not know where the monsters were, nor was he familiar with the lay of the land, so he wasn’t sure he could locate the monsters quickly.</p>
<p>It was still possible for them to act independently, but he probably wouldn’t charge into a monster horde and go wild as he did in Balmel.</p>
<p>The imperial army seemed to have precise information about the monsters’ whereabouts, so there was no reason to act on his own and risk going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Another reason was that he wanted to ask Milt about what happened to the Holy Woman Hermie, after they left.</p>
<p>“What should the other members do?”</p>
<p>Shin asked Shibaid, to reinforce the impression that Shibaid was the leader of the party.</p>
<p>“I am thinking that I will go with Sety while Schnee will go with Filma. It will be more effective to deal with the monsters like this.”</p>
<p>Groups composed of one front and one rear guard member. Shin and Schnee could take both roles if needed, so the balance was not bad.</p>
<p>Tiera’s stats had grown remarkably and she had equipment provided by Shin, so she could surely perform well as a rearguard fighter.</p>
<p>Her fighting ability was the lowest in the party, but with Shin as her partner and Kagerou at her side, she would not drag him down.</p>
<p>Or rather, it was simply unfair to compare her with them: for a denizen of the new world, Tiera’s strength was already at nigh impossible levels. She was the only one unable to believe it.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Schnee’s fame would also help boost the morale of the soldiers who did not know of their participation yet.</p>
<p>“Sety and I will proceed west towards the Sacred Place. Schnee and Filma will head north, destroying any monster groups on the way. Shin and Tiera will act as mobile units, prioritizing the elimination of high-level monster units.”</p>
<p>“No objections.”</p>
<p>Shin had no qualms about the strategy.</p>
<p>The most important point when dealing with floods was the number of monsters.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Filma would gather them in one place, then Sety and Schnee would eliminate them with large-scale magic: that was the most effective method. Moving in small groups allowed high flexibility and prevented the possibility of friendly fire.</p>
<p>It also meant being able to cover a smaller area, but the high speed provided by their stats compensated for more than enough. Their movement and extermination speed were overwhelmingly greater than any single army.</p>
<p>“The numbers are different, but the strategy is the same as during Shibaid’s era. Its effectiveness is proven and we do not have to take special measures. I personally agree.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Adopting unusual strategies could lead to confusion among the troops. Are there any objections?”</p>
<p>Shimaia agreed and Rhubaid finally asked for any different opinions, but everyone nodded in response.</p>
<p>During Shibaid’s reign, they used a similar strategy of gathering monsters into one spot and eliminating them in one fell swoop. For Kilmont, it was a tried and true method they were familiar with, so many nodded with conviction.</p>
<p>After the movements of Shin’s party were decided, the meeting proceeded smoothly. The usage of the available forces had been the bottleneck, evidently.</p>
<p>“So, why are you coming with us? Like it’s the most natural thing in the world?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be so mean! With all the things that happened between us!”</p>
<p>After the conference, Shin and the others returned to their inn. They were offered a room in the castle, but they were adventurers, so Shibaid opted out of such special treatment.</p>
<p>Their numbers increased as they returned to the inn, however: Milt had followed the party.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need to stay with the church people?”</p>
<p>“I said I wanted to go with you, and they said it was a good idea, instead. I guess they want to make connections with Shibaid and Schnee, more than you, though. They’re from the 『Healing』 Holy Woman faction, not the 『Soothsaying』 one.”</p>
<p>The fact that adventurers had collaborated with the church to rescue Hermie, the “Soothsaying” Holy Woman, was known: it was said that they were powerful Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>The Holy Women were not in direct conflict with each other, but they had different factions backing them, probably interested in making connections with powerful figures, or so Milt said.</p>
<p>“Well, I have no intention of making connections either.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought so.”</p>
<p>Milt had used the connection building as an excuse to go with Shin’s party.</p>
<p>“I have a few old acquaintances here, and it’s not like we communicate often. We have to use chances like this to talk. I’ll tell you about what I heard in the church too, how about it?”</p>
<p>“Talking is fine, but you’re a tad too close…”</p>
<p>“Come on, what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear if she was aware of it or not, but Milt was hugging Shin in a way that his arm was squeezed between her breasts. Shin already pushed her away, but Tiera’s gaze was piercing him like a dagger.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Schnee had already departed, so only Tiera, Yuzuha, and Kagerou were left.</p>
<p>If Schnee was present, she would have definitely looked at Shin the same way Tiera did.</p>
<p>“I see you have new people with you too, I bet you have lots of interesting stories to tell.”</p>
<p>“I have a really bad feeling about this…”</p>
<p>Shin’s group would leave the next day, together with the church troops.</p>
<p>Milt said she was going to spend the night with them and wouldn’t be persuaded, so Shin already had a headache from her far too easygoing attitude.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 1</p>
<p>The next day…</p>
<p>Shin had managed to push the overly excited Milt into Tiera’s room and avoid spending the night in the same room with her. Nothing would have happened even if they slept in the same room, but there was no need to act in a way that could create misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“So, somehow Tiera slept while hugging me like a pillow and…”</p>
<p>“Nope, not listening.”</p>
<p>When Shin entrusted Milt to Tiera the night before, she had almost fallen asleep on her feet, so they probably slept in the same bed. Tiera’s expression seemed positively glowing, but Shin thought it might be just his imagination.</p>
<p>“Ahaha, she’s so small and cute, so I couldn’t resist…”</p>
<p>“Go easy on her, please. But doesn’t Sety fit those criteria too, though?”</p>
<p>The two were very similar in appearance, barring one major exception.</p>
<p>“Looks-wise, that’s true, but Sety is so much older than me…”</p>
<p>No matter how young Sety looked, Tiera couldn’t treat someone older than her like that. The age difference between Tiera and Milt was nothing compared to Tiera and Sety, after all. Because of that, Tiera felt the urge to cuddle with her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have older siblings, so this feels pretty new to me.”</p>
<p>“Really? I was sure you were the type to get angry if they treated you like a little kid.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe…thanks to my motherly assets, no one ever treats me like that, actually.”</p>
<p>Milt puffed up her chest proudly and her symbols of maternity, as most men regarded them, swayed visibly. That was the one part of her body which could rival or even exceed other adult women.</p>
<p>“Well, a lot of men just give me lewd looks, while women look at me with envy, though. Sometimes I would get the mascot treatment, but as soon as they knew how strong I was they’d get scared and stay away.”</p>
<p>On one hand, she had an adorable appearance, on the other, she fought by swinging 『Breogand』, a giant halberd that not even adult men could carry, to slice enemies in two or using all sorts of poisons.</p>
<p>Her fighting style leaned on the physical side, despite her appearance.</p>
<p>One time, a High Wyvern flew at low altitude over a small town: Milt jumped up and cleaved it in half with 『Breogand』, causing all the other adventurers present to look at her with a mixture of terror and admiration.</p>
<p>Even the adventurers closer to Milt ended up putting more distance between themselves and her. The male ones continued to give her lewd looks, however, which Milt said was just unacceptable.</p>
<p>“I get where you’re coming from…maybe?”</p>
<p>Shin never experienced such radical changes in how people approached him, so he could only understand superficially what Milt said.</p>
<p>“I know well what you mean by lewd looks.”</p>
<p>Tiera nodded vigorously to Milt’s confession.</p>
<p>Shin also knew that Tiera attracted attention wherever they went. While she wasn’t on Milt’s level, Tiera was also very well endowed.</p>
<p>She was beautiful to boot, so it was only natural for her to attract the gazes of men.</p>
<p>“Shin, you can stare as much as you want, you know? Here, here.”</p>
<p>Milt raised her chest seductively, pushing it closer to Shin.</p>
<p>Her usual equipment, the 『Oriental Battle Garb』, did not show much skin on the upper body, so even a pose like this wouldn’t show the classic cleavage.</p>
<p>While it didn’t show any, the pose made Milt’s clothes take the shape of her breasts: there was no skin exposure, but it was very sensual nonetheless.</p>
<p>“You’re getting aggressive again, Milt. Easy, easy, don’t get so close.”</p>
<p>Tiera and Yuzuha were present too, so Shin stepped away from Milt, to prevent any misunderstandings. Thanks to his relationship with Schnee, he had become more resistant to such temptations.</p>
<p>“There are very few people I can play with like this, you know. With the people here, I can’t help but wonder if what they really want is my power or my equipment. It’s really hard to find people you can trust completely…”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t play with me either…does the church feel cramped?”</p>
<p>Milt’s tone became serious, so Shin asked seriously too.</p>
<p>“There are good people too, like Hermie and Rashia, but when I think about someone to marry…sometimes they introduce people to me, but most of them are like ‘I’m strong, right?’, ‘I’m a badass, right?’ or ‘I bet you’re head over heels already!’ or stuff like that.”</p>
<p>In this world, physical strength played a very large part in how attractive a person was.</p>
<p>A strong adventurer could earn more, while a high-class individual could gain better treatment or a better position. People like that would naturally flaunt their strength before anything else.</p>
<p>However, it did not always create a good impression.</p>
<p>“You always loved fighting strong opponents, so don’t you like strong people in general?”</p>
<p>“In the game, I simply enjoyed fighting, and, during the death game, I was looking for someone that could kill me. But now, I don’t think like that anymore.”</p>
<p>“Eh!? Just now…did you say…you wanted someone to kill you…?”</p>
<p>Among the things Milt talked about with complete nonchalance, Tiera heard something shocking and couldn’t help but react.</p>
<p>“Shin, did you tell Tiera about what happened in the past?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, from when Marino was around till after she was gone.”</p>
<p>“If she already knows that much, then I guess it’s okay.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t something suitable to talk about in public, so they had their meals brought to their rooms. Milt spoke briefly about what happened while they ate.</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“It’s all in the past, so don’t think about it too much. I’m alive and well, plus Shin and I are good friends now, see?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’d call us that…”</p>
<p>“Come on, you could at least agree to that!”</p>
<p>Milt huffed and pouted. From how they acted, no one would have guessed that in the past she had died at his hands.</p>
<p>“So anyway, what I said before was half a joke, half the truth.”</p>
<p>“Which half was the truth then…?”</p>
<p>“That I wouldn’t mind giving my hand in marriage to Shin, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Stop that already, Schnee is…oh, right.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled that he hadn’t told Milt yet, so he explained that he and Schnee were now married.</p>
<p>“I see, so you chose to stay here.”</p>
<p>Milt probably realized that only Shin might have had a chance to go back.</p>
<p>She spoke with a calm tone, without a trace of the joking mood from before. But that sincerity only lasted an instant.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of things I’d like to say about that, but first of all, it’s perfect for me if you stay here. If Schnee is the first lady, then it means the seat of the second one is still free, right?”</p>
<p>Milt smirked, but Shin put a stop to her enthusiasm immediately.</p>
<p>“There’s no seat in the first place! We practice monogamy where I come from!”</p>
<p>“But all men dream to have their own harem, right? Filma, Sety, etc, etc…I thought you planned to make them all yours, one by one.”</p>
<p>“You’ve read too many manga and novels. I don’t look at them that way.”</p>
<p>Shin flicked the puzzled Milt’s forehead and wolfed down the rest of his meal. He could treat what Milt said as a joke, but he was concerned about how Tiera would take it.</p>
<p>“Hmm, a harem, huh…”</p>
<p>“Hey, didn’t you hear what I said? I’m not interested at all in that stuff.”</p>
<p>Tiera had a rather cold look in her eyes, so Shin made sure she didn’t get the wrong idea.</p>
<p>He definitely didn’t want her to think that she might have been one of his targets. Elves were also monogamous, so Shin spoke clearly to avoid any unwanted misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“Kuu, strong males have many females!”</p>
<p>“Not you too, Yuzuha…”</p>
<p>Yuzuha had been quietly munching on meat until now, but for some reason spoke such words with a very serious look on her face. In small fox mode her train of thought leaned on the animal side, so what she said was a bit different from a harem.</p>
<p>“Well, you better make sure the master doesn’t hear anything about this. She’s terrifying when she’s angry.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know that…no, I mean, I’m sure Schnee would understand anyway.”</p>
<p>Shin thought he never showed any signs of being interested in other women.</p>
<p>“Tch, how disappointing.”</p>
<p>“Give it a rest. Why did you even start talking about marriage?”</p>
<p>“You don’t treat me weird because of my strength and you would treasure me, right? Even in your reaper phase you took care of me, one way or another, you didn’t ditch me or anything. That’s when I thought that deep down you hadn’t changed. Besides, it’s nice to know that we’d be okay even if a whole country turned against us.”</p>
<p>“I want to deny that so bad, but I can’t…”</p>
<p>Milt was very good friends with Marino, Shin’s former lover, to the point that they also talked about their real lives. She was also involved with Shin in the game era, in both his “normal” and “abnormal” phases.</p>
<p>Milt knew what kind of existence Shin was in this world. It could be said that she understood him well, in a different way from Schnee.</p>
<p>“That’s never going to happen, though, so go look elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe…don’t forget about how long a High Pixie lifespan can be. I’ll take my time and work on you bit by bit. I have the hunch that it might work out if Schnee gives the OK.”</p>
<p>“Don’t even try, seriously.”</p>
<p>Milt was definitely joking again…right?</p>
<p>So thought Shin as he brought the conversation to an end.</p>
<p>They still had plenty of time, but there was no harm in going early.</p>
<p>There was also the chance of leaving earlier due to unforeseen trouble, so Shin decided to head for the meeting point after the meal.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 2</p>
<p>“Looks like they’re all ready to go.”</p>
<p>The church forces were performing a final check of their provisions: once it was done, they could depart at any time.</p>
<p>Shin’s party headed to their assigned position, ahead of the group.</p>
<p>There they found Reiner, leader of the church forces, talking to someone. Judging from his attire, Shin guessed he was a scout.</p>
<p>“Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“The information about the high-level monsters has been updated. The 2nd royal guard’s division has defeated the Stoluz, but the presence of previously undetected monsters has been confirmed.”</p>
<p>Reiner used a fairly polite tone of speech with Shin, probably because of his affiliation with Schnee and Shibaid.</p>
<p>Shin had told him there was no need to speak so formally: as Schnee had previously taught him, he might be mistaken for a noble if he spoke or was spoken to very politely, so Shin used a casual kind of speech as well.</p>
<p>“At present two units have been confirmed by name, Azathoth and Pharshax. It appears there are also wolf-type and a scorpion-like insect monster. The scouting team’s 【Analyze】 users could not glean their names.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me any characteristics of those monsters?”</p>
<p>Shin added that he might be able to identify them if he knew some more details.</p>
<p>The wolf-type monster’s body spanned over 10 mel and had a brimming yellow mane.</p>
<p>It had large, sharp fangs on both its upper and lower jaw, deep red fur, and two long tails. It was said that the ground burned in its wake.</p>
<p>The scorpion-type monster had clawson its front limbs and three other pairs of legs. On the tip of its tail, it had an alligator-like mouth in place of the typical hook-shaped appendage.</p>
<p>“Wolfreet and Dylebion, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Sounds pretty likely.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded in agreement with Milt’s guess. They were pretty well-known monsters with easily distinguishable traits.</p>
<p>“I think it’s safe to assume that the wolf monster is Wolfreet and the scorpion monster Dylebion. If the group who defeated Stoluz had even the slightest trouble against it, they should steer clear of them. Those two monsters both prey on Stoluz: Wolfreet is especially dangerous.”</p>
<p>So Milt explained to Reiner.</p>
<p>Dylebion’s level ranged between 700 and 750.</p>
<p>It had a sturdy carapace that resisted not only physical attacks but also magic to an extent. Its claws were capable of tearing through Legend-grade gear like paper.</p>
<p>Its most lethal weapon, however, was the mouth that grew where a scorpion usually had a poisonous tail. That was the monster’s primary mouth it used to feed: it looked like crocodile jaws protected by an outer shell.</p>
<p>It could rip even Mythology-grade gear to shreds, depending on their stats, and could even shoot corrosive acid. The only blessing was that it didn’t use magic.</p>
<p>Stoluz was a bird-type monster wrapped in lightning, which had great mobility and used fearsome thunder attacks, but its level was usually between 500 and 600, so there was a clear gap between them.</p>
<p>The difference in combat abilities was also great. Even if the 2nd division had won against Stoluz without any trouble, they wouldn’t be able to handle the other monsters so easily.</p>
<p>What Shin feared the most, however, was Wolfreet.</p>
<p>Its level ranged from 750 to 800, even higher than Dylebion. It was a wolf-type monster with very thick and powerful legs, but it was also very agile.</p>
<p>The most important characteristic, however, was that Wolfreet was classified as a divine beast.</p>
<p>“A divine beast…? You can’t be serious. It’s rare for even high-level monsters to spawn during a flood, and you say this is a divine beast? There aren’t any records of divine beasts ever spawning during a flood.”</p>
<p>Reiner shook his head in disbelief.</p>
<p>Shin understood his sentiments very well: floods tended to spawn low-level monsters in large quantities.</p>
<p>This was based on the data collected by the countries and cities that fought against the floods over the years, however, so there weren’t any rules set in stone.</p>
<p>Floods had happened in the same manner for hundreds of years after the Dusk of Majesty, so it wasn’t strange for them to think like that.</p>
<p>The crucial point was that the flood’s “rules” were apparently changing.</p>
<p>“We can’t be sure that those monsters were spawned by the flood. They might have come from somewhere else.”</p>
<p>“That is true too…”</p>
<p>No one had witnessed the instant of their spawning, so Shin stressed the fact that he merely proposed a possibility.</p>
<p>Even if the Wolfreet had spawned in the flood, it should be easier to fight against if its intellect was lower.</p>
<p>“…you have heard everything, right? Contact the 2nd division at once!!”</p>
<p>Reiner gave orders to the man standing next to him. His tone clearly stated the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>The man also had a stern expression on his face and left immediately.</p>
<p>Reiner ordered him to rush as soon as possible probably because he understood the 2nd division’s ability. They couldn’t deal with monsters on Dylebion’s level, apparently.</p>
<p>“We will head to the 9th fort as reinforcements. Sir Shin and Lady Tiera planned to engage directly with any high-level monsters that were spotted, but can you go right away? It appears that other than the two monsters we talked about, there also are Azathoth and Pharshax units.”</p>
<p>Reiner did not seem to doubt Shin’s information.</p>
<p>He probably accepted it as true because Milt supported it too.</p>
<p>Azathoth and Pharshax were both monsters around level 600. They were clearly less of a threat than Dylebion and Wolfreet.</p>
<p>“No problem, they’re all monsters I have defeated before.”</p>
<p>Shin would face them for the first time in this world, but, with proper countermeasures, there was nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Even without countermeasures, Shin could win easily thanks to his overwhelmingly superior stats. Any countermeasures were more for Tiera and Kagerou.</p>
<p>“If we’re going to face a divine beast, I guess I should stay away.”</p>
<p>“I need to prepare too.”</p>
<p>In some cases several monsters appeared together, so Tiera and Milt were thinking about how to act in such a case.</p>
<p>Shin hoped that they wouldn’t have to face multiple divine beasts at once, but if they had to face several Dylebions, Tiera might end up struggling.</p>
<p>“(Hey Milt, want me to upgrade your equipment?)”</p>
<p>“(Really? That’d be great for me, but they might found out about your true abilities.)”</p>
<p>“(There’s still plenty of time till we arrive, so I’ll think of something. If we say you borrowed something from Schnee I’m sure they won’t confiscate it.)”</p>
<p>There was nothing to worry about if they faced low-level monsters.</p>
<p>Milt was a very powerful warrior by this world’s standards, but she did not possess overwhelming power on par with Shin’s party. Her stats were very unbalanced, so she might end up in lethal danger if she had bad affinity with an opponent.</p>
<p>Milt was one of Shin’s few player acquaintances and also Marino’s friend. He didn’t want her to die just because her equipment was lacking.</p>
<p>“Troops, onward!”</p>
<p>Preparations were finally complete, so the church reinforcements — officially named Church Warband — started their advance towards the 9th fort. Most of them were foot soldiers, but there were also knights like Reiner, riding on mounting beasts.</p>
<p>Some of the knights appeared to be tense, probably because Reiner told them about the monsters they might encounter at their destination, or so Shin thought.</p>
<p>“It’s really convenient that they can change size.”</p>
<p>“I thought the same thing. If they were always in their original size, we’d cause a mess every time we entered a town”</p>
<p>Shin and the others were riding on Yuzuha and Kagerou, both very eager for some reason. Those who saw them for the first time were surprised, but not to the point of creating a commotion.</p>
<p>Milt was riding behind Shin: she never expected to see the day she could ride an Element Tail, so she was very excited too.</p>
<p>Since they had to match the foot soldiers’ pace, they expected to go fairly slowly, but, thanks to the magic users casting physical boost skills and arts over the whole group, they advanced at a decent speed, quicker than a normal person could run.</p>
<p>“I can’t detect any monsters. Being in a ‘flood’, I expected to pick up some more presences, but is it always like this?”</p>
<p>“Based on my experience, we should be encountering more monsters. In the summit, they did say they hadn’t taken them all down.”</p>
<p>Three days had passed since their departure.</p>
<p>Shin used the map and his skills to scan the surroundings in a wide range, but curiously could not pick up any monster presences, so he turned around to ask Milt about it and she replied pensively.</p>
<p>Even if most monsters had already been defeated, the numbers spawned during a flood were massive.</p>
<p>The area extending from the Sacred Place to Kilmont was very large too, but it was bizarre to not detect even one monster around them.</p>
<p>Even excluding the monsters spawned by the flood, there should be monsters and animals naturally inhabiting the area.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a coincidence is it.”</p>
<p>They couldn’t rule out not encountering any monster as simply “happening”.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could investigate to come up with an answer, however, and thus one week passed without encountering a single monster.</p>
<p>The group was half a day away from their destination, the 9th fort when finally Shin could pick up something.</p>
<p>“As they had said, they’re really not moving much.”</p>
<p>Shin had heard a report about the monsters one week before.</p>
<p>They were heading towards Kilmont, the direction Shin and the others came from, so based on their physical energy and mobility, they should have encountered them earlier.</p>
<p>“The monsters’ senses were deceived, in order to keep them from moving. Impressive.”</p>
<p>Milt spoke while looking at a Dylebion, which was raising its tail to intimidate the party.</p>
<p>The current forts and troops were not enough to protect the vast expanse of land.</p>
<p>It wasn’t possible to station troops or adventurers there permanently anyway. As an alternative countermeasure, the idea of luring monsters was implemented.</p>
<p>Items buried deep underground constantly projected illusions towards the monsters.</p>
<p>The monsters thus gathered and roamed near one place, sometimes even fighting each other.</p>
<p>The knights and soldiers would wait for the numbers to dwindle and the remaining monsters to be weakened, then intervene to eliminate the rest.</p>
<p>Monsters spawned during the flood had a lower intellect and less resistance to illusion spells, so this method was very effective against them.</p>
<p>“But I guess it wasn’t enough to hold them all.”</p>
<p>Shin and the others observed the monster, concealing their presence just in case. Shin looked via his skills, Milt and Tiera with binoculars.</p>
<p>As commander of the church forces, Reiner and Lourie, his aide, joined them in observing the Dylebion, while the rest of the reinforcements were standing by farther back.</p>
<p>They could only see the Dylebion: there was no sign of the Wolfreet anywhere.</p>
<p>Shin heard that the monsters gathered in one place sometimes fought each other, but this time only moderate results were achieved.</p>
<p>The reason why the results were “moderate” was that there were no monsters other than the Dylebion present: or more precisely, no living monsters.</p>
<p>The area where the Dylebion likely roamed was covered with all sorts of monster corpses: small ones less than 1 mel, large ones with height spanning several mel.</p>
<p>The biggest one was a monster with a long torso, chopped into several parts.</p>
<p>It was the Azathoth mentioned in the report. Its body was melted and sliced here and there, signs of battle or that other monsters had fed on it.</p>
<p>The item creating illusions was set not to stop until the last monster died of hunger, so without monsters acting as feed the Dylebion might have moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Dylebion below and Pharshax above, huh.”</p>
<p>Shin looked up and found a four-winged monster flying leisurely in the sky.</p>
<p>Jet black wings, a golden crown, and colorful tail feathers: it was the flying monster Pharshax.</p>
<p>It tended to swoop on its enemies and deliver fierce blows with its sharp claws, capable of dealing considerable damage even to monsters above its rank.</p>
<p>It did not seem to have attacked the Dylebion, however. It probably instinctively realized that their difference in level and bad affinity with the scorpion monster meant that Pharshax was likely to be killed if it attempted to attack.</p>
<p>“Let’s drop Pharshax first, then deal with Dylebion. The church forces should take a detour or wait for us to take them down.”</p>
<p>“If you can take them down without trouble we will wait, but will you really be okay?”</p>
<p>Reiner looked more apprehensive after seeing Dylebion with his own eyes.</p>
<p>As he was assigned the role of leading the counter-flood forces, Reiner had confidence in his battle prowess.</p>
<p>Because of that, he could tell how powerful the Dylebion and Pharshax were.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like they underwent any sort of mutation, so we’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>According to 【Analyze】, Dylebion was level 722 and Pharshax 602.</p>
<p>Those were pretty average levels for them, so it didn’t look like they were mutated variants or unique units.</p>
<p>Since they kept circling the same area over and over, their intellect couldn’t be too advanced either. Monsters with higher intellect weren’t affected by luring items after all.</p>
<p>“We will stand back so we don’t interfere with your battle, then. We’ll be in your hands.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded vigorously, also to dispel any concerns Reiner might have. The knight was probably relieved to see it and announced he and Lourie would join the reinforcements waiting a bit farther away.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel nervous, I wonder why.”</p>
<p>After Reiner and Lourie left, Tiera whispered her thoughts to Shin.</p>
<p>Their current plan was for Tiera and Milt to fight first: Shin would join only if there was any trouble. That was probably one additional reason why Reiner was worried.</p>
<p>The plan was proposed by Tiera and Milt themselves.</p>
<p>“If we stand out you’ll attract less attention, right? Besides, I have to become more used to fighting too.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the battle against Reforgerer had changed Tiera’s mindset. There was the issue of preventing Shin from attracting too much attention, but she also thought that she couldn’t just stay behind while he fought forever.</p>
<p>She was now wearing the Heat Haze gear set but would change to an upgraded Bow Princess set for the battle.</p>
<p>“Hehehe…we have the best opponent to test my new gear too!”</p>
<p>The reason why Milt was eager to fight was very simple: Shin had upgraded her equipment during the journey.</p>
<p>『Breogand』’s massive blade had been slightly reduced in size and a blade the size of a short sword had been placed on the hilt, upgrading it to the even more lethal 『Ordgand』.</p>
<p>Its appearance changed, but its sturdiness and sharpness also improved by a large margin.</p>
<p>Milt’s 『Oriental Battle Garb』, which had a traditional Japanese-like design on the upper body, changed too.</p>
<p>It was still sleeveless but had now a white base decorated with blue lotus flowers and petals and a form-fitting silhouette. It also included navy blue armbands extending from the hands to the elbows.</p>
<p>The lower half, formerly traditional Japanese clothing cut short like a skirt, changed to a knee-long design, colored black with golden petals. Leggins with the same color as the armbands also protected Milt’s legs from the knee below.</p>
<p>The name was 『Flowing Grace Garb』.</p>
<p>“Shin, out of curiosity, you didn’t pick this on purpose, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s my first time making one, but it’s the best armor in the 『Oriental Battle Garb』 line. You could make it look more modest, but I kept the same design as before because Milt requested it, okay?”</p>
<p>Tiera’s rather chilly stare caused Shin to turn his eyes from the Dylebion to Milt.</p>
<p>In the game era, the 『Flowing Grace Garb』 was also called “amped-up Chinese dress with lots of exposure”.</p>
<p>The design made it a bit awkward and embarrassing to look at, qualities enhanced by the fact that Milt was wearing it now.</p>
<p>The cloth covering the upper body had a large diamond-shaped hole over the chest, which exposed her deep cleavage.</p>
<p>The lower part too, upon closer inspection revealed that the front and rear flaps were attached from the outside, so they barely did anything to hide the legs from sight. Without the armbands, leggings, and flaps, it looked just like a sexy swimsuit.</p>
<p>“Pretty cool, isn’t it!!”</p>
<p>Tiera was blushing because of Milt’s exposed thighs, but the latter was smiling joyfully.</p>
<p>Excluding the legs and chest area, the『Flowing Grace Garb』had a distinctively Chinese style: a lighter design on the upper body, white with blue decorations, and heavier gold on black in the lower body, which blended well and contributed to its popularity.</p>
<p>Naturally, its stats were far superior to the 『Oriental Battle Garb』.</p>
<p>It gave great boosts to STR and AGI, so it fit well Milt’s fighting style of moving quickly to deliver powerful single blows.</p>
<p>Her new weapon and armor were both inferior Ancient-grade gear.</p>
<p>As far as Shin remembered, however, Milt’s stats were a bit lacking for her to be able to equip Ancient-grade gear, so he was worried about this point when he started upgrading her gear. If he upgraded it too much for her to use it, everything would be meaningless.</p>
<p>According to Milt, however, her stats increased as she fought monsters as part of her activities for the church.</p>
<p>Her status window proved it: her stats showed increases from at least 100 to over 200 points.</p>
<p>At this point, it was a necessity to either upgrade 『Breogand』 and the 『Oriental Battle Garb』, or even to switch them for different gear altogether.</p>
<p>And with perfect timing, Shin had appeared. Milt was extremely excited when they discussed how to upgrade her equipment,</p>
<p>“Isn’t that embarrassing to wear?”</p>
<p>“I’m used to people staring, so it’s okay. If I can get Shin to upgrade my gear, I want the best there is!”</p>
<p>It would be a waste to show restraint, added Milt while pushing up her chest.</p>
<p>“So? What do you think? I can give Schnee a run for her money, right?”</p>
<p>“Stop playing around.”</p>
<p>Milt grinned but was countered by Shin’s chop. That was the whole reason why she requested this design for the chest part.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we have monsters right in front of us and you still act like that. You’ll never change.”</p>
<p>“It’s my own way to keep from being nervous. I did it every time before fighting a boss.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled the game era from Milt’s words.</p>
<p>She always teased nervous players, that was true. Sometimes she was told that she never acted seriously enough, but Milt too felt nervous in her own way, even if she didn’t show it.</p>
<p>“Hehehe…see? You don’t feel as nervous as before, right Tiera?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that’s right, I do feel more relaxed. I guess I could try teasing Shin too next time.”</p>
<p>“Anything but that…”</p>
<p>Tiera laughed wryly and Shin frowned. If Tiera started acting like Milt, he didn’t know what Schnee was going to say…or do.</p>
<p>“Shall we get started?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Reiner joined the troops, so we can go. I think we’ll do fine, but if anything unexpected happens, give us a hand.”</p>
<p>Shin asked the question seriously and Milt answered in the same way while materializing 『Ordgand』. The playful mood was completely gone, and she turned towards the Dylebion with a sharp glare in her eyes.</p>
<p>Including their equipment, Milt and Tiera together were clearly stronger.</p>
<p>What worried both Shin and Milt was that the Wolfreet might join the fray.</p>
<p>Among the high-level monsters spotted by the scouts, Wolfreet was on a whole other level. Milt alone would have trouble defeating it, even with her upgraded gear and higher stats.</p>
<p>Yuzuha and Kagerou stayed behind with the church reinforcements, to protect them in case of any sudden attacks on their end.</p>
<p>“I’ll go first, then.”</p>
<p>Tiera stood up and materialized her equipment. Her attire changed to a glowing armor and bow.</p>
<p>All the equipment had been already upgraded by Shin: a silver circlet on her head, chest armor, and gauntlets both studded with green gems, to provide higher defense.</p>
<p>The armor provided higher defense despite exposing shoulders and stomach thanks to being originally created in a fantasy world, perhaps.</p>
<p>The armor extending to Tiera’s lower body, acting as a skirt, and the knee-high boots too were decorated in the same way. The skirt was rather short, thus Tiera’s thighs were exposed between the skirt and the boots, creating an effect similar to the fabled “absolute territory”.</p>
<p>Tiera’s 『Emerald Dazzle Bow』 was modified by adding Scarletite to Chimeradite, thus creating the 『Emerald Brilliance Bow』.</p>
<p>It was an exquisitely crafted item, with decorations reminiscent of wings and wind, even brighter and easier to use than before.</p>
<p>The shield on Tiera’s back, formed by four half-transparent rhombus-shaped plates glowing blue, had been upgraded as well.</p>
<p>The range of the magic barrier it produced had grown wider and it could also produce wind-based support attacks, so long as Tiera willed it.</p>
<p>In the game era, it attacked automatically, but in this world, it could be controlled.</p>
<p>It was still too tricky to fully control for Tiera, so for now she only used it as a shield, but once she mastered it she could attack multiple targets at once.</p>

<p>“Tiera, once you shoot I’ll go. The timing’s up to you.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Tiera nodded and pulled her bow’s string.</p>
<p>The arrow set on the bow was glowing green. Her posture was not excessively tense, a sign that she was focused.</p>
<p>Milt looked at Tiera and took a lower stance, ready to rush with her 『Ordgand』 at any moment. Shin prepared support spells, ready to cast them as soon as the need arose.</p>
<p>Tiera’s hand-stretched without a sound: the arrow had been shot. It flew towards its target at high speed, leaving a single streak of light in its wake.</p>
<p>The target, Pharshax, twisted its body the instant before the arrow struck.</p>
<p>There was no trace of any elegance in its flight anymore: the base of its right wing was pierced and fell, but the monster did not have two pairs of wings for show: it lost altitude but was not going to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>The sharp glare in its eyes was already directed at Tiera: it had twisted its body to stop its head from being struck.</p>
<p>Before Pharshax could even attempt its famed swooping attack, however, Tiera shot again.</p>
<p>Three streaks of light flew through the sky.</p>
<p>The first arrow had been shot with the bow upright, as commonly seen in archery, but for the second shot, Tiera held her bow horizontally and launched three arrows at once.</p>
<p>Pharshax danced in the air to avoid the three arrows.</p>
<p>Despite its large body, it was extremely mobile in the air.</p>
<p>For Pharshax, arrow attacks were nothing but dots no matter how fast they were. In the air it could dodge in all directions, so it would be not difficult to emerge unscathed.</p>
<p>The first arrow reached its target only because the monster was too slow to notice.</p>
<p>“I’ll show that I’ve grown too!!”</p>
<p>Tiera shouted and shot her third barrage. There was only one arrow, which might seem easier to dodge than the second arrow, but, when it was still a bit far from Pharshax, the arrow burst and scattered.</p>
<p>It looked like it simply exploded, but it actually burst into many smaller arrows.</p>
<p>Bow-type Martial skill 【Split Arrow】.</p>
<p>The skill allowed one to split one arrow in many smaller ones. Each smaller arrow had lower offensive power, but, since they spread in front of the target, they were much more difficult to dodge.</p>
<p>In the game era, it was often used to disrupt flying enemies.</p>
<p>Tiera used it in the same way: because of the sudden explosion of arrows, its flight was thrown out of control.</p>
<p>Pharshax tried to dodge as many arrows as possible, but then three arrows rained from above.</p>
<p>The monster screeched in surprise, then fell.</p>
<p>The three arrows precisely struck its three remaining wings out of commission. They weren’t ripped off, but could not be used for flight any longer.</p>
<p>The three arrows were the ones Tiera shot in her second attack: after Pharshax dodged them, they changed direction and continued pursuing their target.</p>
<p>Tiera had used the Bow-type martial skill 【Hound Arrow】 for this second barrage.</p>
<p>Arrows shot with this skill homed in on their target for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The 『Emerald Brilliance Bow』 also granted great bonuses to range and accuracy.</p>
<p>The 『Bow Princess』 gear sets were generally used for long-distance shooting, so its weapons were reinforced accordingly.</p>
<p>Thanks to the bow’s boosts, 【Hound Arrow】 had double the power and homing effect time.</p>
<p>“Here I go!!”</p>
<p>Milt started running towards the falling Pharshax. Her 『Ordgand』 glowed blue, tracing a streak of the same color on her path.</p>
<p>Pharshax was only able to lower the speed of its fall: it couldn’t attack the approaching Milt in any way.</p>
<p>The monster would suffer heavy damage simply from falling, but Milt went to finish it off.</p>
<p>The reason was that Pharshax could use a wider range of attacks on the ground.</p>
<p>It kept itself afloat with the help of magic, so it only used its powerful swooping attack and low-level wind magic in the air: the way it acted had not changed from the game era.</p>
<p>Once on the ground, it didn’t need to use magic to support itself, so it unleashed wide-range magic without restraint.</p>
<p>“Sorry!”</p>
<p>Milt took advantage of her momentum and jumped.</p>
<p>She leaped as if she soared in the sky, boosted by her rush. Her lethal, glowing halberd in her hands. The moment she swung 『Ordgand』, the Pharshax’ neck was cut off its body.</p>
<p>Axe/Flame combination skill 【Sparnisch】.</p>
<p>The blue glow was caused by flames burning at a high temperature. It was so high that the Phrashax’ severed neck and torso caught on fire.</p>
<p>Before Milt could even land, the Pharshax’ whole body burned to ashes, which were carried away by the wind.</p>
<p>“Ahaha…even stronger than expected.”</p>
<p>A massive body over six mel, wingspan included, burning to ashes in mere seconds. The firepower and the sensation Milt felt when she struck down the monster’s neck made her tremble in excitement.</p>
<p>Shin had explained what changed in her weapon and she had practiced with it too.</p>
<p>Even then, its power exceeded her expectations.</p>
<p>“Let’s deal with the next one!”</p>
<p>“Right on!”</p>
<p>After Tiera’s signal, Milt turned towards the Dylebion.</p>
<p>The monster probably did not notice that the Pharshax had been defeated: it was pretty much in the same position as before.</p>
<p>Milt ran towards the monster, 『Ordgand』 ready to strike again. Tiera’s 【Split Arrow】 flew over her head.</p>
<p>Just as the arrows were about to strike the monster’s head, something white struck against them. When the white object disappeared, nothing was left.</p>
<p>Even before 【Split Arrow】 could perform its characteristic burst, the arrow shot with it was much more powerful than any regular one.</p>
<p>The whole arrow disappeared because of the acid sprayed from Dylebion’s tail mouth.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard rumors about it, but it’s even more powerful than magic!!”</p>
<p>Based on the fact that the acid had melted an arrow flying at high speed, it had to have very high power and precision.</p>
<p>“Milt, you don’t have a shield with you, will you be okay?”</p>
<p>So Tiera asked Milt, while continuing to shoot arrows to prevent the latter from being targeted.</p>
<p>The arrows Tiera shot were Legend grade, but the monster could spray acid strong enough to dissolve them instantly, as fast as a flash of light. It was natural for her to worry.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. My 『Flowing Grace Garb』 won’t melt immediately even if Dylebion’s acid hits: as long as the equipment wasn’t fatally damaged, even the wearer’s exposed areas would be protected.”</p>
<p>It was one of the characteristics of gear at the Mythology grade and above.</p>
<p>Defensive power and scope varied wildly from armor to armor. Some players chose not to add this ability, so not all gear was equipped with it.</p>
<p>Regardless, most gear at that level had this characteristic.</p>
<p>Incidentally, all of the equipment crafted by Shin had it by default. Filma’s 『Armor of Hollow Lacquer』 was like this too. It exposed more than half of her body, so it wouldn’t make sense if only the covered parts had high defense.</p>
<p>“If things get really bad I’ll join in, anyway.”</p>
<p>Milt and Tiera would take down Pharshax and Dylebion.</p>
<p>This was the plan they proposed, but Shin’s participation would make their victory safer and more secure.</p>
<p>The reason why he didn’t was that Milt asked him to stay alert for Wolfreet’s potential appearance.</p>
<p>Wolfreet was a divine beast, a creature different from normal monsters in a variety of ways. If it attacked the Church Warband, it could annihilate them in seconds.</p>
<p>Yuzuha and Kagerou were with them, so it wasn’t likely to happen, but Shin was standing back to intervene in case of necessity.</p>
<p>“I prefer if you believed in—aah!”</p>
<p>Before Tiera could finish her sentence, the shields on her back moved. The next instant, the sound of a spray of acid splashing against them was heard.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t have the shield…it gives me the chills just thinking about it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it moves automatically, but don’t rely on it too much.”</p>
<p>Tiera spoke while shooting more arrows, to hide the fact that she couldn’t react in time.</p>
<p>She had been targeted the instant she looked at Shin. The monster’s acid had been targeting only Milt until then, so Tiera reacted late.</p>
<p>Looking at the tail mouth would let one know where it was going to shoot, but the acid was sprayed so fast that many players melted down before they could react.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting me with the same move twice!”</p>
<p>Tiera dodged the acid that came flying at her after she shot her arrows. She carefully observed the tail mouth this time, so she avoided it easily.</p>
<p>“Don’t go forgetting about me now.”</p>
<p>Milt managed to bypass the acid barrage and ran up close to the Dylebion.</p>
<p>The monster used its large scissor claws to counterattack: because of its large body, the claws by themselves were wider than Milt was tall. They could crush several men in one blow with just their flat side.</p>
<p>Milt swung her 『Ordgand』 towards the monster’s right scissor claw.</p>
<p>Judging from their size difference, it might have seemed like a reckless move, but Milt didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>Instead of her old partner,, 『Breogand』, she was wielding version reborn at Shin’s hands, 『Ordgand』.</p>
<p>“I can’t afford to mess up in front of him!”</p>
<p>Milt poured all of her strength in the swing.</p>
<p>Her boosted stats and the gear bonuses blended together in the strike delivered to the monster’s claws.</p>
<p>Dylebion’s jagged blades, painful just to look at, versus 『Ordgand』’s lethal yet artistically beautiful smooth blade.</p>
<p>Ultimately victory went to the latter.</p>
<p>『Ordgand』 cracked the monster’s claws and tore through.</p>
<p>It couldn’t cut them in two, but if Milt put more strength in her grip, she could continue cutting through the claws.</p>
<p>Before its right claw could be severed, Dylebion tried to slash Milt with its left one.</p>
<p>“I got you figured out!”</p>
<p>The ground under Milt’s feet cracked. Using 『Ordgand』, still locked against the monster’s claws, as a base, she spun in the air.</p>
<p>Milt had jumped up while holding 『Ordgand』’s handle and did not let it go.</p>
<p>Her halberd’s blade had already ripped into about 70% of the monster’s right claw: with one more push, she should be able to cut it off completely.</p>
<p>Milt avoided Dylebion’s attacks from the right and left, but the monster’s offensive wasn’t over yet. Its tail mouth had shot acid in her direction.</p>
<p>“Oops!”</p>
<p>Milt used 【Flying Shadow】, a skill that allowed the user to jump in midair, and escaped the range of the acid.</p>
<p>For close combat players, a skill like 【Flying Shadow】, that allowed one to move freely in midair, was nothing short of a necessity. Milt had also mastered its usage.</p>
<p>She landed with nonchalance right behind Dylebion, where the monster’s claws couldn’t easily reach. It wasn’t an actual blindspot, but it would be easy to dodge any attacks.</p>
<p>“Eh, seriously!?”</p>
<p>Milt wanted to cut off the monster’s tail at the base with 『Ordgand』, but jumped away instead. A shot of acid rained on the monster’s carapace, despite there not being anyone there.</p>
<p>Milt was shaken because the game era Dylebion never hit itself with acid. The monster produced the acid within its own body, but its outer body wouldn’t be unaffected by it.</p>
<p>The acid could dissolve Dylebion’s carapace or its body: the only exceptions were its tail mouth and the organ that created the acid.</p>
<p>“I see, so this happens when its intellect goes down…”</p>
<p>After spraying the acid on its own back, Dylebion was writhing in pain as it tried to face Milt.</p>
<p>Because of the acid’s corrosive power and firing speed, the monster’s torso was riddled with holes, and other places started melting too. Insect monsters were infamous for being tough to kill, but at this point, it would have a hard time continuing to fight.</p>
<p>Milt activated 『Sparnisch』again , the skill she used to cleave Pharshax in two, and put Dylebion out of its misery.</p>
<p>The monster’s torso was already dissolving, so she managed to split it in two almost completely. It shouldn’t be able to move anymore.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 3</p>
<p>“Hmm, that was a pretty disappointing way to end it…”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s done is done.”</p>
<p>Shin consoled Milt, saying that stuff like that happened sometimes. He was glad he didn’t have to use the magic spells he had prepared just in case.</p>
<p>Even if the monster didn’t damage itself with the acid, Milt’s stats and equipment pretty much ensured her victory. She wanted to face the monster head-on and win, however, so a victory like that left her dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“To think that Milt and Lady Tiera could defeat such monsters on their own…”</p>
<p>Shin and the others signaled to Reiner and the church troops that the battle was over and regrouped.</p>
<p>They hadn’t actually witnessed the fighting, so Milt told him how it went down — first with excitement, then with some annoyance.</p>
<p>Shin collected the corpses of the monsters probably killed by Dylebion before Reiner and the troops arrived.</p>
<p>He also had to offer part of Dylebion’s body for Yuzuha and Kagerou to eat: they didn’t have any chance to fight, so their mood was more sour than Milt’s.</p>
<p>“It was a bit disappointing to win like that, but having good equipment really makes things different. I don’t have to worry about my weapon anymore either.”</p>
<p>“Just ‘good equipment’? Aren’t those historical artifacts?”</p>
<p>From Reiner’s standpoint, or any other denizen of this world, Mythology and Legend grade gear was the stuff of legends and fairy tales.</p>
<p>It was natural for him to look at 『Ordgand』 with a grave expression on his face after Milt told him about it in detail.</p>
<p>His gaze sometimes wandered over to Milt’s exposed chest and thighs, but it was pretty normal for a man. Shin was sure Milt had noticed his gaze too but said nothing.</p>
<p>“It is indeed valuable as a weapon, but it doesn’t have any historical value.”</p>
<p>He replied to Reiner’s comment instead. They said that 『Ordgand』 was just a borrowed item, but, since it was created from 『Breogand』, it couldn’t be turned back anymore.</p>
<p>User restrictions had been applied to it, so it was solely for Milt’s hands.</p>
<p>Shin had crafted it just a couple of days before, so there was nothing historical about it.</p>
<p>“I would aspire to be able to wield such a weapon one day…as of now, I doubt I could even lift it.”</p>
<p>“Because it looks like it chooses its own wielder.”</p>
<p>If the player’s stats were too low compared to the weapon, the resulting penalty made it impossible to wield.</p>
<p>In some cases, depending on the gear and the player’s stats, the penalties could even come in handy.</p>
<p>In the game era, obviously, stats only decreased and the gear itself weakened too in most cases. In this world, however, just equipping such items became difficult.</p>
<p>Shin had rarely ever experienced such circumstances.</p>
<p>Seeing that Reiner couldn’t even move the halberd’s handle an inch, Shin realized that it could be one of the reasons why advanced equipment was so scarce.</p>
<p>“Is gear above Rare grade that hard to find?”</p>
<p>“In my experience, Rare grade gear is relatively common. It’s not strange for high-rank adventurers to have Unique grade stuff too. But there are very few people with Legend grade gear in their hands. They’re considered national treasures, so it would take a fortune to buy one. A lot of adventurers and country officials told me that they’d buy my 『Breogand』 and 『Oriental Battle Garb』 at any price. No one would ever let go of such items unless they have serious money problems or plan to retire or something.”</p>
<p>For the people of this world, possessing Legend grade gear meant a boost in ability, even if the penalty was factored in.</p>
<p>Shin thought that some very wealthy people could use their finances to gather them, but, apparently, things weren’t so simple. Even in a large country, having elite forces all armed with Legend-grade gear was a nearly impossible feat, or so Milt said.</p>
<p>“I heard there are craftsmen capable of making new Legend-grade gear in the east, but a person like that would be sought after by countries all over the world. The blacksmith that fixes our gear said that it’s not possible to make items like that on purpose. There are several countries that probably have craftsmen who can replicate items of that level if they can see them, though.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Shin thought that it was better not to mention Kanezuka Araki, the blacksmith he met in Hinomoto.</p>
<p>“(I think there’s someone like that in Kilmont too. I don’t know if they’re a former player, but apparently, the generals are equipped in Legend grade gear and above from head to toe, and their elite troops are apparently supplied with a lot of Legend grade gear. Shibaid might know about them, though.)”</p>
<p>“(Even if he does, don’t ask, okay? If they say there isn’t anyone like that, I guess it’s true, but it would be pretty difficult to develop your skills that far…)”</p>
<p>Since they couldn’t let anyone else hear them talk about the topic, Shin replied to Milt’s question via Mind Chat while he looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Anyone could train blacksmithing skills to a certain degree. Precious metals were necessary to do it, but, if you were in an area rich with them, it wouldn’t be too difficult.</p>
<p>Raising skills over a certain level — more precisely, over level VII — would be a nearly impossible task.</p>
<p>When Shin took out an Orichalcum ingot in Falnido, he was told that it would fetch a very high price.</p>
<p>The same probably applied also to rare metals like Adamantite or Mithril.</p>
<p>In order to raise blacksmithing skills over level VII, it was necessary to use such precious metals and materials in great quantity.</p>
<p>In the game, they were monster drops, an essentially endless resource, but to do the same thing in this world was practically impossible.</p>
<p>At the same time, the only ones capable of crafting Ancient grade weapons were either former players, who had the ability to do so from the beginning, or Chosen Ones, who were born with the ability.</p>
<p>“(But there are also those you call geniuses in this world. There might be someone who can train by themselves and become able to forge maybe not Ancient, but at least Mythology grade gear.)”</p>
<p>Hinomoto’s Kanezuka Araki had in fact succeeded in crafting Legend grade gear, even though with his abilities it wouldn’t have been possible in the game era. They couldn’t rule out the possibility.</p>
<p>“(Weapons are scarce everywhere, after all. There are people who can’t fight at full power because of that, so hopefully the number of blacksmiths will increase.)”</p>
<p>According to Milt, most players and Chosen Ones tended to be combat-oriented.</p>
<p>Production specialists were few and far in between: they were all closely guarded by their countries, blacksmiths included.</p>
<p>In battle not only were weapons and armor necessary, but also healing items or temporary stat boosting items. Shin also struggled with procuring sufficient equipment at the start of his career as a player.</p>
<p>“We aren’t going?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>Tiera couldn’t hear Shin and Milt’s conversation, but she figured it out from their looks. She prompted them to go and they resumed their advance towards the 9th fort.</p>
<p>There they would gain new information about high-level monsters or other threats.</p>
<p>If the situation was really critical, they would be informed directly, so things were probably still not so grave at the moment.</p>
<p>So thought Shin and the others, but once the knights who had galloped ahead to the fort returned, they realized their assumption was incorrect.</p>
<p>“Is that really true?”</p>
<p>Reiner couldn’t believe the report he had just received from the knight.</p>
<p>“No mistake about it. The 9th fort has already fallen, or more precisely, it has been completely erased.”</p>
<p>The knights who actually witnessed the scene had a sickly look on their faces.</p>
<p>Since they were sent as anti-flood reinforcements, even the soldiers in charge of communication had fairly high levels and were battle veterans. Not even such experienced soldiers could hide their agitation.</p>
<p>After proceeding for a while more, the church troops prepared to set up camp.</p>
<p>They originally planned to reach the fort before the evening, but it wasn’t rare for schedules to change during the flood. The soldiers were not told the news about the fort, but they started setting up camp without objections.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shin went ahead to the 9th fort to see what happened to it.</p>
<p>Judging from the contents of the report, there was the possibility that Wolfreet was involved, so Shin went there with Yuzuha: the strongest duo in the current party.</p>
<p>“This is something…”</p>
<p>At their destination, they did not find anything remotely resembling a fort.</p>
<p>If it had fallen to a monster attack, normally one would find crumbling walls and buildings, as well as the corpses of monsters or people.</p>
<p>Things were very different here, however.</p>
<p>There were objects protruding from the ground here and there, probably the remains of the walls. But nothing else.</p>
<p>All the buildings, the remains of living beings, and any traces of fighting were probably buried in the hardened lava covering the surroundings. It was still burning hot and steaming in some spots.</p>
<p>“Do you think this is Wolfreet’s doing?”</p>
<p>“The ground is melting. There aren’t many monsters with this kind of ability.”</p>
<p>Wolfreet’s territory was like hell on earth, an area of scorching hot flames that burned anything and everything.</p>
<p>Whatever constituted Wolfreet allowed it to burn forests or vaporize lakes just by walking through them. In the game era, its original habitat was rivers of lava in volcanic areas.</p>
<p>The current state of the 9th fort resembled what happened in the game when one failed to repel Wolfreet’s attack on a base or home town.</p>
<p>“Kuu! I feel a presence still alive!”</p>
<p>After Yuzuha pointed it out Shin detected it too. In the forest close to the fort, there were several presences huddled together.</p>
<p>If there were survivors, Shin might learn exactly what happened, so he and Yuzuha started running towards their location.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 4</p>
<p>The presences detected by Shin and Yuzuha belonged to soldiers stationed in the fort.</p>
<p>Shin stated he was a scout for the reinforcements sent to the 9th fort and the soldiers, relieved, lowered their weapons. They were rather tense when they first noticed someone was coming.</p>
<p>“So you weren’t attacked by Wolfreet…I mean, a wolf monster surrounded in red flames?”</p>
<p>One of the soldiers was a company commander, someone in charge of several platoons, so Shin immediately asked him what happened.</p>
<p>He also showed the soldiers proof that he was one of the adventurers hired for the anti-flood efforts, just in case.</p>
<p>The certificate serving as proof given to special cases such as Shin and Shibaid was signed by the Dragon Emperor.</p>
<p>In Kilmont there would be no higher proof, so the company commander answered Shin’s questions without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“That’s right. At first, we were attacked by a few giant centipedes and many bee-like monsters. The bee ones flew right over the fort walls and attacked. While we were dealing with those, the centipede monsters broke through the walls. We could have taken care of the bees somehow, but the centipedes were too much for us. Our weapons just bounced off of them and it didn’t look like our magic affected them either.”</p>
<p>The company commander added that they had requested reinforcements, but likely could not hold until they arrived.</p>
<p>The monsters’ offensive continued relentlessly: as soon as the fort’s commander realized they were doomed he ordered all troops to withdraw, while he stayed inside the fort.</p>
<p>Shin had heard from Milt that the forts were equipped with a special barrier used in case monsters overwhelmed them.</p>
<p>It was a very useful barrier that would prevent all monsters inside from going out, while also barring people outside from going in: it was to be used in case of emergency, after allowing as many soldiers as possible to escape.</p>
<p>The switch for the barrier was inside the fort, however, so those who pressed it had little chance to flee. The fort’s commander had decided to let the troops flee in exchange for his own life.</p>
<p>The problem was what happened afterward.</p>
<p>“The barrier can’t endure monster attacks forever. Even if it was possible to trap a good number of them inside, some of them had enough intelligence to figure out that there was a strange wall, so they would often give up on the fort and chase the fleeing soldiers instead. It happened this time too: three of the centipedes chased the soldiers running from the fort. The bees were too numerous to count.”</p>
<p>The bees could be defeated with two or three Flame magic Arts, but their numbers were great: the centipedes, on the other hand, were at levels too high for the soldiers to damage.</p>
<p>The ballistae in the fort could damage them to an extent, but the soldiers escaping the fort had no way of using them.</p>
<p>“We were resigned to die, but just then a monster wrapped in blue flames appeared. It looked like a wolf, but the flames weren’t red like you said.”</p>
<p>It suddenly appeared in the center of the fort. The company commander was desperately fighting the centipedes, so he had no idea how it appeared there out of the blue.</p>
<p>The wolf roared, summoning a heatwave that burned all bees to a crisp and set the centipedes on fire as well.</p>
<p>Naturally, there were casualties among the soldiers as well. The ones who had fled far enough from the fort used their shields or the monsters to protect themselves from the heat.</p>
<p>The soldiers who were still inside or too close to the fort, however, turned to ashes in mere seconds or burned to a crisp.</p>
<p>“The fort, the ground, everything was melting down because of the heat, but that thing just walked out as if it was nothing. At that point, it was like a natural disaster. Well, we could survive thanks to it.”</p>
<p>The heatwave caused casualties among the soldiers too, but, considering that it eliminated all monsters and some soldiers survived it, they were saved by the wolf monster’s sudden appearance. The company commander was aware of what would have happened if they just continued fighting the bees and centipedes like that, as he admitted with a sour look on his face.</p>
<p>The wolf monster walked around the fort for a while, then vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, as if melting into thin air.</p>
<p>The company commander ordered most of the surviving soldiers to head to the 8th fort, the closest one, and remained to inform the approaching reinforcements about what happened.</p>
<p>They were going to wait for a while more, but if no one came they planned to head to the 8th fort too.</p>
<p>“I will report to the church forces myself. On behalf of them, thank you for the information.”</p>
<p>Shin and Yuzuha parted from the soldiers and headed towards the fort to look for any clues about the wolf monster. He already sent the information gained by the company commander to Reiner via Milt.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see why they thought the fort had disappeared.”</p>
<p>If someone who didn’t know of the fort’s presence saw the current scenery, they wouldn’t have imagined anything had been built there before.</p>
<p>Shin went closer and examined the hardened molten rock. There he realized that there were traces of lingering magic power on the cold, hardened lava.</p>
<p>“A monster similar to the wolf wrapped in blue flames, capable of producing heat strong enough to melt the walls of a fort reinforced by skills…could it be a 『Blessed』 one?”</p>
<p>Monsters sometimes left traces of their magic power behind when they attacked.</p>
<p>Shin had not actually seen the monster yet, so he couldn’t be sure, but he had an idea of what it could be.</p>
<p>Certain monsters, called 『Blessed』, spawned with special god-given powers.</p>
<p>The actual conditions were a mystery, but players speculated that it was either because the monsters in question had a good affinity with certain gods or they exceeded a certain level.</p>
<p>Wolfreet matched both of these conditions: Shin had actually seen 『Blessed』 Wolfreets in the game era too.</p>
<p>Shin had yet to meet gods in this world, but judging from his experiences until now, he was sure that they existed.</p>
<p>While incomplete, a true monster like Reforgerer existed, after all. There was no reason to doubt the existence of divine beings.</p>
<p>“But, the scout man said the flames were red.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…the people here said they were blue, and I can’t imagine a professional scout making a mistake like that.”</p>
<p>It was impossible to mistake the difference in the color of the flames between a『Blessed』Wolfreet and a regular one.</p>
<p>The Wolfreet that appeared in the fort might not have been the one that was first spotted. Or maybe it became 『Blessed』 after it was spotted the first time.</p>
<p>There was also the possibility that it was a completely different monster, so it was difficult to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>“I guess we should contact the others.”</p>
<p>Shin related the information he obtained to Schnee via Mind Chat. He hadn’t seen the Wolfreet yet, so he mentioned it simply as a possibility.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe it…the 9th fort…”</p>
<p>Shin rejoined the church forces and told Reiner and the others about what he saw at the 9th fort. Reiner had a tense expression on his face as he listened.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, do you think the other forts might have been attacked as well?”</p>
<p>“I have not heard any such reports from the other members yet. If they really were attacked, I believe we would be informed by the army.”</p>
<p>“We did not hear anything about the 9th fort either, though. It might be impossible to send emergency communications at the moment. The soldiers will surely send a report when they arrive at the 8th fort, but we should send communication too. Based on what you told me, even if the flood monsters hadn’t attacked, the monster that appeared last would have taken down the fort by itself, surely.”</p>
<p>As Reiner said, Wolfreet — 『Blessed』 or not — just needed to walk around the fort to destroy it. That’s how powerful it was.</p>
<p>The fort’s defenses had been bolstered by skills, but judging from how everything was melted, they definitely weren’t enough to stop the destruction.</p>
<p>“I wonder why it attacked the fort…or if it really attacked it in the first place.”</p>
<p>“What do you…oh, I see.”</p>
<p>Shin didn’t understand what Milt meant at first but grasped the meaning after thinking a little.</p>
<p>“Ehm, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“According to the soldiers’ report, the fort was first attacked by a large horde of monsters. Large enough to make them decide to abandon the fort. The Wolfreet appeared when the soldiers were fleeing: it unleashed an attack strong enough to eliminate all monsters at once, but it didn’t attack the soldiers directly. The Wolfreet’s goal could have been not to take down the fort, but the monsters instead.”</p>
<p>Shin hypothesized that the monster clad in blue flames was Wolfreet for his theory.</p>
<p>He continued explaining to the puzzled Tiera by saying that Wolfreet could have decided to come out because the monsters had conveniently gathered in one place.</p>
<p>“I see, that would also explain why it didn’t attack the soldiers that survived.”</p>
<p>Reiner nodded to Shin’s theory.</p>
<p>A rather numerous group of soldiers had managed to escape into the forest near the fort. If Wolfreet’s goal was to destroy the fort, it would have gone after them as well.</p>
<p>There were no Chosen Ones among the soldiers: Wolfreet would have simply needed to run past them to turn them into cinders. Considering their stats, it would have taken mere minutes.</p>
<p>It might have also spared them for whatever reason, but, at the moment, they could only try to guess Wolfreet’s goal. Even if they had some convincing leads, all they could do was make hypotheses.</p>
<p>“What in the world is going on with this flood, anyway? The scale is far too large.”</p>
<p>Reiner said that while floods often happened in Kilmont, this time the number of monsters was far higher than usual.</p>
<p>Shin had experienced the so-called “Great Flood” in Balmel, but this flood had apparently exceeded the scope of a regular Great Flood.</p>
<p>The Church Warband arrived at the 8th fort in an atmosphere of disquiet. Reiner and the other immediately went to meet the commander in charge of the fort.</p>
<p>“There’s the flag of the royal guards, the 2nd division must be stationed here too.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“That’s the flag, the one with two dragons drawn from the side. The number of dragons stands for the number of the division.”</p>
<p>Reiner pointed to a flag showing two dragon heads baring their fangs. As fitting for the flag of one of the divisions representing the country, the dragons were depicted in intricate detail.</p>
<p>Information about the 9th fort had already circulated: Shin and the others were immediately led to a meeting room where the people in charge of each group had gathered.</p>
<p>“First, let me thank you all for coming all the way here. I am Raig Fa Kilmont, the commander in charge of this 8th fort.”</p>
<p>Reiner greeted Raig first, then Shin and the others introduced himself. Raig, a Dragnil with red and black scales, stepped forward and shook hands with them one by one.</p>
<p>He had a dragon-like face, similar to Zaikuin or Shibaid, but the white beard growing from his chin suggested that he was much older than them. Raig apparently guessed such a thought crossed their mind and started talking.</p>
<p>“Some of you might not be aware, but I am Zaikuin’s father. I don’t have a shred of royal authority though, so don’t start trying to butter me up, all right?”</p>
<p>“Sir Raig, please. Your jokes are going to confuse Sir Shin and his companions.”</p>
<p>A Dragnil officer, closer to Humans in appearance, rebuked Raig with a slightly tired expression on his face. He was probably in charge of keeping the old general in check.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! I always enjoy surprising people with this. I’m old enough to get away with this much, right?”</p>
<p>Raig’s air of a serious commander quickly changed to a pleasant old man.</p>
<p>Shin wondered how a member of the royal family could be so close to the frontlines, but, looking at Raig, he thought that he surely wasn’t the type to quietly stay away from the fighting.</p>
<p>“Well then, now that the stiff mood in the room has eased a bit, let’s start the meeting by explaining the current situation to Sir Shin and his companions.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere changed again.</p>
<p>Raig’s tone too changed, assuming the firm speech style of a hardened warrior.</p>
<p>The air in the room felt very tense when Shin and the others entered, but now, while it was tense, there was no restlessness to be felt.</p>
<p>This could not be said for all present, however: most had stiff expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“Let me confirm one thing first: Sir Shin, how much do you know about the current situation of the flood?”</p>
<p>“Yes, even after we departed from the capital we constantly receive information about the situation at the frontlines and the monsters’ attacks, thanks to the people accompanying us. Looking at you all, however, I have the feeling this is not what you plan to talk about.”</p>
<p>Shin expected Raig to talk to Reiner, so he was a bit surprised, but he knew that he couldn’t tell him he asked the wrong person, so he replied.</p>
<p>“We have just received an emergency report, about the 9th fort. The capital seems to be in a rather confused state too. Which is no surprise, after the appearance of a monster capable of melting an entire fort. Another piece of information, however, is more troubling for us.”</p>
<p>“Another one, sir?”</p>
<p>Raig said that the incident at the 9th fort was definitely not to be treated lightly, then continued.</p>
<p>“Monsters have spawned again. This time, it is an army larger than ever before.”</p>
<p>All floods had a fixed number of monster spawns.</p>
<p>The flood in Kilmont was caused by magic power leaking from the Sacred Place, but, since they were beyond the sea, the numbers were smaller than floods created on land, like in Balmel.</p>
<p>Things were different this time, however. Not only the monster spawns were much more frequent, the number of monsters created in each spawn was also incredibly high.</p>
<p>“I won’t go as far as to say they covered the whole land, but the numbers of the monsters exceed any recorded flood. According to the scouts, they were ten times the usual. And apparently, it hasn’t stopped yet.”</p>
<p>Raig added that even the scouts, who should be used to observing large groups of monsters, couldn’t help but be shocked and distressed by the situation.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t stopped yet? Do you mean that the monsters are increasing as we speak?”</p>
<p>“I gave orders to send a report when they stopped increasing…and no word has come yet. They could appear at any time. The only good news, if you can call it that, is that the monsters’ numbers are so high that they can’t even walk without getting in each other’s way, so they still haven’t advanced this way.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they fighting among themselves, though? We have found high-level monsters on our way here, which were surrounded by monster corpses, apparently defeated by them.”</p>
<p>Shin recalled the monster corpses strewn all around Dylebion.</p>
<p>“It seems there are some instances of that, yes. It’d sure be a great help if they continued till the last monster standing, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“That would also mean creating a high-level monster with a great amount of experience.”</p>
<p>In the game, the level and stats of monsters were decided when they spawned on the map: unless they used skills or items to buff themselves, they couldn’t change.</p>
<p>The only exception was monsters in certain quests, *programmed* to grow stronger unless certain conditions were met.</p>
<p>In this world, however, it wasn’t rare for monsters to fight each other.</p>
<p>Monsters were also known to gain experience from fighting their kin, leveling up and growing stronger as a result. Some of them even evolved into the advanced version of their species.</p>
<p>“We had the same concern when we heard the monsters were fighting each other. But, as of now, their numbers are too high for us to do anything. If we ended up triggering an assault, we would be completely trampled. They’re discussing what to do in the capital too, but they haven’t come up with a good plan yet.”</p>
<p>The monsters’ spawn point was at the edge of the continent: there was no way to estimate how many there were at this point.</p>
<p>Even if the Kilmont and allied forces had superior firepower, it would take time just to move their forces.</p>
<p>(Should we get rid of them all with a large scale magic spell? If Schnee and Sety work together…no, even if they do, it’s too wide…)</p>
<p>A large scale spell specialized in destructive power, like the 【Blue Judgement】 spell used in Balmel, would be able to take down even a superior monster.</p>
<p>To cover a whole swath of the continent with a single person’s spell, however, was not realistic.</p>
<p>Not even Schnee and Shibaid could defeat all the monsters in their path: they were focusing on high-level monsters and locations with a high concentration of monsters, leaving the rest to the army.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to come up with a plan too, but haven’t had any luck yet. Sir Shin, Sir Reiner, your duties and requests bring you to all sorts of places, right? We thought you might have different viewpoints from us, who have always been fighting here. Could you lend us your help?”</p>
<p>Raig and the other officers bowed their heads. The current situation was clearly seen as critical.</p>
<p>The advanced high-level monster expected to appear could be the type that instinctively commanded other inferior monsters.</p>
<p>The soldiers could fight against large groups of monsters because they simply moved together in groups: they easily fell prey to the various illusion items scattered across the land and when they fought it was always by themselves, there was no cooperation among monsters.</p>
<p>If an advanced monster took control of them, however, things would change drastically. They might not be able to rely on illusions anymore. Shin could understand well where Raig and the others’ restlessness came from.</p>
<p>“The best way would be just charging in the middle and going all out…”</p>
<p>Shin had used this strategy both in the game and in this world, but this time the scope of the enemy forces was just too large.</p>
<p>His current energies and stats would allow him to hunt them all down: if he called Schnee and they went at it for enough time, they might be able to take them all down.</p>
<p>The monsters spread over such a large area, however, wouldn’t all conveniently head in Shin’s direction.</p>
<p>Kilmont managed to repel the flood until now because the number of monsters spawned in one place was less than other floods, the monsters scattered as they proceeded, were blocked or tricked in fighting each other via items, etc.</p>
<p>When Shin’s group arrived, Kilmont was already at its limits.</p>
<p>If the large monster horde mentioned in the most recent report started moving, the defensive lines were likely to fall.</p>
<p>(Is it better to use Rashugum? Considering the preparations and range of attack, though…Raster is always doing maintenance on it, but only on the facilities they use daily. Even if it can move, we don’t know the state of its weaponry.)</p>
<p>Shin thought that the anti-guild war machine could exterminate monsters in a very wide range.</p>
<p>Rashugum, however, could not be said to move very quickly, and he didn’t know if its weapons were ready to be used.</p>
<p>In the game era, Shin always kept it ready to be used anytime, but since this kind of maintenance was probably not performed for over 500 years, he wasn’t sure about using it. There was no time to inspect all of its weaponry.</p>
<p>It was still better than nothing, however, so Shin decided to send Raster a message after the meeting.</p>
<p>“Our next strategy also depends a lot on how many monsters can be lured by the items in the wasteland.”</p>
<p>“Yes, if we have enough time we can definitely take them all down. Time, that’s what we need now more than anything.”</p>
<p>As someone said, war is all about numbers, and the current situation was proof that it was true. Overwhelming power was indeed a great asset, but, no matter how strong someone was, the area a single person could defend was pitifully small.</p>
<p>The spawned monsters might be low leveled, but even a few of them could be very dangerous for a normal resident to face.</p>
<p>If there were hundreds, thousands of them, with high-level monsters mixed in, it wasn’t strange for Raig and the other officers to throw away their pride and bow their heads.</p>
<p>“Time…hmm, well, there is a way, but…”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>There was a way to supplement for a lack of time. So suggested Raig, but it looked like something was troubling him. Shin asked what that was and he nodded.</p>
<p>“The monsters’ spawn point, the Sacred Place, is beyond the sea. There are no towns or inhabited areas in the surroundings. They don’t even offer useful materials. So someone suggested raising a barrier all around it, to keep them from coming inland.”</p>
<p>Shin thought he read a very similar concept in a manga or novel once.</p>
<p>He also recalled various works where dangerous areas were sealed off with high walls, so the area outside was safe for living. It didn’t look like a bad idea to him.</p>
<p>Many countries actually surrounded their cities with tall walls to ensure their safety. It was the same concept, for the opposite reason: to keep the dangerous elements confined inside the walls.</p>
<p>The location where the monsters appeared was also on a peninsula, so it would be unnecessary to build a wall on the northern and western sides.</p>
<p>If the parts connected to the continent could be blocked, the sea would act as a natural barrier. It would also let them save the resources and materials needed to build a wall completely surrounding the area.</p>
<p>“It’s a simple plan in theory, but executing it is a whole different matter. How far from the Sacred Place will the wall be built? How wide? How tall? How sturdy? Considering that high-level monsters could spawn too, it had to be extremely strong, or it would all be pointless. Even if the sea can act as half of the wall, the other half was still a large distance to cover.”</p>
<p>When the proposal was first made, it was treated as absurd.</p>
<p>The person who came up with it, however, did not give up.</p>
<p>Many ideas were considered and some of them implemented, such as the usage of items to lure the monsters.</p>
<p>During experiments, it was discovered that if the monster’s advance was blocked by a wall, the monsters would continue moving along the wall, without attacking it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the monsters were led to a location surrounded by walls and the sea, they would continue walking till they fell into the water.</p>
<p>“We’ve gone over this many times, but I’ll spare you the details. In the end, the 『World Rift Wall』 project was approved.”</p>
<p>The project involved using items that created gigantic walls instantly, placing them at fixed intervals, and activating them all at the same time to instantly create the wall, without the risk of monsters getting in the way.</p>
<p>“Implementation of the project started 252 years ago.”</p>
<p>“So much time has passed already!?”</p>
<p>The plan hinged on the Dragnils’ long lifespan.</p>
<p>Shin thought that building a normal wall might have been faster, but the wall building technology of this world was not very advanced.</p>
<p>Using skills would have improved things a bit, but, since they wanted to build a permanent, instead of temporary, line of defense, they needed a very long time.</p>
<p>Every time a flood manifested there was the risk to be attacked by monsters and for the wall to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Gathering materials and manpower was surely not easy either. In the end, they reached the conclusion that using items to create walls instantly and activating them all at the same time was cheaper and less work.</p>
<p>The walls would be made with Earth magic, 60 mel tall and 40 mel wide, so they would be very difficult to cross.</p>
<p>The walls would be reinforced via automatic skills immediately after their creation, so they wouldn’t crack even if attacked by a level 700 monster.</p>
<p>“It’s impressive that you can build something like that. I didn’t think that the current technology was so advanced.”</p>
<p>Even in the game era, a project like this would have been deemed impossible. There was something that bothered Shin, however, about the fact that the plan involved building a wall.</p>
<p>“There were engineers alive since before the Dusk of Majesty at that time, after all. It would probably be impossible to make the same thing now. The walls are based on an item called 『Drop of Erathem』, have you ever heard about it, sir Shin?”</p>
<p>“I see, so you use that as a medium for the wall. Now I can see how it would work.”</p>
<p>The size and type of processing were different, but it was also used to power the 6th Sky Castle Rashugum.</p>
<p>Using a large quantity of 『Drop of Erathem』 could indeed make it possible to build the massive wall Raig talked about, equipped with reinforcement skills.</p>
<p>“The placement of the items is almost complete: if we succeed, we should be able to narrow down the monsters’ advance routes to very limited areas. I would have preferred to activate it when it was complete, but we can’t afford to wait any longer, can we.”</p>
<p>“If we go take a position where there are gaps in the wall…even so, it’s still too wide…”</p>
<p>Even if the wall was 90% complete, the remaining 10% was still an area over 500 kemel. It was impossible for Shin’s party to cover it completely.</p>
<p>“Can’t you place the remaining items faster? Looks like we have some time before the large monster horde starts moving and they’re still at the edge of the continent, even if they start moving now it’ll take time before they arrive, right? The empire’s troops can handle the ones who spawned first, except the high-level ones. If we place the remaining items at full speed, we can reduce the gaps in the wall to an area Shin and the others can cover, no?”</p>
<p>“If we go ourselves, huh…do you need any particular skills to set the items?”</p>
<p>“No, the items must be set at a certain depth, but any magic user of a certain level can do it, even if they aren’t Chosen Ones. It would be easy for Sir Shin, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Raig and the other officers seriously considered Milt’s idea. Both the items’ placement and the subsequent counterattack relied on Shin’s party, but the current situation didn’t give them other choices.</p>
<p>Shin was curious about who created the items in the first place but decided to ask about it later and continue with the plan.</p>
<p>“Can I discuss it with Schnee and the others first?”</p>
<p>“We would be grateful if you did. Please go ahead.”</p>
<p>Raig and the other officers nodded, so Shin immediately opened Mind Chat. None of the other pairs were currently engaged in battle, so they answered right away.</p>
<p>“(I have just heard the same information. I see, the 『World Rift Wall』 project. I can understand why Raig wishes to wait for it to be complete, but considering the monsters’ numbers, it cannot be helped, I suppose.)”</p>
<p>“(However, even if that will stop the current flood, will the wall resist in the future too? Unlike now, the monsters would all gather into that hole in the wall.)”</p>
<p>Shibaid heard about the plan and agreed that it was a valid one.</p>
<p>Schnee worried about what would happen after the wall was created, though. Floods would continue as long as there was magic power in the sacred place: the goal was not to stop only the current one.</p>
<p>“(If they set more illusion items and gather the previously scattered troops in one place, won’t it work out somehow?)”</p>
<p>“(I remember that in some battles they put ballistae, magic cannons, and stuff on the walls, together with magic users. What was the size of the wall again?)”</p>
<p>Filma and Sety continued by suggesting some countermeasures.</p>
<p>Shin was thinking of the same thing too.</p>
<p>Climbing the wall would be terribly difficult, so unless they used teleportation devices placing troops and cannons or other weaponry on the wall was pretty much impossible. They could lend them temporarily, using Schnee’s name.</p>
<p>“Ehm, Shin…I’ve thought of something, but I’m not sure if it can work out, can I say it?”</p>
<p>Shin felt his sleeve was being pulled and turned around to find Tiera. She did not seem completely confident, so she hesitated a bit.</p>
<p>“Hm? Sure, we have to throw out ideas first, we’ll think later if we can put them into practice or not. So, what did you think of?”</p>
<p>“Those items that will create the wall, they say they’re going to be activated all at the same time, but I thought that you could activate them also by themselves. So that when we’re finished dealing with this flood, you can fill the gaps in the wall.”</p>
<p>“…oh yeah, that couldn work too.”</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it didn’t seem impossible. Shin had a creation-type job, if he knew the details of the item in question he might be able to do something about it.</p>
<p>“To change the timing of the items’ activation? Is it possible?”</p>
<p>Raig heard Shin and Tiera’s conversation, so he joined in.</p>
<p>“I cannot say for sure without dismantling the item, but if it’s the one I’m thinking about, it might be possible. Can you take a look at this?”</p>
<p>“Is that an item card?”</p>
<p>Shin took a card out of his item box and materialized it: it was a transparent sphere the size of a table tennis ball.</p>
<p>The item’s name was 『Space Rift Crystal』. It could be used to cast the Earth magic spell 【Soil Wall X】.</p>
<p>Its effect was simple: throwing it on the ground created a barrier of earth.</p>
<p>It was normally used to stop chasing monsters or to block enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Shin’s item had greater effectiveness, however: the 【Soil Wall】 it created was sturdier and lasted longer than normal.</p>
<p>Shin took it out because, while hearing about the wall and how it was conceived, a certain person came to mind.</p>
<p>So he took out that item card to verify his supposition.</p>
<p>“…hmm, I see Sir Shin is very knowledgeable about items as well. Please follow me. The items used in the project are a military secret, I cannot talk about them here.”</p>
<p>Raig took a little while before answering, probably because he read the information about Shin’s item first. He had unlocked it, so it could be accessed via【Appraisal】.</p>
<p>Raig shot a wave of intimidation that made the other officers in the room tremble.</p>
<p>“Men, I must apologize, for we have to leave for a while. Proceed with the meeting while we are gone.”</p>
<p>Raig then motioned for Shin and the others to go with him.</p>
<p>The officer charged with continuing the meeting looked at Raig with “again?” written all over his face. He was the same human-like Dragnil who had scolded Raig at the beginning.</p>
<p>The officers realized the gravity of the situation, so no one raised any objections or expressed disappointment.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 5</p>
<p>“I suppose this means I guessed right?”</p>
<p>Shin had followed Raig in a private room, with Tiera and Milt in tow, then asked this question.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Sir Shin, but I would like you to speak first. As I said before, the items used in the 『World Rift Wall』 project are a military secret. One of utmost secrecy.”</p>
<p>The information about the plan and the items themselves were guarded very closely, to prevent ill-intentioned people from stealing them.</p>
<p>There were also several disputes within the empire concerning the creator of the items in the first stage of the project, so the creator’s identity was kept hidden to protect the people related to them from harm.</p>
<p>The creator was a nobody at the time, so they used their name for the project’s name too at first.</p>
<p>“The items’ creator is Barakia Wallcraft. In current terms, you’d call him a Chosen One. He was a blacksmith and alchemist, someone very passionate about building walls. His favorite words were ‘Parapets are the best thing ever’. That’s the Barakia I know. The items used for the 『World Rift Project』 are powered up versions of that item, maybe?”</p>
<p>Shin pointed to the item card in Raig’s hands. Since this world offered more freedom than the game, it wasn’t strange for Barakia to have become able to create such items.</p>
<p>“…to be able to figure out so much…Sir Shin, are you related to Sir Barakia?”</p>
<p>Raig did not answer directly and asked another question, but implicitly answered Shin’s question in the process.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve done some things together.”</p>
<p>In the game era, blacksmiths exchanged information and critiqued each other’s works.</p>
<p>Barakia was a victim of a monster attack on a Home Town.</p>
<p>“That man was really passionate, but in a pretty strange way…the same type as Shin.”</p>
<p>“Oi Milt, don’t call me weird so naturally.”</p>
<p>“You were pretty high on the weird scale at that time, you know? Birds of a feather is what pretty much everyone said.”</p>
<p>“What…did you…just…?”</p>
<p>Shin was not aware at all.</p>
<p>“You’ve done things together, you say.,.I thought you had heard about him from Sir Shibaid. What exactly do you mean by ‘doing things together’? Barakia died more than 200 years ago…hmm, also considering what Lady Milt said…I thought you were a High Human, but apparently, you are a long-living species instead. A Lord or a Pixie, maybe?”</p>
<p>Raig heard from Barakia about where he used to live and what he used to do in the past, so while surprised he asked for more details, a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what Barakia had been up to after coming to this world, so he thought that the Barakia he knew was different from the one Raig knew, but, apparently, that was not the case.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave that to your imagination. About the item, I pretty much know how it is made, so I believe I can work on it.”</p>
<p>Things would get complicated if they started talking about his species, so Shin changed the topic.</p>
<p>“This is not the right time to talk about that, is it? In any case, I would never have expected you to know him personally…that was rather surprising.”</p>
<p>Raig pondered silently for a short while, then looked at Shin again.</p>
<p>“….very well. I have had some of the wall creation items, named 『End Wall』, brought to this fort. There were concerns that they could be broken or lost, so we stored some of them here as spares. I shall let you see them. If it’s possible to activate them separately, it will be worth reporting to the emperor.”</p>
<p>Raig told the soldiers standing by outside the room to inform the other officers that the meeting was suspended.</p>
<p>“This way, follow me.”</p>
<p>Raig started walking away.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the two of us are going to be much use, but should we come too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I was thinking the same thing.”</p>
<p>Raig did not tell Milt and Tiera to wait there.</p>
<p>They had followed Shin and heard the conversation too: Shin thought that if their presence was problematic, Raig would have said as much, so he said it would be probably fine for them to come too.</p>
<p>“Lady Milt is a former player and Lady Tiera is a priestess, right? We wish to hear ideas different from ours more than anything, after all. Do not fret, we will change the items’ hidden storage location after we have shown them to you.”</p>
<p>“…I can see how you know about Milt, but you knew about Tiera too?”</p>
<p>Raig had spoken in a casual tone, but Shin couldn’t help but ask about it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t strange for a long-living species like Raig to know about players, but the fact that Tiera was a priestess was only known to those who lived in the elven village or had a connection to it. The only exception was Shin and his party.</p>
<p>“I have been living since before the Dusk of Majesty, after all. I’m not this old for nothing. I have actually met a priestess before, though I don’t know what generation she was. Lady Tiera’s aura feels similar to hers. I was not completely sure, but it looks like I struck gold, yes?”</p>
<p>Shin’s reaction proved that Raig’s assumption was right.</p>
<p>Shin thought that he messed up: he would have never expected a Dragnil to know about the priestesses.</p>
<p>“I will not speak about this to anyone, of course. I know very well how important priestesses are.”</p>
<p>Raig spoke in a more firm, serious tone. Having met a priestess before, he was well aware of their position and role.</p>
<p>The group soon arrived in a room used by the fort commander for paperwork and meeting guests.</p>
<p>“We’re going in the secret passage now. The rest is up to you.”</p>
<p>So Raig said to the Dragnil in the room — the officer who had rebuked him for his jokes — and opened a hidden door in the back of the room.</p>
<p>Beyond the door there was a small room: Raig manipulated a device and a bookshelf slid to the side, revealing a corridor.</p>
<p>According to 【Magic Sonar】, the spiral staircase beyond led all the way underground.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Raig then proceeded into the hidden passage. Shin thought it would take some time for him to go all the way underground, but Raig was back in about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>“That was pretty quick.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you are aware of how far this corridor goes. But you shouldn’t be able to tell where the items actually are.”</p>
<p>Raig smirked and Shin raised his hands in surrender.</p>
<p>He wasn’t going to show both the hidden passage and the items’ storage location, after all. Nonetheless, it was also true that he had already revealed a large part of the fort’s secrets.</p>
<p>“What about the items, then?”</p>
<p>“Here. You’ll understand that I cannot simply give them to you. I’ll be here while you analyze them, I trust that is fine with you?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I have nothing to hide.”</p>
<p>Shin took the item from Raig. It had a spherical shape, very similar to his 『Space Rift Crystal』. The rainbow-colored glow in the center was probably created by a『Drop of Erathem』.</p>
<p>Shin activated 【Analyze】 and 【Appraisal】, the same method he used in Hinomoto when forging 『Dojigiri Yasutsuna』.</p>
<p>Since Shin already knew how to craft the base item, he could easily find out the materials and composition. He also found out why they were set to be activated all at the same time.</p>
<p>“I see, it’s because of a lack of materials…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Apparently there weren’t enough 『Drops of Erathem』 at the time. The spell to create the walls and the skills to reinforce them both depend on them, but they couldn’t gather enough for all the items.”</p>
<p>“The prototypes created the wall without problems, though. I saw them with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>“They were probably designed for testing or demonstrations. These items are all connected by magic power. How do I say it…it’s like there’s an invisible thread of magic power tying them all together. When they are activated, they become complete together, creating not the faint light you see here, but a whole 『Drop of Erathem』 crystal.”</p>
<p>It was one of the methods used when there weren’t enough materials to make an item.</p>
<p>In【THE NEW GATE】, magic power worked more effectively when crystallized rather than when infused into an item.</p>
<p>If magic power was infused into items and then split into several parts, the resulting items or gear would have an inferior effect than magic power in its crystallized form. In the 『End Wall』 item, magic power was still crystallized.</p>
<p>As far as Shin could see, the 『Drop of Erathem』 used when crafting 『End Wall』 did not have enough potential output to create a wall that could cut off part of the continent.</p>
<p>What made it possible was using this method.</p>
<p>By distributing a uniform amount of magic power to all items and arranging them to activate at the same time in perfect balance, it was possible to create an amount very close if not equal to magic power in crystallized form.</p>
<p>It was also possible to break down the magic power crystals in powder or melt them, which was more effective in terms of simultaneous activation, but this method had its own unique advantages.</p>
<p>If an entire 『Drop of Erathem』 was used in a single item, the magic power effectiveness was 100%. If the magic power crystal was shattered or liquefied and split into two items, the effectiveness fell to about 48%.</p>
<p>If the magic power was infused, the effectiveness fell further to about 40%.</p>
<p>The more items magic power was infused into, the lower the effectiveness. By using this connection method, however, it was possible to keep magic power effectiveness close to 50% even if the magic power was infused into two items.</p>
<p>Shin remembered well that, when this method was found out, it created quite a stir among Creation job specialists, with everyone wondering how it could be possible, some claiming it had to be a bug.</p>
<p>Many players complained that magic power effectiveness should be made equal in every case, after all.</p>
<p>This method had its advantages, but since there weren’t many cases in which it would be really useful, most players either forgot about it or never knew about it in the first place.</p>
<p>There was no simpler method, however, to increase magic power effectiveness.</p>
<p>There was a solid reason why it was used in the wall creation plan: to keep magic power balanced, the items absorbed the surrounding magic power.</p>
<p>In order to create a wall across a whole continent, an incredible quantity of items was needed.</p>
<p>To keep magic power balanced between so many items, the total amount of magic power that needed to be absorbed far surpassed the amount of the 『Drops of Erathem』 used to craft the items.</p>
<p>After a quick calculation, Shin realized that the method could indeed provide for the lacking magic power.</p>
<p>“Hey Shin, is it really fine to activate some of the items by themselves, then? If they are set to absorb magic power together to work properly, won’t we mess it up if we change things?”</p>
<p>Raig probably thought the same thing as Milt, as he nodded to her question.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, thanks to Barakia. He didn’t use pretentious methods or newly found techniques not thoroughly tested. He also made it possible for the items to be incorporated, in case other players found them.”</p>
<p>The results of the analysis appeared in Shin’s mind. There were no defects to be found.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Shin? You have a pretty scary look on your face.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I just felt how serious he was when he made this. I guess this might be fate too…”</p>
<p>Barakia was not part of 『Rokuten』, but he was still a player Shin felt close to.</p>
<p>“So, about the magic power. At this point, there is a great amount of magic power being added. The items were made with this method because they didn’t have enough『Drops of Erathem』, basically not enough magic power, so if we use the『Drops of Erathem』I have we can make the items activate normally even in this state.”</p>
<p>The items were connected via an invisible bond of magic power, so it was possible to add 『Drops of Erathem』, their primary source of magic.</p>
<p>“If we use the same process on the items set to activate individually, their effects shouldn’t change. I have to actually try it before I can be sure, though.”</p>
<p>The plan had been carefully perfected over 200 years: Shin was not so reckless as to go and fiddle with its key items just like that. He had the blueprints now, so only the final checks remained.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of doing the necessary testing first, then actually work on the items if there aren’t any problems. What do you say?”</p>
<p>“Please go ahead with the testing. I cannot approve work on the items on my authority alone, though. We will have to wait for the emperor’s final say.”</p>
<p>Even if Shin was Schnee and Shibaid’s companion, to modify the core aspects of such a project naturally needed the approval of the country’s ruler.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was almost a miracle that someone as little known as Shin could be allowed to see and analyze such top-secret items, even if Schnee and Shibaid vouched for him.</p>
<p>Things could be different if he revealed his identity as High Human, but Raig did not know of it.</p>
<p>“When do you expect to have the results?”</p>
<p>“With the situation as delicate as it is, I want to be as thorough as I can. Even if I start right now, it will take at least three days. Then it all depends on the results of the tests.”</p>
<p>The analysis of 『End Wall』 was complete.</p>
<p>Shin could have started experimenting on it immediately, but he wanted to try other tests first before actually working on it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if the meetings here will reach a conclusion, but can you proceed like that?”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Raig was quick to decide, probably because of his personality.</p>
<p>“If you have any other ideas, let us know. I don’t mean to doubt your ability, but the more countermeasures we have, the better.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>There was always the chance of the tests leading to negative results. It was natural to try to have reserve plans.</p>
<p>“Shall we go back, then? I do hope a good plan will come out of this.”</p>
<p>Raig put back the 『End Wall』 in storage, then they all returned to the meeting room.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 2 Part 6</p>
<p>Reacting to the sound of the door opening, all present turned towards Raig, Shin, and the others.</p>
<p>“Were there any developments while we were gone?”</p>
<p>“The monsters do not seem to be moving yet. About the countermeasures, the proposed plans include burying explosive items on the monsters’ expected route, dropping explosives from the sky, and even reckless ones such as taking the monsters down with all of our forces, before they can scatter.”</p>
<p>“The army would spread not to let the monsters flee, while Lady Schnee and Sir Shibaid would charge into the main horde?”</p>
<p>“That is one proposal, yes.”</p>
<p>“I can see where it comes from, but…”</p>
<p>Judging from the expressions of the members of the meeting, it really was simply one of the proposals they came up with. No one pushed it proactively.</p>
<p>It would be effective, of course. Schnee and Shibaid were far stronger and could attack in a far wider range than any of the army’s Chosen Ones.</p>
<p>They also had great mobility: if the battlefield didn’t encompass an area as large as the continent, it would be a solid plan for sure.</p>
<p>The only problem was it wasn’t enough to solve the current situation.</p>
<p>“Landmines and air bombing could work to an extent. Among the monsters, there are flying types too, however. A number of casualties in the dragon knight divisions would be unavoidable. Is there any news about the monster species?”</p>
<p>“As before, the confirmed monsters include animals, insects, and shapeshifters. At present no monsters capable of flight over the highest point have been spotted, so air bombings would be effective. According to the most recent communication from the capital, preparations are underway.”</p>
<p>“I see. Hopefully, that can thin the numbers a bit.”</p>
<p>More precisely, the best result they could hope for at present is to prevent the monsters’ numbers from increasing.</p>
<p>“Let us close the meeting for now. I wish for you all to keep thinking of possible countermeasures, however. If you come up with any useful ideas, you may contact me anytime.”</p>
<p>The ever-increasing monster spawn was a grave issue, of course, but the problem of the monsters spawned from before remained as well. They could not just keep using their time for meetings.</p>
<p>After all the officers returned to their posts, Shin and the others left the meeting room as well.</p>
<p>“Sir Shin, Lady Tiera, what will you do now? You spoke in private with Sir Raig, so…”</p>
<p>“I have to do some tests. If it all goes well, we might be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
<p>“I would very much like to know more, but maybe it is not something for us to hear?”</p>
<p>“I cannot decide on my own if I can talk about it or not. I’m sorry, but you would need to ask Raig about it.”</p>
<p>Reiner thought for a moment, then glanced at Milt.</p>
<p>“If Shin doesn’t talk, I can’t say anything either.”</p>
<p>Milt covered her mouth with her hands and shook her head. She was a subordinate of the church, but even so, could not speak of other countries’ military secrets so easily.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of making you become a spy. But if you act like that it’s clear that you also know what we’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“!? You tricked me!!”</p>
<p>“Not really…you went with Sir Shin when he left the meeting, so anyone could figure it out…”</p>
<p>Reiner simply meant it as a joke.</p>
<p>“Since you know about it, go with Sir Shin, for the time being, Milt. Our reinforcements and the troops in the fort are enough to deal with the monsters for now, as long as no high-level monsters appear.”</p>
<p>So said Reiner, but Milt did not agree with his orders at all.</p>
<p>“I’m not a creation job specialist, so it would be pointless for me to stay. I’d definitely be more useful if I was out there swinging my halberd. Don’t you think so too, Shin?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t go as far as to say pointless, but….there’s nothing I need you to help with, that’s true. It’s not your specialty, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin thought for a moment before replying, but the conclusion was the same.</p>
<p>Since she used poison, Milt acquired 『Concoction』 and several other creation-related skills. However, they wouldn’t be useful with the item Shin was going to work on this time.</p>
<p>It was amazing enough for her to have honed those skills despite being a battle-oriented player.</p>
<p>“And so, I’m coming with you.”</p>
<p>“I see. We’re leaving immediately, then. We received orders to eliminate as many monsters as possible in the surroundings before the large horde starts moving.”</p>
<p>“Roger! See you later, folks!”</p>
<p>Milt winked as she left, joining Reiner’s forces in the monster extermination expedition. Shin and Tiera watched her go, then they also exited the fort.</p>
<p>They rode on Yuzuha and Kagerou for about two kemel, then Shin took out a certain item.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the item from before? But you couldn’t take it with you, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, this is a different item. But the sphere infused with magic power is definitely this 『Plain Stone』. I confirmed it during the analysis. If you infuse this with the right magic power and skills, it’s possible to create the item Raig showed us. At least in theory.”</p>
<p>The item Shin materialized from a card, 『Plain Stone』, was a material normally used for infusing skills.</p>
<p>There were other similar types too, all used in conjunction with skills. The only difference was the level and type of skills that could be infused in each one.</p>
<p>“If we take a 『Drop of Erathem』 and wrap it in our hands with this 『Plain Stone』, we have— ”</p>
<p>The one cemel wide 『Drop of Erathem』 fragment fused with the 『Plain Stone』 in Shin’s palm. The 『Drop of Erathem』 disappeared and the 『Plain Stone』 started giving off a rainbow light. It looked exactly like the 『End Wall』 item Raig showed them.</p>
<p>“…eh? You did it already?”</p>
<p>“No, now we have a base for skill infusion. I have to attach skills in it now.”</p>
<p>The 『Plain Stone』 gave a faint glow as Shin spoke.</p>
<p>“Done. Since it’s still experimental…let’s just call it 『Wall Stone』. Okay then, here goes.”</p>
<p>Shin buried the 『Wall Stone』 in the ground, walked away from it, then activated it. It was the remote activation function also present in the 『End Wall』 items.</p>
<p>“I can see how this could stop the monsters…”</p>
<p>Tiera was staring, dumbfounded, at a massive wall of soil, 10 mel tall, 20 mel wide and 5 mel thick.</p>
<p>It was already hard rock, as solid as metal. Seeing such a small sphere give birth to a fortress-like wall would certainly leave anyone speechless.</p>

<p>“Next is this.”</p>
<p>Shin took out the same number and size of 『Plain Stone』 and 『Drop of Erathem』 and fused them.</p>
<p>“It looks like the same to me, is there anything different?”</p>
<p>“I attached two layers of skills. The first wall only had one max level 【Soil Wall】, but I cast the same skills twice this time.”</p>
<p>Shin then activated the item. Nothing happened, however.</p>
<p>“Did it not work?”</p>
<p>“No, there wasn’t enough magic power.”</p>
<p>The『End Wall』Shin analyzed had a double layer of skills too.</p>
<p>Infusing an item with the same skill twice raised its effectiveness, but also required more magic power than infusing it with two different skills.</p>
<p>The magic power in the 『Drop of Erathem』 Shin used to create the item clearly wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“It’s all according to calculations, at least for now. Let’s fuse another 『Drop of Erathem』 in it.”</p>
<p>Shin dug out the item, fused one more 『Drop of Erathem』 in it, and buried it again. Once he activated it a wall much more massive than the first one was created.</p>
<p>He used a skill to measure it: the new wall was about 60 mel tall and 40 mel thick.</p>
<p>Because of the item’s capacity, the wall’s width capped at 10 mel, but the height and thickness were the same as what Raig said 『End Wall』 to be.</p>
<p>“If I add a hardening skill, the magic power consumption is exactly the same. A hefty quantity, as expected. I guess I should try testing the magic power absorption quantity when the items’ magic power is balanced together…?”</p>
<p>Shin already had information about how the item was made: combined with the analysis of the item itself, there were no holes in the information he had. The experiments were proceeding extremely smoothly.</p>
<p>Additional fusion of a 『Drop of Erathem』 to the 『End Wall』.</p>
<p>Measurement and calculation of the magic power absorption at the moment of activation of connected items with equal amounts of magic power. Activation time variation, and more. Shin thoroughly performed test after test.</p>
<p>He had to delete and re-create the walls a number of times, thus inadvertently causing a bit of commotion in the fort, but could ultimately produce positive results.</p>
<p>Then, two days after he began his research…</p>
<p>“To be able to create a top-secret item in such a short time…so this is why Zaikuin’s answer arrived so quickly.”</p>
<p>Raig was holding one of the 『End Wall』 items made by Shin. After scanning the results of Shin’s experiments and the materials about the item, he felt almost tired to be surprised so often.</p>
<p>As Raig said, they received an answer from the royal capital the next morning after he sent the materials: an unprecedented approval to give Shin unlimited freedom.</p>
<p>It was so fast that Raig sent more documents and asked for confirmation a second time. Shin thought it was probably because the emperor knew he was a High Human.</p>
<p>Once again, he felt that, for the people of this world — players excluded — 『Rokuten』 was that special of an existence. They weren’t treated as the gods of creation jobs for nothing.</p>
<p>The Dragnils involved in the creation of 『End Wall』 were amazed to see that Shin seemed to know its structure better than them.</p>
<p>“The plan will be put into action as soon as the soldiers retreat from the front lines.”</p>
<p>“Understood, let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>In order to implement the plan, the 1st and 2nd fort were going to be abandoned, as they were located beyond the planned wall. The soldiers had begun withdrawing already: they were scheduled to completely leave the forts in two days and would cross the planned wall in seven days.</p>
<p>Once they crossed the wall line, there would be no need to fear the large monster horde anymore. They could keep the great number of monsters that spawned this time at bay as well.</p>
<p>Cultivating such optimistic thoughts was what triggered it all, maybe.</p>
<p>Shin and the others heard furious knocking at the door. The soldier that rushed inside looked as pale as death.</p>
<p>“Emergency report!! The large monster horde…has started moving!!!”</p>
<p>As it turned out, the monsters weren’t going to stay quiet until the wall was built.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 1</p>
<p>“Explain in more detail.”</p>
<p>Raig talked to the agitated soldier in his usual tone.</p>
<p>He took a solid, unfazed commander-like stance.</p>
<p>The soldier seemed to regain some composure thanks to Raig’s calm. He took a deep breath and started talking again.</p>
<p>“Yes sir! The report arrived just now: the scouts stationed in the 1st fort witnessed several large monsters separate from the horde at high speed. Afterward, the rest of the monsters started moving as well, as if following their lead. Lastly, the scouts could not read the names or levels of the large monsters that left the group first.”</p>
<p>The scouts stationed in the 1st fort were experts of concealing their presence and analyzing their targets. Most of them were Chosen Ones, so their stats were far higher than the average person.</p>
<p>If they couldn’t analyze their levels, the monsters either had very high levels or skills that hid their information.</p>
<p>“How many of those large monsters were there, exactly?”</p>
<p>“The report mentioned that three were spotted at the moment. They headed respectively northeast, east, and southeast of the starting point. Each of them leading monsters of their same type.”</p>
<p>The scouts confirmed that the monsters heading northeast were of the shapeshifter type, the ones heading east the animal type, and the ones heading southeast the insect type.</p>
<p>The animal types were led by a tiger-like monster with two heads.</p>
<p>Its body was approximately five mel long, mostly covered in black fur, with red patches here and there.</p>
<p>A pair of yellow horns grew from both of its heads. It was also reported that there were sparkles of something coming from its mouths.</p>
<p>Based on this information, Shin guessed it was Heltoros. What sparkled in its mouth was probably lightning.</p>
<p>Heltoros could spew lightning from its left mouth, flames from its right.</p>
<p>It was highly skilled at commanding feline and canine monsters: it was the kind of monster powerful on its own, but much more fearsome in a pack.</p>
<p>It also possessed very high mobility: even if the prey managed to run away from it, it could track it via smell and would chase it obsessively.</p>
<p>In the game, its level was between 700 and 750. If it was leading a pack, it was better to regard it as being 100 levels higher.</p>
<p>The insect-type boss monster had a lizard-like head, compound eyes, a centipede-like body with six pairs of thin dorsal wings. It also had long spider-like legs.</p>
<p>Shin was sure that it was a Selcikeus. Its characteristics were too unique: as long as it was a monster from the game, there was no mistake about it.</p>
<p>Even if it had wings, its flying capabilities were limited and it could only fly very slowly, so it normally used its long legs to move on the ground.</p>
<p>Its most dangerous abilities were an extremely large range of enemy detection and long-range attacks.</p>
<p>Its lizard-like head could split in four to release a very powerful searing hot beam. Its offensive power was so high that Selcikeus itself was blown away from the recoil, so it used its long legs to anchor itself to the ground.</p>
<p>Its level ranged from 800 to 850. As far as Shin knew, it did not have the ability to command other monsters of the same type, so this Selcikeus might have acquired new abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, the shapeshifter monster was one the scouts had the most trouble with.</p>
<p>Slimes and other shapeshifter monsters were very difficult to identify from their external characteristics, as suggested by the name. Since they could change their shape, such characteristics could not be relied on.</p>
<p>What was known at present was that its body was blue and purple and had three pairs of thin stick-like limbs, six in total, growing from its oval body.</p>
<p>It used such insect-like features to move. Most spherical shapeshifter monsters either rolled or crawled on the ground, but this one was different.</p>
<p>The soldiers’ report confirmed that only the monster leading the pack moved in such a way, however.</p>
<p>Heltoros, which was more dangerous the larger its pack, had thus found its ideal conditions.</p>
<p>Selcikeus’s long-range beam attacks would be very dangerous if it sent other monsters ahead.</p>
<p>The shapeshifter monsters’ abilities would be unknown until the battle started.</p>
<p>Considering their numbers, each pack was dangerous enough to wipe a small country off the map. Maybe even a large country could not fend them off for long.</p>
<p>“They’re all going to be a pain to deal with.”</p>
<p>“A pain? Shin, these are calamities for the normal people here. By the current standards, they’re basically screwed.”</p>
<p>Milt sighed helplessly at Shin’s comment.</p>
<p>In the game era, players from everywhere would have gleefully charged at the monster packs, excited to join the new event, but things were very different in this world.</p>
<p>Now that the 『World Rift Wall』 project was nearing completion, however, there were ways to deal with the issue.</p>
<p>“I know that. But there are still things we can do. Because we have a bunch of “abnormal” people on our side, me included.”</p>
<p>“Phew, I’m glad to see that you’ve got self-awareness. If they weren’t scattered you could wipe them all out by yourself, after all.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if you’re praising me there, Milt.”</p>
<p>Shin was slightly bothered by Milt’s response. He wasn’t going to say that he was a perfectly normal person, but it felt a bit uncomfortable to hear others say it.</p>
<p>“There are way too many monsters for me to wipe out completely by myself anyway…wait, why are you two nodding like that?”</p>
<p>Shin told Milt that what she said was beyond ridiculous, but both Tiera from behind him and Yuzuha on his shoulder nodded in approval.</p>
<p>“Well, thinking about the battles until now, that seemed like the natural order of things. I honestly expected that after building the wall you’d say something like ‘I’m still worried after all, so let’s defeat them all to be sure’, go over the wall and start fighting. Once the wall is complete and the monsters can’t advance, the time issue is solved, after all.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I can’t…deny that possibility…”</p>
<p>Shin scowled a bit at Tiera at first but soon realized that he was really prone to say something like that.</p>
<p>Even if the wall prevented the monsters from spreading through the continent, leaving such a large horde of monsters alone was definitely worrying. It would not be strange if they decided to exterminate all the monsters that spawned this time.</p>
<p>Shin thought so because it was not beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>“(Kuu! Time for Shin to show what Shin is made of!)”</p>
<p>Yuzuha seemed to agree too. She deftly used her tails to support her body upright and punched the air with her paws, as if shadowboxing.</p>
<p>“You people are sure taking it easy. The 1st and 2nd fort soldiers are going to be attacked by the monsters, remember?”</p>
<p>Reiner interjected in the conversation with a mixture of confusion, disappointment, and a pinch of anger.</p>
<p>Most of the troops stationed in the forts were foot soldiers. Even with the support of arts and skills, they definitely could not outrun high-level monsters.</p>
<p>The physical abilities of monsters outmatched humans too. Compared to the average person, a high-level monster’s energy was practically endless.</p>
<p>The monsters were overwhelmingly superior in both strength and speed. There was a high chance that the 1st and 2nd fort troops would be attacked before they could cross the wall line.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we aren’t just messing around.”</p>
<p>Shin understood that the atmosphere surrounding Milt and Tiera was very different from the other officers.</p>
<p>“Yes, Shin could really pull it off.”</p>
<p>“Right, Shin definitely could”</p>
<p>“(Kuu, Shin will do his best!)”</p>
<p>“That’s not a proper reason…look, everyone’s glaring.”</p>
<p>Shin urged them to act more seriously, but the officers’ looks did not change much.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! It appears that even monsters unknown to us aren’t much of a threat to Sir Shin. We couldn’t hope for a more reliable ally, could we?”</p>
<p>Loud laughter erupted in the conference room. Raig saw the situation differently from the other officers.</p>
<p>“Do you have any plans other than the wall project? Everyone is anxious, as you can see. Can you tell us about them?”</p>
<p>Raig stopped laughing and took a serious expression. The retreating troops would soon be in danger: they couldn’t keep laughing forever.</p>
<p>“The number of humans on our side is next to nothing compared to monsters. So I propose to use these to transport the troops quickly to a safe location.”</p>
<p>Shin took out a crystal enchanted with teleportation magic. He was involved in the current situation as Schnee’s ally, and it would not be strange for her to use such items, since she lived since before the Dusk of Majesty; Shin thus decided to use them without hesitation.</p>
<p>“A crystal to transport the troops…? Could that be…”</p>
<p>The officers seemed to be puzzled, not understanding how the crystal could move the troops.</p>
<p>Raig thought for a bit after seeing the crystal, then his eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“We can bring the troops close to the 9th fort in an instant with this. It’s not possible to transport the whole army at once, of course, but based on their numbers, we should be able to bring them all in using them 10 times or so. We’ll go there ourselves and start transporting the troops. I heard that there is a wyvern in this fort, to be used when messages do not work, so if we borrow it we should be able to reach the forts before the monsters do. This will also give us more time to prepare to engage the monsters after the wall has been built.”</p>
<p>“…a crystal enchanted with teleportation magic, I see. It surely would dispel all concerns of the troops being chased by the monsters.”</p>
<p>Raig sighed while looking at the crystal in Shin’s hands.</p>
<p>“I thought I knew how skilled you were, Sir Shin, but I cannot help being surprised nonetheless. Disposable teleport crystal shards can sometimes be found in ruins or dungeons, but not crystals capable of transporting groups of people. I know that it was the norm once, but there are very few people capable of such a thing nowadays.”</p>
<p>“Where in the world did Lady Schnee find such a person…?”</p>
<p>Raig’s vice officer seemed stupefied too.</p>
<p>“Well, enough about that. If we have our allies retreat without forcing them to suffer casualties, there will be no better plan. The 1st and 2nd fort troops will be sent to guard the soldiers in charge of setting the wall creation items. With Shibaid and Lady Schnee present, I doubt anything will happen, but more manpower could be useful in case of emergency, at least as a defense.”</p>
<p>“I agree. We cannot rule out the possibility of a situation we could not handle on our own.”</p>
<p>Numbers equal power. Even if Shin and his party members were individually very strong, they could not be everywhere at the same time. All the situations they had faced until now could somehow be resolved by brute-forcing their way in specific locations, but they had to be ready for a situation where that method would not work.</p>
<p>“Can you move immediately?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There are still many unknown factors, so we should act as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The unconfirmed Wolfreet-like monster was another issue Shin wanted to deal with, but the monster horde had higher priority.</p>
<p>“Our side shall proceed with building the wall, then. Item setting and escort troops have already been dispatched to forts 3 to 7. Let us depart too.”</p>
<p>Activating the 『End Wall』 required a certain amount of manpower, to prevent the mistaken activation of a single item that activated all of the others in a chain reaction.</p>
<p>There were so many items used in the 『World Rift Wall』 project precisely to prevent human error or people misusing the items with malicious intent.</p>
<p>Schnee and Filma were going to act on their own, by borrowing a wyvern like Shin’s group and visit the various item activation points, defeating monsters on the way.</p>
<p>In case of emergencies, they would contact Shin and deal with it.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Sety were going to continue on their way to regroup with Shin, defeating any monsters they found.</p>
<p>The party was going to regroup where the『End Wall』items hadn’t been set yet.</p>
<p>The item setting operations had proceeded at a feverish pace while Shin was doing his experiments.</p>
<p>The item setting could proceed more smoothly thanks to items that allowed the workers not to be spotted by monsters, provided by Shin.</p>
<p>The workers would continue setting up the items as much as they could until the monsters arrived; if they couldn’t make it in time they would activate the items on the spot: Shin and the others were going to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Depending on the wall’s structure, it might not be possible to block all the gaps, so Raig, the imperial army, and Reiner’s church forces were ready to be deployed too.</p>
<p>A report from the capital stated that the dragon knights had departed already.</p>
<p>“First, we will head to the 1st and 2nd fort to assist the withdrawal of the troops there. We will decide the teleport location once we arrive: please inform any deployed troops about the teleportation plan first. It wouldn’t be a problem even if they are deployed, but if they know about the plan in advance we can avoid needless confusion. Would it be acceptable to inform the soldiers here later?”</p>
<p>“Not a problem. I leave the troops in your capable hands.”</p>
<p>Raig nodded and Shin jumped on the wyvern.</p>
<p>Wyverns usually had rough temperaments, but this one was trained well, so it didn’t run wild even if it was its first meeting with Shin. It trembled when Yuzuha hopped on its head first, so that might be the reason.</p>
<p>Shin made sure Tiera was sitting properly behind him, then lightly pulled on the reins.</p>
<p>The wyvern understood what that meant and started running. After a short run, it spread its robust wings and soared in the sky.</p>
<p>It was probably supported by skills or magic: after kicking the ground it flapped its wings just a few times but was already high up in the clouds.</p>
<p>“Since it’s used for emergency communication, I expected this wyvern to be very fast, but it’s nothing special…maybe?”</p>
<p>Tiera was hugging Shin’s back, but after the wyvern stopped soaring and started flying in a more stable manner, she moved away a bit.</p>
<p>She didn’t let go of his hands, though. There was a lot of shaking while the wyvern flapped its wings, so she might still be worried.</p>
<p>It had shaken strongly enough that Tiera could have fallen off if she didn’t hold Shin’s hands, as she wasn’t handling the reins.</p>
<p>“Seems pretty fast to me, though. Until now you’ve flown only on the Ancient Dragons and Tzaobath, so I guess this guy seems slow in comparison.”</p>
<p>They did not fly many times together, so it was easy for Shin to recall.</p>
<p>The Ancient Dragons and Tzaobath both had much higher levels than the wyvern. Even if it was trained to fly at high speed, it couldn’t compete with them.</p>
<p>The wyvern cried softly, and Shin thought it said “Don’t compare me with beasts like those, please…”.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the kind of gap that could be filled via training, so Shin softly caressed the wyvern’s neck to console it.</p>
<p>“How long will it take to reach the destination?”</p>
<p>“It’s about three hours till the item setting area. We’re going to set a teleport spot there, then head to the 1st fort. They should have been informed already that the monsters are moving, though, so they might have started retreating already. In that case, we’ll arrive earlier.”</p>
<p>Raig said that it would take the troops 2 days before leaving the fort, but that included the time necessary to prepare food supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>If the troops only prepared enough supplies and gear to move to a nearby fort, 1 day would be enough to make preparations.</p>
<p>The only other factor was how much time they could buy before the monsters arrived.</p>
<p>“We’ll make it in time…right?”</p>
<p>“If the monsters moved exactly as the report said, yeah.”</p>
<p>Tiera was worried, but Shin chose not to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Most of the information in the reports they recently received was about the large monster horde.</p>
<p>The 1st and 2nd forts were the closest ones to the monster spawning point, but they couldn’t focus on only those two spots.</p>
<p>While the monsters were heading deeper into the continent, not all of them acted in the same way.</p>
<p>Maybe because of their lower intellect, some monsters stopped advancing halfway, roaming the surroundings instead.</p>
<p>Some monsters also formed packs, so there was the chance they attacked people or settlements during their advance. They couldn’t rule out the possibility that such monsters might be attacking forts right now.</p>
<p>Raig had warned them about this before they left to rescue the soldiers. He decided to tell them because Shin was not especially knowledgeable about Kilmont’s floods, so he might not know about it.</p>
<p>After about three hours of flight, they spotted the silhouettes of what seemed to be the item setting troops.</p>
<p>“Looks like the item setting operations are going well.”</p>
<p>“Right. I can feel several strong magic sources from under the ground.”</p>
<p>Shin too detected large globes of magic power, set underground at fixed intervals.</p>
<p>Maybe because he knew the items’ structure in detail, he could tell that they were properly connected by threads of magic.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s make sure they don’t mistake us for monsters.”</p>
<p>Shin, still riding the wyvern, took out the imperial army flag borrowed from Raig.</p>
<p>All the Kilmont troops knew that wyverns were used for emergency communication. If Shin waved the flag on top of that, there shouldn’t be any risk that they would be mistaken for monsters.</p>
<p>“We have come to secure a teleportation location to assist the withdrawal of troops from the 1st and 2nd fort. Have you received communication from Sir Raig?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we have. Based on the number of troops, I believe an area about one kemel away from here would be fitting. What do you think?”</p>
<p>The field commander checked Shin and the others’ names and identities, then made this proposal. He said the distance to be one kemel, but since the troops would be stationed starting from the center, it was actually closer.</p>
<p>If it was too far away they could have trouble dealing with sudden developments, but the wasteland had little obstacles and offered a clear field of view. They could notice any changes immediately.</p>
<p>The field commander also considered the fact that positioning the troops too close to the wall building points might cause accidents.</p>
<p>“We will head to the 1st fort immediately after setting the teleportation point. Please continue your operations.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to us. The safety of many of our compatriots depends on this mission. We shall carry it out perfectly.”</p>
<p>The field commander saluted Shin in the Kilmont style, by holding his right first over his solar plexus, then returned to his work.</p>
<p>Shin and the others did as they said: after setting the teleportation point, they soared back into the sky on the wyvern, heading towards the 1st fort.</p>
<p>It took them about 30 minutes: as the map and detection skills already told them, there was no one to be found there.</p>
<p>“Looks like they left already. A lot sooner than what we were told, though.”</p>
<p>Even if they started their preparations immediately after the messages were sent, after the council in the royal capital, not even half a day had passed yet. Raig had said that even if they had to abandon the fort it would have taken some time to prepare, so Shin was worried that something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Even if unforeseen trouble struck in the 1st or 2nd forts, however, they were supposed to be contacted immediately.</p>
<p>Since there was no such communication, Shin guessed they either left ahead of schedule or had to leave immediately for a specific reason.</p>
<p>“There are tracks of the troops’ retreat. It doesn’t look like they were attacked by monsters, more like they left in a hurry. They shouldn’t be too far.”</p>
<p>The troops had clearly used the same arts used by the Church Warband to move more quickly. The numbers of the troops were great, however, and Shin’s party could move faster by flying.</p>
<p>After about five minutes of flying while scanning the surroundings with detection skills, they found a cluster of soldier presences and other presences scattered here and there.</p>
<p>“Thanks to their experience fighting on the frontlines, the commander’s judgment was swift, I suppose. Their movements are coordinated very well.”</p>
<p>From above it was easy to see that the troops moved in orderly files. They were using physical boost magic, as expected: they could move very quickly.</p>
<p>Shin thought their movement speed was even higher than the Church Warband. They might be using skills, not arts, to boost their physical abilities. Since they were fighting in dangerous frontlines, their abilities had to be higher as well.</p>
<p>“Even so, there are things you can’t avoid.”</p>
<p>Shin looked towards a group of presences that repeatedly went closer, then away, then closer again to the 1st fort troops.</p>
<p>As Raig had warned Shin, a group of roaming monsters was attacking the troops.</p>
<p>The soldiers were prioritizing their advance, so they did not stop to fight the monsters.</p>
<p>Some of the monsters that did not attack the soldiers left the pack, without paying too much attention to the soldiers, so the commander judged there was no point in engaging them in battle.</p>
<p>“I’ll go take down the monsters that left the pack. Tiera, please go help the soldiers fighting against the monsters. Yuzuha, control this guy so that Tiera can shoot more easily.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, leave it to me!”</p>
<p>“Eh!? What!?”</p>
<p>Shin entrusted the reins to Yuzuha, now in human form, and jumped off the wyvern. While cutting through the wind, Shin activated a magic spell and two fist-sized globes of magic power appeared in his hands.</p>
<p>Shin used 【Flying Shadow】 to regain an upright stance, then aimed at the monsters away from the soldiers.</p>
<p>Lightning-type Magic Skill 【Giant Spark】.</p>

<p>Shin launched one fist-sized globe of electricity for each pack of monsters. The globes would enlarge once they hit the center of the pack, engulfing it fully in a lightning storm.</p>
<p>After the skill subsided, only charred corpses remained.</p>
<p>All the monsters other than the ones engaged in battle with the soldiers or too close to them were thus quickly exterminated by Shin’s 【Giant Spark】 barrage.</p>
<p>“What power is that…!?”</p>
<p>“All troops, be alert! Where did the attack come from?”</p>
<p>“Captain! I-it came from the sky!”</p>
<p>The soldiers trembled in their boots as they witnessed the monster packs being annihilated one by one.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers pointed to the sky and shouted.</p>
<p>The soldier riding on the most majestic horse of the group looked upwards too.</p>
<p>Shin landed right next to this soldier on horseback and started running along him.</p>
<p>“Sir, I assume you are the commander of the 1st fort troops. I have come from the 9th fort to assist your retreat, my name is Shin. Are the soldiers here with you your whole division?”</p>
<p>Judging from how the other soldiers addressed him, Shin thought the man on horseback was the commander and talked to him as such.</p>
<p>Shin’s sudden landing surprised all the surrounding soldiers, so it took a few seconds before the man replied.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I am commander Gunoit. We have indeed heard that they sent a wyvern as emergency reinforcements. Let us talk more once we have repelled the monsters, shall we? We have encountered a large pack while retreating, and our numbers make it difficult to lose them.”</p>
<p>“Let us deal with them first, then. Have you heard the details about your transportation?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did find it hard to believe, but if Sir Raig says so, I have no choice. Are there any additional orders?”</p>
<p>They were still under attack, so Gunoit wanted to deal with the monsters first. He probably noticed that the lightning only targeted monsters.</p>
<p>Shin too knew that it would be difficult to transport them like this and didn’t want to waste time talking about details.</p>
<p>“Nothing in particular. It would be better for you to be still for the transportation to work, so let us deal with the monsters first. If we can defeat the monsters surrounding us, we can proceed with the transportation immediately.”</p>
<p>“Understood. We had grown irritated with the persistence of those beasts too. All troops, stop where you are! Prioritize defeating the monsters!”</p>
<p>The captain probably used a magic tool to communicate: even the soldiers too far to hear him normally stopped to fight the monsters.</p>
<p>The soldiers were probably as fed up as Gunoit with the monsters: starting from the spots with a lower concentration of monsters, the soldiers blew them away with their shields or pierced them with their spears.</p>
<p>Their way of fighting was rather wild for imperial soldiers, but they positioned themselves in a way to support each other, showing they were indeed battle veterans.</p>
<p>“Ah, my companion is shooting the monsters from the sky, so please don’t attack that.”</p>
<p>“I shall inform the soldiers accordingly.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded as Gunoit shouted the order to his troops, then leaped in the air.</p>
<p>He jumped again with 【Flying Shadow】, then headed towards a pack of monsters too close to use 【Giant Spark】.</p>
<p>The soldiers could take down smaller groups of monsters, so he headed towards larger groups.</p>
<p>Most monsters were four-legged animal types. They attacked the soldiers using a hit-and-run strategy, switching places with other monsters every time, possibly due to their instincts.</p>
<p>The soldiers did not risk going to the spots where Shin went, consistently culling the monsters’ numbers instead.</p>
<p>Shin jumped over the soldiers’ heads as they deftly defended themselves against the monsters’ claws and fangs, sometimes with their shields, sometimes with their weapons and armor.</p>
<p>Since the soldiers were on the defensive, Shin assumed the monsters’ attacks were becoming more aggressive. He landed between them, without a sound, then flashed his 『Kakura』.</p>
<p>The monsters probably did not even notice that an enemy had landed behind them. Before they did, they had already dissolved into blood and smoke.</p>
<p>Before their severed heads or torsos fell to the ground, Shin swung 『Kakura』 again.</p>
<p>All monsters in the sword’s range were torn to shreds.</p>
<p>Most monsters were under level 200, so he could easily cut down their numbers without using skills.</p>
<p>Shin performed his attacks in directions where there were no soldiers, to prevent the shockwaves from damaging them.</p>
<p>“I’ve finished off the monsters in the back! The ones in the front are the only ones remaining!!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted to the surprised soldiers.</p>
<p>They were having a difficult time because of the monsters’ battle strategy too, but especially because of their numbers.</p>
<p>Even if they managed to wound the monsters, new ones soon took their place. The soldiers couldn’t run at full speed either, so they couldn’t outrun the monsters. Their energy was thus gradually whittled away.</p>
<p>Since they were veterans that fought against the floods on the frontlines, monsters around level 200 were no match for them.</p>
<p>They stayed on the defensive because they couldn’t see how many monsters in the back rows had been defeated by Shin.</p>
<p>The greatest threat of the monsters’ number was gone, and the monsters themselves were shaken by Shin’s appearance, so there was no need to fight defensively anymore. The soldiers in this area too started proactively exterminating the monsters.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 2</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re done here.”</p>
<p>There were still some spots where monsters remained: Shin checked where Yuzuha and Tiera were providing support and headed in the direction farthest from them.</p>
<p>The monsters’ numbers had been severely reduced through the intervention of Shin’s party; the soldiers’ counterattack thus quickly exterminated the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>“You have my gratitude for assisting my troops. There are many things I’d like to ask, but please let me know about the message first.”</p>
<p>If they lingered too long they might be attacked by monsters again. Gunoit seemed intent to begin the teleportation immediately.</p>
<p>“That’s a great help. I have been informed of the numbers of squads in the 1st fort: if the troops gather according to their squad, we can start transporting them right away.”</p>
<p>“That’s no problem then. The troops were fighting the monsters in groups according to their squads just now. Some might be mixed in larger companies to cooperate, but it won’t take much time to reassemble the squads.”</p>
<p>“Let us start immediately then. The destination has already been secured.”</p>
<p>The troops were grouped by squad, leaving 10 mel open between each. It was done pretty quickly, as Gunoit said.</p>
<p>Shin stood in the center of the squad to be transported and infused magic power into the teleportation crystal. The scenery surrounding them twisted and turned, and the next instant they were in the wastelands Shin registered as the teleportation destination.</p>
<p>“…that’s the item setting division?”</p>
<p>After the teleportation, Shin heard one of the soldiers close to him whisper to himself. The soldiers of the item setting division, whom Shin’s party had spoken to some time before, were now in front of them.</p>
<p>It was obvious from Shin’s standpoint, but it was nothing but shocking for the transported soldiers, who stood there speechless.</p>
<p>“I will go back to transport the other squads. Please stand by here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Understood.”</p>
<p>So Shin addressed the still awed squad leader, then teleported away. As he did, the soldiers’ gazes all focused on him.</p>
<p>“He’s back. They really teleported…”</p>
<p>“Seems like they’re going to teleport all of us like that.”</p>
<p>“So that is the strength of those chosen by Lord Shibaid…”</p>
<p>Shin’s hearing skills brought various whispers to his ears.</p>
<p>Teleportation was not exactly an unknown technique.</p>
<p>What remained of it at present, however, was only an adaptation of the teleportation devices from the ruins or guild houses of old, as used in the adventurers’ guild and royal castle in Bayreuth.</p>
<p>The technology to create teleportation devices and place them anywhere was said to be lost.</p>
<p>The soldiers’ reactions reminded Shin of how Tiera acted when Shin first used a teleportation crystal in this world.</p>
<p>“There are no remaining presences: all soldiers have been transported. I will head to the 2nd fort now.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your service.”</p>
<p>Shin transported the last remaining squad, then returned.</p>
<p>“Off to the 2nd fort then. Let’s get this done quickly.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shin and Tiera climbed on the wyvern. He made sure Tiera had firmly wrapped her arms around his stomach, then they soared.</p>
<p>“Hm? Is it just me, or is the wyvern shining?”</p>
<p>As soon as they flew up, the wyvern started glowing faintly with a green light.</p>
<p>“Kuu! Movement speed up!!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha gloated while wagging her tails. Apparently, she was behind it.</p>
<p>She had modified a skill that boosted movement speed to affect the wyvern’s flight speed.</p>
<p>It was something that no player would have easily come up with, as they could not fly in the sky by themselves. Summoners and Tamers were more likely to think of such a technique, maybe.</p>
<p>Yuzuha didn’t use it when they first left the 9th fort because she wasn’t sure she could control it sufficiently: she didn’t want to risk a crash landing.</p>
<p>She had perfected her control of the skill during the previous battle.</p>
<p>During the battle, they flew at low altitude and speed, did not face many enemies at once, and, even if they crashed, remained safe since Tiera could save herself and the wyvern wouldn’t suffer lethal wounds; it still sounded impossible to pull off to Shin’s ears though.</p>
<p>“It’s impressive that you could support the soldiers in a situation like that.”</p>
<p>“I could somehow feel when we were going to speed up. Besides it’s not like the wyvern accelerated abruptly, so I didn’t risk falling off.”</p>
<p>So Tiera, who had assisted the soldiers by firing her bow from the wyvern, answered Shin’s question. Shin thought that her proficiency as a Tamer had probably increased.</p>
<p>“You could also ask Kagerou for more riding practice.”</p>
<p>Kagerou probably heard the conversation too: he emerged from Tiera’s shadow and looked at her as if asking “I wonder if Tiera will ride on me too…?”, so Shin gave him an assist.</p>
<p>He had been supporting Tiera from inside the shadow so that he wouldn’t be mistaken for a monster.</p>
<p>“It should be in sight already…”</p>
<p>Thanks to Yuzuha’s support skill, they could reach the 2nd fort area in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>They planned to go to the 2nd fort first, then switch to the direction the soldiers moved.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I ask something?”</p>
<p>“Eh? W-what’s up?”</p>
<p>Tiera had been quiet during the flight but finally broke her silence. Shin used a skill to decrease the wind pressure around them, so they didn’t need to speak loudly to understand each other.</p>
<p>Shin’s awkward pause and his reaction were caused by the way they were sitting, Tiera talked right next to his ear. She also spoke up suddenly, so Shin was caught off guard.</p>
<p>“It might be just my imagination, but from the place you transported the 1st fort soldiers until here, the monsters’ presences felt kind of weird.”</p>
<p>“Weird?”</p>
<p>Shin scanned the monsters’ presences as they flew, but they felt the same as always to him.</p>
<p>As far as Shin could tell, regardless of whether monsters spawned due to the flood or not, their presence felt the same.</p>
<p>“What exactly is weird about them? I detected monsters here and there too, but they didn’t feel weird.”</p>
<p>“I feel that there are monsters that are hostile and monsters that aren’t…it’s not clear, though, that’s why I said it felt weird.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t as clear to state it outright, but also not faint enough to treat it as just her imagination.</p>
<p>“Yuzuha, can you feel anything?”</p>
<p>“…lots of hostility. But something else is mixed in?”</p>
<p>So said Yuzuha while cocking her head to the side. It was a faint sensation for her too.</p>
<p>“…let’s see if we can confirm it after we’ve transported the 2nd fort soldiers.”</p>
<p>Something that Shin couldn’t feel, but Tiera and Yuzuha did. It was a matter of senses, but Shin thought that even something as small as that shouldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>The 『World Rift Wall』 project would be realized very soon: he couldn’t rule out the possibility that this might be a hint that something unexpected was going to happen.</p>
<p>They were simply going to land and approach one of the presences to analyze it more closely. Even if nothing came up, it wouldn’t be much of a loss of time.</p>
<p>“Can you focus on searching for the presences around us? If you can find one clearly different, we’ll land and analyze it from up close.”</p>
<p>“Kuu, I’ll do my best!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will try.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha sat on the wyvern’s head, her ears and tails springing right up. Shin could understand why her ears would do so, but it was a mystery if there was a point to the tails standing up too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shin felt Tiera’s arms around his stomach tighten. She also leaned more closely against him: even through the clothes, he could clearly feel the softness of her body.</p>
<p>“Er…Tiera…?”</p>
<p>“I can keep my body more stable like this. I’ll tell you when I find something, so let me stay like this for a while.”</p>
<p>“Got it, I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p>Tiera’s tone was completely serious: Shin could tell she wasn’t joking at all, even without looking at her.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to think of it in a weird way, so Shin also focused on scanning the monsters’ presences. Ignoring the sensations pushing against his back.</p>
<p>“Sorry to break your concentration, but we’ve arrived at the 2nd fort.”</p>
<p>They were already close in the first place, so it only took minutes to arrive at the 2nd fort. There were no silhouettes to be seen, no presences to be felt. The map did not show anything either, so they assumed the soldiers might have left already, like in the 1st fort.</p>
<p>Shin then spread his detection field in Kilmont’s direction.</p>
<p>As there were no hits yet, the troops had to have moved a considerable distance already. Because of the great number of soldiers involved, tracks of their passage clearly remained on the soil. They weren’t going to have trouble catching up to them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go after the soldiers. If you catch anything on the way, let me know.”</p>
<p>The wyvern’s flight route was directed towards Kilmont. After about five minutes, Shin picked up on a group of presences, likely the soldiers.</p>
<p>“Looks like they haven’t encountered monsters this time.”</p>
<p>Shin took out and waved the flag as they approached the soldiers. They waved their own Kilmont flag in response.</p>
<p>Shin flew over the troops once to let themselves be seen, then landed in a nearby clearing.</p>
<p>The soldiers followed them to the wyvern’s landing spot. They separated into two files and a man on horseback, probably the commander, approached through the middle path.</p>
<p>“My name is Shin, I came at Sir Raig’s request to transport you to a safe location. Have you received the message?”</p>
<p>“I am Ahd Dey Kilmont, the commander in charge of the 2nd fort. We have received a communication, yes. Please go ahead with the transportation as soon as you’re ready.”</p>
<p>The commander bore the surname Kilmont; he was either part of the royal family or shared a connection with them.</p>
<p>The troops were already separated in squads, so it was simple to transport them. After the 2nd fort soldiers, the next troops to be transported were the 2nd royal guards division and the Church Warband, stationed in the 9th fort.</p>
<p>“I will start the transportation now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do.”</p>
<p>A Dragnil clad in full armor nodded and Shin activated the teleportation. The 2nd royal guards division was transported first.</p>
<p>“Teleportation makes it all so much easier.”</p>
<p>Milt said so to Shin after he finished transporting the 2nd division. She was going to be transported together with the Church Warband.</p>
<p>“Want to learn it?”</p>
<p>“I honestly would, but I’m afraid it’d make things more troublesome in the end, so I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>Milt answered Shin’s question after glancing at Reiner and sighing. The 2nd royal guards division had also invited her to join their ranks after they learned of her upgraded weapons.</p>
<p>The Dragnil commander of the 2nd royal knights division was equipped with Legend gear, but it was all either mid or inferior grade.</p>
<p>That was impressive in its own regard, but Milt’s equipment was much superior to that, and she also had enough ability to use it.</p>
<p>Milt couldn’t use her full strength before because of her equipment, but now that she had a weapon capable of withstanding her strength, her fighting ability was higher than before. It would be strange if they didn’t try to get her to join their ranks.</p>
<p>“In any case, I wish you will give a proper and fair consideration to the marriage issue.”</p>
<p>“You have my heartfelt wishes that you will find your special someone in the future.”</p>
<p>Shin had gotten relatively used to Milt’s teasing, so he answered with a very serious look on his face.</p>
<p>“Aah, Shin is being mean!”</p>
<p>“Stop joking around then.”</p>
<p>Milt dramatically fell to her knees and pretended to cry, so Shin gave her a light chop over the head. It reminded him of their exchanges in the game era and he felt a wave of nostalgia.</p>
<p>“Hmm, this is fun in its own way, but seeing you get used to it makes me feel complicated too. I have to think of something more amazing after this mission is over.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to jinx it if you say it like that. Let’s go, come on.”</p>
<p>Milt might be an acquaintance, but it wasn’t the right time to be chatting.</p>
<p>Shin activated the teleportation and transported the Church Warband. After transporting all of its members, he once again reminded Milt to be careful, then joined with Tiera and Yuzuha again.</p>
<p>“Tiera, Yuzuha, please go help the soldiers in charge of the items. I’ll set down some traps in the direction the monsters are coming from, just in case.”</p>
<p>Shin thought of helping the item setting division, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Based on the speed at which they were advancing, they were definitely going to cross the wall line before all the items could be placed and the wall activated. They would be forced to activate the items with a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>The hole would be formed where Shin and the others were, so he thought of setting traps there to slow down the monsters’ advance.</p>
<p>The most important trap was an item that created smaller walls, which Shin had crafted while working on 『End Wall』. Its size was rather small, but it was more than enough to serve as an obstacle.</p>
<p>He also thought of testing various trap items he made during the game era, which were now lying unused in his storage.</p>
<p>He could detect where he set the items, so recovering them later would be easy. He wasn’t going to create a landmine situation, where he knew the items were buried but did not know exactly where.</p>
<p>“Okay, my good wyvern friend, you have one more job to do.”</p>
<p>Shin’s traps could be simply scattered from the sky; it was faster to do so while flying on the wyvern than while running.</p>
<p>The wyvern cried loudly, expressing that it was ready and willing to go.</p>
<p>“Around here should work.”</p>
<p>After 20 minutes of flight, once they were far enough from the wall creation line, Shin took out the traps from his item box.</p>
<p>“You can only do something like this because no one lives around here.”</p>
<p>Shin tossed the item cards while shifting the wyvern’s course. The materialized items fell on the ground.</p>
<p>They didn’t crash with loud sounds, raise dust or smoke, however: they sank into the ground like pebbles in water.</p>
<p>It was a function created for items to be buried more easily, often present in items used by scattering them on the terrain.</p>
<p>It wasn’t possible to aim at specific spots while dropping them, however, so this method couldn’t be used with the 『End Wall』 items.</p>
<p>The items Shin scattered were traps that, when monsters got close enough, caused the soil to spike upwards. The shape these ground protrusions took was random: Sometimes they were sharp lances, sometimes strange statues, etc.</p>
<p>They were very large and not even Shin, who set them, knew what shape they were going to have, so the monsters were definitely going to be confused. The ground protrusions would also work as physical obstacles.</p>
<p>When these traps were used to protect an allied facility the function to distinguish friend from foe was added too, but it was not needed this time: they were too many to do so. The traps were going to activate even if a normal person walked too close to them.</p>
<p>Luckily, no one lived in the area so there was no risk of such a thing happening.</p>
<p>After the operation, if Shin reported to the authorities about the traps they could make it possible for no one to get closer until all of them were removed.</p>
<p>“Let’s turn around now. Go back about one kemel, then start flying in the same way as now.”</p>
<p>The wyvern Shin borrowed was very intelligent and understood his words completely.</p>
<p>Maybe because of his riding skills as well, he only needed to say what he wanted to and pull the reins a little for the wyvern to comply.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, Shin could concentrate on dropping the items. The next types of traps he scattered were exploding or freezing ones. They would cause confusion or delays, allowing the monsters to be finished off more easily.</p>
<p>“I’d liked to have scatter some more, but it can’t be helped, I guess.”</p>
<p>Shin had prepared a considerable quantity of items, expecting to scatter them from the sky, but there was a limit to how many he could prepare on his own. He dropped the traps as widely as he could, but, after about one hour, he had no more left.</p>
<p>“Now it’s just a fight against time.”</p>
<p>He was going to help with setting the wall items in the remaining time. They split into small groups and set down as many items as possible.</p>
<p>The item setting division troops and Tiera worked on the areas closer to the sea, while Shin flew inland with the wyvern and took over from the point until which the items had been set already.</p>
<p>He had practiced what to do to the point of memorization while working on the items: in the game era Shin and Barakia had done similar things together, so he could work faster and more precisely than the item setting division.</p>
<p>Even so, there was not enough time.</p>
<p>The monsters did not stop moving.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow?”</p>
<p>A few days after the operation started, the word finally came. The 『End Wall』 was going to be activated.</p>
<p>The messenger from the scout division contacted the field commander, so Shin and the others — the heart of the operation — were informed immediately.</p>
<p>“According to the scouts’ report, the monsters are expected to arrive 3 days from now, at noon, as long as nothing unexpected happens.”</p>
<p>The commander’s expression was grave. The report finalized the 『End Wall』’s activation date. The gap that would be formed in the wall was approximately 10 kemel wide. A gap that they could fill if they had just 5 more days.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t make it, in the end.”</p>
<p>“Can’t be helped. We knew it from the start after all.”</p>
<p>Shibaid glared at the map and one of the blocks placed on it, which marked the monsters’ position. Filma shook her head lightly and replied.</p>
<p>Together with Schnee, they had rejoined with Shin in the last few days. While Shin and Schnee were helping the item setting division, Filma and Shibaid used the wyvern to scout the monsters’ activities. They also set more traps and helped the imperial forces and the Church Warband to build a defensive line.</p>
<p>They also had Rashugum move towards Kilmont, for added safety, but because of the flying fortress’ speed and its initial location, it hadn’t arrived yet.</p>
<p>Without proper maintenance of its armaments, it would be difficult to use on the front lines anyway.</p>
<p>According to Raster, there didn’t seem to be any major problems with it. He had performed maintenance on Rashugum for many years, so his words definitely had credibility, but in any case, there was no way to use it if it was still so far away.</p>
<p>“What’s the condition of the monster packs?”</p>
<p>“It looks like each pack is starting to behave differently. The monsters led by Heltoros have formed many smaller packs. Heltoros is still the supreme ruler, but now it has servants ruling each smaller group.”</p>
<p>Schnee replied to Sety’s question while looking at the documents she received. Because of Heltoros’ commanding abilities, its pack was well organized. Their movement speed was also the fastest.</p>
<p>“Selcikeus is moving with monsters all around it. It probably intends to use them as a shield. They are all matching its pace, so they’re not very fast. We might be able to completely eliminate Heltoros’ pack before they even arrive. While their methods are different, we can say that this pack is also tightly organized.”</p>
<p>Some of the monsters surrounding Selcikeus normally acted independently, but this time none apparently strayed from the pack.</p>
<p>“Their intellect is lower than normal, so maybe they’re obeying the strongest monster of their kind?”</p>
<p>“That could be. For monsters, the leader is always the strongest.”</p>
<p>The monsters had clearly been fighting each other.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear if leveling up also boosted their intellect, but it was enough to establish a power relationship.</p>
<p>Even if they were insect types, they still belonged to the “monster” category above all. They did not share all of the characteristics of normal insects.</p>
<p>As far as Shin knew, the monster hierarchy was determined completely by individual ability. Subjugation by force, as Sety and Filma suggested, was very possible.</p>
<p>If the two packs attacked together, with Heltoros’ herd attacking directly and Selcikeus bombarding from afar, the Kilmont allied forces would certainly suffer many more casualties.</p>
<p>Shin and the others all thought that it would definitely be better to fight the two packs separately.</p>
<p>“Then there’s Gelganger.”</p>
<p>The identity of the shapeshifter monster was confirmed as soon as they saw it.</p>
<p>Gelganger was a type of slime, a monster completely focused on defense.</p>
<p>It was a top-class monster in terms of ways of mitigating damage: it could minimize blunt damage to a tenth, reflect magic, and more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, its offensive power was extremely low: in the game, players often ended up in a situation where they couldn’t defeat Gelganger, but the monster couldn’t defeat them either.</p>
<p>It was a non-active type of monster: it never did anything as long as players didn’t attack it. Even if other monsters around it were attacked, Gelganger would just slime away, unfazed.</p>
<p>Shin fought it in the past too: his sword attacks simply bounced back on the slime monster’s elastic skin. Like many other slimes, it didn’t seem interested at all in fighting.</p>
<p>It even let players ride on top of it (on its back?), so it was regarded as a very unusual kind of monster.</p>
<p>“Does this one attack?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s likely, yes. All monsters spawned by the flood tend to be aggressive, even if they aren’t normally. It might be dangerous to consider it an exception.”</p>
<p>“…well, it’s easy to defeat as long as we have more attack power at least.”</p>
<p>It was a foe difficult to fight against, but it had a clear weakness.</p>
<p>It was the weak point all monsters focused on defense had: they had no way to defend themselves from attacks that exceeded their defensive powers. It was enough to make Shin feel optimistic.</p>
<p>Something also felt off, however. Heltoros and Selcikeus were both aggressive monsters, but Gelgengar was the complete opposite.</p>
<p>It was strange that such a monster was born from the conflict between other monsters. Only a monster that overwhelmed its opponents with absolute power would triumph in the end.</p>
<p>“What will we do about our positions? At present, the monsters led by Heltoros are expected to arrive first, but, considering Selcikeus’ presence, it would not be a good idea to fight them close to the wall.”</p>
<p>Schnee spoke up and Shin decided to stop thinking about that for the moment.</p>
<p>He had no hard evidence at the moment and drawing a counter-strategy against the monsters’ advance had higher priority.</p>
<p>Unlike Shin and his party, the soldiers posted behind them probably wouldn’t be able to withstand Selcikeus’ long-distance attacks.</p>
<p>The defensive line wasn’t going to crumble after just one shot, but if they continued being attacked from a position too far to respond in kind, they would eventually be annihilated.</p>
<p>“The best thing would be to make the monsters target us. In that case, Schnee and I, being the fastest, would go ahead, while Shibaid and the others stay back to defend against the bombardment. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Even with your shields, Shin, we cannot defend the whole army. Fortunately, there is only one Selcikeus. If we get close enough to disrupt its line of fire, we should be able to take care of it all.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Shibaid’s proposal.</p>
<p>If they stayed away, they would never know where Selcikeus was going to shoot and couldn’t defend the whole allied army anyway. The only other way was to get closer themselves.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with Shibaid then. The monsters other than Selcikeus can’t perform attacks at that range, and even if there are some who can, we just have to torch the whole lot.”</p>
<p>Sety was clearly raring to go, as evidenced by her rather colorful choice of words.</p>
<p>She gave a bit of a reckless impression, but for Sety, the party member specialized in offensive magic, to shoot a barrage of spells from behind Shibaid, the party’s greatest shield, was not a wrong choice at all.</p>
<p>“Okay, so you two will head there from the start. If our calculations are correct, not even Selcikeus’ cannons should be able to bring down the wall, but we don’t need to put that to the test. If we have to crush it, I prefer doing it as soon as possible. Filma and I will go take care of Heltoros. Tiera, you and Kagerou will take down any monsters that we missed. Schnee will support Tiera and stand by in the middle between the wall and our positions, ready for any emergencies. How does it sound?”</p>
<p>Shin and the others did not think they could handle everything by themselves.</p>
<p>If the monsters’ objective was to advance inland more than anything else, many of them were likely to slip by Shin’s offensive advance. The imperial army and the Church Warband would have to deal with them.</p>
<p>The soldiers weren’t average citizens who would be helpless before a monster.</p>
<p>He told Schnee to stand back primarily to be ready to counter any unexpected situations, though she would help the soldiers if needed. She may not go as forward as Shin or Shibaid’s groups, but she was going to see her share of fighting anyway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shin didn’t mention Yuzuha’s name because it had already been decided that she would go with him.</p>
<p>There was the possibility that all monsters completely ignored Shin or the others and went straight towards the hole in the wall.</p>
<p>The fast monsters following Heltoros were the ones more likely to slip past Shin, so Yuzuha served as a countermeasure for them.</p>
<p>“Let’s use this strategy as a basis then.”</p>
<p>Shin and his party couldn’t decide the whole strategy by themselves: the conclusion would be decided through discussion with the imperial officers and the Church Warband.</p>
<p>Even if the result was going to be the same, they couldn’t simply decide on their own.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any other way though.”</p>
<p>“Sshh, they’ll hear you!”</p>
<p>Shin and Milt talked while looking at Schnee and Shibaid to discuss the strategy with the officers.</p>
<p>The most important objectives were to minimize casualties and stop the monsters from advancing: any strategy would end up being similar to the one Shin’s party thought of.</p>
<p>Since level and equipment were a major factor in this case, there was a limit to how tactics or strategy could influence the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a battle between human creatures, so they also had to account for the monsters making unexpected moves.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, the fact that a world just like a game exists is pretty weird.”</p>
<p>“You’re only thinking about it…now?”</p>
<p>The concept of level was maybe the greatest example: in the game, it was an element meant for players to enjoy the game for a long time. In reality, however, it just became a binding chain.</p>
<p>Leveling up was not a simple or quick process, so if they fought normally humans would simply be routed by the monsters.</p>
<p>“There are things that we can do because this world is just like a game, though.”</p>
<p>To fight against hundreds, thousands of monsters on your own or as a small party. And be able to make an impact.</p>
<p>Such a fantasy became reality in this world.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’ve reached a conclusion.”</p>
<p>“Right. Okay then, time to get serious.”</p>
<p>Shibaid nodded in Shin’s direction: it was the sign that the talks went as they expected.</p>
<p>Three more days until the operation.</p>
<p>A monster horde larger than ever seen before was drawing closer every minute.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 3</p>
<p>“They’re finally in sight.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking at a cloud of dust and smoke in the distance, raised by the monsters.</p>
<p>His current position was approximately one kemel away from the area where he had scattered the traps. As expected, the first to arrive was the pack of animal-type monsters, led by Heltoros.</p>
<p>The tiger-like monster commanding them was running ahead of the herd, naturally.</p>
<p>There were some differences from the information they received, however. Both of its heads had grown to a size much larger than normal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the beast’s fangs now stretched down to the base of its neck.</p>
<p>“It must have evolved on the way here.”</p>
<p>— Heltoros Garze Level 840</p>
<p>Not only its head, but the whole body was about twice the size of an average Heltoros.</p>
<p>An advanced specimen with higher speed and muscular power. Its jaws could go even over its neck, reaching its torso if wide open. It looked just like its mouth made up for one-third of its body.</p>
<p>“(I confirmed that Heltoros evolved to an advanced form. Selcikeus and Gelganger might have done the same. On your toes, everybody!!)”</p>
<p>Shin urged his teammates to take care via Mind Chat, then sent a message to the troops stationed behind him.</p>
<p>He had no intention of letting Heltoros break through his line of defense, but the other monsters might have powered up as well.</p>
<p>The monsters’ large numbers were enough of a threat: if the soldiers fought them without the knowledge that they might be stronger than usual, they might end up paying a steep price.</p>
<p>“Our first target is that one, right?”</p>
<p>Filma looked at Heltoros Garze, her 『Scarlet Moon』 slung on her shoulder. She was eager to let loose.</p>
<p>“Yeah, the leader’s presence alone makes the pack much more dangerous. Yuzuha, you handle the monsters that slip through. I’ll deliver the first blow, but I think that several monsters will slip through until we take that beast down.”</p>
<p>“You have my word!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha was standing next to Shin in her original form.</p>
<p>She still had not completely returned to her true form, but was very close to it: her body now measured about 10 mel, tails excluded.</p>
<p>Her mental faculties seemed to grow together with her body: her speech had nothing of her usual childishness. Her intimidating aura as one of the strongest monsters in the world was much more powerful.</p>
<p>She transformed in front of the imperial army and the Church Warband, so that they would not mistake her for an enemy monster, but even some of the officers stepped back in fear and awe.</p>
<p>“I’ll throw something big for the first blow. Filma, tell that to the messenger, please.”</p>
<p>Shin spoke while looking at the massive wall standing behind them, so tall you had to look to the sky to see the top.</p>
<p>The wall building operations continued for as long as the monsters’ advance speed and counterattack preparations allowed: the 『End Wall』 was finally erected the day before.</p>
<p>The figure of the massive structure shaking the ground as it rose to the sky was simply breathtaking.</p>
<p>No monster, no matter how powerful or high leveled might be, would pass any longer.</p>
<p>The wall’s overwhelming presence and mass inspired such a belief in the hearts of whoever saw it. Even Shin, who had seen many giant monsters in his life, could not help but be impressed.</p>
<p>His old friend had dedicated his life to making 『End Wall』. The fruit of his efforts now stood tall, to protect all the people behind it.</p>
<p>The troops stationed in the other forts, preparing for the monsters’ attack, also reported that the wall had been erected on their side as well.</p>
<p>The fact that no unexpected accidents happened during the construction of the wall was one of the reasons why Shin, his party, and the soldiers felt confident.</p>
<p>If other holes opened in it, they would have to send someone there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Such a thing did not happen, however: they all knew they only had to protect this one gap. Their morale was at an all-time high.</p>
<p>“I got a response. We can go anytime!”</p>
<p>“Here goes…!”</p>
<p>Magic power overflowed from Shin’s body. He chose the same skill he used during the great flood in Balmel, 【Blue Judgement】.</p>
<p>The thunderstorm it caused spread all around after hitting the ground, so it affected a wider range than the initial one. It was an ideal skill when the primary objective was to slash the enemy’s numbers.</p>
<p>The sky, where previously only thin clouds could be seen, soon became heavy with dark clouds. Clouds that rained pale blue thunderbolts.</p>
<p>It might have looked like a beautiful sight from a distance. For anyone under the clouds, however, it was nothing but a catastrophe.</p>
<p>The monster horde led by Heltoros Garze moved as a tightly controlled pack, so they were all rather close together.</p>
<p>It was like the situation was asking for Shin to cast 【Blue Judgement】.</p>
<p>The thunderbolts struck the area with the highest monster density, slightly behind Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>Shin delivered this blow with 【Limiter】 completely removed. Its offensive power and range were approximately twice of Schnee’s 【Blue Judgement】.</p>
<p>It was a view so unnatural for the people of this world. One of the Kilmont imperial soldiers who witnessed it later described it this way: “Rather than a thunderstorm, it looked like pillars of blue light were falling from the sky.”</p>
<p>“I thought I knew how it was going to turn out, but you went above and beyond once again…the majority of the monsters must be gone already, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s like a hole opened in the middle of the pack, yeah. But there’s still more than half remaining. They spawned continuously for several days, after all.”</p>
<p>The monsters defeated by Shin’s attack were the ones with enough speed and level to keep up with Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>The hole opened in the pack was soon filled by the monsters coming up from behind. On the map, the area behind【Blue Judgement】’s range of effect was covered in red dots.</p>
<p>They already knew about the size of the pack, but couldn’t help but marvel at how ridiculously high their numbers were.</p>
<p>Shin’s detection skills, however, told him that the average level of the monsters trailing in the back was considerably lower. Not all monsters were in the same high-level range, after all.</p>
<p>“Okay, it’s a test of endurance from here on.”</p>
<p>“Right. I’d love to shoot another 【Blue Judgement】, but it looks like it wouldn’t work out. Ah, make sure you don’t go to the areas where I set up the traps, okay? We’ll charge in after they get caught.”</p>
<p>Shin tried to cast another 【Blue Judgement】, but it didn’t feel like the skill was going to activate anytime soon. He felt like the magic power he released scattered in a mist all around.</p>
<p>He also felt that the magic power wasn’t just disappearing meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Maybe because of the magic power control training he started after coming to this world, he felt his mastery of magic power had changed. It was too vague a sensation to put into words, but he was sure something was different from before.</p>
<p>“I have to go over this again when I have the time.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing. Well then, let’s see how much the traps are going to help.”</p>
<p>Even after 【Blue Judgement】, the Heltoros Garze showed no signs of slowing down or looking back.</p>
<p>The same could be said for the monsters around it. They all kept running straight forward, without sparing a glance to their defeated or wounded brethren.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that they proceeded straight towards Shin’s position, even though they weren’t supposed to be able to see him, their goal was probably decided from the start.</p>
<p>It was the gap in the wall behind Shin.</p>
<p>“No hesitation at all.”</p>
<p>The monsters led by Heltoros Garze rushed straight into the area riddled with traps.</p>
<p>Aided by magic power detection skills, or maybe its wild instincts, Heltoros Garze deftly zig-zagged around the earth spears and strange statues rising from the ground. It also opened its jaws, extending close to its torso, to spew flames wrapped in lightning.</p>
<p>Monsters’ breath attacks looked like flames, but they were different from normal fire. The breath attack’s nature could change if the monster willed it.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze was no exception: its breath ran on the ground, scorching it and destroying Shin’s traps in the process.</p>
<p>“Looks like it noticed the traps. It didn’t do it from the start because it could dodge them, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think so too. Well, I put the traps to slow them down anyway. As expected of an advanced high-level monster, it can destroy even the main ones.”</p>
<p>Some of the monsters coming up from behind Heltoros Garze were pierced by the spears or crashed against the obstacles and were sent rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>Overall, only a few monsters could dodge the traps completely. The closer they were to Heltoros Garze, the more likely they were to do so.</p>
<p>Even so, they couldn’t destroy the traps in the same manner as their boss.</p>
<p>The monsters that followed Heltoros Garze’s path exactly were more or less unscathed, but the others were sometimes caught by traps and damaged themselves or the surrounding monsters.</p>
<p>Some were torn to shreds by explosions, others froze and shattered in a thousand pieces, others sank into the ground.</p>
<p>The various traps hidden in the environment turned it into a scene of carnage.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I almost feel sorry for them!”</p>
<p>So said Filma after swinging her flame-clad 『Scarlet Moon』, unleashing burning hot slashes that turned several monsters to ashes.</p>
<p>Thanks to the traps, only a few monsters had emerged. It was possible to whittle down their numbers with long-range attacks.</p>
<p>They weren’t heading straight towards Shin’s position, probably because they were still quite far from them.</p>
<p>Shin and Filma were using skills that enhanced their sight and could see the monsters well, but the same could not be said for their opponents.</p>
<p>“Well, they’re traps originally used by high-level players to defeat lethal monsters, after all.”</p>
<p>Shin used magic skills with high precision to snipe down the incoming monsters without destroying the traps. It would be a waste to break them while they were still effective.</p>
<p>It wasn’t going to last long, however. Heltoros Garze, which kept running while destroying the traps, had finally crossed the trapped area.</p>
<p>“We don’t have any time to waste, let’s finish it off quickly. Yuzuha, you take care of the rest!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Shin!”</p>
<p>Yuzuha howled loudly. A howl so powerful it shook the very atmosphere and disrupted the movements of the monsters following Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>Now that Yuzuha was more familiar with her original powers, her level exceeded 900.</p>
<p>Her tails too grew to 8. Her aura was already fearsome enough, yet she was still far from her complete form.</p>
<p>Leaving Yuzuha, bristling with a fighting spirit, to handle the lesser monsters, Shin and Filma headed towards the Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>Shin was now holding a straight single-bladed longsword. From its handle stretched four fang-like protrusions, giving the impression of a carnivore beast hunting for its prey.</p>
<p>It was the Superior Ancient-Grade katana 『Hunter Fang』.</p>
<p>It was one of Shin’s finest weapons for killing beast-like monsters: its abilities and stats were mostly focused on dealing critical damage to four-legged and other animal-like monsters.</p>
<p>『!?』</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze, as well as all the monsters running ahead of the pack in Shin’s general direction, turned towards him. They were still too far to be able to see him.</p>
<p>Even if they couldn’t see him, they all headed in the same direction.</p>
<p>The reason was naturally Shin’s 『Hunter Fang』.</p>
<p>Weapons that caused critical damage to specific monsters had a particular characteristic: the more their critical damage ability was honed, the more attention — in game terms, “aggro” — they attracted from that category of monsters.</p>
<p>According to Yuzuha, the weapon itself emitted killing intent.</p>
<p>Thanks to the information they had about the incoming monsters, Shin could reinforce his specialized weapons to deal critical damage in advance.</p>
<p>『Hunter Fang』 and the other specialized weapons in Shin’s item box were now even more lethal than they were in the game era.</p>
<p>Their boosted ability also caused them to attract more aggro than before.</p>
<p>Unfazed by the increased attention, Shin prepared 『Hunter Fang』 to attack.</p>
<p>He pointed the sword’s tip towards Heltoros Garze and thrust it straight. The monster was still too far for the sword to reach, but 『Hunter Fang』 filled the distance with a beam of light.</p>
<p>“Hmm, guess it can dodge this much.”</p>
<p>Because of the distance between them, Shin had to perform the skill much faster than normal to be able to hit Heltoros Garze with it. Even so, Heltoros Garze moved away from the beam’s trajectory. Its movements showed that it would take much more to successfully land a hit.</p>
<p>What Shin had shot through 『Hunter Fang』 was a long-range attack via the Katana-type Martial skill 【Katana Strike】.</p>
<p>The skill was used to turn a thrust attack to long-range: its range was very narrow, but it was difficult to see, so it could be used as a sniping attack.</p>
<p>Not only slashing weapons, but all kinds of weapons had common skills with similar names and the same type of effects.</p>
<p>After dodging Shin’s 【Katana Strike】, Heltoros Garze detected the source of the attack and turned exactly in Shin’s direction.</p>
<p>Only Shin and Filma were going in Heltoros Garze’s direction: based on the attack’s origin, it was probably not difficult to tell that it had come from Shin.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze was rushing towards Shin, baring its fangs. A few seconds later, however, its movements changed unexpectedly.</p>
<p>It stopped dead in its tracks, still staring in Shin’s direction. They were now close enough for the beast to be able to see him.</p>
<p>“What? They stopped?”</p>
<p>Not only Heltoros Garze, but most of the monsters following its lead stopped as well.</p>
<p>The monsters scorched by fire traps, the ones with parts of their body frozen, the ones pierced by earth spears — they all looked at Shin and Shin only.</p>
<p>Even the monsters too far to be able to see him did. Shin could tell that all eyes in this area, except his allies, were fixed on him.</p>
<p>“Hey Shin…did specialized weapons always attract so much aggro?”</p>
<p>“It feels different from that, though. Besides, even the monsters outside the aggro’s range stopped. What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>Until seconds ago, the battlefield was filled with monster roars, growls, screams in pain, loud explosions, and the high-pitched sounds of the activation of freezing traps. Now, however, nothing but silence remained. The dust and smoke raised by the explosions slowly drifted away in the wind.</p>
<p>Even Filma, sword in hand, eager to fight, was puzzled by the monsters’ reaction. Her voice showed it too.</p>
<p>It was the same for Shin: there was the fact of 『Hunter Fang』’s aggro range, but also because he did not use any skills to focus aggro on himself.</p>
<p>He had never seen monsters react in the way Heltoros Garze and the other monsters did. It was like the whole pack could see what Heltoros Garze saw.</p>
<p>『————』</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze’s mouths moved. Shin was watching it with special attention, since it was the leader of the pack, so he noticed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just growling. It wasn’t just opening and closing its jaws. Its mouths were moving unnaturally, as if a monster was articulating actual words.</p>
<p>『AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!!』</p>
<p>A few empty minutes passed. Before Shin could decide whether to go closer to see what was going on or to use the chance to attack, Heltoros Garze moved.</p>
<p>A loud roar echoed throughout the silent battlefield.</p>
<p>“(It said, ‘FOUND!’.)”</p>
<p>Yuzuha sent a Mind Chat. Heltoros Garze was relatively close to her in terms of species, so she could understand the beast’s roar.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 4</p>
<p>“Found? Do they mean Shin?”</p>
<p>“I think so, judging from how they’re staring a hole in me. It can’t be just this sword.”</p>
<p>Shin answered Filma’s question while glancing at 『Hunter Fang』 in his right hand.</p>
<p>Specialized weapons, regardless of ability or critical damage ratio, were not especially rare items.</p>
<p>Even if it was extremely dangerous for Heltoros Garze and the other monsters, Shin was sure that they wouldn’t react to it by saying something like “Found”.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s say they’re giving us time to do some stretching before the real thing!”</p>
<p>A magic circle appeared on the ground around Shin. He didn’t just stand there watching the monsters and talking: he had prepared a magic spell for the monsters other than Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>The reason why he used a magic circle for the spell, despite the fact that Shin could cast powerful magic without chanting, was that pouring more MP allowed the spell to continue even after Shin left the magic circle.</p>
<p>The spell created a small automatic cannon.</p>
<p>“Okay then, regardless of how the monsters might have acted unusually just now, what we have to do doesn’t change.”</p>
<p>While Shin finished setting up the magic circle, Filma leaped in Heltoros Garze’s direction.</p>
<p>The high-speed movement provided by her armor’s magic power expulsion made it look like she was flying.</p>
<p>If too much time passed they would get surrounded by the monsters, but thanks to her mobility she could break through any time.</p>
<p>For the first attack, Filma wrapped her 『Scarlet Moon』 in flames and charged from the front.</p>
<p>Her opponent was an advanced high-level monster, however: no matter how much mobility she had, if it could see the path of her blade, there was no way for her to get a clean hit.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze crouched and easily avoided the slash searing the air.</p>
<p>Filma’s『Scarlet Moon』was upgraded by Shin into newer version. The beast probably understood that it would be dangerous to block it.</p>
<p>“You won’t play with me?”</p>
<p>Filma, her momentum boosted by the magic power expulsion, and Heltoros Garze crossed each other.</p>
<p>Filma experienced the recoil of drawing 『Scarlet Moon』, her own weight, and the acceleration by magic power expulsion. As Filma did not have sub-weapons equipped, she could only perform additional attacks via magic in such a situation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear if Heltoros Garze was aware of this or not, but it was clearly not paying attention to her.</p>
<p>It underestimated her.</p>
<p>Because after『Scarlet Moon』sliced through the air above the monster, she attacked again from above the monster’s head, and it couldn’t completely dodge the blade this time.</p>
<p>“Animal instincts, huh?”</p>
<p>So Filma whispered to herself while chasing down Heltoros Garze. Even if wounded, the monster did not stop running.</p>
<p>She had swung 『Scarlet Moon』 aiming to crush the beast’s left head, but Heltoros Garze twisted its body out of the way at the last second.</p>
<p>It couldn’t dodge completely, however: the blade, glowing in an emerald light different from the flames of the first slash, left a large gash on Heltoros Garze’s back.</p>
<p>“If you keep ignoring me like that you’ll wound my pride.”</p>
<p>The cut was by no means light, so it would be normal for Filma to draw aggro because of it.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze, however, did not stop one second. Moreover, it didn’t even spare a glance at Filma. It looked like it escaped her attacks and what could have proven fatal too.</p>
<p>“(Was that roar from before a special skill?)”</p>
<p>“(I don’t see any particular buffs or special status, though.)”</p>
<p>Shin replied to Filma’s Mind Chat, then prepared his 『Hunter Fang』 to strike Heltoros Garze.</p>
<p>Monsters facing a specialized weapon normally acted wary of its dangers, but there was nothing of the sort this time.</p>
<p>“(It seems to me that it’s not like it won’t bother to look at me, but that it can’t. It reacts a little if I’m in its field of vision, but then it just gives me the bare minimum instinctive reaction!)”</p>
<p>Filma did not let go: she attacked Heltoros Garze again while the latter kept running towards Shin.</p>
<p>Chains of light extended from the tip of her sword towards the monster.</p>
<p>It was 【Arc Bind】, one of the most powerful restricting-type skills.</p>
<p>Even if Heltoros Garze was over level 800, it would be forced to stop if hit by such a skill.</p>
<p>The skill’s chains were very sturdy and difficult to break. The best option available was to dodge them.</p>
<p>The chains spread widely to eliminate any possible escape route for Heltoros Garze. Before it could be completely surrounded, however, the monster leaped in the air.</p>
<p>“As expected.”</p>
<p>So said Filma, waiting in the spot Heltoros Garze was leaping to, her 『Scarlet Moon』 ready to strike.</p>
<p>Since Heltoros Garze seemed hell-bent on pushing forward, she expected it would jump that way and prepared for it.</p>
<p>Golden flames danced around 『Scarlet Moon』’s blade. Filma leaped in the air and spun once: the flames released by her sword made her look like a phoenix with golden wings.</p>

<p>Triple combination skill 【Regal Blade of the Soaring Phoenix】.</p>
<p>It was one of the ultimate “Shiden” skills of sword arts, combining sword arts, flame magic, and light magic.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze had no way to move in midair. As a final struggle, it tried smashing the golden blade descending diagonally from the right with its left head’s jaws, but the blade crushed its fangs and proceeded to slice through the beast’s torso.</p>
<p>The skill didn’t stop there, however.</p>
<p>Filma spun once more, adding centrifugal force to 『Scarlet Moon』 and swinging it again upwards.</p>
<p>Heltoros Garze’s right head was severed and finally, the monster stopped moving.</p>
<p>Two slashes in midair from a position higher than the opponent. That was the basic form of 【Regal Blade of the Soaring Phoenix】.</p>
<p>For the monster pack, however, losing their leader was not the last of their misfortunes.</p>
<p>【Regal Blade of the Soaring Phoenix】 concentrated energy in the blade and unleashed powerful slashes on the enemy. The stronger the enemy, the more energy was consumed.</p>
<p>The power Filma infused in 【Regal Blade of the Soaring Phoenix】 could not be spent simply by performing the two basic slashes.</p>
<p>Because of her higher stats and the weapon’s upgrades, the skill ended up being more powerful than she expected.</p>
<p>The golden slashes that severed Heltoros Garze’s body, still burning with energy, flew towards the monsters in the back.</p>
<p>After landing, the slashes scattered golden sparks in a ripple fashion.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful view, but any monster that touched the sparks turned to cinders in mere instants. Even the tiniest spark could incinerate large monsters in no time.</p>
<p>From the monsters’ standpoint, it was like a wall of unbearably hot flames was approaching. Any normal monster would have fled at the sight.</p>
<p>“The skill’s power went up, perhaps too much. It’s useful now, but I have to adjust a bit more.”</p>
<p>Lack of control of a skill’s power could be dangerous during training. However, this could be a good chance for Filma to test it out.</p>
<p>“Anyway, not only do they not stop, but they don’t even hesitate a little.”</p>
<p>Before gravity forced her on the ground again, Filma looked down at the monsters.</p>
<p>They kept running as if they couldn’t even see the golden sparks, charging headlong into the fire. The grotesque sight sullen her expression.</p>
<p>Filma eventually landed and readied her 『Scarlet Moon』 again. Even if the leader of the pack, Heltoros Garze, was gone, the monsters’ advance did not stop.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the situation was to defeat every single monster.</p>
<p>A small distance away from her, a fireball struck the ground.</p>
<p>Despite its moderate 50 cemel size, the fireball caused a massive explosion that rocked the ground all around it. Shin’s magic circle had started its barrage.</p>
<p>He did not shoot only fireballs.</p>
<p>Thunderballs that rained lightning bolts all around them. Ice balls that froze the ground and all monsters in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Wind balls that scattered transparent blades of wind everywhere. The magic circle shot spheres of various magic elements.</p>
<p>After a little while, a blue and white sphere, clearly charged with much more magic power than the others, landed in a spot with higher monster density. This sphere was shot by Shin himself.</p>
<p>Once it hit the monster cluster, the ground under them froze. The freezing effect upon impact was the same as the ice balls, but the differences were its range and that the frozen monsters shattered even if nothing hit them.</p>
<p>The area where the sphere landed was filled with tiny fragments of shattered monsters, much like diamond dust.</p>
<p>“There’s still too many.”</p>
<p>They had already defeated more than a hundred, but the horde of incoming monsters had no end in sight.</p>
<p>“Do you think that the other packs will come this way if I stay here?”</p>
<p>“It’s easier to protect others like that, but I wonder if something convenient like that will really happen…?”</p>
<p>Did the bizarre focus on Shin affect only Heltoros’ pack, or also the other packs roaming the continent? It was too early to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>Shin tried contacting Shibaid and the others about it, while swinging his sword and casting spells, when it happened.</p>
<p>Shin’s instincts told him that an attack was coming. He turned around and his whole field of view was submerged in white light. He had no time to evade.</p>
<p>“Woooohhh!?!”</p>
<p>He reacted with surprise but activated a skill at the same time. His body moved before his mind did: Shin waved his left palm in the attack’s direction, in a backhand-like fashion.</p>
<p>His palm was infinitely smaller than the approaching beam of light, which was large enough to engulf his whole body.</p>
<p>The skill had been activated in the spur of the moment, but its user was Shin nonetheless. The magic power concentrated in his palm was incommensurable.</p>
<p>The white light and the fist clashed.</p>
<p>The beam annihilated any monsters in the vicinity, without losing any of its power, but Shin’s fist did not fall. On the contrary, the white light was deflected away and scattered before it could strike, as if it had crashed against a transparent wall.</p>
<p>The white light deviated to the left and right around Shin: some sparks fell on his feet, but his reinforced defensive gear was unscathed.</p>
<p>Despite the attack dissolving around him, Shin did not even feel any heat: he realized that even if he was hit his armor would have protected him fully and felt relieved.</p>
<p>Even if he knew on paper that the attack wouldn’t have affected him dramatically, being targeted like that was still shocking.</p>
<p>“Shin!?”</p>
<p>Filma was surprised to see Shin suddenly attacked by the beam of light. She was so focused on the many monsters around them that she didn’t notice the incoming attack.</p>
<p>“I’m all right!”</p>
<p>Shin barely managed to catch Filma’s shout while he was parrying the beam and shouted back at her not to worry.</p>
<p>The beam of light continued for about five seconds: after three seconds it started growing thinner and in the end had little to no offensive power.</p>
<p>“What the heck was that?”</p>
<p>After the beam died out, the surviving monsters started attacking again: while fighting against them, Shin looked in the direction of the source of the beam.</p>
<p>The white light annihilated any monsters and carved the ground in its wake. The spots where the light was deflected to or scattered were in a similar state.</p>
<p>The attack came from the direction of Selcikeus and the insect monsters pack. Just when a certain possibility crossed his mind, a flood of voices hit him.</p>
<p>“(HEY SHIN!! CAN YOU HEAR ME!? SHIN!!)”</p>
<p>“Whoa!!”</p>
<p>A voice by Mind Chat would not hurt the ears even if it was loud, but the loud volume of the call took Shin by surprise. Because of that, he swung 『Fang Hunter』 so hard that he carved through a monster and the ground.</p>
<p>“(I can hear you Sety, no need to shout. What’s wrong?)”</p>
<p>“(Ah, you’re okay! Shibaid, Shin replied!)”</p>
<p>Shin’s response caused a reaction he found almost exaggerated,</p>
<p>The situation seemed to be frenetic: they were speaking normally, but he could hear the conversation via Mind Chat. Shin thought that Shibaid might have been trying to call him too.</p>
<p>He seemed to recall hearing a voice while he was blocking the beam attack.</p>
<p>He was fully focused on deflecting the beam of white light, so he couldn’t hear the voice clearly over the noise of the ground being carved and the monsters’ wailing.</p>
<p>“(You weren’t responding, so I felt a chill down my spine.)”</p>
<p>“(I was probably defending against an attack right at that time. Sorry Shibaid, I didn’t notice.)”</p>
<p>“(No, we didn’t expect it to target you either. The monsters suddenly stopped, so we were looking closely to see what happened when all of a sudden again the beam of light shot in a direction different than their course. We haven’t engaged them yet, so my shield skills didn’t reach it. I’m sorry.)”</p>
<p>“(The monsters here too started targeting me all of a sudden, and we don’t know why. Anyway we’re fine, so don’t worry about us.)”</p>
<p>Since Selcikeus used the other monsters as a barrier, Shibaid and Sety hadn’t actually seen it yet. The beam attack was shot out of the blue too: as soon as they realized it had gone in Shin’s direction, they hurriedly contacted him via Mind Chat.</p>
<p>The distance Selcikeus’ beam covered was higher than the long-range attacks Shin remembered, so it was likely to have evolved to an advanced or mutated form, like Heltoros.</p>
<p>“(By the way, Shibaid, have the monsters on your side changed their course?)”</p>
<p>Shin sent the question while slicing the monsters around him with flying slashes.</p>
<p>If Selcikeus targeted Shin too, the possibility that Heltoros’ roar served to inform the other monsters of Shin’s position was high.</p>
<p>Shin had no idea why the monsters would target him, but it was rather convenient if they didn’t go after anyone else.</p>
<p>Since the cause was still unknown, he told Schnee to stay put but asked Yuzuha to switch from picking off stragglers to fighting all out.</p>
<p>If the monsters’ sole target was Shin, Filma and Yuzuha could attack as they pleased.</p>
<p>“(I can only see the front rows, but yes, they clearly changed course.)”</p>
<p>“(Right. They were heading straight towards us first, but now they’re going in a totally different direction.)”</p>
<p>Shibaid and Sety noticed that the monsters were heading towards the coastal part of the 『End Wall』 gap at first, but now changed to the opposite direction and headed inland.</p>
<p>“They’re coming straight for you, Shin?”</p>
<p>“Seems like it.”</p>
<p>Shin nodded to Filma as they unleashed a wide range flame spell together.</p>
<p>The insect monsters were still too far to know with any certainty, but their behavior and timing made it seem very likely.</p>
<p>“Oh, I just received a message saying that Gelganger’s pack changed course too.”</p>
<p>So said Filma while releasing a flaming slash.</p>
<p>The monsters they were currently fighting were all level 300 on average, so they could afford to fight while talking.</p>
<p>Filma opened the menu window to check the message contents, but her hands did not stay idle as she did. She only needed her eyes to use the menu. It could also be moved according to the user’s head movements, so she didn’t need to look into one specific point.</p>
<p>If the opponent’s level was low enough, they could easily fight while browsing messages, as Filma did.</p>
<p>“That pack is targeting me too, huh?”</p>
<p>“They were going straight from the wall, but suddenly switched to a south-south-east direction. No doubt about it, really.”</p>
<p>It was all too unexpected. Shin too couldn’t help but assume the monsters were targeting him.</p>
<p>It was definitely a better situation than all the monster packs targeting the gap in the wall, but after all the time spent worrying about how to keep casualties to a minimum, it was kind of disheartening to find out that all their planning may not have served much of a purpose.</p>
<p>“Let us put it this way. This situation has just become a lot easier to deal with.”</p>
<p>Yuzuha rejoined Shin and Filma, while raining fireballs and thunderbolts on the monsters. Wide range attacks were her specialty: her eight tails continuously shot spells to whittle down the enemies’ numbers.</p>
<p>She fought in the same way as the Element Tails, the bane of players’ existences in the game. The intimidating aura she projected was difficult to imagine from her small fox form.</p>
<p>“Okay then…if they want me so bad…they’ll have me all right!”</p>
<p>Shin shouted in order to renew his focus in the battle and swung 『Hunter Fang』.</p>
<p>Around him, there were few allies and a massive number of enemies.</p>
<p>Monsters born not in a natural manner, but from the accumulation of magic power. Monsters that would bring chaos and destruction to the continent if left alone.</p>
<p>There was no need for any concern about habitats, territories, power balance, nothing.</p>
<p>The imperial army’s scouts were not posted in the vicinity, so they wouldn’t be dragged into the fighting. There was no need for Shin to limit his powers, nor the risk to be seen by them.</p>
<p>In other words…</p>
<p>He could go on a…</p>
<p>Full-powered.</p>
<p>No holds barred.</p>
<p>Rampage.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 5</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Shibaid was running towards the insect monster pack, but a cold chill running down his spine turned his attention to the area behind him. In the direction, Shin and the others were fighting.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shibaid, do you feel it too? A weird presence…”</p>
<p>“You felt it too?”</p>
<p>Sety, perched on Shibaid’s armored shoulder, apparently felt the same aura. Her expression looked troubled.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an unpleasant-feeling aura, however. Shibaid felt something akin to excitement coming from it.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it’s related to the monsters’ sudden change of course?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I doubt it. We could not hear Heltoros Garze’s howl that Filma talked about, but it was a signal for its monster allies to concentrate their aggro on a specific target. That was what prompted them to change their course, but I think that this sensation we just had is unrelated.”</p>
<p>The chill that ran down their spines came considerably later than the monsters’ change of course. Shibaid pointed out that the timing was too different.</p>
<p>“Something tells me that this sensation is not ominous for us.”</p>
<p>The battlefield’s atmosphere changed. What did make him feel like this? Was it the chill, or something else?</p>
<p>Shibaid himself felt that his senses were sharper than normal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a forced stimulus of battle spirit, like skills such as 【Berserk】 caused. He felt a sort of excitement gradually welling up from inside.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. This feeling…”</p>
<p>Something surfaced in Shibaid’s memory. He actually knew that feeling well.</p>
<p>He had experienced it many times, so he didn’t find it unpleasant.</p>
<p>It was the first time he felt in a long while, so he didn’t recognize it immediately.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t solve it all on your own! Hey, Shibaid…are you smiling?”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it…yes, I just couldn’t.”</p>
<p>Sety pointed out that he was smiling, unlike his normal self, but Shibaid thought it was not important.</p>
<p>Now that he remembered it, he realized it wasn’t anything to worry about. He wondered instead why he had forgotten about it until now.</p>
<p>Shibaid assumed that Sety was going to remember too, soon enough.</p>
<p>It was a sensation that all the support characters who fought alongside Shin knew. Filma, who was fighting close to Shin, surely recalled it already. Shibaid was positive, even if he couldn’t see her.</p>
<p>“You know this sensation too. Try to remember.”</p>
<p>“I do? Hmm…”</p>
<p>The sensation might have been different between close-range and long-range fighters. Sety fell deep in thought.</p>
<p>They were almost in range for her magic spells to reach the monster pack, so Shibaid decided he was going to tell her, but he was interrupted.</p>
<p>A red flash of light shot directly towards the monster pack. Shibaid and Sety were still a considerable distance away, but they could clearly feel its incommensurable heat.</p>
<p>“Aah…yes, now I remember. It’s the feeling when Shin goes all out…”</p>
<p>Part of the monster pack they were approaching was blown away.</p>
<p>After the blast came the sound and wind caused by the explosion. After seeing, hearing, and feeling it, Sety made her realization and expressed it with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Wait a second…was that Full Prominence? At this range!? The offensive power was insane too…!”</p>
<p>Thanks to her specialization in offensive magic, Sety quickly recognized the spell that just caused complete destruction before their eyes.</p>
<p>Flame Magic Single Element Combination Spell 【Full Prominence】.</p>
<p>There were several skills that allowed the user to shoot heat beams, but 【Full Prominence】 had particularly high offense.</p>
<p>The so-called “Skill Combination” system allowed players to combine two or more types of skills to form a different skill.</p>
<p>It was a rather complicated system: at first, players thought they just had to combine any two skills of two different elements. It was also possible, however, to combine skills of the same element.</p>
<p>【Full Prominence】 was a skill born from the combination of two skills of the same element. It was used mainly to open a path in a pack of monsters or to cause confusion in the enemy as a pre-emptive attack.</p>
<p>Magic was usually used from medium to long range, however, this skill did not have particularly long range. Shooting it without protection also meant one would be hit by its aftershocks, so it was considered a sort of suicide bombing skill.</p>
<p>If a short-range skill that caused a wide explosion like 【Full Prominence】 lost its only weakness, its range, what would be the result?</p>
<p>The scorched earth Sety and Shibaid were witnessing was the result.</p>
<p>“We’re not getting hit with one of these…right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Shin would never attack us without reason.”</p>
<p>“I mean, this kind of “going all out” is a lot more than what I remember…”</p>
<p>Sety looked at the monsters vanishing among the flashes and explosions. Many insect monsters were weak to fire, so 【Full Prominence】 not only had great range and power but also a perfect affinity against them.</p>
<p>The monsters, despite the sturdy carapace protecting them, disappeared without a trace. Literally, nothing remained in the blast’s wake: the monsters truly “vanished”.</p>
<p>Overwhelming firepower that burned every last fragment of the monsters to cinders. Some of the insects had to be resistant to fire, but they were swept away the same.</p>
<p>“I guess we’d better target the monsters outside Shin’s range. What should we do about Selcikeus?”</p>
<p>Selcikeus, the monster which had shot a long-range beam attack towards Shin, was still inside the monster barrier it created. Shibaid and Sety were the closest, but still couldn’t actually see it.</p>
<p>【Full Prominence】 was shot sporadically in a wide range, so the monsters protecting Selcikeus hadn’t decreased yet.</p>
<p>“If all the monsters are targeting Shin, we should not stay focused here. Let us go on the offensive.”</p>
<p>Shibaid contacted Shin via Mind Chat, just in case. He could probably tell what they were up to from their movements, but it was faster to send a message.</p>
<p>“Let us go, then. Hold on tight!”</p>
<p>Shibaid started running, Sety on his shoulder. He held his shield, the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』, in front.</p>
<p>Because of their difference in agility, Shibaid was considered slow compared to Shin or Schnee. That, however, did not only depend on his stats.</p>
<p>The greatest difference between Shibaid and the others was the weight of his equipment.</p>
<p>The 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』, the giant halberd 『Placid Moon』, and the full body armor.</p>
<p>There was no great difference in terms of stats with Shin and the others’ equipment, but Shibaid’s gear was much heavier.</p>
<p>Shin’s equipment used metal only in certain parts. Schnee and Sety’s equipment contained little to no metal.</p>
<p>Filma’s equipment was mostly metallic too, but it was reduced wherever possible, so its weight was more or less the same as Shin and the others’. The deceased Girard’s gear belonged to this category too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the strategy of using skills to increase one’s own weight and charge into enemy groups was exclusive to Shibaid.</p>
<p>Skills that increased weight were more effective the greater the user’s base weight.</p>
<p>Shibaid could also use such skills in tandem with skills to increase his own speed and blow away enemies with devastating results.</p>
<p>“NNNUUUOOOHHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>Shibaid roared as he rushed forward.</p>
<p>The monsters would bounce and leap in the air: not because they wanted to, but because the 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』 launched them.</p>
<p>Shibaid charged straight and true towards the core of the monster pack.</p>
<p>At first, he only bumped against the few monsters running ahead of the pack, but once he hit the dense group protecting Selcikeus, the resulting effects were almost comical.</p>
<p>The monsters that were knocked in the air, due to their defense and the angle of collision, could consider themselves lucky.</p>
<p>The ones who faced Shibaid’s shield head-on, instead, popped like water balloons thrown against a concrete wall.</p>
<p>“As terrifying as usual…”</p>
<p>Sety whispered while looking at the monsters blowing up in patches of blood.</p>
<p>They couldn’t see in front at all, but Shibaid had activated detection skills and visual skills such as 【Clairvoyance】 to see the path ahead.</p>
<p>There was no risk of going wrong way or picking a dangerous path.</p>
<p>“Are you so different, though?”</p>
<p>Shibaid’s barrier was only in front, so their sides and rear were wide open.</p>
<p>The sigh accompanying Shibaid’s reply was prompted by the fact that Sety’s magic fully covered those “wide open” spaces.</p>
<p>The monsters prioritized Shin rather than fighting against Shibaid or Sety, so they didn’t even attack them. There was no need to be particularly careful during their offensive.</p>
<p>That didn’t mean that she could sit there doing nothing, however.</p>
<p>The monsters that dodged Shibaid’s charge and those outside his path became targets of Sety’s spells.</p>
<p>She repeatedly cast spells that scattered upon hit, without chanting.</p>
<p>Just like her upgraded movement skills, Sety honed her magic via the unique method she boasted about: her spells had become much more lethal than Shibaid remembered.</p>
<p>The number of elemental bullets she could shoot at once had increased, as well as their piercing capabilities.</p>
<p>One bullet was enough to finish off the lower level monsters and the subsequent explosion carved holes in the surrounding terrain. Higher-level monsters would see their bodies perforated.</p>
<p>The bullets would also retain their original power even after piercing one or two monsters.</p>
<p>Each elemental bullet could knock any monster in its range out of commission, and Sety was shooting a barrage of them, as it was the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Shibaid charged in the monster pack and Sety widened the path he opened. Their destination was Selcikeus.</p>
<p>“Mph! Sety, I’m going to jump a bit!”</p>
<p>Shibaid detected a surge in magic power from Selcikeus’ direction and jumped between the monster’s position and Shin.</p>
<p>The next instant, a beam of white light blasted through the monster barrier. Just like the first time, the white beam burned through the monsters, but this time Shibaid blocked it with his shield and a barrier skill.</p>
<p>The beam was shot upwards, so Shibaid and Sety had to block it in midair, but creating a foothold with 【Flying Shadow】 allowed him to stand firm while repelling it.</p>
<p>Shin had upgraded Shibaid’s 『Great Shell Shield of Collision』 too: its barrier completely blocked the white blast, deflecting it towards the surroundings.</p>
<p>Part of the beam shot upwards through the clouds while the rest scorched the ground and the monsters on it.</p>
<p>“It’s shorter than the first one.”</p>
<p>The white-hot beam lasted for approximately three seconds and was at maximum output for only two.</p>
<p>“It’ll be a pain if it starts shooting more often though. Look, it’s finally in sight.”</p>
<p>The monster barrier was partly cleared, revealing Selcikeus’ silhouette.</p>
<p>— Selcikeus Heim – Level 870</p>
<p>It was an advanced monster, as expected. Shibaid and Sety, even without giving each other a signal, activated the next skill at the same time.</p>
<p>Triple Combination Skill 【Diamond Blast Thurst】.</p>
<p>Flame/Ground Combination Magic Skill 【Flare Comet】.</p>
<p>Shibaid’s platinum white 『Placid Moon』 was thrust in Selcikeus’ mouth, the cannon that fired its long-range beams, and shook the monster’s whole body.</p>
<p>The blade, stabbed deep inside the monster’s mouth, produced a vibration that ruptured its internal organs. That was the effect of 【Diamond Blast Thurst】. As a secondary effect, it limited the target’s movements as well.</p>
<p>Once the target stopped moving, red hot meteors started raining.</p>
<p>Several skills, of different range and power, allowed the user to rain burning boulders or masses of earth on the opponent, but 【Flare Comet】 was famous for having the highest offensive power among them.</p>
<p>The meteors caused a great shock upon impact, so they were especially effective when the target was very large or moved in a pack.</p>
<p>The only weak point was that the meteors created shockwaves that caused damage to anyone, friend or foe, located within range.</p>
<p>Using it at the wrong time would blow away the user too: in a way, it belonged to the same category as 【Full Prominence】.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Sety, however, were unaffected by such a weakness. The shockwaves and heat waves caused by the meteors were neutralized by Shibaid’s shield and barrier, so they did not suffer any damage.</p>
<p>“Hehehe, how about it?”</p>
<p>“You definitely overdid it.”</p>
<p>After stopping Selcikeus in its tracks, 『Placid Moon』 automatically returned in Shibaid’s hands. With his weapon retrieved, the Dragnil shrugged and shook his head.</p>
<p>Sety had taken advantage of the situation to cast a *barrage* of 【Flare Comet】 spells.</p>
<p>After the meteor storm subsided and the debris cleared, Selcikeus Heim was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>There was no trace of the parts that made up its body. It was an “overkill” through and through.</p>
<p>Insect-type monsters were known to be tough to kill, that was true, but this was definitely too much.</p>
<p>“Shin upgraded my 『Flower Moon』, so it’s more powerful than before. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have been able to take it down so fast.”</p>
<p>Sety knew her abilities full well, so she protested that the destruction caused by the meteors was not solely her fault.</p>
<p>“But even after doing all this, there are still monsters left.”</p>
<p>So Sety continued while looking at the mayhem she caused.</p>
<p>【Flare Comet】 and its aftershocks had opened a gaping hole in the monster pack.</p>
<p>Even that hole, however, did not take long to get filled. The monsters’ numbers were that large.</p>
<p>“I tried using a skill to draw their attention, but it doesn’t seem to be working. I guess we’ll have to penetrate the pack and go wild from there.”</p>
<p>“My specialty, right?”</p>
<p>“Indeed it is.”</p>
<p>Any monsters they failed to take down would head towards Shin, so Shibaid and Sety focused on eradicating every last one.</p>
<p>Shibaid readied his 『Great Shield of Collision』 and 『Placid Moon』 again to charge into the monster horde, while Sety swung her 『Flower Moon』 from his shoulder to cast wide range spells.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Chapter 3 Part 6</p>
<p>While Sety and Shibaid started their rampage, Shin was going all out as well.</p>
<p>A rainbow of magic elements shone in the land dominated by monsters. The magic power changed color according to the caster’s will and turned into physical phenomena that attacked the monsters.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The red light turned into flames that burned everything to cinders.</p>
<p>The blue light turned into chilling air that froze solid anything they touched.</p>
<p>The brown light turned into massive rocks that crushed everything in their path.</p>
<p>The green light turned into blades of wind that ripped through everything.</p>
<p>The yellow light turned into thunderbolts that pierced everything.</p>
<p>The white light flashed in the blink of an eye, melting anything it touched.</p>
<p>The black light spread instantly and silently, corrupting everything it came in contact with.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To use seven elements of magic at the same time was the complete form of a secret technique for users specialized in offensive magic.</p>
<p>Shin was not a magic focused player, but his stats and skills allowed him to perform the same techniques.</p>
<p>He basically looked like a human magic-casting cannon, casting spells to exterminate monsters all around. Many of the players that saw him in action protested that he looked like he was in a category all of his own.</p>
<p>Behind Shin, Yuzuha used her nearly complete Element Tail powers to cast the magic of all elements in a similar way to Shin. Any monsters lucky enough to escape the double magic barrage were sliced in two by Filma.</p>
<p>The trio had settled on a fighting strategy based on the fact that the monsters kept targeting only Shin.</p>
<p>Their strategy had overwhelming offensive power, but there was still one issue it could not solve: their natural MP recovery could not catch up with their MP consumption.</p>
<p>Even though there were skills and abilities that allowed the user to absorb MP from defeated foes, if their attacks were too effective, the user would still be unable to cast spells or use skill endlessly.</p>
<p>In such a situation, having enough tanks meant being able to defeat more monsters.</p>
<p>The effects of such MP absorption skills were thus severely limited, to prevent the defeat enemy -&gt; absorb MP -&gt; defeat enemy endless loop.</p>
<p>The limit was only on the amount of MP that could be absorbed from a single enemy, however.</p>
<p>In the game, a situation like the present one — a very small party against monsters as far as the eyes could see — never happened. No matter how bad the MP absorption ratio was, if a single skill could defeat several monsters at the same time, the MP recovery ratio became quite high.</p>
<p>Additionally , Shin had a wide collection of MP recovery items at his disposal.</p>
<p>He was regularly using such items now, so his actual MP consumption ratio was about ten percent of what a typical “human magic cannon” style user would consume.</p>
<p>His maximum MP had broken the upper limit in the first place, so he was in no danger of running out.</p>
<p>“The last time you and the other Rokuten members did this, they laughed at you guys and said you were playing a different game, right? Haha!”</p>
<p>They had used this strategy during a town invasion event, only for other players to say “We’re playing a MMORPG, but those guys are playing a bullet hell game!!”</p>
<p>They endlessly consumed items and annihilated any monster that came close, causing other players to look at them speechlessly. In the end, they used up so many items that they were completely in the red, but for them, it was a very fun strategy.</p>
<p>“(Looks like we’re about done with the animal types. Are you tired, you two?)”</p>
<p>“(Nah, I’m fine, I still have plenty of items left too.)”</p>
<p>“(This much is nothing.)”</p>
<p>Shin used Mind Chat, since the explosions and the monsters’ growls would make it hard to speak normally. Even while talking, they continued moving to take down as many monsters as possible.</p>
<p>Magic users that acted as human magic cannons did not move around normally.</p>
<p>They were fully focused on using healing items, checking the cooldown time of their spells, and choosing which spell to cast next and when, so normally they couldn’t afford moving too.</p>
<p>In this world, however, there was little to no cooldown for casting spells.</p>
<p>Shin only experienced something like that for large scale spells such as 【Blue Judgement】, but most other spells could be fired in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Thanks to that he didn’t have to think about how to combine various spells and could take advantage of his innately high mobility.</p>
<p>Shin unleashed a barrage of magic spells while moving because he realized that among all monsters that gathered towards him, a small number of them went in the opposite direction sometimes.</p>
<p>If he continued moving while attracting their attention, he could be less worried about monsters straying from the pack.</p>
<p>For added safety, Shin contacted Milt and told her to continue setting the walls that could be activated independently.</p>
<p>It would help fill the gap in the wall, in case the monsters changed their target. At present, all monsters that strayed from the pack were dealt with by Schnee.</p>
<p>“If only I could figure out the conditions for using large scale magic again…”</p>
<p>Shin mumbled to himself while picking the spell with a wider range among the list of magic he had become able to use again. At the moment, he could use one large scale spell every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Two hours had passed since he had started going all out.</p>
<p>Shin asked about Yuzuha and Filma’s condition at this time because he finally saw an end to the horde of monsters, previously stretching beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>The other reason was that Gelganger’s pack of shapeshifting monsters was drawing closer.</p>
<p>Shibaid and Sety were decimating the insect monster pack, so it would still take time to reach Shin’s position.</p>
<p>As a result, Shin’s group focused their attention on the shapeshifter monster pack, as it was still unscathed.</p>
<p>“(…looks like they arrived.)”</p>
<p>After a while, the shapeshifter monsters reached the rear end of the animal monsters pack.</p>
<p>They were too far for Shin and the others to see, but the map, which had gradually become transparent after the animal monsters decreased, colored itself red again.</p>
<p>There were too many monster icons to be able to locate Gelganger.</p>
<p>“(Let’s continue the magic barrage for a while. Once the shapeshifting monsters become visible, we’ll leave this place for a while and review the current situation.)”</p>
<p>There was little doubt that Gelganger had also evolved to an advanced or mutated form.</p>
<p>Shin didn’t know what attacks it was going to use, so he sent this message to Filma and Yuzuha.</p>
<p>The scouts reported that Gelganger was advancing ahead of the pack, so Shin thought that it would be easy to spot. Heltoros Garze also marched ahead of the pack and targeted Shin before all the other monsters it led.</p>
<p>Contrary to Shin’s predictions, however, something changed on the map. The icons belonging to the shapeshifter monsters changed from the hostile red to the neutral green.</p>
<p>“ —they’re fighting against the animal monsters?”</p>
<p>The change was not only in the color of the icons.</p>
<p>As the animal monsters gradually decreased, the shapeshifter monsters became visible.</p>
<p>Some pierced the animal monsters with the tentacles stretching from their bodies, others tackled them and absorbed them within their bodies.</p>
<p>“(They’re not on the same side…I guess? Selcikeus’ long-range attack was kind of similar too…)”</p>
<p>“(It damaged the monsters in its own pack too, after all. I don’t know if we can say it’s the same thing.)”</p>
<p>Selcikeus Heim’s beam attack did damage the animal monsters in its path, but it also did the same to any insect monsters in its trajectory too.</p>
<p>According to Shibaid, the insect monster icons were still red, so Shin thought that only the shapeshifter monsters were acting in a different way.</p>
<p>While they talked, the number of animal monsters continued to decrease.</p>
<p>They were essentially pincered between Shin’s group and the shapeshifters.</p>
<p>The shapeshifter monsters could absorb the animal monsters in their bodies, so their corpses were not obstacles in their path.</p>
<p>The animal monsters were overwhelmed just like pebbles sinking among sea waves.</p>
<p>“…they’re not attacking us.”</p>
<p>“The icons are still colored neutral too.”</p>
<p>“I cannot feel any hostility.”</p>
<p>Shin’s group decided to gather to wait for the monsters’ next move.</p>
<p>The shapeshifter monsters stayed out of Shin’s “human magic cannon” spells.</p>
<p>If he shot another 【Full Prominence】, as he previously did against the insect monsters Shibaid and Sety were occupied with, he could reach them, but as the shapeshifters weren’t attacking yet, he wasn’t sure it was a good idea to make the first move.</p>
<p>Shin and the others were wondering what to do when Shibaid messaged him. The shapeshifters apparently attacked the insect monsters too.</p>
<p>Once it had been verified that the monsters were targeting just Shin, they had the imperial scouts take shelter behind the wall.</p>
<p>Shin’s party would have been contacted immediately if the monsters showed signs of targeting the hole in the wall again.</p>
<p>No one had continued tracking the shapeshifter monsters’ pack, so they didn’t know that it had split into two.</p>
<p>Because of the large size of the pack, however, even if it was observed from up close it would be difficult to tell what was going on at the other end.</p>
<p>“Gelganger…is there too.”</p>
<p>Its size overshadowed the other shapeshifters. The half-transparent, light-purple jelly-like monster was Gelganger.</p>
<p>Its appearance did not show any particular signs of mutation.</p>
<p>— Gelganger Yvr – Level 876</p>
<p>However, 【Analyze】 could reveal its new identity.</p>
<p>Its appearance might look the same, but it had evolved, just like the other two pack leaders.</p>
<p>Gelganger Yvr probably noticed Shin’s gaze, as it moved forward.</p>
<p>Gelganger Yvr alone approached Shin’s group, alone.</p>
<p>It was already in range of their magic. If Shin wanted, he could attack it anytime.</p>
<p>“(Should we attack?)”</p>
<p>“(No, wait a moment. I’ll go ahead first. It’s acting differently than the others, but based on Heltoros’ howl and all the monsters changing direction, they must have some business with me.)”</p>
<p>Shin walked forward, leaving Filma and Yuzuha behind. After a while, Shin too entered Gelganger Yvr’s attack range.</p>
<p>The monster stopped moving, so Shin did so too.</p>
<p>For a while, the two looked at each other silently.</p>
<p>The first one to move was Gelganger.</p>
<p>The surface of his body trembled and its shape changed. Its massive body became smaller and smaller, eventually assuming a human silhouette.</p>
<p>After a while, Gelganger Yvr was replaced by an old gentleman with a shining monocle, silver hair slicked back, and a black swallow-tailed coat</p>
<p>『Pleased to make your acquaintance. I have come to meet Lord Shin as per my master’s orders.』</p>
<p>The old gentleman formerly-known as Gelganger Yvr then exhibited an impeccable bow.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vol. 17 Side Story Part 1</p>
<p>After being freed from the demons’ control and fighting alongside Shin to defeat Scoruas and Adara, Milt started living with the church.</p>
<p>The assault on the Summit Faction had succeeded thanks to her ability in battle, earning her a degree of credibility from the knights of the church.</p>
<p>In order to atone for the guilt of participating in the kidnapping of the Holy Woman, Milt’s next goal was to earn the trust of those who worked for the church but not through her skills on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“So, why should I dress like that?”</p>
<p>Milt asked the female elf next to her, while looking at the robe supplied to her. The elf was Lilishila, a priestess who helped Shin during the Holy Woman rescue mission.</p>
<p>“Miss Milt, you will be helping the church’s activities for the community. I understand that you have not become a believer, but we will attract unwanted attention if you participate in our sisters’ and apprentices’ services with an outfit different from them. We live every day upholding our faith above all else, but even so, sometimes malicious thoughts are born even in our hearts. Frankly, I do not know how effective this measure will be, though.”</p>
<p>Few people were aware of Milt’s reasons for helping the church’s activities, but there was always a chance the information could leak. Lilishila concluded by saying that the less attention she attracted, the better.</p>
<p>There were some in the church who, while they were aware of Milt’s exploits in battle, doubted she would act properly in other situations.</p>
<p>“We are indebted to Lord Shin and his companions in many ways. They say that you are not a bad person, so please do not betray their trust. Am I clear?”</p>
<p>“Egh….yes.”</p>
<p>Milt couldn’t refuse if Lilishila explained it that way. She didn’t want to imagine what would have happened if her mind control wasn’t broken.</p>
<p>To suffer defeat after fighting head-on with a strong warrior was perfectly acceptable, but to be manipulated and bent to someone’s will was the worst possible situation for Milt.</p>
<p>“Well, what kind of work should I help with?”</p>
<p>“Chores such as cleaning the sanctuary and preparing meals for our believers and workers, personal training, and various other things. Normally we would assign you a sister as an instructor, but considering your circumstances, you will have to learn the basics by yourself.”</p>
<p>“W-well, that’s a mouthful…”</p>
<p>The list of jobs assigned to the sisters seemed to be endless, so Milt started wondering if they were all Chosen Ones. Since Lilishila also mentioned training, it was clear that they did not only do community service.</p>
<p>“Why do sisters train too? They don’t go into battle, do they?”</p>
<p>Milt looked at the sisters they saw in passing while they went to Lilishila’s room. It didn’t look like they had any skills useful in battle.</p>
<p>“Sisters mainly learn healing arts. Once they become skilled enough, they are sent to churches across the continent. In some places, healing potions are a rare commodity, so they learn the skills necessary to help as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>Some sisters aimed to become church knights, so they also learned battle arts and underwent training for actual fighting.</p>
<p>“Miss Milt, you will join the church knight apprentices for training. Even in the church, there are few people with your level of battle prowess, so I am sure you will be an excellent stimulus for them.”</p>
<p>“It feels like the more you explain, the more my workload increases…”</p>
<p>Milt couldn’t help but think that it would have been so much easier to fight monsters or Summit Faction members with the other church knights.</p>
<p>“This concludes my explanation. If you don’t have any questions, I would like you to start right away.”</p>
<p>“Oh, excuse me, it’s not an actual question, but can I ask just one thing?”</p>
<p>Lilishila seemed puzzled by Milt’s choice of words, and the latter continued while pinching her robe.</p>
<p>“It’s too tight on the chest area, could I have a larger size?”</p>
<p>“…we will have to order a special size for you.”</p>
<p>Lilishila looked at the tight robe, which seemed ready to burst at any moment, with a tense expression.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>Milt had been fighting monsters day in, day out for a long time, so life in the church was a whole new experience.</p>
<p>Things didn’t go too well in the beginning, but thanks to her high stats and her efforts, she became able to handle three sisters’ share of work by herself every day.</p>
<p>One day, Milt was told by Lilishila to come to the training grounds, having recalled being told that training was part of her job too.</p>
<p>The church had a large number of believers and many people visited it every day. Milt first took the chores lightly but was surprised by how many things there were to do.</p>
<p>“I was so busy that I completely forgot about training, I tell you.”</p>
<p>“Normally, training begins at a later stage. It would take a toll on the body if one isn’t used to the lifestyle here, but you have more energy than the average apprentice, Miss Milt. Please mind your speech, though.”</p>
<p>For a woman to have physical skills surpassing men was one of the advantages of being a Chosen One. Though there still were people to be respected even if you were stronger than them physically.</p>
<p>In Milt’s case, that person was Lilishila.</p>
<p>“I will be more careful. By the way, I don’t have to wear the usual robe, do I?”</p>
<p>Milt was wearing her 『Oriental Battle Garb』 and the rest of her usual equipment.</p>
<p>Milt was told her opponent was a knight chosen among the civilians. They were going to train for battle, but if she wore Legendary-grade gear it wouldn’t be much of a training session for them.</p>
<p>“You will fight against one of the church’s Chosen Ones; to show the soldiers how strong a Chosen One can be is also part of our job. Please do control your strength carefully.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, I see, so I have to play the monster role.”</p>
<p>No matter how much one might read and hear about something, there were many things that could be truly understood only by witnessing them directly.</p>
<p>The danger and strength of a high-level monster were taught by using a Chosen One with powers on the same level.</p>
<p>The training grounds were the same as Milt remembered when Shin showed them to her.</p>
<p>Lilishila and Milt used teleportation to go to an underground facility of the training area. It was a room surrounded by solid walls, so those who didn’t belong to the guild could also use it.</p>
<p>There were about 50 people in the training area, all wearing similar equipment. The only differences probably depended on their various specialties.</p>
<p>Armored knights had maces and large shields, so they were easy to tell.</p>
<p>The other soldiers had similar armor but different weapons: bow and arrow, greatswords, spear, etc. Their roles were clearly expressed.</p>
<p>All soldiers present looked at Lilishila and Milt when they entered. Most of them seemed to wonder why a child had been brought to the grounds, however.</p>
<p>They looked puzzled probably because they had talked to her before or at least noticed her doing chores with the other sisters.</p>
<p>Milt couldn’t help but notice something, however.</p>
<p>Regardless of the emotions projected towards her, many of the gazes were pointed not at her face, but lower than that.</p>
<p>It was likely because most of the soldiers on the grounds were male.</p>
<p>The robe she usually wore had been made especially for Milt, so it kept her physical features hidden.</p>
<p>Instead, the 『Oriental Battle Garb』 showed her physical assets clearly, so even the knights that were already familiar with her to a degree couldn’t help but look.</p>
<p>“I see some of you know Miss Milt already. She will be your virtual enemy today. She is a very powerful Chosen One, so do not underestimate her because of her looks.”</p>
<p>Many of the knights were surprised by Lilishila’s words. Some of those who weren’t probably perceived Milt’s strength already.</p>
<p>“The rest is up to you, Miss Milt.”</p>
<p>Milt nodded and materialized her 『Breogand』.</p>
<p>Again, the knights were shocked by the sudden appearance of the giant weapon. It was longer than Milt was tall, after all.</p>
<p>Milt lightly spun 『Breogand』 to signal the knight in charge of supervising the training that she was ready to go. The knight replied that she could start whenever she wanted, so Milt’s lips curved into a feral smile.</p>
<p>The knights’ opponent was a creature much more powerful than them, an enemy they couldn’t afford taking their eyes off for one second. She was going to pound this teaching into their bodies.</p>

<p>Vol. 17 Side Story Part 2</p>
<p>Approximately one month after she started working for the church, Milt’s name was already well known.</p>
<p>Having a bright personality, talkative and easygoing with anyone, and with a lovely appearance, Milt topped it off with high combat prowess as a Chosen One.</p>
<p>Lilishila had done what she could to keep Milt from attracting much attention, but as she had previously said, it would be only a matter of time.</p>
<p>That day too, what had become an everyday occurrence was happening at the entrance of the church.</p>
<p>“Look, Miss Milt! I have dispatched this Wild Boar myself! It is much larger than normal, is it not!? Please, enjoy it with the other good folks of the church!”</p>
<p>“Ehm…”</p>
<p>“Honestly, that thing is just getting in the way of traffic. On the other hand, the Core Frog I dispatched offers a great variety of gemstones! I shall have them crafted into an accessory for you, Miss Milt!”</p>
<p>“Please, never mind me…”</p>
<p>Some were attracted by her beauty, others enticed by her strength: many men started gathering in front of the church, hoping to woo her.</p>
<p>As the rumors spread, the sight of adventurers, knights, and other men flaunting their qualities could be seen all over.</p>
<p>For the men of this world, strength was one of the points of appeal easier to show.</p>
<p>Both the knights and sisters of the church were free to engage in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Milt, however, was still an apprentice on paper. She was not full-fledged yet and the men who came to court her did so in public: their antics were nothing but an annoyance to her.</p>
<p>Milt was the target of jealousy at first, but her solicitors became so many and so straightforward that the jealousy turned into pity.</p>
<p>“Hahaha…”</p>
<p>Milt faked a smile to dodge the men’s advances and quickly went to the sisters’ cafeteria. There she sighed deeply as she chewed on a piece of bread.</p>
<p>“You had it rough today too…”</p>
<p>Next to her sat one of the sister apprentices that worked alongside Milt since the first cleaning activities. She was not a Chosen One, but the church accepted anyone as an apprentice, regardless of their status.</p>
<p>Milt didn’t like using the fact that she was a Chosen One to lord over others, so they became friendly enough to chat casually.</p>
<p>“Honestly…they won’t stop pestering me even if I say they get in the way of cleaning.”</p>
<p>Milt couldn’t help but voice her complaints.</p>
<p>The sister took turns in cleaning the various areas of the church: the entrance was the place where the solicitors could gather more easily.</p>
<p>Many of them boasted about their hunts there because it was forbidden to bring them inside the church. There were guards at the gate, but if the men only boasted about themselves they couldn’t be forced to leave.</p>
<p>Many of them also made offerings or participated in the church’s community activities, hoping for Milt to notice them, so they couldn’t be treated harshly in public.</p>
<p>People cannot be saved only with pleasantries and ideals, after all.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit envious though, to be honest…I mean, looks like even famous people come to see you sometimes.”</p>
<p>The apprentice sister sitting in front of Milt was the roommate of the one sitting next to her.</p>
<p>One was gentle and meek, the other more straightforward and frank: their very different personalities created good chemistry, so they became friends quickly.</p>
<p>They were two of Milt’s few friends, who talked with her without being scared even after knowing her true strength.</p>
<p>“Do they really think that showing me monster corpses is going to win me over, I wonder?”</p>
<p>“Well, they’re adventurers, what else can they do? If they can take out monsters like that, I bet they’ve got plenty of this too.”</p>
<p>The girl then rubbed her thumb and index finger together. Some gestures were the same no matter the world, apparently.</p>
<p>“I don’t really see the appeal in that, honestly…”</p>
<p>“Whoa, listen to this girl…I’d like to be able to say something like that too…”</p>
<p>The girl’s shoulders dramatically dropped.</p>
<p>“Then what kind of men do you find appealing, Milt? You don’t really care about strength or money, right?”</p>
<p>“I want to know too! You never talk about things like that, Milt. So? So? Could it be that you already have someone you like?</p>
<p>Though they were sisters, they were still young girls. It was natural for them to be very interested in such matters of romance.</p>
<p>“Hmm, well, he has to be stronger than me, first of all.”</p>
<p>“That’s super hard already…”</p>
<p>“Quite…difficult, I guess.”</p>
<p>The two girls furrowed their brows.</p>
<p>They couldn’t think of any church knight or adventurer that matched Milt in strength, surely.</p>
<p>Her individual strength was impressive on its own, but her Legendary grade gear was normally considered a national treasure. To be able to surpass both was an amazing feat.</p>
<p>“You’re that strong and so pretty too…god blessed you too much, Milt.”</p>
<p>“Really now…?”</p>
<p>“You could pick any man you wanted, with that face and these bad girls here!”</p>
<p>The girl pouted and poked Milt’s chest, which was resting on the table.</p>
<p>The specially ordered robe hid her physique as much as possible, but it had its limits.</p>
<p>“So soft, yet firm and elastic enough to bounce back finger pokes…if only I had it too…”</p>
<p>“That would be…difficult, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Milt and the girl sitting next to her both looked away. The chest area of the girl poking Milt’s chest was very much flat.</p>
<p>“You’re horrible, you two!!”</p>
<p>“You have to accept reality. Besides, I get lewd looks all day, you know? A lot of people talk to me like my face was on my chest too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s disturbing, to be honest.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t quite on Milt’s levels, but the girl sitting next to her was well endowed too.</p>
<p>“Aah, I wish I could say the same thing…”</p>
<p>The girl sitting in front grumbled out of frustration and Milt smiled.</p>
<p>Her gestures and reaction were exaggerated because she wanted to lighten the topic, and Milt understood. The two girls with her were capable of such kindness.</p>
<p>“Someone I like, huh…”</p>
<p>Milt returned to the room assigned to her, lay on the bed, and mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>When she was asked if there was someone she liked, she did think of someone.</p>
<p>“Hmm, but this is different…”</p>
<p>Someone stronger than her. There wasn’t such a person around her at the moment, but there were several around the continent.</p>
<p>There were adventurers equipped with Mythology grade equipment, which surpassed her Legendary grade gear. The outcome wasn’t set in stone if they ever fought, but Milt was sure she wasn’t the strongest.</p>
<p>Milt knew, however, the man who was likely the strongest among them all.</p>
<p>“Shin.”</p>
<p>There was probably no one stronger than Shin in the whole continent.</p>
<p>His stats from the game era had been boosted. He also forged the highest grade equipment by himself.</p>
<p>Even without counting the power boost he received after coming to this world, Shin’s original stats were the fruit of the time and efforts he spent honing them.</p>
<p>Milt enjoyed the same benefits as him, so she couldn’t say things were unfair.</p>
<p>“That’s not the point though, is it.”</p>
<p>She was thinking about the fact that Shin’s face came up when she was asked if she had someone she liked.</p>
<p>It was just a casual conversation: there was no need to think deeply about it. Even so, she didn’t want to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Milt thought about why she thought of Shin.</p>
<p>Because he’s strong? Because she knows him well? Or maybe because she liked him like the girls wanted to know?</p>
<p>“No, no, no.”</p>
<p>Milt sat up on the bed and shook her head left and right. There wasn’t space for such romantic feelings in her relationship with Shin.</p>
<p>They lived under the same roof for a time, but it was only because their goals were the same.</p>
<p>“At that time, Shin never showed he was interested in any of that…”</p>
<p>Milt knew how Shin was before the death game.</p>
<p>Shin the player, as most THE NEW GATE users knew him, and the person Milt’s close friend told her about.</p>
<p>Milt felt Shin as someone relatively close, because of what she was told about him.</p>
<p>Then, in the world after the death game…</p>
<p>They fought together in order to clear the game, but he felt very distant. The burden of the players’ expectations on his shoulders made him look tired, exhausted.</p>
<p>When they met again and they started cooperating, he was no longer the Shin she knew.</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>Even if he was much different from before, some things were unchanged. Milt noticed by being at his side.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because Milt was a friend of his lover, or maybe because she was a woman: she didn’t know the exact reason, but she felt Shin was looking out for her at times.</p>
<p>Then, in the final moment…Milt remembered very well the expression on Shin’s face when he cut her down.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Shin remembers too.”</p>
<p>At that time, Shin looked like he was about to cry.</p>
<p>For Milt, Shin’s blade saved her, but he certainly did not see things the same way, as she knew well.</p>
<p>He might have seemed different but was the same person deep down. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t have had such an expression on his face.</p>
<p>When they met again in this world, Milt realized he had returned to the original Shin and felt a bit relieved.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it…”</p>
<p>Milt recalled what happened when they met again and found herself blushing. She was told later what state she was in at that time.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she was taking a bath. She only knew that Shin saw her naked. She attacked him like that, apparently, so she couldn’t tell him not to look.</p>
<p>“Why did I do something so embarrassing…?”</p>
<p>In the real world, she was taken care of by nurses. They were all female, however, so there was no shame in being seen naked.</p>
<p>The situation with Shin was very different, though. Her naked body had been seen by a man for the first time, outside of a hospital setting. Not even Milt could say she didn’t care.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s the reason.”</p>
<p>Shin wasn’t the person she liked, but this episode made her think of him. Milt then closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The next day, she was in the cafeteria, sighing again.</p>
<p>“Will they ever stop…”</p>
<p>The boasting battle had broken out that day too. This time a noble’s messenger even pestered her to sell them her equipment.</p>
<p>Milt’s gear was extremely precious: it wasn’t rare for such negotiators to visit her. She simply didn’t want to deal with them when she was feeling down.</p>
<p>“Will I ever find someone stronger than me, that doesn’t care about my equipment, and doesn’t give me lewd looks?”</p>
<p>“What is this girl going on about now?”</p>
<p>“She’s tired, let her be. Today they were even more annoying than usual, I suppose.”</p>
<p>The girls, sitting with her as usual, were conflicted too. Milt knew she was asking for a lot, but if she found someone like that her worries would disappear.</p>
<p>She could at least think about him, though. If he could understand her as a person it would have been even better. If he was fun to tease, even better.</p>
<p>The only person Milt knew that fit these criteria was Shin, after all.</p>
<p>Even Shin was caught glancing at her bust sometimes, but he was still much more forgivable than the rabble who talked with her with their eyes glued to her chest.</p>
<p>He was overwhelmingly stronger and had a load of equipment on the same level as Milt’s.</p>
<p>He was also the person that knew her the best in this world.</p>
<p>As he was now, Shin was also a lot of fun to tease. Milt recalled how he acted awkwardly when she just hugged his arm a little and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Definitely a great asset, he is.”</p>
<p>So she said, thinking that her motives were not the purest.</p>
<p>She was sure that what she felt wasn’t love, just something similar.</p>
<p>Maybe all the lovey-dovey episodes she heard from Marino, Shin’s former lover, got imprinted onto her somehow.</p>
<p>Milt never experienced talking so happily about someone, so she was a bit irritated, yet envious of Marino’s expressions and the feelings she conveyed.</p>
<p>Was this a form of love, or maybe something else?</p>
<p>Milt did not know yet. Even so, she was strangely positive that it wasn’t something bad.</p>
<p>“Aah, I’d like to see him again soon.”</p>
<p>She wanted to see him, to chat about the silliest things. To give him a good hug and see him feeling awkward. Milt felt her irritation leave her completely.</p>
<p>“Oh, you want to see him, hmm?”</p>
<p>“We must inquire about *him* further, yes?”</p>
<p>“Whoops, did I say that out loud?”</p>
<p>Milt renewed her resolve to keep doing her best, hoping to see him soon.</p>
<p>She then switched her focus to dodging the barrage of questions of the curious girls surrounding her.</p>
